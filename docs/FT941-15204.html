			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International press review RUSSIA Russia's press, which is at least half-free, thought the Russian-US summit less than overwhelming. It was respectful - even the opposition press was not as rude as it might be in the west - but it did not profess to having its socks knocked off. Even Izvestiya, the most loyal to President Boris Yeltsin, headlined its Saturday report on the two-day visit 'Yeltsin and Clinton basically happy - but there are problems'. Among them was the readiness, or not, of the Ukrainian parliament to ratify its government's promises. On past experience, said Izvestiya, 'we mustn't think that this matter is fully decided.' Nezavisimaya Gazeta (The Independent) was characteristically sharper. Tt said that there was 'nothing special' about the meeting and that 'the expression of support for the reform course which Boris Yeltsin was adopting sounded the same as the noises Boris Yeltsin was himself making about reforms'. The resignation yesterday of Mr Yegor Gaidar from a future cabinet put these 'noises' in some perspective. Sovyetskaya Rossiya, the nationalist-communist daily banned since the suppression of the last Russian parliament until last month, said sourly that 'the first European journey (of the US president) from Brussels through Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva was in the first place to support and strengthen his international standing and in the second to demonstrate once more his support for Boris Yeltsin. The Russian president needs such help permanently.' Moskovski Komsomolets, the irreverent Moscow evening daily, concentrated on Friday on the price of Bill Clinton's suite in the Slavyanskaya Hotel - Dollars 185 (Pounds 124) a night, it said - against that paid by Michael Jackson last October in the Metropole (Dollars 1,500 a night). It also noted that, to avoid disturbance to his few hours of sleep, 'the market around Kiev Station just outside of the hotel was temporarily closed'. Did the president know his visit had suppressed market activity? BELGIUM Allegations that bribes were promised or paid to Belgium's francophone Socialist party in 1988, to influence the award of an army helicopter contract, have whipped the Belgian press into a froth of indignation and self-righteousness. The trigger was the December request by Mrs Veronique Ancia, the investigating magistrate, that the parliamentary immunity of three ministers be lifted. But what really inflamed the debate was the leak 10 days ago of her detailed justification of why she wanted to question the trio. That allowed certain elements of the Flemish press to open up Belgium's old linguistic divide and rail against alleged corruption at the heart of the French-speaking political establishment in Wallonia. Le Soir, the francophone daily, tried to put the debate into perspective on Saturday - the day after a parliamentary committee voted for a partial lifting of the immunity of two of the ministers. Certain Flemish leader-writers had 'discredited the whole of the press' with their insinuations, said the paper. But it added that the three ministers, all of whom have denied any wrongdoing, should not have gone public with their own criticism of Mrs Ancia's report: 'By doing so, they have adopted the same attitude for which they have criticised the press.' The lifting of the ministers' immunity was inevitable according to most newspapers, Flemish and francophone. Flanders' Gazet van Antwerpen said the public would have considered any other decision tantamount to 'abandoning the political institutions to the mafia, making hypocrisy a noble virtue and everyday fraud the rule'. De Standaard, the heavyweight Flemish daily, stressed in Saturday's editorial - headlined 'To the very core' - that the investigation was only the start of what should be an in-depth examination of the financing of political parties and the award of military contracts. A separate parliamentary committee still has to decide whether to lift the immunity of the third minister concerned in the affair, but La Derniere Heure, a popular francophone paper, summed up the current situation with its banner headline on Saturday: 'Round one to Ancia'. IRELAND The lifting last Wednesday of Ireland's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has provoked a flurry of comment and analysis in the Irish newspapers. 'A very wrong decision,' says an editorial and 'A platform for murderers' shouts a headline in the Irish Independent, the flagship of a flotilla of newspapers controlled by the Irish millionaire Dr Tony O'Reilly. 'Dublin and London are now out of step on a very important matter,' the editorial says. In a more apocalyptic vein in its opinion columns, Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien (who as communications minister in 1976 introduced the Sinn Fein broadcasting ban) writes: 'There is a great opportunity here for the opposition. It is up to them to stop a rot that is beginning to affect the very foundations of our democratic state.' Nonetheless, the same newspaper in a poll published on Saturday acknowledges that 64 per cent of the population agree with the decision to lift the ban and that 57 per cent do not believe that 'they will be swayed in their views' by Sinn Fein interviews. Most papers favour ending the ban. The Sunday Business Post says the ban came about in the early 1970s 'in the face of British criticism and internal Fianna Fail feuding. . . the principle of free speech was sacrificed for internal Fianna Fail purposes'. Ireland's paper of record, the Irish Times, dedicated several pages to the issue and concluded that the ban 'served in equal measure to frustrate broadcasters, embarrass the government and provide Sinn Fein with a sense of grievance bordering on martyrdom. . . the time for plain speaking and the putting of strong and straight questions (to Sinn Fein) has arrived'. Capturing that idea, a cartoon in the same paper portrays a radio interviewer asking Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader: 'What has mass slaughter and economic mayhem and other aspects of IRA terrorism ever done to benefit the people of Ireland?' An awkward Mr Adams replies 'No comment'.</p>

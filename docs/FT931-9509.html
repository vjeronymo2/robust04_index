			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Private-sector pay at 3.6% PRIVATE-SECTOR pay settlements are continuing to average about 3.6 per cent, according to two reports published yesterday. In spite of the continuing downward pressure on pay in the private and public sectors, private-sector increases look high relative to inflation of 1.7 per cent and a public-sector norm of 1.5 per cent. Pay analysts said uncertainty about the direction of the inflation rate after leaving the European exchange rate mechanism might have contributed to the relatively buoyant private-sector pay rates of the final quarter of last year. Industrial Relations Services, which found average awards at 3.6 per cent in the final quarter of last year, said that eight out of 10 deals were above the inflation rate during that quarter. The union-funded Labour Research Department has also found average settlements settling at 3.6 per cent in the three months to the end of January. Some analysts, such as the Confederation of British Industry, have already reported much lower rates in the private sector - 2.8 per cent in manufacturing in the final quarter of last year and one in three companies making pay freezes, according to the latest CBI figures.</p>

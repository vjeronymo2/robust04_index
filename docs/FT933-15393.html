			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Caricom and Cuba in trade agreement In a diplomatic triumph for Cuba, its neighbours in the Caribbean Community (Caricom) have agreed to set up a joint commission with the island to oversee co-operation in areas such as trade and the sugar industry, writes Canute James in Nassau, the Bahamas. The agreement followed a call by the 13 Caricom nations for the lifting of the 30-year-old US trade and economic embargo against Cuba. The commission will seek to increase trade between Cuba and Caricom and foster co-operation on sugar cane yields and sugar by-products. It will also promote the development of livestock and fisheries and combine biotechnology research. The US has not welcomed the agreement. 'Caricom is made up of democratic countries and Cuba is not democratic,' said a senior US State Department official attending the conference.</p>

UN special envoy Ahmedou Ould  Abdallah said the Army must pull out within the day. "But they  are dragging their heels and the High Command is not exerting  strict discipline," he said. He noted that the Army, dominated  by the country's Tutsi minority, had a "terrible reputation"  among the majority Hutu population in northern parts of  Bujumbura where gun battles broke out at the weekend.    Abdallah estimated that at least 100 people were killed,  adding that the death toll might be higher "because lots of  people in this country do not weep and do not display their  dead." Diplomatic sources said there were "misunderstandings"  between the military and the government, "which are considerably  complicating the situation."    The UN special representative repeated his complaint of the  previous day that some Hutu politicians with vested interests  were claiming "vastly exaggerated" casualty figures. Interior  Minister Leonard Nyangoma told government radio in neighbouring  Rwanda earlier in the week that almost 1,000 people had been  killed. The latest official figure was given on Thursday by  Communications Minister Cyriaque Simbizi at about 400.    Abdallah also rapped false reports spread in the last few  days that the Army was mounting another coup and that government  ministers had fled the country. "It is dangerous for the Hutu,  who may well lose their credibility abroad," he said. Abdallah  said he was worried about the estimated thousands of residents  who fled their homes during the fighting into other parts of  town, thereby causing overcrowding which could lead to fresh  tensions.    Although there were no shooting overnight and things were  relatively calm in northern districts of the capital, people  were still seen quitting their homes for neighbouring Zaire,  other parts of the city or outlying banana groves.    Part of the Army mounted a short-lived coup last October,  killing Melchior Ndadaye, Burundi's first Hutu president. Since  then, tribal fighting has left tens of thousands dead and driven  700,000 into refuge in surrounding countries.</p>

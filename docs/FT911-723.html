			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Currency movements hit S&amp;N in opening quarter SMITH &amp; NEPHEW, the healthcare and medical products group, reported pre-tax profits down 8 per cent, from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 27.2m, for the first quarter of 1991. Adverse currency movements reduced the outcome by about Pounds 2.5m. But Mr Eric Kinder, chairman, issued a confident statement with the results. 'Overall our trading in the first quarter was on plan and sales showed continuing underlying growth,' he said. 'Despite weaknesses in many of the world's economies our core businesses continue to perform well.' Turnover for the three months was almost unchanged at Pounds 171.5m. Excluding the effect of exchange rates and the disposal of the Watson Marlow infusion pump business, underlying growth was 10 per cent. Sales and profits of medical products such as wound dressings and bandages 'continued their excellent growth in continental Europe and the US.' Sales to UK hospitals were still constrained by the shortage of cash in the National Health Service. Profits from manufacturing specialised gloves began to recover, following last year's decision to withdraw from the loss-making examination gloves business. The UK consumer business - including brands such as Nivea, Elastoplast, Lillets and Dr White's - suffered from the recession, with sales and profits lower than a year ago.</p>

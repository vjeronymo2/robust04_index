			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Scenes of carnage in UN 'safe area' UN military observers yesterday confirmed the utter devastation of Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in south-eastern Bosnia, after Serb forces finally allowed them to reach the region designated a 'safe area' by the international community. The team of eight monitors described a scene of 'considerable destruction' in Gorazde, which has been under a Serb siege for 13 months and the target of an intense three-week offensive. Artillery attacks ceased 10 minutes after the monitors crossed Serb lines on Wednesday night, ending what was described as the heaviest day of shelling. The monitors described as 'chaotic' conditions in the local hospital, where a ratio of one doctor to 10,000 people seems to make the humanitarian situation even more appalling. Some 2,000 people have been treated for injuries which may require amputation, according to a Bosnian radio report. Local officials told the monitors that 92 people had been killed in Wednesday's assault. About 100 critically wounded people require urgent medical evacuation. Despite several air drops of emergency relief, the 70,000 people trapped in Gorazde are suffering a chronic shortages of food and medical supplies. Gorazde's population has more than doubled as about 38,000 refugees have sought sanctuary from 'ethnic cleansing' in eastern Bosnia, where Moslems were once a majority. In Belgrade, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said said hundreds of thousands of refugees may never be able to return to their homes if the latest Geneva agreement is carried out. 'We are concerned that the plan will create units too small to be viable for the Moslems,' said Ms Judith Kumin, UNHCR spokeswoman.</p>

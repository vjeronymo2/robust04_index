			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Business and the Environment: Recycling still a burning issue - The arguments for and against incineration Europe should burn more of its waste paper rather than recycle it. This view is held by some parts of the pulp industry and those agencies charged with handling domestic waste. It is rejected outright by environmental campaigners. But with the waste-paper market flooded by improved collection systems throughout the EC, those who want to burn rather than recycle could soon win a more sympathetic hearing from politicians. Germany is committed to recycling 80 per cent of its domestic waste by 1995, the UK's target is 50 per cent by the end of the century and the proposed EC packaging directive stipulates a 60 per cent recycling rate. The German success at collecting paper, combined with its inability to absorb the recycled product, has led to waste paper being exported at below cost to neighbouring states. This has all but destroyed domestic waste-paper markets. Pressure is building on regulators to allow more waste paper to be burned to provide heat and electricity. The burning argument states that if properly managed, paper can be produced in a sustainable way. The trees are grown, harvested and replanted, which can be achieved with the minimum use of chemicals and disruption to the countryside. Paper can be made in plants that are self-sufficient in energy because waste materials - such as wood off-cuts - are used as fuel. If the emissions from pulp-making are controlled, then the entire process is sustainable. Neither does this activity contribute to the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, because the plantations act as carbon sinks by fixing the carbon dioxide. Recycling, on the other hand, is usually done near urban areas, the source of waste paper. Fossil fuels are mostly used for energy and this contributes to the increase in CO. While recycling reduces the amount of paper that ends up in landfill, the process also produces wastes such as inks, fillers and finishers. More important, large-scale recycling cuts demand for virgin pulp. While this might seem a positive result, a contraction of pulp markets in developed countries discourages moves in the developing world to produce pulp from sustainable forestry. This not only affects the economies of developing countries but discourages the growth of managed forests in areas that have been denuded by slash-and-burn agriculture. 'We are not against recycling. We say that recycling should be used in particular situations so that there is the right balance. Incineration should also be improved to reduce pollutants,' says Erling Lorentzen, chairman of Aracruz Celulose, which produces pulp from managed plantations in Brazil. 'Our forests are recycling carbon dioxide all the time. Planting trees is the best form of recycling,' he says. Lorentzen says that if Europe is genuinely in favour of sustainable development it should encourage markets for virgin pulp from properly managed sources. Environmental campaigners disagree. 'The argument is a non-starter because the idea of creating sustainable forests is a misnomer,' says Benedict Southworth, recycling officer at Friends of the Earth. Governments should instead encourage markets for recycled paper. It is also better, he says, to use paper fibres as often as possible, rather than burning them after a single use. Campaigners are also against the incineration of waste because it produces noxious emissions. But those in favour of burning say new technology and higher standards have solved the historical problems of incinerating municipal waste. A study on paper recycling by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis concludes that the incineration of waste paper might be a good economic and environmental alternative to recycling. However, this depends on the removal of some of the chemicals and heavy metals used in paper and printed packaging. Yvonne Iwaniuk, a representative of the Confederation of European Paper Industries, says waste paper remains an important resource to the industry, especially in countries with no domestic forestry.</p>

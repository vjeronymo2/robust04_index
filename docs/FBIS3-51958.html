			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta Artola has  confirmed that during the disturbances early 26 January on the  northern highway and in other areas of the capital, 206 people,  who will be placed under the disposal of common courts, were  arrested for disrupting public order and committing other crimes  as identified in the current Penal Code. He also said several  minors who were arrested as they attempted to remove  cobblestones from the streets were released later.    Mendieta Artola has explained that no disturbances will be  tolerated, adding that police authorities will act in accordance  with the law.    [Begin recording] [Mendieta] The National Police has  sustained some attacks. Later, a cleanup operation during the  predawn hours of 26 January, starting at 0500, resulted in 220  people being arrested; of these, we have released those who are  minors and we are still holding 206 individuals in prison,  individuals who have been placed under the disposal of  authorities; they are now being processed by authorities.    In this regard, the gentlemen of the National Transportation  Commission [CNT] have called for a meeting to discuss the  release of these people. We have met with CNT representatives  and they demanded the release of these people, but they did not  make any commitments that would permit us to guarantee the fact  that these people may indeed be waging a civic and peaceful  strike.    We noted the need for CNT representatives and the Government  Ministry to sign a commitment ensuring they would only conduct  peaceful actions. This was not possible, because they refused  to sign this document. Later, when we learned of the National  Assembly document, we discussed it with CNT representatives and  explained that the solution to the transportation problem lied,  as the National Assembly Manifesto stated, in the possibility of  meeting with all transportation sectors.    In this regard, we also noted the need for the CNT leaders  to  display a more serious attitude, because they have given false  statements to the media. The statements by CNT representatives  are aimed at promoting an atmosphere of violence at this time.    [Unidentified reporter] What is the juridical and legal  situation of the 200 people who were arrested? Are they all  members of the transportation sector?    [Mendieta] Yes. Those who were arrested have violated  constitutional articles, particularly Article 31, which  establishes the right of all Nicaraguans to transit freely  throughout the nation. They have also violated Article 325 of  the Penal Code, which says that those individuals who damage or  destroy communication roadways and who may endanger the security  of transportation vehicles commit an offense. They have also  violated Article 346 of the Penal Code, which establishes that  those who attack authorities are subject to imprisonment ranging  from one to three years. [end recording]</p>

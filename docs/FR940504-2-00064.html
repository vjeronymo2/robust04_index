This will allow the agency to examine the potential impact of future imports on the survival of the giant panda. The Service will consider whether, and if so, how such imports into the United States might contribute to giant panda conservation. Any draft policy or guidelines developed as a result of this review will be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  for public review and comment. A public working meeting or meetings will be used to assist the Service in formulating the draft policy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Public comments on this notice will be accepted until June 30, 1994.

Section 2(b) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) states that the purposes of the Act ``...are to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved, to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species, and to take such steps as may be appropriate to achieve the purposes of the treaties and conventions set forth in subsection (a) of this section.'' CITES is one of the Conventions cited in subsection (a) of this statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is responsible for deciding whether to issue import and export permits required by the Act and CITES for giant panda loans. Therefore, the Service must determine whether the purposes for such imports influence the continued existence of giant pandas in the wild. The Service believes that existing regulations and policy, including its March 14, 1991 ``Policy on Giant Panda Import Permits'' (56 FR 10809) have been sufficient for individual panda import permit decisions made to date. However, there is the possibility that an increasing number of import permits for numerous pandas will be sought for captive breeding purposes in the United States in the near future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before any import permit will be granted, it must be reviewed in terms of the application requirements of CITES and the Act by the Service's Offices of Management and Scientific Authorities. Issuance of an import permit under CITES requires prior findings that: (1) the proposed import would not be for purposes detrimental to the survival of the species; (2) the import would not be for primarily commercial purposes; and (3) the permit applicant is suitably equipped to house and care for the animal(s). Issuance of a permit under the Act requires prior determinations that, among other things: (1) the import would be for scientific purposes or to enhance the propagation or survival of the species in a manner consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act; and (2) issuance of the import permit would not be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. These requirements are further implemented by application requirements and issuance criteria found in 50 CFR 13.12, 17.22, 23.14, and 23.15. With regard to making the first finding listed above under both CITES and the Endangered Species Act, the issue is whether the detrimental effects that might result from a loan would be sufficiently offset by specific enhancement features to allow a determination that the import would be for purposes that are not detrimental and that would, in fact, enhance the survival of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Service was processing a previous application to import a pair of giant pandas for a temporary exhibition loan, the CITES Secretariat requested that the Service reevaluate its ``Policy on Giant Panda Import Permits'' for temporary exhibition loans. Therefore, the Service published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 29, 1992 (57 FR 28825), requesting public comments on this policy. Before this evaluation was completed, the Service received additional applications for the import of giant pandas for purposes other than for temporary exhibition loans, and determined the need for additional review and comment, resulting in this notice. To date, comments received have not been incorporated into any revision of its existing policy, since such comments only were solicited on temporary exhibition loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 19, 1993, the Service received an application from the Zoological Society of San Diego to import a pair of giant pandas for a captive-breeding loan. Shortly afterwards, on April 20, 1993, the American Zoo and Aquarium Association (AZA) announced the development of a Giant Panda Conservation Action Plan, which currently includes approximately 29 zoological institutions that have agreed to participate in a giant panda captive-breeding program in North America.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

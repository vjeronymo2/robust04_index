			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Metallgesellschaft to outline its survival plan The new management at Metall- gesellschaft, the financially stricken metals and engineering conglomerate, is to outline its survival plans this afternoon to its creditor banks. Bankers said yesterday they expected to be asked to delay calling in loans and to allow a 90-day breathing space in which plans could be refined and put into operation. The 40 to 50 banks also expected to be told the extent of the losses incurred by the German group's US subsidiary, MG Corp, on the New York oil futures market. The losses, independently estimated at around DM1bn (Pounds 300m) last month, precipitated the crisis and the sacking or demotion of several senior executives, including the chairman, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch. Bankers called to today's meeting, which was originally planned for next week, said they were asked only yesterday morning to confirm the balances on their Metallgesellschaft accounts. 'They should have done that a week ago,' one said yesterday. Despite earlier suggestions that some creditors were considering declaring the group in default, optimism had grown that there was 'the prospect of a viable rump' emerging from the crisis. Lenders were keen to hear which of the group's 260 subsidiaries were to be sold off, as well as the scale and handling of an expected rights issue to 'shore up its depleted net worth', the banker added. Peripheral creditors were concerned that a moratorium should be agreed, to avoid the possibility that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, both shareholders and main lenders, might gain security over prime assets, leaving them 'out in the cold'. Both banks were quick to step in and extend credit lines when news of the New York oil futures losses emerged. A week later, the Metallgesellschaft supervisory board, chaired by Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, a Deutsche Bank director, shook out the management claiming the supervisory board had not been kept informed. Mr Schimmelbusch was replaced by Mr Kajo Neukirchen, a restructuring expert well-known to Deutsche. Metallgesellschaft has estimated net short-term obligations of DM8bn, described by a spokesman as 'not unusual' for a company deriving half its annual DM27bn turnover from trading.</p>

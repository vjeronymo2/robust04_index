			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Japan When Japan's biggest broker says Japanese stocks are cheap, as Nomura did this week, it is time to sit up and take notice. A good part of Nomura's argument is that everyone, whether in Japan or outside it, thinks the market can only go down. Given the depth of universal gloom and the fact that the market has fallen 60 per cent from its peak, it might indeed be asked what kind of disaster is not in the price already. One obvious and familiar answer is the collapse of the Japanese financial system as a result of the downward spiral in asset values. But there are paradoxes here. There are various steps which the Japanese authorities could take to help, from cutting the discount rate and pushing through a large supplementary budget to reducing property taxes. There seems general agreement in Tokyo that the return of asset inflation is simply not a threat. The absence of action by the authorities thus seems to suggest they do not take the possibility of financial collapse seriously. It might therefore be asked whether the market would find action reassuring or alarming. Perhaps another way to approach the issue is to ask what scope there is for a bounce in corporate earnings when recovery finally does arrive. The market is, after all, a discounting mechanism. There is thus every reason to suppose that it will turn before the earnings cycle hits bottom. The chief difficulty here is that recovery in Japan, as elsewhere, is expected to be fairly anaemic. In that case it may be asked whether Japanese corporations, with their limited scope for cost-cutting and lay-offs, can expect much of an earnings bounce at all. Nomura could be right in arguing that 16,000 is a floor. The question is rather how long the market will stay there.</p>

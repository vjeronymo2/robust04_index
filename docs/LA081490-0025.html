			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> AN UNDERGROUND ROCK WAKE FOR THE ZELIG OF HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Until his death from a drug overdose earlier this summer, bassist Rob Graves  (ne Ritter) was the Zelig of Hollywood, popping up in band after band, scene  after scene. His wake at the Roxy on Sunday was kind of a historical survey of  L.A. underground rock. It was a strange bill, a lot of disparate music united  by what wasn't there. The new band of Kid Congo Powers -- who played  wall-of-sound guitar to Graves' bass in the first and best version of the  seminal swamp-blues post-punk band Gun Club -- opened with a short, beautiful  set of distorted, one-chord dirge music. The Nymphs, alternative heavy-rock  fronted by Inger Nymph, who's smart money to become '91's Axl Rose, played a  tight set, imbuing even the corniest goth-rock cliches with dignity.  </P> <P> A reunited Thelonious Monster was great, a newly cleaned-up Bob Forrest  eulogizing his late friend and slamming through the Monster's nuclear-powered  takes on the genre of American radio pop. The Gun Club's Jeffrey Lee Pierce  sang a couple of songs with Powers and the Monster rhythm section; the Red Hot  Chili Peppers (which never had Graves as a member) played a couple of songs  too.  </P> <P> Then came 45 Grave, the band most identified with Graves, rough and mournful in  its mock devil metal. Craig Lee and Alice Bag, from the Bags, Graves' punk  band, did four quick songs. Lee's cheesy guitar sound and Bag's quavering  vocals still define early L.A. punk, and the audience slammed in glee.  </P> <P> 45 Grave finished the evening with a creepy version of "I'm Waiting for the  Man," the Velvet Underground's hymn to heroin, with singer Dinah Cancer droning  the words "when the music's over" again and again as Paul Cutler drew fantastic  windstorm noises from his guitar.  </P> <P> When the song finished, he pulled out a huge knife and executed his wailing  instrument.

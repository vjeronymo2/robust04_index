			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Heading towards a hung family With five days to go before polling day, Paul Cheeseright returns to the Martins, the FT's family of floating voters, to gauge the effect of the party campaigns. OLD wounds re-opened in the Martin household this week. The knife to the scar was the Duke of Westminster's poll tax bill of Pounds 68. As that is little more than a third of the bill facing Russell, 18, on Pounds 4,500 a year and 80p a month over the limit for a rebate, the family was angry and highly critical of the government and the poll tax. 'It really got me,' said Lyn, Russell's mother. 'It's got my back up over the Conservative government,' said first-time voter Russell. 'Bills. We're getting ours through now. The Conservatives should have scrapped it straight away,' complained Tony, father of the family. 'It's the one big mistake of the Tories and they'll never live it down,' Lyn came back. 'They've spent billions trying to get it right, but it's the government's job to get it right first time,' said Russell. 'It's the number one influence.' 'But it's over now,' Lyn reminded him. And so it is. The poll tax does not figure much in the party political debate, but the bills plopping through letter boxes are a reminder of one of Mrs Thatcher's less adroit moves, part of the record which will be judged by floating voters such as the Martins. For them, it has not been a very satisfactory week as the debate has twisted from issue to issue. The tax issue came up again, of course. The Martins rather like Mr Ashdown's honesty in his commitment to put an extra penny on income tax to pay for education. 'The only thing that has come over to us,' Tony said of the Tory campaign, 'is that they're trying to put income tax down to 20p, but they haven't said when.' 'The way the people will vote depends on how much they've got in their pay packets at the end of the week,' Russell said dismissively. Still, the Martins accept that the economy is the central issue. They remain uncertain about the political approach to it. 'We know we're in a recession. No party is going to come in, wave a magic wand and all the figures will change,' Tony said. Lyn didn't think Labour plans for a minimum wage would help employment. 'That's not going to create jobs,' she argued. 'It's going to put people out of jobs,' asserted Tony, adding, that on general economic policy, 'nobody has come through.' 'You can't say anybody's got it sorted,' said Lyn. But as the Liberal Democrats have become the butt of Labour and Conservative attacks, sympathy, even enthusiasm, for Mr Ashdown came through. Tony began to hoist his colours: 'Of the the three leaders, Paddy Ashdown would make the best prime minister if his party was stronger.' 'He's come over honest. He's the common man's choice,' Russell agreed. 'My heart is telling me to vote Liberal Democrat. My head is telling me to vote Conservative.'</p>

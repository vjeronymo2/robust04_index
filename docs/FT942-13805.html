			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Diminished hopes for an early interest rate cut contrasted sharply with more optimistic feelings in the market over the corporate outlook and led to volatile trading in the futures market, writes Christopher Price. An expected weak opening failed to materialise, and the June FT-SE 100 contract moved up to 3,112 and began a period of tight trading prior to the retail sales figures coming out. Forecasts of a 0.3 per cent rise proved wide of the mark and at the unveiling of the chunky 0.8 per cent uplift June went into swift reverse as the market's hopes of a rate cut were seen to have been dealt a severe blow. The heavy sell-off pushed June down to 3,083 at one stage, trading at a 7-point discount to the cash market. However, buyers moved back into the market and June clawed its way back, helped by a bright start on Wall Street and digestion of some impressive corporate results, particularly from SmithKline Beecham. One dealer reported sentiment among institutional buyers at its most positive for several weeks. June closed at 3,115, its high of the day, with turnover reaching 13,282 contracts. Traded options volume reached 52,739, with FT-SE turnover at 13,722. Lasmo, inspired by recent takeover talk, topped the stock options at 5,338 contracts.</p>

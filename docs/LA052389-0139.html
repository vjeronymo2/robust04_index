			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION SOFTBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> SHORTSTOP IS DEDICATED, BUT IT'S NOT TO FASHION  </P> <P> Saddleback High School shortstop Nikkanni Andrews stands out in a crowd.  </P> <P> It is not just her athletic skills, which make her one of the fastest and most  fluid players on almost any softball diamond. It is her dare-to-be different  attitude. Her Bohemian approach to her wardrobe.  </P> <P> "She likes to dress a lot differently than anybody else in school," Saddleback  Coach Yvonne Alonzo said. "She will come to practice with some really crazy  clothes on. She will wear purples and greens and it just all mixes in and  everybody knows its Nikkanni, and it looks good so she gets away with it.  </P> <P> "She has got the tall, thin body type where any type of clothing she puts on  will look good. Nobody likes to tease her because they know where Nikkanni  stands."  </P> <P> Andrews stands for individuality. She achieves it through her cutting-edge  fashion off the softball diamond. On it, she achieves it with performance.  </P> <P> Andrews, a junior, ended the regular season as the county leader in home runs  (seven), runs scored (24) and was third in RBIs (21). And she has committed  only three errors at shortstop.  </P> <P> Andrews, the Sea View League's co-most valuable player, has stolen 19 bases in  20 attempts and helped Saddleback to a second-place finish.  </P> <P> Today, she will be wearing the standard Saddleback uniform when the Roadrunners  play third-seeded Irvine at home in the second round of the Southern Section  3-A playoffs. Even without her flamboyant wardrobe, she stands to be a player  of impact for Saddleback.  </P> <P> "Nikkanni is so valuable because she can come through for you with a big hit,"  Alonzo said. "If she gets on base on a walk, she can make a big play happen  because she can steal and possibly cause an overthrow. If she is on base, she  is going to probably get into scoring postion and somebody else can drive her  in."  </P> <P> Andrews is quick, but it is neither her speed nor her hitting that Alonzo  values most.  </P> <P> "Probably her attitude is the most valuable thing to the team," she said. "She  is a real well-rounded kid as far as attitude goes. She keeps up her pep with  everybody else on the team, and no matter how well she is doing, she is pretty  level-headed about everything."  </P> <P> Said Andrews: "I like to be different -- a lot different. I don't really have a  style. I just wear whatever I want to. . . . A lot of people say I dress weird,  but I just dress how I want to."  </P> <P> But her fashion does not clash with her purpose.  </P> <P> "A lot of people just play softball because it is a sport, it is something they  want to do because they think it is fun. I take it more seriously than that.  I'm not saying that I am great or anything, but I do know what I am doing."  </P> <P> In other 3-A games today:  </P> <P> El Toro (18-12), the South Coast League's third-place representative, plays  host to Montclair (22-4); Mission Viejo (15-8) is at home against top-seeded La  Mirada (26-1); San Clemente (18-12) travels to West Torrance (18-6).  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Brussels to offer Pounds 195m in steel aid THE European Commission is preparing to offer more than Ecu240m (Pounds 195m) of aid to help the ailing European steel industry through painful restructuring. Senior Commission officials were meeting last night to consider Brussels' response to last month's plea for help from Community steelmakers, which have been hit by overcapacity, recession and cheap non-EC imports. The Commission's industrial directorate is recommending Ecu240m of assistance between 1993 and 1995 to help cover the cost of laying off or retraining as many as 50,000 workers. The proposals fall short of what the steel industry has been demanding. Steel-makers believe a redundancy programme over the next three or four years could cost at least Ecu2bn, while the related cost of closures could double that figure. They are prepared to contribute to that cost, but expect the Commission to provide political, commercial and financial support. Commission officials said yesterday that Brussels was reluctant to get involved in centralised regulation of the steel market, as implied in the industry's request. Nor does it want to decide where radical capacity cuts should be made. Instead, the Commission may employ a consultancy to advise the companies on the best way to proceed with the proposed restructuring. Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, wants the 16 EC commissioners to approve an aid package at their meeting on the same day, for presentation to EC industry ministers on November 24. Commissioners will have to decide the sensitive question of where to find funding for the aid plan. In particular, they will discuss whether the EC should draw on reserves in the European coal and steel treaty - Ecu750m built up from levies on the two industries - to fund closures. The industrial directorate is recommending that support for redundancies should come from the existing budget of the treaty, but the separate reserves are considered by some Commission departments to be sacrosanct because they underpin a series of coal- and steel-related loans.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Serb jets bombard 'safe area' of Bihac Serb aircraft yesterday bombarded Bihac, the UN-designated safe area in northwestern Bosnia, ignoring warnings of Nato retaliation, a UN spokesman said. The air attack came as Serb troops, backed by forces loyal to Mr Fikret Abdic, the renegade Moslem leader, tightened a noose round the Bosnian government Fifth Corps in Bihac. Nato, which is policing a UN no-fly zone over Bosnia, could not confirm the attack. Bosnia's mountainous terrain makes it difficult for radar to detect air attacks. The UN has threatened to call in Nato air power if Bihac was attacked. Its Security Council was due to meet last night to discuss the attack. In Sarajevo, meanwhile, the Bosnian Federation assembly building was hit by a guided missile yesterday as the UN commander in Bosnia was snubbed by the Serbs in attempts to have them discuss the city's security crisis. As the military situation in and around Sarajevo deteriorated further and threw into doubt the future of an uneasy truce that has prevailed since February, the UN said Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic had refused demands for a meeting. The jets that attacked Bihac are believed to have taken off from nearby Udbine, Croatia, claimed by Serbs as part of their 'state' of Krajina. Krajina Serbs have joined Mr Abdic's forces in the counter-offensive launched by Bosnian Serb forces. The increased involvement of Krajina forces casts a long shadow over international efforts to restore relations between Zagreb and Knin, the Serb stronghold in Croatia. It plays into the hands of those Krajina leaders who are close to their Bosnian Serb counterparts. They hope to scupper any deal that President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia reaches with Croatia. Despite intense pressure from Mr Milosevic, Krajina leaders yesterday rejected a proposed agreement on forging economic links with Zagreb on the grounds that it was tied to the question of Krajina's political status. It dashes hopes that the Krajina assembly will today approve the agreement to restore water, power and fuel links between the breakaway Serb state and Croatia. International mediators have been pushing for an agreement, hoping to isolate the Bosnian Serb leaders who rejected a peace plan. As the fighting continues - and despite a blockade from Mr Milosevic - the Bosnian Serbs appear even less inclined to endorse the plan that would divide Bosnia between them and the Moslem-Croat alliance.</p>

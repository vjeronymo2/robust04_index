			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Life group allows for pensions hit Lloyds Abbey Life, the life assurance group, yesterday said it was setting aside money for possible compensation payments to people who bought their personal pensions when transferring out of occupational schemes. Announcing the 1993 results, Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, said it had made 'sensible and prudent' provisions. The life and pensions industry is awaiting a report from the Securities and Investments Board, the City watchdog, on how to compensate pension transfer customers who have suffered as a result of poor advice. Provisions rose, but the group would not give a figure for the amount set aside for pension transfers, saying merely that the net effect on the profit and loss account of reviewing its provisions was 'insignificant'. Black Horse Financial Services, a 'bancassurance' company which sells products only to customers of Lloyds Bank, had 22,600 pension transfers, while Abbey Life, the group's other UK life assurance division which sells mostly through a direct sales force, had 30,300 pension transfers. Together, this gives the group Pounds 433m, or about 10 per cent of the estimated 500,000 pension transfers sold since 1988. The group's pre-tax profits rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 323.6m. The greatest growth came from the non-insurance businesses. A final dividend of 11.7p gives a total of 18p, up from 17.3p - the first increase for four years. Earnings per share rose from 28p to 31.1p. Within pre-tax profits, Abbey Life fell to Pounds 135.3m (from Pounds 146.4m), while Black Horse Financial Services rose to Pounds 115.6m (from 110.5m). Mr Stephen Maran, chief executive, highlighted the impact of regulation and low interest rates. Meeting requirements on training and competence had contributed to a further fall in the Abbey Life sales force to 2,500 as well as reducing selling time. Low interest rates meant that greater amounts had to be reserved out of profits to meet future commitments to policyholders, he said. Both regular and single premium sales rose in Black Horse Financial Services, while Abbey Life suffered a small dip in regular premium business. For the second year running, Trans Leben, the group's German life subsidiary, had a bad result, recording a loss of Pounds 15.9m, after a loss of Pounds 14.1m in 1992. Sir Simon said the group's aim was to 'keep it small, steady and not a management headache'. Pre-tax profits at Lloyds Bowmaker, the finance company, rose to Pounds 38.2m from Pounds 16.2m, helped by a sharp fall in charges for bad debts to Pounds 35.3m. Black Horse Agencies, the estate agency, increased its sales last year and again saw its losses fall, from Pounds 10.6m in 1992 to Pounds 700,000 in 1993. Lex, Page 22</p>

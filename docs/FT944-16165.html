			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Abbeycrest reduces loss to Pounds 296,000 Abbeycrest, the jewellery manufacturer, reduced pre-tax losses from Pounds 345,000 to Pounds 296,000 in the first half of this year and was in the black at the operating level. Turnover grew to Pounds 19.2m (Pounds 16.5m), with all sectors of the group's business increasing sales, and operating profits emerged at Pounds 18,000 (losses Pounds 135,000). Abbeycrest's results are heavily biased towards the second half. Losses per share were 0.9p (1p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 1.2p. Mr Michael Lever, chairman, said he was pleased that last year's progress had continued, though he added that, as had been the case in previous years, 'it is the next 10 weeks that are crucial to the final result'. He said that Abbeycrest had lifted its market share in a 'relatively flat, highly competitive market'. Margins were maintained, he added, through product strength and marketing initiatives. The pre-tax deficit occurred after increased net interest charges of Pounds 314,000 (Pounds 210,000). This rise was as a result of the planned stock build to improve service in the key pre-Christmas months. There were also higher infrastructure and management costs, incurred in the drive to lift operational capability. Mr Lever said he was convinced that the way to grow was through product innovation to offset the reduction in demand for jewellery, a result of the current pressure on consumers' disposable income. He added that he wanted to further increase the company's market share and seek new export possibilities.</p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (11): Cries of desperation - Hardware makers have never had it so bad EUROPE'S top computer executives must be wondering if they made the right career choice these days. There are seemingly precious few rewards for staying in the hardware business. The European computer market has always been tough. Now a combination of the recession, increased competition from the US and Asia and a resistance to buying more computer equipment among their customers has stacked the deck resolutely against European-owned players. A note of desperation is creeping in. In a grim note to his staff, Mr Carlo de Benedetti, chairman and chief executive of the Italian Olivetti group, outlines a new management structure, adding: 'I am firmly convinced that this new organisation is the most appropriate for the difficult months ahead, during which the survival of the company will be at stake.' Some top computer executives have already decided to seek their rewards elsewhere. Mr Arno Bohn, former marketing director of Nixdorf, the ailing minicomputer manufacturer taken over by Siemens two years ago, left to become chief executive of Porsche, the luxury car manufacturer. Mr Vittorio Levi, a former Olivetti executive who became managing director of Nokia Data, the personal computer manufacturer, left to take up a senior post with the Italian fashion house Georgio Armani when the Finnish unit was acquired by ICL of the UK. The European landscape is considerably less populated than a few years ago. Fujitsu of Japan acquired ICL which in turn acquired Nokia Data. Keinzle, a minicomputer maker at one time owned by Mannesmann of Germany, was sold to Digital Equipment (DEC) of the US. Last year DEC also acquired the minicomputer interests of Philips of the Netherlands. Norsk Data remains independent but is still losing money despite a dramatic shift in product emphasis. The world IT market is dominated by US suppliers although Japanese mainframe suppliers are making an impressive showing. But of the top 10 manufacturers, only three are European, 1990 statistics demonstrate. Siemens-Nixdorf of Germany is in eighth place with a turnover of Dollars 7.7bn, Olivetti is ninth with Dollars 6.4bn and Groupe Bull of France 10th with Dollars 6.3bn. All three are currently losing money. Siemens' computer operations had been making a modest profit, but the merger with the hugely loss-making Nixdorf left it a legacy of unprofitability which it will take time to shake off. To put Europe's troubles in perspective, the computer industry is in trouble world wide. IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, lost money last year after taking substantial restructuring charges. Profitability has been much reduced at the leading Japanese suppliers, Fujitsu, NEC and Hitachi. Nevertheless, Europe's makers are becoming 'marginalised' according to the French consultancy Idate which points out that in 1990 European-owned groups accounted for only 13.9 per cent of the Dollars 278.5bn world IT market, while consuming more than 35 per cent of the total. By comparison, in 1990 Japan accounted for almost a quarter of global production. There are a number of reasons for Europe's relative weakness in computing. Despite the advent of the single market, Europe remains a series of small markets each with its own computer champion. Insular attitudes have meant that although these companies collaborate in precompetitive research and in transnational programmes such as the EC's Esprit, it has proved impossible to persuade them to work together on a grand scale for the common good. These days, in any case, the wisdom of such an approach is open to question. Small, agile units able to respond quickly and flexibly to customer needs would seem to have the advantage over centralised and monolithic bureaucracies. IBM, for example, is trying to recreate itself in the form of a series of smaller, specialised units each with profit and loss responsibility. Merger has become, in any event, an academic question for Europe's surviving manufacturers. There is little talk any more of full blooded takeovers; the aim is rather to form alliances with stronger partners able to help defray research and development expenses and giving economies of scale in production. The European Commission, while anxious to help indigenous producers, has turned its face against subsidies or other means of providing aid which might be seen as anti-competitive. It is still considering whether French government plans to pump millions of francs into Groupe Bull are acceptable. It is, however, prepared to provide the impetus for what has become known as the European Nervous System, a transnational computer network designed to help to co-ordinate aspects of social policy throughout the community. The options open to Europe's manufacturers are narrow and getting still narrower. They are all heavily overstaffed and must lose people on a large scale. In the case of Olivetti, it required six weeks of negotiations to persuade the Italian government and trade unions to agree to a cut of 1,500, far short of the 2,200 the company was hoping for. They must also look for niche markets which play to their strengths. Now only IBM can hope to cover every area of the hardware business. Groupe Bull, after a protracted discussion period, has signed a broad ranging alliance with IBM giving it access to the US giant's expertise in reduced instruction set computing (risc) as well as a market for portable computers from its Zenith Data Systems subsidiary. IBM, in return, benefits from Bull's expertise in multiprocessing and networking. The deal gives Bull substantially more credibility in the marketplace. Mr Francis Lorentz, Bull chairman, is looking more relaxed than for many months. Siemens and Nixdorf have yet to settle into a comfortable working relationship. Broad cultural differences between the two companies are said to be causing difficulties and delaying the synergies expected of the merger. This is common in the computer business, where troubled mergers are more common than successful ones. It took ICL years to paper over the joins between English Electric, Ferranti Computers and other companies which went into the making of the former British computer champion. If there is a future for a European owned computer industry, it lies in services rather than hardware. Siemens Nixdorf already derives 37 per cent of its revenues from services, Olivetti 27 per cent and Bull 36 per cent.</p>

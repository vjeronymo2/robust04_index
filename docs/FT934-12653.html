			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Jordan warning ignored, Iraq arms inquiry told INTELLIGENCE warnings that Jordan was being used as a diversionary route for defence exports to Iraq were ignored by Foreign Office officials because the information was not 'irrefutable', the Scott arms-for-Iraq inquiry heard yesterday. Mr Charles Haswell, a Foreign Office official formerly responsible for Britain's bilateral relations with Israel and Jordan, was justifying a decision to exclude Jordan from countries suspected of breaking the UN embargo on Iraq published in December 1991. He told the inquiry: 'It was important not to mislead the minister (Mr Douglas Hogg), particularly on something that he had taken great interest in. To risk damaging our relationship with Jordan on the basis of little or no evidence was wrong.' Mr Haswell was questioned about a series of intelligence reports giving examples of the country being used as a route for defence related and/or dual-use chemical products for Iraq. He said he had responded to ministerial concerns about the potential diversion by calling a meeting of intelligence staff in November 1991 to make a judgment on the evidence. But he had concluded that at most Jordan had been involved in isolated cases of 'technical breaches' of the UN embargo which did not justify the adoption of a more restrictive policy towards the country. The evidence supplied by intelligence agencies included the diversion of parts for Iraq's supergun project, and of chemical products such as ammonium nitrate which had a potential military application. In an exchange with Lord Justice Scott, Mr Haswell was asked whether there was not an inconsistency between the view of intelligence officers and that adopted by some officials. He replied: 'You may think my view bonkers, but I don't think I was.' Mr Haswell was recently appointed to the UK delegation to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Vienna. The hearing continues today.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Yi Chong-Hwan] </F>   [Excerpts]"If you run, you get hurt." A self-preservation  attitude is eating away at the civil service community. An  aversion to work is becoming conspicuous among those in civil  service. At one time able to make even the impossible possible,  an increasing number of them observe, "Lately, even the possible  is impossible." This is because they are scared. Even while  dealing with such burdenless work as the issuance of resident  registration cards in a comparatively friendly way, they  hesitate to handle work for which they will be held responsible,  such as authorizing licenses. It has gone so far that there are  even people requesting service who offer to pay workers to  handle their problems. [passage omitted]    It has been nine months since the civilian government's  reforms began. With each sector of society changing at its own  speed and intensity, the 870,000-strong civil service community  too seems to have changed in various ways. Overall, it is busier  and its treatment of even strangers has become comparatively  friendly. Government workers even answer the phone differently  than they did in the past. Compared to rural areas, Seoul and  other urban areas in particular have changed a great deal.    One government official compressed the most characteristic  of  recent changes into six categories: three that have increased  and three that have decreased. The so-called "Three Increases,  Three Decreases". Audits, anonymous messages and group civil  petitions have increased; the convictions of government workers,  their supplementary income and desire to work have decreased.    The number of audits in particular have increased  conspicuously. Several audits frequently happen at once, so much  so that it is said they happen at the drop of a hat. [passage  omitted]    Anonymous messages have also increased markedly. This is so  much the case that this saying is circulating: "[The government]  failed at economic revitalization, but succeeded at  anonymous-message revitalization." Anonymous messages and  written petitions from all over are pouring into the Blue House,  Integrated Government Building, Public Service Center, Board of  Audit and Inspection [BAI] and the Public Prosecutor's Office.  "Stabbing-the-persimmon-you-can't-eat" style of groundless,  anonymous messages intended to secretly hurt someone are also  contributing to this flood. Not too long ago, a saying was  circulating in one government office in which a bureau chief was  sacked because of such anonymous messages: "Anonymous messages  are more frightening than the anti-corruption campaign."  [passage omitted]    Supplementary income has also decreased. The number of  regularly visiting petitioners has markedly dropped. Contact  with people who used to occasionally call officials out for food  and drink has also become rare. The giving and taking of money  envelopes, considered natural in the past, is now something to  be done cautiously. Restaurants in the vicinity of government  offices are starting to feel the pinch of economic hard times.  [passage omitted]    The lack of enthusiasm is the same, regardless of rank or  duties. Although there may be differences in degree between  those in and out of government offices, and between central and  regional offices, their problems are similar. The "season of  ambition" during which workers were anxious to quickly do  people's civil-petition paperwork for them appears to have  passed. Now a new habit is forming in them, a habit of checking  the regulations carefully one more time to make sure they do not  get in trouble.    Lying low. Is this a byproduct of the reforms or resistance  to it?    "Outwardly making justifications, inwardly asking, what am I  getting out of it, bureaucrats put class and personal interests  first. They consider the nation their possession. Their  existence is of a different order, their consciousness full of  controlling and interfering. In particular, as a result of their  distorted political experience, they think taking bribes fair  and proper and hate the prevention of this most of all."    These are the observations of one Seoul National University  professor. He says bureaucrats by their very nature dislike  reform. Although not organized, they show a passive resistance  by not doing what they are told or by doing it slowly, he  explains. This is a problem at both upper and lower levels, he  says.    "Among office directors, many only answer the phone. They  have those below them do all the work and do none themselves.  This is in contrast with the bureaucrats of advanced nations,  who sit in front of their computers, working diligently of their  own accord. Because of such directors, administration becomes  careless. What of those in the lower ranks? Their greatest  objective is to get in a good position and make a profit for  themselves. It does no good to tell bureaucrats to reform: all  they will do is pretend." [passage omitted]    One Democratic Party lawmaker was even more critical: "Our  country's bureaucratic system is a combination of surviving  feudalistic thought, which puts the government above the people,  and colonial bureaucracy. To this, add the barracks-style  authoritarianism picked up during years of military  dictatorship. Accustomed to this climate, most bureaucrats  perceive reform to be a loss of their rights, as something  inconvenient to themselves. Even while accepting--they have no  other choice--the trend toward democratization and  decentralization, they criticize it as inefficient every chance  they get. Unless the scalpel of a large-scale operation is taken  to the bureaucracy, we cannot hope for reform and  democratization."    Not a few government workers strongly deny this, however.  [passage omitted]    Insisted a secretary of the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and  Energy [MOTIE] "Far from resisting it, the reform is what we  want to pull forward." One assistant grade two official working  in the Capitol Building said the following:    "Reform is the current of the times. Even if it weren't  President Kim, there would have been reform. It may have speeded  up a little because of him. Although there may be some  government workers resisting it, they are few. I think most are  not that way. It is only that they can't move quickly because of  the nature of the bureaucracy. This actually guarantees the  government's stability." [passage omitted]    Under the name of beautifying the environment, district  office workers have to go around taking down advertisements off  the streets. He says they even wash billboards and signs. Even  worse, if a "civil petition" comes in that a drunk has vomited  making a public place dirty, they have to go out to clean it,  the worker says. One told a story about what he experienced  while removing poster advertisements.    "Two of us were engrossed in removing an advertisement from  a  telephone pole. One little kid who was going along with his  mother asked, Mommy, what do those people do?' Do you know what  the mother answered, then? She said, If you don't study hard  either, you'll end up being one of those people too.'"    He says it is at times like these that the doubt, what is  the  use in working hard, enters his mind. Recently, the number of  public servants feeling this way is increasing. Let us listen to  the words of one grade five official:    "Lately, in meetings between classmates or between juniors  and seniors, you hear a lot of talk about how empty people feel.  The greater a person's expectations of the civil service  community, the greater the sense of emptiness. It's not because  the profits of the past have disappeared with deregulation. It's  because there is a great deal of criticism of the economic  departments to which we have devoted ourselves, as if they were  an obstacle to our country's economic development and because  government workers are thought of as a group of criminals. There  are not a few of my colleagues who feel the present government  has sold us out for political objectives. It's to the extent  that we go in twos and threes after work to comfort ourselves in  the neighborhood bar."    The grade five official said, "When there were regulations,  control was possible, so the work was easy. But as regulations  were eased, it became less possible to predict, so everything  must be checked and reviewed. Because of this, there's a lot  more work to do. There may be those in the front-line windows  who say they won't take money and they won't work, but here we  have neither the time nor mental latitude to think like that."    Criticized by civil petitioners for saying they "won't take  money and won't work," there are those who respond, "I have  something to say to that." These are the words of one low level,  district office worker:    "They say that we're saying, we won't take your money and we  won't give you an authorization, but is it only the government  workers who have been bad? It's not that the person in charge is  finding fault, even though there is nothing wrong. There are  many cases in which people come with something that cannot be  done, "include an envelope [a bribe]" and beg you to do it for  them. They ask you to look the other way; they whine and plead.  It's giving a break to someone in these pitiable circumstances  that is considered corruption." [passage omitted]    The attitude of government workers toward civil-petitioners  is very negative. The words of one district office employee:    "Petitioners think if they only include a money envelope in  their paperwork, then it will all go through. If you tell them  to supplement this or that point, they just think they didn't  put enough money in the envelope. If even then you don't take  their money and demand supplementary measures, they apply  pressure through higher-ups or send anonymous messages for  totally unrelated reasons."    Of those around him, "Many have suffered this," he says,  "unless the whole of society changes, there will be government  worker corruption." "If petitioners don't get their way, they  send anonymous messages," says a worker at another district  office. [passage omitted]    The audits have played a big part in workers' decisions to  "work according to the law." "You have to spend two weeks  getting ready for one audit. There are a lot of cases in which  people can't do other work because of this," said one junior  official who works in a district office housing department, "You  hesitate to issue a license because you don't know what  indications are going to come out of the audit." Having watched  inspections of workers below him several times, one municipal  office manager takes a much stronger tone in his criticism of  the auditing:    "Do you think the BAI [Board of Audit and Inspection] people  are all clean? Some of them are robbers. In the past, they dealt  with all high-level civil petitions. Our country can't work  because of the BAI. Hardworking people all get hurt. They are  the only ones who like inspections."    "There is a lot of disparity between service administration  and inspections," says one district-office manager, until  recently working in the Seoul municipal office. Contrary to  service administration, which actively interprets legal  statutes, standing on the side of civil petitioners, auditors  end up interpreting the nature of the statutes in a passive way.  "Unless they narrow this deviation in interpretation, service  administration will become impossible," he said, "We are stuck  with the absurdity of being disciplined more the harder we  work." Is it not this absurdity which created the  self-preservation attitude of the civil service community?    To the question, "What within your organization has changed  with the reforms?" most government workers answer, "Nothing."  There are many who respond, "It's become friendlier," "It's  become cleaner" or "We try hard to do right." The observation  that the reform is deepening is attributable to this. [passage  omitted]    Although nine months have passed since the reform began, it  is not progressing as it should. Concerning areas in which there  were many irregularities and injustices in the past, only  auditing is being done. No deep prescriptions for eliminating  the causes of these irregularities are seen. [passage omitted]    "When the Blue House says `reform,' ministers and vice  ministers hear this, come and gather the bureau chiefs together  and say `reform.' The bureau chiefs gather those below them and  talk of reform; those below them also repeat this talk of reform  to the people below them. But they only said to carry out  reform. Nobody knows what it is that we are supposed to reform.  The same goes for the ministers who came in as a reform force.  The minister has to designate something to reform, but to do  this, he has to know the work of his ministry well. How many  such persons are there among the present ministers?"    "It doesn't matter whether they are ministers, vice  ministers  or senior officials, they can't carry out reform because they  don't know anything," asserts a person with the rank of bureau  chief working at the Capitol Building. The Blue House is also  within range of his criticism.    "The Blue House has been telling us to carry out reform, but  not saying what to reform. All it does is repeat the vague  slogan, Creating a New Korea. But it apparently has no concrete  methodology on what and how to reform. It's just saying that  government workers aren't moving, without presenting any  particulars." [passage omitted]    A Blue House source says, "The civil service community has  no  choice but to be placed in a contradictory relationship: on the  one hand, it suffers because of the anti-corruption drive, on  the other hand, it must draft policy and implement the reform.  Even for this, it cannot depend on the Blue House for  particulars, but must find them itself. The direction of the  anti-corruption drive concerning the government-service  community is not against past offenders, but against those  people who do not intend to change."    Is this really the direction the anti-corruption against  public servants has taken up to now? Unfortunately, it does not  appear so. The personal assets registration of public servants  is a representative example of this. There were senior officials  who in the morning heard from their minister, "Stay just as you  are," only to hear, "At the Blue House, they say it doesn't look  good," in the afternoon and then have to resign. There was also  a figure of the legal profession who had to resign only because  the land he bought with money he had received as an inheritance  happened to be in Suji-myon, Yongin county.    The economic condition of a ministry became the standard of  the anti-corruption drive. Too much interest in finances became  a cause of misfortune. "Is it 500 million or a billion [won]?"  became the line between the guilty and the innocent. People had  to be anxious over whether they had left out their sons'  accounts when registering personal assets. This has been one  aspect of the anti-corruption drive up to now. The reality of  the civil service community was that, during the time its  members were supposed to be finding their own work, such as  drafting policy for the particulars of the reform, they had no  choice but to look after their futures and the concerns of those  above them.    There will be many changes in the position held by the Blue  House until now, predicted one senior Blue House official in  connection with the anti-corruption drive in the civil service  community. "It is true that until now we have mainly treated the  problem's symptoms. In the future, however, we intend not to use  these measures as far as possible. The symptoms suffered by the  civil service community are so severe that by trying to excise  some parts we could end up killing the patient. Its reform  cannot help but be time-consuming." This shows us the  considerable extent of the Blue House's distrust of the civil  service.    Late last October, a conference of  planning-management-office  directors from each department of the Capitol Building was held  for the first time in a long time. It was set up to discuss the  problem of education for government workers, but in the middle  of the meeting, it unexpectedly went off in a curious direction.  The Blue House's method of reforming the government-service  community came up in conversation. The words of one participant:    "Government employees feel their work is worthwhile because  of four things: honor, promotion, remuneration and job security.  That the recent reform wind stole all these away from them came  up in conversation. Far from being honorable, the public servant  is presently portrayed as a member of some criminal  organization, resulting in this loss. Prospects are that the  backlog in promotions will grow more severe as the years go by  and, on top of this, pay is poor. It's bad enough as it is, but  the cold wave of the anti-corruption campaign reduced both legal  and illegal income by 30 percent. Job security for government  workers is never knowing when your head is going to roll."    "For these reasons, government workers have become cynical,"  he said, "In order to cause a desire to participate in the  reform to truly well up from within, we need to raise their  morale. Since everything else is working out well, we concluded  that each of us through our ministers should suggest to the Blue  House that, at least, it often give official recognition to  people who do well." [passage omitted]    The promotion backlog is now considerably severe. It takes  an  average of 12.7 years to be promoted from grade five to grade  four and 10.4 years from grade four to grade three. In the  finance ministry and Economic Planning Board, this still takes  2-3 years more than other ministries. Prospects are that these  periods will lengthen as time goes by. [passage omitted]    To relieve its severe promotion backlog, beginning last  November the Ministry of Government Administration adopted a  plural ranking system for the main chief clerk positions in its  central departments. Through this, about 269 people were  promoted to grade four, even while doing grade five work. The  question is how long the effects of this will continue.    The promotion backlog is the same at the lower levels.  Although there are some who started at grade nine and are now  bureau chiefs in central departments, people in the lower ranks  cannot even dream of this. At best, 18 years are required to go  from grade nine assistant clerk to grade six junior official.  Furthermore, in the future there is a high probability that the  best one can hope for will be to retire as a junior official.  With the best they can aim for being "eternal low rank," there  is concern about whether talented people will come into  government service at all.    Because of this promotion backlog, dissatisfaction is being  concentrated on the problem of remuneration. They are asking to  at least be given decent pay. The present pay of government  workers is reportedly 87 percent of workers at government-run  firms. During his campaign, President Kim promised to raise this  to 100 percent within his term in office. There are no  government workers who actually believe this, however. This is  because every president has made the same campaign promise.  There is a great deal of criticism over the freeze on government  pay early this year. "Just because he's president, does that  mean he can change what was put into the budget by last year's  National Assembly?" ask some, saying that with the wage freeze  the president went beyond his authority.    One MOTIE grade five official with 11 years in grade, said,  "I take home about W1 million in months without a bonus and 1.7  million in months with a bonus. I was shocked when I compared my  salary to that of a man in his tenth year working for Samsung: I  made over W600,000 less in the amount actually received."  [passage omitted]    There are problems with the present pay system, which  decides  pay based on rank and number of years worked. Rather than  increases in pay, it is geared more toward increases in rank, so  all must depend on promotion. Some point to this as a stumbling  block in the way of the move toward a specialized  administration. Also, if the small government is achieved, the  bureaucracy may have less appeal than previously. In preparation  for this, pay needs to be raised more quickly, to continually  entice a capable elite into the government. In an economic  department of the Kwachon government building early this year,  there was a disturbance when an elite, grade four official said  he was going to the private sector and others tried to dissuade  him.    It is very obvious that if the morale of the bureaucracy  drops, it is difficult for the government to be managed as it  should. Promotion and pay are not the only factors raising  morale. Continuous encouragement is needed capable of awakening  a sense of belonging and duty. One senior official used the  chariot-race scene in the movie Ben Hur as an  example. Ben Hur beat off innumerable competitors to win; there  is a direct correlation between this and his handling of the  reins, he says. If one looks closely, one can see that the  others are whipping their horses, but, without a whip, he only  keeps the horses in order using the reins, he points out.    It has been the whip of the anti-corruption drive centered  around the Blue House which has characterized the YS [Kim  Yong-sam] style of reform. Thus, people are heard to say things  like, "The direction is different, but the method is the same as  that of past authoritarian regimes," and use the newly-coined  word, Taechi [presidential rule]. The underlying tone of the  reform of the government-service community was also determined  by this Blue House-centered, anti-corruption style. Because of  this, the civil service community is frozen with fear and  self-preservation attitudes are prevalent. A bureaucratic  organization cannot be the faithful instrument of a reformist  government. Unless the situation is changed, the reform may fail  and fade away. But this does not mean that it is okay for civil  service reform to stop. Reform must continue, but it must be  done with the attitude of Ben Hur driving his chariot.</p>

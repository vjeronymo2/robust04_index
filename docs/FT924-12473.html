			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Brussels deal to curb toxic waste trade EC environment ministers yesterday decided that member states will have the right to ban imports of hazardous waste for disposal, opening up an agreement to regulate trade in toxic waste after two years hard negotiating. The agreement in principle was made possible after the European Commission took the rare step of changing the legal basis of the regulation from the internal market and trade provisions in the EC treaty to its environment clauses. The legal switch established that the environment took precedence over the free circulation of goods demanded by the single market, in what EC environment commissioner Karel Van Miert nevertheless stressed was 'a unique case'. Non-radioactive toxic waste had hitherto been characterised by European Court jurisprudence as a tradeable good. Ms Segolene Royal, the French environment minister, hailed yesterday's decision as 'one of the applications of the Maastricht treaty, which states that the environment takes precedence over commercial policy'. The regulation, which should come into effect in September 1994, reinforces the principle that waste should be dealt with as close as possible to the point of production. Mr Van Miert is fighting hard inside the Commission to ensure that environment policy does not become a casualty of subsidiarity. Ministers also agreed to propose controls on a chemical believed to eat the ozone layer faster than other substances the world is already trying to eliminate, Reuter reports. Diplomats said the ministers decided that methyl bromide, used to drive insects off farm land, should be added to the list of products targeted for control or phase-out in the Montreal Convention on protection of the ozone layer.

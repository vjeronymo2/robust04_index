			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Fujitsu returns to black as electronics sector recovers - Improved results at some of Japan's leading groups / Electronics Correction (published 1st November 1994) appended to this article. Japan's large comprehensive electronics companies posted a firm recovery in profits in the first six months of fiscal 1994 on the strength of cost-cutting measures and buoyant demand for products. The rebound for the manufacturers, who make a broad range of products from semiconductors and televisions to computers and heavy electrical machinery, ended a painful period of declining earnings lasting, in many cases, for three years. Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer manufacturer and parent of ICL, the UK-based computer company, bounced back into the black with recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - of Y22.13bn (Dollars 227m) compared with a deficit of Y13.79bn at the same stage last year. NEC saw recurring profits nearly triple to Y20.28bn from Y7.13bn while Mitsubishi Electric's recurring profits surged 80 per cent to Y27bn. The turnround came in spite of what the companies described as persistent weakness in private capital spending amid a mild economic recovery in Japan and a strong rise in the value of the yen. The biggest boon for Japan's electrical makers was the strong demand this year for electronic devices, particularly semiconductors and liquid crystal display panels. Japanese companies are leading world suppliers of memory chips and LCD screens, which are seeing strong demand from the US personal computer industry as PCs have been upgraded to advanced models which use more memory and as the PC market has grown. Fujitsu reported a 22 per cent rise in sales of electronic components, including semiconductors. Toshiba said semiconductor sales were up 14 per cent and sales in its information systems and electronic devices division were up 16 per cent as a result of strong demand for semiconductors and LCDs. Other information equipment, such as cellular phones and car navigation systems, enjoyed firm demand in Japan and are expected to support sales ahead. However, for the many integrated electrical machinery makers involved in consumer electronics, demand from consumers for audio-visual products remained sluggish overall, in spite of the income tax cut. In addition, prices have fallen sharply in the consumer electronics market, resulting in lacklustre profits even for companies which were able to maintain unit sales. For example, Toshiba said that air conditioner sales rose 50 per cent in unit terms but due to weak prices the benefit to profits was insignificant. Meanwhile, sales of TVs, video recorders and audio equipment remained weak in the Japanese market and prices came under pressure from cheap imports. The weakness of private capital spending was reflected in the results of those companies' with substantial heavy electrical and industrial machinery divisions. Hitachi, for example, saw a 15 per cent decline in sales in its industrial systems division. Toshiba suffered a 30 per cent drop in its heavy electrical machinery division, although that was largely on an absence of nuclear power plant sales in the period. The computer market was also, on the whole, a weak point for Japanese companies. While PCs have been in demand in the Japanese market, prices have fallen sharply. Fujitsu said it expected unit sales to rise about 28 per cent to 30 per cent but indicated that this would not translate directly into profit increases due to the price falls. Fujitsu saw consolidated sales in its information processing division fall 2 per cent due to the yen's rise and to a weak performance by ICL, which suffered from stagnant sales in Europe, it said. The companies have responded to pressures in their business environment by cutting costs, shifting production overseas and procuring more parts from low-cost bases abroad. Toshiba, for example, began importing 14-inch TVs from Taiwan which it sells in Japan under its own brand in an original equipment manufacturing arrangement, the company said. Fujitsu said it would shift more production overseas. Currently 17 per cent of the company's overall sales is manufactured overseas. The industry expects demand for semiconductors and LCDs to remain buoyant for some time ahead. On the back of expected strong semiconductor demand, NEC, Toshiba and Fujitsu have all revised spending plans to reflect greater expenditure on semiconductor facilities.

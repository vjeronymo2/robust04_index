			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 races ahead to all-time closing high - Market Report A combination of sharply higher international stock markets, increased hopes of UK interest rate cuts, and news of a big corporate deal, saw London share prices race ahead to record levels yesterday. And there were strong indications from traders that this morning could see the FT-SE 100 Index penetrate the 3,500 level. At the close of one of the busiest trading sessions in the past few weeks, the FT-SE 100 stood 44.4 higher at a peak 3,491.8. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index underperformed the senior FT-SE 100, however, registering an 18.5 gain at 4,084.3, as the big institutions shifted their focus to the market's more liquid heavyweight stocks. The London market was in a confident mood from the outset of trading, as Wall Street's move to an historic high last Friday and the Tokyo market's near 8 per cent leap yesterday set the scene for a buoyant opening. European stock markets advanced strongly as dealers pinned their hopes on a German interest rate cut on Thursday when the Bundesbank council meets. And news that BMW, the German car manufacturer, is buying British Aerospace's Rover car company, for Pounds 800m in cash, put the seal on a strong opening to the London stock market. Helping to fuel the early push by share prices were the MO money supply figures, which came in below market expectations and reinforced a growing market view that weak money supply numbers would increase the chances of an early reduction in UK interest rates. The market got very excited about possible rate cuts in the UK following the monthly monetary policy meeting between Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Ken Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer. There was some scepticism, however. Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull described the market's enthusiasm for the rate cut story as a 'dangerous argument', and highlighted the risks of a big setback. Opening around 10 points ahead, the FT-SE 100 drove forward throughout the day, eventually settling at an all-time closing peak. The FT-SE 100's intraday record high is 3,496.1, registered on January 21. Volume in the market was a hefty 992.8m shares and was boosted by a medium-sized trading programme executed in the morning session and some hectic business said to have been triggered by a number of options expiries. These were said to have represented expiries of various OTC instruments, large tailor-made options featuring many FT-SE 100 stocks. Significantly, the Footsie bounded ahead after the options market closed and as Wall Street moved up to post a 30-point advance on the Dow Industrial Average. A senior marketmaker at one of the big UK securities houses noted the absence of any real selling pressure in London. Mr Richard Jeffrey, market strategist at Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, described the underlying mood in London as 'very confident', and said it would take 'a brave investor to take a contrary view'. He added that the biggest threat was likely to come from the political arena. There were some big casualties in the market, with Wellcome, the drugs group, damaged by adverse comment on its Aids drug, and Christian Salvesen, the transport to food company, savaged after a profits warning. Royal Insurance delivered another good performance amid hints of renewed big buying via the inter-dealer broker system.</p>

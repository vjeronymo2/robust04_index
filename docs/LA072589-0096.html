			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEPUTIES BREAK UP ILLEGAL RODEO  </P> <P> An illegal rodeo that reportedly included bullfighting was shut down by  sheriff's deputies who discovered it in Saugus while investigating a parking  complaint, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> About 200 participants and spectators were dispersed from a ranch in San  Francisquito Canyon Sunday afternoon, Sgt. David Stunson said. Deputies  stumbled on to the rodeo, which had no county permit for a public assembly,  when answering a report that so many cars were parked in the area that a  driveway shared by nearby ranches was partially blocked, he said.  </P> <P> County animal control officers were also called to the scene when deputies  noticed that several horses and steers used in the rodeo competition appeared  to be malnourished and injured.  </P> <P> Mexican rodeo, or charreada, events had been staged on Sundays at the ranch in  the 29300 block of San Francisquito Canyon Road for nearly a year, according to  neighbors. But authorities said the Sheriff's Department was unaware of the  activity until deputies received the call on Sunday.  </P> <P> In addition to not having an assembly permit, the rodeo had improper emergency  access and lacked fire protection equipment, Stunson said. There were  inadequate restroom facilities and the health department will be asked to  determine whether food and beverage preparation at the rodeo was sanitary, he  said.  </P></p>

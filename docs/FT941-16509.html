			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Management: Put the gender issue on the agenda - Steve Shirley, life-president of the FI Group, on how to get more women into senior positions - Tips from the top Let's suppose that one of your resolutions for 1994 is to get more women into senior management, perhaps even on to the board. What do you have to do this Monday morning? With women forming more than half the working population, it certainly seems strange that so few of us get through the glass ceiling to serve at a corporate level. It should be no surprise if shareholders start asking questions at the AGM. The point is, however, that it is quality not quantity that counts: pressure to play the numbers game does not help. Making promotions and new appointments is tough enough without someone saying you should appoint a black or someone with disabilities or, heaven forbid, a woman. Yet some positive discrimination may be necessary, if for no other reason than to create the right corporate culture. My experience is that once you alter the culture, there is no looking back. Women have seen welcome changes in the fields of marketing and advertising, and more recently, in the old, hidebound professions of law and accountancy. But we also need such a quantum leap in industry. Top women now aged over 50 can be termed pioneers. We were the first of the few rising to uncharted territory. Career opportunities 30 years ago were so narrow that we had to take any significant opportunities that arose. The same is true today. I receive more corporate invitations than my business performance alone would warrant. They have an element of tokenism. No matter - provided it is clearly understood that I am not going to sit quietly, giggling at the occasional joke whether or not I understand it. I expect to be judged by the same inexorable criteria as my male colleagues: do I enable my group or organisation to achieve its task? Nowadays that is less by command and control, more by building teamwork and empowering individuals. There are undoubted business benefits in having a work environment that is more encouraging to women. So, in the absence of quotas, what can be done to increase the quality and quantity of women's participation? First, companies should consider introducing general management training specifically for women. I'm also a great believer in senior managers, of either sex, mentoring more junior female colleagues. Then, there is 'career pathing' as a system of stepped experience towards career goals. Like men, women have to face the issue of whether they are prepared to pay the price of a vigorous career. Success is not an easy option. It requires sacrifices but also provides excitement and a sense of fulfilment. Funnily enough, I also believe that God is in the detail. We have to get job advertisements and application forms worded so that women who have been through career breaks to have children or to follow a husband's job move, do not feel they have to break into an alien world of steady progression and unbroken continuity. If you want to get a woman on your board as a non-executive, think of the characteristics you want in any director. Then if there is a shortage in your industry extend your search to professions where women have hit the top. Perceptions are vitally important. I shall always remember rejecting a candidate's application on the grounds of her insufficient experience. Then a headhunter so extolled her entrepreneurial qualities and trained intellect that a meeting was arranged. She went on to serve on our board for more than two terms. On the subject of positive discrimination, there is Opportunity 2000's idea of percentages agreed with business unit heads so as to target, say, 30 per cent of all department heads or unit leaders to women. Once the middle management posts are filled, there will be competences enough for the top posts later. The main reason people give me for not appointing women to their boards is that there are no women around. By this they usually mean visible at the level below the board. The process of managing change is an enormous challenge. But it is not always necessary to guess. Ask the women in your organisation what they think will help them fulfil their aspirations.

			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (28): More commercial role - The future of state-run enterprises Fifty years ago, South Africa's most contentious political issue was the 'poor white' problem - how to cope with hundreds of thousands of poverty-stricken, rural Afrikaners seeking work in the cities. The answer came in the form of parastatals: big, state-run companies which provided huge numbers of new jobs and useful sources of patronage for the Afrikaner elite. Now, with the country's attention focused on finding employment opportunities for the vast, unskilled black labour pool, attention has once again centered on these giant companies. But despite the pre-election aspirations of some of the more statist among African National Congress advisers, the economic climate is now vastly different from the early days of Afrikaner rule. Iscor, the state iron and steel company, was privatised in 1989 and is now the most actively traded stock on the Johannesburg market. Similarly, Sasol, the giant oil-from-coal company, is also privately run and has begun to shift its focus to the manufacture of petrochemicals and other derivative products. Both are now among the country's leading exporters of semi-manufactured products. Over the past few years, moreover, with an eye to possible further privatisations, the remaining state corporations have been shifted to a 'commercial' basis, and are run as self-financing, independent public companies, with an appointed board of directors. In recognition of this shift, the new government has chosen to emphasise the strategic importance of existing state industries and their potential as bases of local technology and manufactured exports, rather than their possible role as job providers for the masses. 'The public enterprises have a special role to play in the process of rebuilding and revitalising the economy' observes Ms Stella Sigcau, minister of public enterprises. Although some state-run companies, such as the Mossgas oil terminal off South Africa's southern coast, are struggling, others have dramatically improved productivity in the past few years. Transnet, which runs the country's railways, airline, ports and harbours was for years best known as a home for unskilled, white workers who could be guaranteed lifetime employment on the railways. 'I don't even want to talk about how bad our hiring ratio used to be,' acknowledges Mr Anton Moolman, managing director, noting that the company is now committed to a comprehensive affirmative action programme. However, while the demographics may have improved, overall employment in the company has been falling steadily as it has sought to improve productivity and cut costs. In 1993, more than 15,000 employees were redeployed and 27,000 took voluntary severance packages. 'Our prices are now competitive globally,' Mr Moolman says. 'We stand to benefit greatly from the economic recovery.' Given the prominence of electrification goals in the government's reconstruction and development programme, Eskom, the giant electricity utility, has a particularly important role to play. Last year, the utility electrified 200,000 new homes. In 1994 it hopes to raise the total to 250,000, all financed internally. Both of these companies, moreover, are now intent on expanding their operations abroad, especially in Africa. Transnet has already got operations under way in Libya and east Africa, while Eskom envisions the establishment of a vast regional electricity grid that can make use of the hydroelectric resources of the Congo and Zambesi basins. Mr John Maree, Eskom's chairman, wants to use South Africa's low-cost electricity as a key incentive to increase foreign investment. 'With the second-cheapest electricity in the world, we are able to create an Electricity Valley in South Africa - similar to California's Silicon Valley  -that will attract high energy consumption industries to the region,' he says. Perhaps most striking of all has been the ANC-led government's new affection for the country's arms industry, now split into two companies, Denel, which does most of the manufacturing, and Armscor, which concentrates on procurement and maintenance. They have been applauded by the new administration as representing a 'very important technological base without which numerous job opportunities would be lost.' Given this emphasis on commercial activity, moreover, the thorny question of privatisation has forced its way back onto the agenda. Although President Mandela recently deprecated the notion as just another means of maintaining white economic clout, the government seems to be leaving the door open for a change of heart. It has publicly declared that it will 'look with interest' at ways in which privatisation might empower the black community, while Mr Jay Naidoo, minister without portfolio, has said that he is in favour of selling 'unproductive assets' in state hands. Whatever the future of that debate, however, it seems highly unlikely that the government will seek to decommercialise, let alone renationalise, the privatised companies. In the unexpectedly sober new South Africa, job creation and patronage in the parastatals will be taking second place to efficiency and sustainable growth.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Groupe Chez Gerard on stock market menu Some of London's most fashionable eating places are to be floated on the Stock Exchange at the end of next month. Groupe Chez Gerard owns Bertorelli's in Covent Garden, Cafe Fish off Haymarket, Soho Soho in Frith Street and three Chez Gerard restaurants. It also operates and has a 25.5 per cent stake in Chutney Mary in Chelsea. The group is expected to have a market value of over Pounds 17m after the flotation, which is expected to raise between Pounds 3m and Pounds 5m of new money. The shares will be placed with institutions, although some will be made available to group employees. Mr Laurence Isaacson, deputy chairman, said yesterday that the group was raising the money in order to expand the business faster in London. 'We want to utilise our brands fully, with the emphasis on Chez Gerard and Cafe Fish.' The restaurants are owned by Mr Isaacson and Mr Neville Abraham, chairman and chief executive. The pair entered the restaurant business in 1980, converting a banana warehouse next door to the Royal Opera House into Cafe des Amis du Vin, which they sold in 1984 for Pounds 2.2m.</p>

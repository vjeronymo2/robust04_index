			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Erosion of support for Canadian Reform party in run-up to election A new element of volatility has entered Canadian politics in the run-up to this year's general election with a rapid erosion of support for the once fast-growing Reform party, writes Bernard Simon. Reform's populist, right-of-centre policies had been expected to drain considerable support from the ruling Progressive Conservative party, especially in the western provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. Many political observers had predicted that the most likely outcome of the election, expected in early autumn, would be a minority Conservative government supported by as many as 30 Reform MPs. Reform currently has only one MP. But according to the latest Angus Reid/Southam poll, support for Reform in Alberta, its stronghold, has halved in the past year to 21 per cent, with a five-point decline in January. An Angus Reid official said yesterday that many voters, nervous at the prospect of a hung parliament, appear to be returning to the three traditional parties - the Conservatives, Liberals and New Democratic party. The Liberals, the main opposition party, remain well ahead, with 46 per head of the decided vote, against 18 per cent for the Conservatives.</p>

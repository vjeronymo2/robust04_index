			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT BUSH SENDS TROOPS TO SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> One idea about the "Butcher of Baghdad" dilemma: Don't kill a lot of civilians,  etc. Don't even think of committing American ground forces.  </P> <P> Simply station our carriers off Iraq and use missiles alone. What would be the  target: Very simple -- Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> We certainly know where his haunts are. We certainly have some kind of  intelligence inside Iraq. Wherever he goes, wherever he intends to go, blast it  with a big warhead. I'd be willing to bet he would get real nervous in a short  time, as Libya's Moammar Kadafi did. Think of the millions of people who would  have been saved if we could have eliminated Hitler.  </P> <P> Did I hear someone say it's not right to engage in personal assassinations? To  that I reply that being killed or injured is just as personal to the young men  now sailing toward harm's way because of this ruthless, unfeeling nut.  </P> <P> CHET HILL  </P> <P> Arroyo Grande  </P></p>

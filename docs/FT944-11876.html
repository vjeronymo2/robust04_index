			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Rowland to quit Lonrho board: Defeat in bitter battle with Bock marks the end of 33-year reign Mr Tiny Rowland is to retire from the board of Lonrho, following a protracted and bitter struggle with his fellow joint chief executive, Mr Dieter Bock. His departure after 33 years at the helm of Lonrho will remove from the UK corporate scene one of its most controversial and charismatic characters. Mr Rowland was once described by Mr Edward Heath, the former prime minister, as the 'unacceptable face of capitalism', but created virtually from scratch an international trading group encompassing mines in Africa, a chain of international hotels and a complex web of other interests. After two days of tempestuous negotiations between the warring chief executives, Mr Rowland yesterday agreed to surrender his executive responsibilities at the end of the year and to retire from the board altogether in March. If shareholders agree, he will then be given the honorific title of president, allowing him to continue to visit African and Middle Eastern heads of state in the company Gulfstream jet. Mr Rowland, who is 76, has fought off previous attempts to remove him from the company, but his colleagues said yesterday that the battle appeared to have been won by Mr Bock. 'The papers are signed,' said one. 'It is a done deal.' According to a Lonrho director, Mr Rowland's reaction when told two days ago that a majority of the board were in favour of his departure was 'I will see you in hell first'. But it was made clear to Mr Rowland by the company's chairman, Sir John Leahy, that 'he had no option'. In the previous few days, Sir John - a retired diplomat who is only a temporary chairman - had taken informal soundings from the board. Directors were resolved to offer Mr Rowland the 'opportunity to make an elegant exit', according to a financier. However, they were equally determined that they would not take 'no' for an answer. Mr Rowland will continue to receive his salary of Pounds 1.24m, plus expenses and benefits, until the end of next year. His 'benefits' last year included Pounds 470,000 towards the costs of running his homes in London and Buckinghamshire, and his expenses were more than Pounds 1m. Mr Paul Spicer, a longstanding ally of Mr Rowland who retired from the Lonrho board earlier this year said that his old friend had achieved one significant victory. Under a new arrangement relating to Mr Rowland's 6.5 per cent shareholding in the company, Mr Bock - who holds 18.8 per cent - no longer has the right to force Mr Rowland to sell him his shares on leaving the company at the end of next year. Mr Spicer said: 'He did not want to leave them (the shares) under the control of Mr Bock.' The contract paving the way for Mr Rowland's departure was signed by him at 4pm yesterday. It was then ratified by the company's board at a meeting which began at 4.30pm and which Mr Rowland did not attend. Mr Bock, who joined Lonrho at the beginning of 1993 when he bought his stake in the company, has had an uneasy relationship with Mr Rowland for more than a year. He felt that his plans to reorganise Lonrho, which owns around 500 companies, were being frustrated by Mr Rowland. Mr Bock launched an abortive coup two months ago to oust Mr Rowland. Hours before September's board meeting, he backed off from proposing that Mr Rowland should step down, fearing he could not count on the support of the board. Since then, two of Mr Rowland's closest supporters have resigned from the board. Lex, Page 16 How Bock turned the tables on Tiny, Page 19</p>

Zhang Wule said: Last year, encouraged by Deng Xiaoping's  southern tour talks and the spirit of the 14th CPC National  Congress, the people throughout the province, taking account of  Gansu's actual conditions, implemented the decision of the party  Central Committee on macrocontrol and regulation, took effective  measures, overcame all kinds of difficulties, and fulfilled the  objectives set by the provincial party committee and government  at the beginning of last year. The general situation is good.  This year is the last year to fulfill the Eighth Five-Year  Plan, a crucial year to expedite the establishment of the  socialist market economic structure, and a year to start with  the implementation of the decision of the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The state will introduce  major reforms to the financial, taxation, monetary, planning,  investment, foreign trade, and price systems. [passage omitted]    Zhang Wule pointed out that in this new situation, the  government has three main tasks to perform: The first is  ensuring sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and  improving Gansu's productivity; the second is making efforts to  improve the masses' lives on the basis of economic development;  and the third is upholding the two civilizations and striving to  maintain a good mood and basic stability in society. In line  with these three basic tasks, there is a need to ensure a steady  growth in the rural economy; to develop rural industries,  township and town enterprises, tertiary industries, collective  economic sectors, individual economic sectors, and private  economic sectors; to widen the scope of opening; to carry out  technical transformation; to expedite the transformation of  scientific and technological achievements into actual productive  forces; to strengthen enterprise management; and to bring about  the gradual formation of a modern enterprise system.

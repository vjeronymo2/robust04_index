			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / International Company News: Gerstner lures Chrysler finance chief to IBM MR LOU Gerstner, the new chairman of International Business Machines, yesterday made his first top-level executive appointment by naming Mr Jerry York, chief financial officer of Chrysler, to the same position at IBM. Mr York, 54, has been chief financial officer of Chrysler since May 1990 and has played an important role in the carmaker's successful efforts to cut operating costs by Dollars 3bn, sell non-core assets, issue some Dollars 3bn in equity and re-negotiate its credit agreements  - all in the midst of a severe motor industry recession. He is well respected on Wall Street, where analysts said his experience would be extremely valuable at IBM, which is struggling to cut costs and return to profitability after two years of heavy losses. Mr York, who becomes a senior vice-president of IBM, is the first person selected by Mr Gerstner for his corporate management team. Mr Gerstner, former chairman of foods and tobacco group RJR Nabisco, took over as as chairman and chief executive of IBM on April 1. He replaced Mr John Akers, who retired early because of the group's financial problems. Mr Frank Metz, IBM chief financial officer, retired in January and had been replaced on a temporary basis by Mr Paul Rizzo, who returned to the group from retirement. IBM announced last week Mr Rizzo would remain at the company as vice-chairman and would be responsible for manufacturing and development operations on an interim basis. Mr Gerstner said: 'Jerome York not only has extensive financial experience, but he has a significant background in operations as well. 'He has helped lead Chrysler's cost-reduction programmes while successfully managing the company's overall financial portfolio. He will be a valuable member of our team.' Mr York, who worked for Ford and General Motors early in his career, joined Chrysler in 1980.</p>

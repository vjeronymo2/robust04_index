			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bruna Bellonzi and Alberto Sisto: "The Old Labor </F> Leaders Are on Their Way Out"]    [Text] What are the prospects for uniting the labor unions?  Changes in their top leadership are being forecast: changes that  would favor rapprochement and mergers such as the peripheral  organizations are now advocating.  <H5>  Confindustria Also Participates </H5>   "We welcome the prospect of labor union unity, and I would  further state that by signing the Unitary Labor Union  Representation accord we contributed to that unity." These are  the words not of a labor union official but rather of  Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] Vice  President Carlo Callieri, who wants the industrialists to  participate in the debate on labor union unity. This should come  as no surprise. Labor appears to have lost some of its political  connections and to be seeking a new identity in an attempt to  reaffirm its status as a major player, in anticipation of the  Second Republic.    The industrialists' organization accordingly wishes also to  have its say, inasmuch as the renewed debate on the subject of  labor unity has until now--at least as far as the top leaders of  the labor confederations are concerned--consisted solely of  reciprocal invitations, although an embryonic movement in favor  of unity the can already be discerned within the craft unions  and territorial organizations.    The face of unitary trade unionism has not yet taken shape,  but it will definitely not bear any resemblance to either Bruno  Trentin, Sergio D'Antoni, or Pietro Larizza. This is because the  first step toward that goal will be taken in the factories and  offices with the election of the unitary representatives--a  process that is scheduled to begin within the next few weeks.    The embryos of unity that are becoming visible within some  territorial organizations and craft unions do not yet project an  image of this "new" federation. They take the form of meetings  to study proposals with respect to unity such as those put  forward by the Lombardian regional secretaries of the three  labor confederations. These proposals include the creation of a  single treasury, such as the Campania textile workers created  when they paid their membership dues for 1944; the  reconstitution of unitary directives, such as the commercial  workers' unions have chosen to do; and nonaggression pacts, such  as the one between textile workers and metalworkers in  anticipation of the election of the RSU [Unified Trade Union  Representatives].    The textile workers will offer a single ticket at the RSU  election, although the affiliation of the individual candidates  will be indicated. The metalworkers, on the other hand, have  decided that no one will be left without representation: If in a  given factory or office one of the three confederations fails to  elect a single representative, the other two will give it one of  their seats.    The pensioners--who constitute at least half of the  membership of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor],  CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], and UIL [Italian  Federation of Trade Unions]--have already scheduled a joint  meeting for 15 February to consider a proposal to be presented  for discussion by the rank and file. The proposal also contains  initiatives that reveal a desire for unity but still do not  confront the real issues.  <H5>  The Obstacles </H5>   In reality, what has taken place so far is more in the  nature  of a reorganization of the joint efforts made in recent years  than the beginning of a process designed to achieve unity--a  process that will face its share of difficulties. Despite the  powerful incentives that motivate them, the pensioners  themselves make no secret of the obstacles that their proposal  is encountering even within their own ranks.  <H5>  More Than a New Logo Under Discussion </H5>   The obstacles are even greater at the next higher level in  the labor union structure. The political obstacles remain, for  although many of labor's political connections no longer have a  name (for example, the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and PSI  [Italian Socialist Party]), the respective visions of the kind  of society in behalf of which the labor movement would like to  struggle are still quite diverse. The organizational  difficulties remain, because the problem as to whether the  movement should represent basically its own membership or all  workers has not yet been resolved. The internal structural  difficulties also remain, because before a unified structure can  be achieved, the respective leaderships must in any case not  only be changed but reduced in size. According to CGIL  Organizational Secretary Paolo Lucchesi, at least 30 percent of  these leadership positions will have to be eliminated--no easy  task.    But this is a problem for the distant future, like that of a  new logo that will do justice to everyone. There is much more  under discussion. When an adjective must be chosen to describe  the new labor federation, what will the right word be? Or  rather, what word will be acceptable to everyone?    No one has yet come up with that word. In negotiations with  the other side, for example, will a strategy of conflict  prevail, or one of cooperation? And will the prevailing concept  be joint management or codetermination of policy? The CGIL  leadership is quite cautious in designing the profile of the new  entity which it seems inclined to create in cooperation with the  other labor organizations.    Sergio Cofferati, who many say will succeed Bruno Trentin as  the head of the most powerful of the labor confederations, will  suggest only what the future organization should not be. "It  should be a union organization devoid of any trace of a  corporative structure, but instead characterized by a strong  spirit of solidarity," he says. "Moreover," he adds, "this is a  course that we have already begun to follow. There is no lack of  examples: they range from the labor dispute with Olivetti to the  agreement with Iveco of the FIAT Group and our proposals for  negotiations in the automobile sector." This policy would appear  to exclude COBAS [rank-and-file committees] and all other  independent organizations, whose only reason for existence--and  for opposing the confederations--is precisely the defense of  special interests.    "Rather than unity," Piergiorgio Tiboni--secretary of FLMU,  the independent union of metalworkers and mechanics--notes,  "what the CGIL, CISL, and UIL have in mind is a single union,  although they are ashamed to call it that. They obtained a  reward from Confindustria: a reserve of 30 percent of the  representatives, in each company, over and above the success of  the individual slates, whereas these elections are precisely the  occasion when the real strength and representativeness of each  labor organization should be recorded!"  <H5>  Representatives </H5>   The CGIL has in fact officially renounced its quota. Trentin  is insisting that the real representativeness of each  organization be continually verified, and on this point even the  internal minority--the "Be a Union" faction--is in agreement.  Alfonso Gianni, one of the heirs of Fausto Bertinotti--who left  the confederation because he was elected secretary of the  Communist Renewal party--wants the accord concerning the RSU to  be replaced by a law whereby the 30 percent reserve for the  so-called more representative confederations would be abolished  and every organization would fight on equal terms. To obtain  this objective, Trentin and Gianni advocate a referendum to  abolish the criterion of "greater representativeness," on the  basis of which the representatives who have a voice at the  negotiating table are currently selected.    In the unitary labor organization of the future, will there  be a place for the extreme factions--for those who are still  installed in the organs of the CGIL leadership or who while away  their time in the CISL and are kept at bay in government jobs,  for example, by D'Antoni's prestige?  <H5>  The Problem of COBAS and the Independents Remains Unresolved </H5>   "The impulse of solidarity and of conserving the existing  system must reconciled," says Carlo Ghezzi, secretary of the  Labor Chamber in Milan. "I do not rule out the possibility that  some people will not be recognized in a new labor confederation.  However, the clarification could come immediately, with the  election of the RSU."    Cofferati is more cautious. "Unity does not mean a  leveling,"  he says, "nor a disappearance of differences, either among the  confederations or within the confederations." But neither does  he want to deny that some segments of unions that represent  radical positions could be lost along the way. "And not only  leftist segments," he explains. The reconciliation has in fact  already begun, and not just today. The first crack was opened  with the signing of the accord of 3 July 1993 between the  government and the corporate interests, and others developed  during the difficult negotiations for the restructuring of large  economic groups.    Codetermination of policy, rather than joint management,  would certainly appear to be the keystone for managing processes  that are painful and inevitable. And this may be precisely the  basis for the welcome--and indeed the appreciation--that has  been expressed by Confindustria.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo to review public spending MR Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, is set to announce the most sweeping review of public spending since the early 1980s. As rising public sector borrowing increasingly threatens ministers' hopes of avoiding tax rises, Mr Portillo will in the next few weeks announce plans for re-assessing Whitehall departments' long-term expenditure priorities. It is expected to be the most fundamental review since Lord Howe, the former Chancellor, ordered a similar study after the Conservatives took power in 1979. The aim then was to cut public spending in real terms. Mr Portillo's review, expected to last at least a year, will look at spending in the hope of paving the way for further income tax cuts before the general election. A likely early target is the Pounds 76bn social security budget which now accounts for about a third of government spending compared with less than a quarter in 1979-80. Defence and transport are other possibilities. Mr John Major is determined to take a tougher line on public spending as the Treasury forecasts that the public sector borrowing requirement will reach Pounds 37bn this financial year and Pounds 44bn in the following financial year. The cabinet agreed in principle to the review last May but work was delayed while Mr Portillo concentrated on November's Autumn Statement. He is expected to set out a programme of work - probably indicating the departments to be subject to scrutiny first as well as the overall objectives. Mr Major hinted at the review in his speech to the Carlton Club on Wednesday. He said it was, 'dangerously easy for the state to settle into habits of spending which outlast their purpose and outrun their budgets. And to avoid that happening, it is necessary from time to time to re-examine long term trends in expenditure.' The prime minister said that to make progress towards lower personal taxation, 'we must keep firm control of inflation and take a rig -orous approach to public spending'.</p>

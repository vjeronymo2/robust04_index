			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Maynayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek, 15 Jun--Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] has adopted a  policy of protectionism. In line with a decision by the  republic's government that was promulgated today, import duties  of 200-400 percent are being brought into effect on imports of  alcohol, tobacco products, furniture, carpets, motor vehicles,  and domestic television and radio equipment.    According to competent bodies, the duties will also affect  goods brought in across the border by tourists for personal use,  even if this is just a single item.    Although these measures are of a temporary nature, if the  decision is to be believed, local businessmen make no secret of  their concerns. Experience shows that there was nothing more  permanent in the former Soviet Union than temporary decisions.</p>

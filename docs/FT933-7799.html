			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Kodak to shed 10,000 more jobs EASTMAN Kodak, the troubled photographic equipment company, expects to cut about 10,000 jobs by the end of 1995, some 7.5 per cent of its workforce. The forecast cuts are in addition to 2,000 job losses announced earlier this year. Kodak could not immediately comment on the number of redundancies expected in the UK. The job cuts will mean bad news for Rochester, New York - a company town near Lake Ontario. The forecast was made in a letter to shareholders by Mr Kay Whitmore, Kodak's departing chairman. Mr Whitmore, who has a reputation for disliking job cuts, was told to go as the head of Kodak by independent directors earlier this month. He is staying on until a replacement is chosen. When Mr Whitmore's impending departure was announced, Kodak's directors said the company no longer expected to unveil a 'turnround' plan in September. They added that Mr Whitmore would write to shareholders after the August 13 board meeting. Mr Whitmore wrote that Kodak's plans anticipate 'reducing capital spending to the level of depreciation, capping both research and development and sales, advertising, distribution, and administration, and pursuing opportunities to turn assets into cash'. Mr Whitmore did not elaborate on potential asset sales. Speculation has centred on its health interests, dominated by Sterling Drug. He said that should allow the company to generate cash flow - profits after tax and interest, but with depreciation taken into account - of Dollars 2.8bn between the beginning of 1993, and the end of 1995. Cash flow should reach Dollars 700m in 1993, Dollars 1bn in 1994 and Dollars 1.1bn in 1995. The 1993 figure will include a contribution from the large Eastman Chemical unit which Kodak has already said will be spun off. Yesterday, Kodak said independent directors - who include Mr Roberto Goizueta, chairman of Coca-Cola, and Mr John Phelan, former head of the New York Stock Exchange - were 'pleased with some of the elements' of Mr Whitmore's proposed restructuring. On Wall Street, Kodak - which stood at Dollars 55 3/8 in advance of Mr Whitmore's overthrow - gained another Dollars   1/4 to close at Dollars 60 1/2 .</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PAN AM SETTLES OVERWEIGHT SUIT  </P> <P> Pan American World Airways has agreed to pay $2.35 million to settle a lawsuit  by 116 flight attendants claiming the carrier's weight policy discriminated  against them.  </P> <P> The class-action suit, which was filed five years ago in San Francisco by the  Independent Union of Flight Attendants, said the Pan Am attendants were fired,  forced to resign or denied promotions because the airline decided they were  overweight.  </P> <P> In 1987, a federal judge in the Northern District of California ruled in favor  of the flight attendants and ordered Pan Am to change its policy that sets  limits on how much flight attendants could weigh. Pan Am had appealed that  decision.  </P> <P> Under the settlement announced Thursday, Pan Am agreed to withdraw its appeal  without admitting any wrongdoing and establish a more liberal weight policy.  </P></p>

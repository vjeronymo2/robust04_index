The trial of the 1991 coup organisers was declared over  after  the Russian State Duma proclaimed an amnesty to the plotters.  However, the prosecution appealed against the decision saying  that any trial which is already under way is to be completed by  passing a guilty or non-guilty verdict. If the verdict is  guilty, the accused will then be amnestied.</p>

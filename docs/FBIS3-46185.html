Ltd, the first profitable joint venture in the  Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone here, has decided to invest 10  million U.S. dollars more to expand production.    The Sino-Japanese venture was one of the first  transnationals  to enter the free trade zone, which went into operation in March  1992.    The extra investment will be put into the manufacturing of  audio equipment and video cassette recorders, according to Cui  Changshun, chairman of the company. He said that the products  will be exported to the United States, Canada and Southeast  Asian countries.    Last December alone, the firm recorded a sales value of 130  million yuan by selling big-screen television sets, high-end  audio equipment, camcorders and video cassette recorders. Of  these commodities, 70 percent were exported and the rest were  sold on the Chinese market.    Cui attributed the economic performance to preferential  policies enjoyed by corporations in the zone. The policy does  not require licenses for import and export goods, which are also  exempted from tariffs.    The Waigaoqiao Free Trade Zone is projected to cover ten sq  km. Construction has so far been completed on forty percent of  the development area, which has absorbed more than 860 projects  and 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in total investment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Beijing-based correspondent Yi Tong-sik] </F>   [Text] Chu Chang-chun, North Korean ambassador to China,  in a news conference today, said that North Korea showed the  nuclear fuel rods being replaced at the nuclear reactor in  Yongbyon to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  inspection team.    In a news conference for foreign reporters held at the North  Korean Embassy in Beijing this afternoon, Ambassador Chu  stressed that although North Korea showed the IAEA inspectors  the nuclear fuel rods, North Korea does not have the obligation  to permit any inspection, thus hinting that an actual nuclear  inspection was not made.    Ambassador Chu also said that if a package solution is  agreed  upon on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula at the third  round of talks between North Korea and the United States, the  IAEA could supervise [kamsi] the replacement of the fuel rods at  any time, thus making it clear that North Korea will link the  nuclear inspection with its third round of talks with the United  States.</p>

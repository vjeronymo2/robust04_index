			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Austrian group buys 34% stake in Czech brewery for Sch115m BBAG, Austria's biggest drinks company, is paying Sch115m (Dollars 10.3m) in cash for a 34 per cent stake in Starobrno, a Czech brewery in Brno. The acquisition, through BBAG's brewing subsidiary Brau-Union, is the first significant foreign investment in the Czech Republic's brewing industry this year. Brau-Union won against competition from several other European brewers. Starobrno has about 3 per cent of the Czech beer market and is the largest brewer in South Moravia, close to the border with Slovakia, with some 50 per cent of the market in Brno, the regional capital. The brewery's output last year was 488,000 hectolitres and this is expected to rise to 500,000 hectolitres this year. The company had turnover last year of Kcs325m (Dollars 11.48m). Brau-Union bought the stake in Starobrno because of its strong position in its local market. The Austrian company is keen to increase its share of the central European market, adding to its breweries in Austria and Hungary. It intends to maintain Starobrno's position as a regional brand and will offer support in marketing and technological development. The Czech beer market, heavily localised and fragmented, is the focus of fierce competition among European and US drinks groups vying for stakes in local brewers. Anheuser-Busch, the US brewer of Budweiser, is wooing Budjeovicky Pivovary, brewer of Czech Budvar. Negotiations are complicated by disputes over the use of the Budweiser brand name, which is of Czech origin. Bass, the UK brewer, bought a 34 per cent stake in Prazske Pivovary brewery last December for Pounds 9m (Dollars 13.95m).</p>

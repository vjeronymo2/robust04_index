			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Time Warner appoints president Time Warner, the world's largest entertainment group, yesterday appointed Mr Richard Parsons, 46, the chairman of New York savings bank Dime Bancorp, as its new president. He takes over from Mr Gerald Levin, who remains chairman and chief executive. Although the appointment of a banker to the number two spot appeared to be an unusual move, Mr Parsons has been a member of the group's board of directors since 1990 and has also worked on the boards of TriStar Pictures and the cable group American Television &amp; Communications. He is also a respected figure in local and national politics, having previously worked with New York Mayor Mr Rudolph Giuliani, and in Washington in the administrations of former vice-president Nelson Rockefeller and former president Gerald Ford. His ties to the political, banking and Wall Street communities are believed to have played a key part in his appointment. As president at Time Warner, Mr Parsons will be responsible for many of the day-to-day administrative functions of the group, including the running of all corporate financial activities (with the help of new finance chief, Time Warner senior vice-president Mr Richard Bressler), legal affairs, staff management and corporate communications. In a separate development, Time Warner was expected yesterday to announce the appointment of Mr Danny Goldberg as the new chairman of its Warner Brothers Records unit, the world's largest record company. Mr Goldberg, currently head of Time Warner's Atlantic Records label, is expected to be asked to take over the helm at Warner Brothers.</p>

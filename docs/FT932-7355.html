			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Airlines There are several ways of going global in the airline industry. British Airways' expensive strategy has been to buy minority stakes in other national airlines and develop closer operational links. But the proposed integration of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines Systems, Swissair and Austrian Airlines suggests another way forward. The four medium-sized carriers are discussing how to pool their resources to create a fleet of more than 270 aircraft. This would make the merged airline the second largest European carrier after BA and the seventh biggest in the world. The theory is attractive. The proposed integration, though, would be fraught with operational difficulties making many doubt whether the airline will ever get off the ground. The airlines have declared their determination to set up a jointly-owned company with a unified management and balance sheet. But the trade unions are already questioning which national hubs will suffer as a result. The complexities of unifying operating systems and corporate cultures would be immense. The venture would also have to leap some high regulatory hurdles. Still, SAS is itself the product of the merger of three airlines, and its history highlights the possibilities. If the venture does proceed, BA would certainly face far stiffer competition in Europe. Those with the most to worry about, however, would be Air France and Lufthansa. Both carriers suffer from high operating costs. Moreover, neither has yet charted a viable route to a global future.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Central European Fund 42.4% invested in shares In its first three months of operation the Central European Growth Fund, a Dollars 200m investment trust set up in March by CS First Boston and Cazenove to invest in central European stocks and bonds, has become 42.4 per cent invested in the shares of central European companies and 16.8 per cent in bonds. The remainder is in US money market instruments. Net asset value at June 30 was Dollars 186.9m or Dollars 93.43 per share. The fund's greatest exposure is to Hungarian equities, which account for 18.7 per cent of funds invested, followed by 12.3 per cent in the Czech market, 9.3 per cent in Poland and 1.9 per cent in Slovak equities. In the fixed income department the fund holds 16.8 per cent of its portfolio in bonds issued by central European entities and 16 per cent by western issuers. The fund is one of a growing number of European and US-based trusts attracted by last year's sharp rise in central European share prices. Share prices have since fallen substantially on all the central European bourses following the rise in US interest rates. But with privatisation proceeding apace and private sector growth running at an estimated annual rate of 25 per cent in the three main central European states - the Czech republic, Hungary and Poland - the prospects for medium and long term capital appreciation continue to attract investors.</p>

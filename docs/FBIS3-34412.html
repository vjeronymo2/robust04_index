At the meeting, thanking Iran for her fundamental and wise  policies on Afghanistan, the Afghan delegation said it was a  good example of good-neighborly relations.    Referring to the latest developments in Afghanistan, they  asked Iran to continue her efforts toward the establishment of  peace in Afghanistan.    Referring to the fact that Iran's ambassador would remain in  Kabul, our country's foreign minister said: This shows Iran's  special attention to the events in Afghanistan.    Expressing regret about the continuation of fratricide in  Afghanistan, Velayati said: Iran was considered one of the main  supporters of our combative Afghan brothers during the war with  foreign occupiers, and after the liberation of Afghanistan she  began extensive efforts to halt the civil war there.    He added: Iran would seriously support any proposal by the  warring groups that would end the war and bloodshed in  Afghanistan and bring about a fair and honorable peace.</p>

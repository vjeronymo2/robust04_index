			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EPPLE'S VOTE WAS FOR CONSTITUENTS  </P> <P> This letter is in response to the article by Mark Gladstone concerning  Assemblyman Bob Epple (Times, Sept. 10). The story states that Epple voted  against the ban on semiautomatic weapons. Assemblyman Epple did not bow to the  pressure of the NRA (National Rifle Assn.). He voted the way his constituents  wanted him to vote. Mail and calls concerning the ban to the assemblyman's  office were running 8 to 1 against it.  </P> <P> I don't believe you realize who the NRA is. It is not some mysterious,  behind-the-scenes council that sways lawmaker opinions. It is made up of people  who share like interests, just like sports car clubs or softball teams. We pay  $25 a year dues to belong to this group and have someone in Washington and  Sacramento speak for us just as Handgun Control Inc. pays to have someone speak  for them.  </P> <P> We are not all pot-bellied Uzi toters as another article described us. As a  matter of fact, most of us do not own military look-alikes listed on the ban. I  certainly don't. But I would defend a person's right to legally own and shoot  the gun of his or her choice.  </P> <P> There were over 3 million of us before that maniac, Patrick Purdy (Stockton  schoolyard murderer), came into the picture. But now the membership has grown  by leaps and bounds to a record number because of the issue. That number does  not take into consideration those on the fringe who own guns but do not belong  to the NRA. At last count, there are more than 50 million gun owners in the  United States.  </P> <P> Gov. (George) Deukmejian admitted that the calls and letters against the  semiautomatics were substantially more numerous than those for the ban. As for  how much more, we will never know. His office will not release that  information.  </P> <P> So who is backing the wishes of the people in this fight? Who has their fingers  on the pulse of the people? Mr. Epple and his colleagues in the Assembly who  voted against the ban are the only ones I see.  </P> <P> JOHN GAUDOT  </P> <P> Norwalk  </P></p>

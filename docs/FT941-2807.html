			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Capital Markets: Hongkong Bank restructures its treasury business Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and its investment banking arm Wardley Holdings are pooling their resources in treasury and capital markets operations. The move is designed to boost dealing capacity and better exploit Asia's fast-growing debt markets. Under the restructuring, HSBC's 50-strong team and Wardley's 58 dealers will be brought together in a purpose-built treasury facility in the bank's Hong Kong headquarters. Staff will be hired to bring the total to 150 people by the year-end, with room for a further 100 positions. However, HSBC and Wardley will retain their own balance sheets and legal identities. Hongkong Bank said the growing sophistication of Asian investors, together with the introduction of dragon bonds and new derivative instruments, had prompted it to beef up and restructure operations to meet customer demand and maximise profitability. He said that although Hong Kong had long been an important trading centre for foreign exchange, other aspects of treasury and capital markets business had only recently taken off, especially on the debt-origination side. The new treasury facility will be the nerve centre for the origination, underwriting, distribution and trading of a wide range of debt securities. It will also provide a broad spectrum of interest, currency and index-related swaps and derivatives. It will also embrace the group's existing foreign exchange and money market services.</p>

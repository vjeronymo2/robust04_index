			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALLOUS COSTA MESA  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa City Council has delayed a final decision on a proposed new law  that would give police the power to arrest people they thought "intended" to  solicit employment on the street. It should have simply rejected the idea.  </P> <P> In its frustrated effort to discourage dayworkers from gathering on city  streets, Costa Mesa has been taking increasingly firm and insensitive steps.  The city, which once sought more humanitarian approaches, already has a law  that bans curb-side soliciting of employment.  </P> <P> That ordinance, however, doesn't seem to have solved the problem. Dayworkers  are still congregating on some streets. And obviously police haven't been able  to catch enough of them making the curb-side job requests. So now the council  is thinking of amending its ordinance to allow police to arrest people for  soliciting jobs -- even if officers do not see them actually doing the dreaded  deed. Circumstantial evidence, the proposal implies, will be enough to prove  intent.  </P> <P> One thing missing thus far is a guideline that would define the "intent" that  would constitute the crime. Even more disturbing is the rationale outlined in a  city memo supporting the amendment that reasoned, given the scarcity of police  resources, that it was too much of a burden to require officers to actually  observe a violation before they can make an arrest.  </P> <P> If the city pursues that policy of expediency in other areas, too, we shudder  to think what constitutional shortcuts it could take in making misdemeanor  arrests on unseen acts, merely because the officer thought the suspect  "intended" to violate the law.  </P> <P> And would such a selective amendment to the city's anti-dayworker law put any  Latino on the street in danger of being arrested because police thought he  intended to solicit employment from someone in a car?  </P> <P> It reminds us of the law Santa Ana tried to pass that would have allowed  officers to arrest prostitutes for just being on Harbor Boulevard. A judge  threw that out of court.  </P> <P> Dana Point is taking a far more sensible approach to the problem of dayworkers  gathering on street corners. The city is exploring the idea of setting up a  telephone hot line that would match employers with workers. It takes a new and  possibly more effective tack that could fill the needs of the employers and  workers and clear the streets of the groups of dayworkers that disturb many  merchants and residents. And it is far preferable to Costa Mesa's callous  approach of making it against the law to even "intend" to take to the streets  to find a job.  </P></p>

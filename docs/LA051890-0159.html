			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NURSES GET PRIZES, PERKS AND BONUSES TO TAKE JOBS;  </P> <P> COMPETITION: HOSPITALS AND HEALTH-CARE AGENCIES ARE RESORTING TO A VARIETY OF  RECRUITING GIMMICKS BECAUSE OF A NATIONAL NURSING SHORTAGE.  </P> <P> Sometime this fall, a chauffeured limousine will pull up to South Coast Plaza  in Costa Mesa and out will step a grand-prize winner with $5,000 to start a  four-hour shopping spree.  </P> <P> No, the lucky shopper won't be a radio show contestant or a participant from a  revival of the "Queen for a Day" television show. It will be a nurse from FHP  Inc., a health maintenance organization in Fountain Valley that is rewarding  nurses who recruit others for the company. The winner will be drawn in  September from the names of FHP nurses who bring in new hires.  </P> <P> Since FHP began a new recruitment award program in March, nurses who recruit  their peers have also been eligible for drawings for a camera, a portable  compact-disc player and a VCR. And the company is giving away $500 for every  full-time registered or licensed vocational nurse and $250 for every part-time  nurse.  </P> <P> A severe nationwide nursing shortage is prompting FHP and other health-care  companies and hospitals to pull out the stops. They are offering bonuses of up  to $4,000 for nursing recruits and other bonuses for staff nurses who bring in  new recruits.  </P> <P> The stakes are high. The number of hospital nursing vacancies statewide has  more than doubled from 2,757 in 1983 to 6,770 currently. In Southern  California, 11.5% of full-time positions for registered nurses were vacant in  1988, according to the latest available data from the California Assn. of  Hospital and Health Systems.  </P> <P> The problem has been exacerbated by a four-year decline in nationwide nursing  school enrollments, according to the California Nurses Assn.  </P> <P> As career options for women have expanded, fewer have embraced nursing. At the  same time, demand for registered nurses has grown with the proliferation of  home health-care services and the changing role of hospitals, which are  treating patients who are more acutely ill.  </P> <P> So hospitals are flexing their recruiting muscles, and none more than White  Memorial Medical Center, a 377-bed nonprofit hospital in Los Angeles. In  addition to a $2,000 sign-up bonus, White Memorial offers nursing recruits free  maid service at their homes for a year.  </P> <P> Such marketing gimmicks have drawn mixed response. Critics say they blemish the  professional image of nursing and distract from efforts to increase nurses'  wages and improve their working conditions.  </P> <P> "Gimmicks are not going to solve the nursing shortage. Nurses need more say and  more pay rather than a VCR," said Maureen Anderson, spokeswoman for the  California Nurses Assn., a nurses' union.  </P> <P> The union is pushing for higher salaries for senior nurses, a stronger voice in  hospital policy and the hiring of non-medical staff to perform everyday tasks  that don't require trained nurses, such as transporting patients in wheelchairs  and distributing meals.  </P> <P> St. Joseph Hospital in Orange scoffs at recruitment incentives as mere  gimmickry. "They are all substitutes for salary and have the potential of  preventing salary raises," said Judy Burton, the hospital's vice president of  nursing.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, many hospital recruiters argue that bonuses are effective  recruitment tools.  </P> <P> They say that referral bonuses are a less-expensive way to recruit nurses than  advertising in newspapers or hiring nurses by the hour from private nurse  registries, which supply them for a fee. Registries tend to charge 40% more  than staff nurses at hospitals receive.  </P> <P> Kathy Kelley, manager of professional staffing at FHP, said the $5,000 shopping  spree contest helped make employees aware of the hospital's referral bonuses.  She said 10 nurses have been hired as a result of the promotion.  </P> <P> "In any marketing campaign, you have to have a calling card to draw them in,"  said Beverly Morris, a nurse recruiter at White Memorial in Los Angeles. The  hospital has signed on 35 new nurses since it began offering free maid service  to recruits last October. It has also received numerous inquiries from other  Southern California hospitals that are considering instituting a similar  program.  </P> <P> Morris said the hospital also offers a $2,000 sign-up bonus and $750 to staff  nurses who direct bilingual registered nurses to the hospital, which is located  in predominantly Latino East Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Morris said job applicants are aware of the perks and not shy to ask about  them. "One of the first things they ask is: 'Do you have sign-up bonuses?' "  she said.  </P> <P> "It's not unusual for young nurses today to just move around and get what they  can," agreed Phyllis Fliegel, a nurse recruiter for Kaiser Permanente, Southern  California's largest health maintenance organization.  </P> <P> Kaiser offers $1,000 "finder's fees" to any of its employees who help Kaiser  recruit for hard-to-fill positions such as nurse managers and certified nurse  anesthesiologists. "It works fantastically well," Fliegel said.  </P> <P> Laura Kato, a recruiter at Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim and La Palma  Intercommunity Hospital in La Palma, said she relies heavily on employee  referals. As an incentive, she said, the hospitals pay $1,000 to both a new  recruit and the nurse who made the referral.  </P> <P> Chapman General Hospital in Orange has hired five or six nurses since it began  offering a $2,500 referral bonus 18 months ago. "In a small facility, that  really helps," hospital administrator John Kramer said.  </P> <P> Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach also uses perks to attract nurses. This month,  the hospital doubled its finder's fee from $250 to $500. It also recruits  nurses on a temporary basis from other parts of the country, paying their  transportation and living expenses.  </P> <P> Health-care officials say that wooing nurses is just part of their task.  Equally important, they say, is persuading them not to stray to another  employer who may offer attractive incentives.  </P> <P> During the past couple of years, White Memorial has boosted its educational  benefits for nurses, given them more decision-making power and increased wages,  Morris said. As a result, the hospital's nurse vacancy rate has fallen from  between 17% and 21% to between 10% and 12%.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is retention. Otherwise you will have a revolving door, no  matter what you offer," said David Langness, vice president of communications  for the Hospital Council of Southern California.  </P> <P> Langness said the council advises hospitals that they could save millions of  dollars spent on recruitment ads and marketing ploys if they instead took steps  to increase the number of people entering the nursing profession.  </P> <P> The council has organized a health career information center that, among other  things, points out to job seekers that salaries for Southern California nurses  rose 17% in the last two years. The average annual pay for a staff nurse in the  region now is $35,214, according to the most recent council survey, while a few  nurses with special training and experience make more than $100,000.  </P> <P> Despite a slight increase in nursing school enrollments last fall, many  professional recruiters expect the shortage to worsen as hospitals continue to  compete for nursing talent with other health-care providers.  </P> <P> "I think it will get worse before it gets better," said Ruth Spears, employment  manager at St. Joseph Hospital.  </P> <P> GROWING NURSE SHORTAGE  </P> <P> The number of openings for registered nurses in California hospitals steadily  increased from 1983 to 1988. Figures for 1989 are not available, though most  experts say the shortage continues to be acute. The shortage in Southern  California is estimated to be nearly three percentage points higher than in the  rest of the state.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:2.44IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percentage  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> of Positions  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Number  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Vacant  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> of  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Statewide  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Openings  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1983  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,757  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,517  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1985  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3,374  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5,340  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6,238  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 8.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6,770  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / People: Bruce, from the frying pan into the fire David Bruce, who quit as head of finance and administration for the London Stock Exchange shortly after Peter Rawlins arrived as chief executive, has accepted the same job at an even more troubled City institution, Lloyd's of London. His appointment represents the final step in a process of streamlining of senior management initiated by new Lloyd's boss Peter Middleton. The head of finance, John Gaynor, took early retirement at the age of 57 at the end of last year, and the head of administration, Bob Woodford, retires at the beginning of April at the age of 62 after five and a half years in the job. The two jobs have now been combined, leaving just four senior executives - the other three responsible for regulatory services, marketing services, and systems and operations - reporting to Middleton. Bruce, 46, moves from Guinness Mahon, where he had been finance director since 1990. An old Etonian, his first years in the City included spells at Peat Marwick and Cazenove. He got an early taste of Lloyd's when serving on the Wilson Committee set up in 1977 to review the City. He says he 'mugged up' on the market before it was decided that Lloyd's should be studied by a separate commission. In 1979 he moved to Royal Dutch Shell, ending up as treasurer and controller of Shell UK, before moving to the stock exchange in 1986. Passed over as chief executive, he left shortly afterwards; the finance department was subsequently thoroughly overhauled. Rawlins, chosen in his stead, resigned last week over the Taurus fiasco.</p>

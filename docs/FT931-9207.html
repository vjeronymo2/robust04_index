			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Cyprus talks delay likely MR Glafcos Clerides, who narrowly won the presidential election in Cyprus on Sunday, yesterday said he would ask for a postponement in UN-sponsored peace talks, Reuter reports from Nicosia. On the other side of the divided island, Turkish-Cypriot leader Mr Rauf Denktash said resuming the talks as had been planned next March would be futile. Mr Clerides, the veteran leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally party, beat incumbent Mr George Vassiliou by a majority of 1,998 votes with the backing of the centre-right Diko party, which is unwilling to make concessions to the Turkish Cypriot minority. Mr Clerides said that before peace talks he needed to consult with the Cypriot and Greek political leadership.</p>

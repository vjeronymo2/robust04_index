In a statement today, Dr. Sha'th said 'Arafat will ask  President Husni Mubarak for Egyptian support for the peace  process when they meet in Cairo tomorrow.    He pointed out that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations  to the Security Affairs Committee reached no agreement on the  crossings today. He noted that the Palestinian delegation  submitted a written proposal setting out the points of agreement  and disagreement on the crossings so that the two delegations  would not have to discuss the issue from the beginning every  time and so that the points of agreement and disagreement could  be submitted to the political leaders of the two delegations to  try to resolve them. The Israelis will respond to the  Palestinian proposal tomorrow.    Dr. Sha'th said the Civilian Affairs Committee today  discussed the water issue, saying that it is a difficult  problem, particularly with regard to Gaza, requiring a concrete  solution.    He affirmed that the Palestinian delegation submitted no new  papers or proposals on the crossings in Gaza and Jericho or the  border points between Egypt and Gaza and between Jordan and  Jericho. He said the Israeli concept is that the crossings are  an external security affair. Dr. Sha'th said this is the wrong  interpretation and if they stick to it, it would be difficult to  reach an agreement. He affirmed that the security at the  crossings is a Palestinian and Israeli concern, not only  Israeli. He explained that the crossings to Gaza and Jericho  should be treated differently and that Israeli supervision  should be inconspicuous, because Israel will withdraw from these  two areas rather than the remaining parts of the West Bank.    He noted that Israel still has objections on this issue. And  it has not agreed to place the crossings under international  supervision. Dr. Sha'th affirmed that Israel is anxious about  the results of the Geneva summit between Presidents Clinton and  al-Asad. He said Israel is afraid that the U.S.-Syrian agreement  will put pressure on it, pressure that will again steer the  negotiations toward a comprehensive solution, as UN Security  Council Resolution 242 called for Israeli withdrawal from all  the occupied Arab territories, not part of them. The head of  the Palestinian delegation said that despite the problems and  obstacles facing the Gaza-Jericho Committee, the talks have not  reached a stage requiring intervention by the United States as a  cosponsor of the peace process in the area.

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMNESTY DEADLINE RUMOR SENDS HUNDREDS TO  INS  </P> <P> More than 600 immigrants flooded an Immigration and Naturalization Service  office in Sepulveda Monday morning, mistakenly believing a rumor that today was  the deadline to apply for legal residence status under the amnesty program.  </P> <P> The rumor apparently started last Wednesday afternoon when the San Fernando  legalization office on Parthenia Street ran out of the temporary work  authorization cards issued to illegal aliens who have applied for residency  under amnesty programs.  </P> <P> Because they could not issue work cards, the office stopped accepting amnesty  applications and told prospective applicants to return this week. The office  continued to turn away applicants last Thursday and Friday, said Richard  Walden, chief legalization officer of the Northridge amnesty office.  </P></p>

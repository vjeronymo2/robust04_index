			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Umberto Bossi, Italian Northern League </F> Secretary, by Guido Passalacqua on 26 April; place not given:  "Let Us Not Split the Country in Two"]    [Text] Milan -- On "Milano, Italia" after the great 25  April [Liberation Day] rally, Umberto Bossi met with Achille  Ochetto [Democratic Party of the Left Secretary]. The League  leader very much wanted this meeting to take place, but it was  long delayed, and the event was characterized by a tone of  political detente. This evening Bossi returns to Rome to  negotiate the composition of the next government and related  guarantees with [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and [National  Alliance leader] Fini. Bossi is offering himself as guarantor  of the rights of the opposition within the majority coalition.  On the basis of such a role, he is planning to win a major  success in the negotiations: the granting to the League of the  Interior Ministry, a key position for averting public  disturbances.    [Passalacqua] Mr. Bossi, how did you feel 25 April amid the  catcalls and insults?    [Bossi] On the way there I knew how things would turn out.  On the one hand, there was the anger and dissatisfaction of  those who lost the elections and who were reacting because they  were dissatisfied, and, on the other, there was a kind of  appeal, a love-hate relationship.    [Passalacqua] That is your interpretation of the insults....    [Bossi] What other meaning could there be to their shouts of  "traitor" if not hatred and love? For me that rally was a  political experience.    [Passalacqua] What is the status of the League after 25  April?    [Bossi] The League is the same as before, a movement of the  common people. Certainly not a right-wing movement, a center  movement. The League constitutes the reformist part within the  pole for freedom.    [Passalacqua] Is this the message that you intended to  convey  by attending the rally?    [Bossi] I wanted to indicate that the League believes in the  principle of freedom, even when it is a historical memory.    [Passalacqua] But politically....    [Bossi] We stressed the substantial difference that exists  between the League and the other political forces that comprise  the pole, which must govern because it won the elections --  because this country must have a government. We attended the  rally, accepting all the dynamics that can occur in such a great  rally, in a celebration which has always been managed by the  Left and in which people saw the League joining the defense of  the battle that we waged against the system of party domination,  as a battle similar in kind to that waged by the partisans.    [Passalacqua] Was it a provocation, in the best sense of the  word?    [Bossi] We participated in the event. But some people felt  provoked: It was not our intention to provoke, but people  perceived our presence almost as something sacrilegious. But  how did people respond? With both love and hatred, because  everyone knows that the League is not fascist.    [Passalacqua] Some people interpret both your attendance at  the rally and your debate with Occhetto as the start of a  flirtation between the League and the Left.    [Bossi] We are experiencing a situation in which things are  unclear. We have a first-past-the-post electoral system which  tends to divide the political spectrum into two poles. But the  fact is that it is impossible to divide it into two, even if  this is what the election results say: The first-past-the-post  system should exclude the losers from a whole range of  opportunities which were hitherto shared among all the parties,  in accordance with the rationale of consociation. It is not  easy to move onto something new; there is no magic wand. To  say, "Winner takes all," could be dangerous because those who  are excluded could take politics into the streets. A  confrontation could result, if mediation proved impossible or if  no willingness were displayed to perform at least some mediation  in parliament.    [Passalacqua] So this is the League's new role.    [Bossi] The capacity for mediation and centrality; in other  words, to democratize the Right, and to liberalize the Left.    [Passalacqua] Speaking with Occhetto, you stressed the  League's role as guarantor and mediator with respect to the  progressive opposition. Is there a rapprochement.    [Bossi] It was a public explanation, an important  explanation. We had not spoken for three or four months. And I  also consider it important that we were there at the rally while  Fini was in church and Berlusconi was at home.    [Passalacqua] Occhetto explicitly asked you to provide a  guarantee of democracy for the opposition forces with regard to  your role within the majority.    [Bossi] We must talk not in terms of spoils sharing, but in  terms of areas -- for instance, with regard to RAI [state radio  and television service], the Anti-Mafia Committee, and the  watchdog committees. The danger of the opposition's being  nullified is normal in countries where the first-past-the-post  system is established; here it is not normal.    [Passalacqua] What inviolable barriers are there with  respect  to your allies?    [Bossi] With regard to the National Alliance, we say "no" to  any resurgence of fascism.    [Passalacqua] What about the next prime minister?    [Bossi] It is impossible to accept the idea of a prime  minister that at the time of the establishment of the new  government assigns himself a temporary role as interior  minister: That reminds me of Benito Mussolini.    [Passalacqua] So is the first barrier the Interior Ministry?    [Bossi] It is certainly the most delicate issue at present.    [Passalacqua] What if Forza Italia and the National Alliance  do not accept your suggestion of a League member as interior  minister, as guarantor and mediator with respect to the  opposition forces. What will happen then?    [Bossi] Why do you want to make me fight right away? I say  that they will have to give me clear and convincing  explanations. It is an important issue and deserves immediate  attention. The alternative is to separate local government from  the Interior Ministry. But it is Berlusconi's powers that are  the real problem.    [Passalacqua] Powers even outside the government, such as  his  role as a businessman....    [Bossi] I do not say that a businessman cannot engage in  politics, but I do emphasize with regret that there is no  antimonopoly law in this country.    [Passalacqua] Is this the watchdog that is being discussed?    [Bossi] But who will monitor the watchdog? It is the  ordinary judiciary that can constitute the sole guarantor. The  real guarantee is for the League to control certain ministries  -- the Treasury Ministry, which holds the purse strings, and the  Interior Ministry. This is the political guarantee; the other  is the monopolies committee.    [Passalacqua] What can you say about the Mediobanca  [Financial Credit Bank] affair?    [Bossi] I am worried: Mediobanca is one of the country's  masters.</p>

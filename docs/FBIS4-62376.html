			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Dubinin, acting Russian minister of </F> finance, under the "Economics" rubric: "The State Budget  Reflects the Policy of Financial Stabilization"]    [Text] Following the State Duma's discussion of the draft  federal budget, which has been finalized with due regard for  deputies' comments, not even prejudiced observers must have any  complaints against the government. All suspicions and rash  accusations that the government is prepared to abandon the  policy of financial stabilization under pressure from sectoral  and regional lobbyists are refuted by dry figures.    We propose that the federal budget deficit will amount to  68.8 trillion rubles [R] this year and that it will not exceed  9.5 percent of GDP. At the same time the expenditure part of  the budget is increasing by R10.1 trillion -- which, in toto,  will give R193.3 trillion. The increase in revenue will be a  more modest R3.7 trillion -- which, in the final analysis, will  amount to R124 trillion.    These key indicators speak for themselves. Whether we will  manage to consolidate our hold on these positions and not blow  the budget to pieces with new "expenditure" decisions is another  matter. But the draft's discussion in the State Duma and the  assistance given us by deputies in the course of its correction  make me confident that we have managed to arrange businesslike  cooperation and work fruitfully on common problems.    Of course, it is impossible to reach a consensus that  satisfies everyone without a search for sensible compromise  solutions acceptable to both sides. In working on the draft  budget, the Ministry of Finance endeavored to take the deputies'  valid demands into consideration as far as possible. We agreed  that the structure of expenditure must be shifted toward an  increase in the size of funding for the agro-industrial complex,  industry, and the social sphere. For example, cultural and  health care establishments will receive an additional R968.4  billion. Appropriations to support the mass media (particularly  television and radio broadcasting) will increase by R434  billion. One percent of personal income tax will henceforth  remain at the disposal of the local authorities.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Australian immigration boost Senator Nick Bolkus, federal minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, said yesterday Australia was likely to increase its intake of immigrants in the next few years, Nikki Tait reports from Sydney. Sen Bolkus declined to quantify the increase, although he indicated the rise would be fairly modest and reflect the improving economic situation. 'I can't say the numbers. . . all I will say is that I think we're getting to a stage where we can look at a moderate increase in our programme,' he said. In 1992-93, Australia's migrant intake fell to its lowest level for almost a decade, with 76,330 people entering the country. This compared with 107,391 in the previous year.</p>

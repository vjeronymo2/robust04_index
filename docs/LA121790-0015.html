			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> THEY HAVE TO CATCH RAIDERS NOW;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: L.A. CLINCHES FIRST PLAYOFF BERTH SINCE 1985 AND TAKES OVER FIRST  PLACE WITH A 24-7 VICTORY OVER THE BENGALS. JACKSON MAKES THE BIG PLAY AGAIN.  </P> <P> A backup cornerback without a shoe contract took Bo Jackson down from behind  Sunday, turning hordes of fact-finders into part-time genealogists, but it  wasn't enough to keep the Raiders from making quick work of the Cincinnati  Bengals, 24-7, or re-introducing themselves to the playoffs for the first time  since 1985.  </P> <P> For the Raiders, commitment to excellence is reality again after four lost  seasons, and the exclamation marking the end of their suffering was cause for  celebration before 54,132 at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> The news in Kansas City, where the Houston Oilers upended the Chiefs, made for  some nice window dressing. The Raiders didn't merely clinch at least a  wild-card berth with Sunday's victory, they jumped a full game ahead of Kansas  City into first place in the AFC West with two games remaining.  </P> <P> "It's a great day for the organization, and it's a great day for this football  team," Raider Coach Art Shell said afterward.  </P> <P> It was, too, another great day for Jackson, who leads the league in  news-per-carry. Sunday, it was an 88-yard, third-quarter display during which  Jackson started left, changed direction, hurdled quarterback Jay Schroeder, and  broke free down the right sideline, with only grass and air separating Jackson  from the goal line.  </P> <P> It seemed nothing without a motor would catch Jackson, but Bengal cornerback  Rod Jones, subbing for the injured Lewis Billups, stalked Jackson stride for  stride and tripped him up at the one-yard line.  </P> <P> "I don't understand why he didn't make it to the end zone," Shell said later.  "I told him he must be losing a step."  </P> <P> Jackson's run led to a one-yard scoring pass from Schroeder to tight end Ethan  Horton with 9:07 left in the quarter, putting the game out of reach at 24-7.  The Raiders, in fact, mistakenly issued in the third quarter a news release  about the purchasing of playoff tickets. It presumed a Raider victory. Turns  out it wasn't that much of a reach.  </P> <P> Bengal quarterback Boomer Esiason gave it the old college try with a bad groin.  He threw a fluky touchdown pass to give his team a quick 7-0 lead, then faded  from the scene. Esiason aggravated the injury on a 21-yard scramble in the  second quarter and that was pretty much it. Esiason would be removed for good  in the third quarter, as Coach Sam Wyche looked ahead to next week's AFC  Central showdown against Houston, which could mean the division title.  </P> <P> "I'm upset," Wyche said. "I don't like to lose. But next week is where it's  at."  </P> <P> So why not sit back and watch a Bo show? Everyone else was.  </P> <P> "Let's face it," Esiason said. "He's probably the world's greatest athlete. Our  defense, I thought, did a whale of a job shutting him down. He just made a  great play. He's just hard to stop."  </P> <P> Jackson has proved to be quite mortal on most plays, but those 88-yarders tend  to boost your average. Jackson gained 117 yards in eight carries against the  Bengals. Last week in Detroit, it was 129 yards in 18 carries, which included a  55-yard scoring run. The week before in Denver, it was 117 yards in 13 carries,  but 62 of those came on one run for a touchdown.  </P> <P> But what of the man who tracked down Bo Jackson? Actually, Jones entered the  contest with all the right credentials for the task. A former first-round draft  choice of Tampa Bay who didn't work out there, Jones was a track star at  Southern Methodist University, winning the NCAA 400-meter championship in 1984.  </P> <P> Was it a fair race? Well, Jones had to leap the attempted block of Schroeder  before giving chase of Jackson. Jones thought he had a chance.  </P> <P> "I mean, if I didn't think I could get him, I should have just stopped right  then," Jones said later. "Bo is a fast man. You just have to be a fast man  also."  </P> <P> Jones said he and Jackson chatted briefly after the game.  </P> <P> "He asked did I run him down," Jones said. "I said I have to do my job, that's  all."  </P> <P> Jackson seemed happy enough simply to extend one of his two-sport seasons.  </P> <P> "It's the first playoffs ever in any sport," he said. "I'm anxious to see what  happens."  </P> <P> The Raiders weren't thinking playoffs on the first drive, when Esiason drove  the Bengals quickly down field and lofted a pass into the end zone that was  intended for Eddie Brown. Brown didn't catch it. Instead, teammate Tim McGee  stepped in front and completed a 41-yard scoring play.  </P> <P> You don't draw them up like that.  </P> <P> The Raiders tied the score late in the quarter on a five-yard scoring pass to  the once-forgotten Tim Brown, capping a 27-yard drive that was made possible by  linebacker Riki Ellison's interception of a deflected Esiason pass.  </P> <P> Schroeder and Brown hooked up again in the second quarter on a 44-yard scoring  play to put the Raiders ahead for good.  </P> <P> The Bengals threatened only once more, late in the half, but an Esiason pass  into a crowded left corner of the end zone was intercepted by cornerback Terry  McDaniel.  </P> <P> Jeff Jaeger added a 39-yard field goal with 45 seconds remaining to give the  Raiders a 17-7 lead at the half.  </P> <P> The Bengals weren't much of a match, really. Esiason was injured. All-Pro left  tackle Anthony Munoz was forced out of the game because of a shoulder sprain.  Running back Ickey Woods didn't carry because of bad ribs, although he did  catch a pass for two yards. Cincinnati started without corner Lewis Billups and  safety Rickey Dixon because of injuries.  </P> <P> Still, the Bengals pulled out the usual tricks. Twice, they lined Esiason out  as a receiver, bad leg and all, using receiver Lynn James as a quarterback in a  shotgun formation.  </P> <P> Raider corner Lionel Washington followed Esiason to the flank, not sure what to  expect.  </P> <P> Giving up a big play to a one-legged quarterback playing receiver has its  obvious drawbacks.  </P> <P> "You look stupid," Washington said.  </P> <P> Washington didn't look stupid because Esiason didn't do anything other than act  as a very expensive decoy.  </P> <P> With the playoffs resolved, the Raiders can set their sights higher. Victories  over Minnesota and San Diego in the next two weeks and the Raiders win the AFC  West title.  </P> <P> It's not enough being wild cards?  </P> <P> "That's for the birds," defensive tackle Bob Golic said. "We're in control as  long as we keep winning. There's nothing better than opening the paper and  seeing 'Raiders' on top of the division chart."  </P> <P> That, or watching Rod Jones chase Bo Jackson.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> After going 20 quarters without a touchdown pass, the Raiders' Jay Schroeder  now has thrown six in the past two weeks. Schroeder completed 10 of 20 passes  against Cincinnati for 163 yards and no interceptions. Bengal quarterback  Boomer Esiason completed seven of 17 passes for 134 yards before giving way to  backup Erik Wilhelm with five minutes remaining in the third quarter. Esiason  had one touchdown pass and threw two interceptions. . . . Remember Marcus  Allen? He carried 14 times for 39 yards.  </P> <P> * TIM BROWN: Forgotten man catches two touchdown passes, giving him three in  two games. C15.  </P></p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Buy-outs fall to seven-year low MANAGEMENT buy-out activity plunged to a seven-year low in the third quarter of 1993 with just seven large deals of Pounds 10m or more being completed. This compares with 14 deals in the second quarter of this year and 15 in the third quarter of last year, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants. Buy-out activity was also depressed in terms of the value of deals, falling to Pounds 360m from Pounds 740m in the preceding quarter and Pounds 430m in the same quarter of last year. In the first nine months of the year the number of deals fell sharply but the value was slightly higher than in the same period last year. Thirty buy-outs valued at Pounds 1.56bn were completed between January and September compared with 45 deals worth Pounds 1.49bn in the same period last year. Mr Chris Beresford, Peat Marwick's head of buy-outs, said that one reason for the decline was the increased time it took to complete a deal. He added: 'Deals are taking twice as long to consummate as we normally expect.' Venture fund managers who finance buy-outs have also been busy arranging to sell or float the ones they backed in previous years and have little time for new deals. Record numbers of companies backed by venture capital have obtained stock market listings this year. The high stock market ratings enjoyed by many companies makes them reluctant to sell subsidiaries or divisions by means of a buy-out at lower price/earnings ratios than their own because this would reduce their own capital value. In addition, some potential vendors expect an improvement in the trading performance of subsidiaries and are waiting for this to emerge before disposing of them, Mr Beresford said. The largest deal completed in the third quarter of 1993 was the Pounds 192m buy-out of the Eurodollar car rental business from the TSB banking group.</p>

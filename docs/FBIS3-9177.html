Kostic report: "Farmers' Apprehensions"] </F>   [Excerpts] The second springtime sowing under the  international sanctions has started, with much apprehension  being felt among the farmers.    It seems that the primeval fear of heaven's (dis)favor is  the  least present among them, because other hardships accompanying  their work are as just difficult and dangerous.    According to the adopted balance of energy supplies, it is  necessary to provide around 120,000 metric tons of oil for the  farming work that should be carried out in the first half of the  year. In happy times that amount would be no problem. Now,  because of the unprecedented embargo imposed on Yugoslavia, the  importation of oil derivatives, except meager amounts through  the black market, has been made totally impossible, while the  home manufacturers are hardly capable of meeting one fourth of  the needs. [passage omitted]    When some 400,000 tractors spread out over the 2.5 million  hectares in late March and early April, any delay in supplying  them with oil could be fatal, because for farmers time is of the  essence. There is no second chance for those who miss the best  time for sowing, provided that the weather is favorable as well.    Last fall over 300,000 hectares were sown with wheat. Thanks  to the mild "poor people's winter," as farmers put it, crops  have welcomed the first warm days in quite a good condition, but  now mineral fertilizers are needed to boost nutrition. However,  it is well-known that there is a shortage of fertilizers. The  importance of reinforced nutrition is shown by the fact that one  kilogram of fertilizer quintuples the wheat yield. [passage  omitted]    The sowing of sugar beet is in full swing, but few people  believe that the 100,000 hectares that farmers are hoping for  will be sowed with that plant. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, Nikita </F> Yermakov and Igor Shchegolev]    [Text] Paris June 8 TASS -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said on Wednesday that the Partnership for Peace  programme has a role to play in building a unified Europe.    Meeting journalists at the Russian Embassy in Paris on  Wednesday, Kozyrev said Russia wants to see cooperation with  NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises. "Our cooperation with  NATO has certain peculiarities because Russia differs from other  countries in size, army strength and influence and is a nuclear  power," he continued.    He said that military problems must not dominate the world  agenda any more, otherwise it could lead to the  re-militarisation of political relations in Europe.    The Russian minister called for holding a new meeting of the  foreign ministers on Bosnia as soon as possible. It is  necessary to hold it "within the next week or two" as proposed  by President Boris Yeltsin in order to move closer to a  political settlement of the conflict.    On the domestic front, Russia said it would send a  peace-keeping contingent to Abkhazia within the next few days.  Kozyrev said this decision has nothing to do with the imperial  policy or irresponsibility. This is a normal policy of a  responsible country which closely cooperates with the United  Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE) to settle regional conflicts, he added.    Seeking to play a greater role in world politics, Russia has  been actively engaged in the preparations for the upcoming G-7  summit meeting to be held in Naples in July. Kozyrev said that  the dialogue in Naples will consist of two parts. One will deal  with Russian economic reforms and Russia's relations with G-7.  It will be held in the seven plus one format.    The other one to be held in the G-8 format will allow the  leaders of eight countries to discuss jointly, on equal terms,  large problems of world politics, particularly Bosnia, the  construction of a united Europe and the upcoming session of the  CSCE heads of state and government to be held in Budapest at the  end of the year, Kozyrev said.    The Russian foreign minister has already met with U.S.  Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown to discuss bilateral  cooperation between Russia and the United States. He called for  the soonest possible elimination of the vestiges of the cold war  hampering business partnership between Russia and the United  States. The meeting was part of the preparations for a session  of the Russian-U.S. joint commission on trade and scientific  and technical cooperation to be held in Washington. The  commission is co-chaired by Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice-President Al Gore.</p>

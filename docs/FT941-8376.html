			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Elizabeth David auction There can be few homes among the dinner party classes without an Elizabeth David cook book. For the generation after 1950 she brought a little Mediterranean sunshine into the British kitchen. On Tuesday you can bid for the pots and pans in which Elizabeth David created her recipes. The contents of the kitchen of the most influential cookery writer of the century are to be sold at Phillips Bayswater auction house. David, who died in 1992, threw little away and stayed faithful to traditional utensils. The sale consists of almost two hundred lots, ranging from basic items, such as spoons and rolling pins (estimated at up to Pounds 30 each) to more personal mementoes, such as hand written recipes which never made the books.</p>

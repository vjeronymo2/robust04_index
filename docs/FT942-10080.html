			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Italy's new government With the swearing-in yesterday of Mr Silvio Berlusconi at the head of its 53rd postwar government, Italy has truly entered uncharted waters. Not only is the new government uncomfortably low on political experience, as was only to be expected after a general election in which voters decisively threw out representatives of the old political order. It is also led by a man who has yet to resolve the conflicts of interest between his business empire and his political role, and comprises bedfellows whose heterogeneity and distaste for one another were underlined by the opera buffa of coalition haggling over the past six weeks. Most eye-catchingly, perhaps, it is the first government since the war to contain representatives of a party, the MSI, that has not repudiated links with Italy's fascist past and that is not committed to all Italy's international treaties. Another coalition member, the Northern League, has in the past come close to advocating the break-up of the country. Small wonder that President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro took the unprecedented step of publicly warning the new prime minister to respect Italy's international obligations and alliances and to maintain its national unity. Yet the real reason to worry about Mr Berlusconi's creation is not that it summons echos of a relatively distant past. It is that it may prove incapable of dealing with the challenges of the present - paramount among them the economy, still in the early stages of a fragile recovery and burdened by a mountainous public debt. On the face of it, the new government offers some reassurance on this score in the shape of Mr Lamberto Dini, plucked from the Bank of Italy to run the Treasury. But even he is something of a political novice - and his is but one voice in a coalition dominated by competing power-brokers. Moreover, he will be only too well aware of how the most powerful broker of all won election: on the basis of tax-cutting and job-creating promises that were, to put it charitably, over-optimistic. Were Mr Dini to be forced into trying to deliver Mr Berlusconi's false dawn, he would be putting at risk the project of economic renewal painfully initiated by the Amato and Ciampi governments of the past two years - and with it, Italy's financial credibility. Their brave battle against swelling budget deficits merely contained the problem rather than resolving it: already there has been disturbing slippage in spending and receipts, with the result that the deficit this year will be close to 10 per cent of GDP notwithstanding the relief afforded by falling interest rates. Similarly, the two previous governments may have begun the lengthy process of privatising state enterprises, but the really difficult parts of that task still lie ahead, and the new coalition is beset by confusion as to how to proceed. Mr Berlusconi should use his first speech to parliament to junk his campaign rhetoric in favour of a firm statement of economic intent, with discipline in public finances and rapid privatisation as top priorities. As a newcomer to politics with a strong mandate, he can afford to be radical in this direction. If he instead tries to please those who believed his election promises, Italians will discover that the new order for which they thought they voted is no better than the old.</p>

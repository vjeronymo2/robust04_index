			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: TWA reduces net losses to Dollars 8m Trans World Airlines, the US airline struggling to avert a financial crisis, yesterday reported that cost-cutting had enabled it to reduce net losses in its third quarter to Dollars 8m from Dollars 61.7m. However, Mr Robert Peiser, chief financial officer, said it was still 'crucial' that the company should win approval for the sweeping financial restructuring plan that it put to creditors last month. TWA, once one of the world's best-known airlines, went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992. It emerged in November 1993, but has not reported a net profit since. At its annual meeting yesterday in St Louis, Missouri, TWA told shareholders that it had turned the comparable period's operating losses of Dollars 34.5m into operating profits of Dollars 33.8m this time - the first operating profit recorded by the company since the third quarter of 1990. Mr Jeffrey Erickson, chief executive, said cost-cutting and productivity improvements were behind the turnround. Unit costs, expressed in cents per available seat mile, had fallen to 8.66 cents from 9.23 cents in the comparable period. However, Mr Erickson said the company was still being dragged down by the cost of servicing its debts. Interest expense was Dollars 49m in the last quarter alone, and had totalled Dollars 146.3m so far this year. Last month TWA announced a rescue plan under which creditors were asked to swap Dollars 800m of the company's Dollars 1.8bn worth of debt for new equity. If the rescue plan succeeds, TWA believes it will be able to survive the lean winter months and return to profitability next year. However, many creditors believe they would get a poor deal under the restructuring plan and are threatening to oppose it. If the plan fails, TWA will quickly run out of cash and will almost certainly have to file for some form of bankruptcy protection again.</p>

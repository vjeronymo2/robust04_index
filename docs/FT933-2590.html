			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (11): Bankers strike pot of gold - As the pace quickens, John Thornhill reviews the privatisation bonanza FACED with the pressures of rising budget deficits and the demands of ageing populations, governments around the world are feeling the squeeze. Many have hit on the same solution of privatising state-owned assets to plug the gaps in their nation's balance sheets. Last year, about Dollars 70bn was raised from such sales. With enormous privatisation programmes under way in western and eastern Europe, Latin America and the far east, the pace of privatisation will only quicken. For merchant bankers, this process represents a huge pot of gold. Not only will governments pay bankers fat fees to help prepare companies for flotation and trade sales; integrated banks will also win a slice of the action through distributing shares to overseas fund managers. As well as the short term financial bonanza, bankers believe they may gain substantial long term benefits. Helping to privatise companies will enable banks to forge closer corporate relationships, perhaps resulting in mergers and acquisition work. One of the biggest and most attractive privatisation programmes is being launched in France. The Balladur government is committed to transferring at least 21 companies to the private sector over the next five years. More than Dollars 50bn of corporate assets are likely to be brought to the market, increasing the capitalisation of the Paris bourse by as much as one-fifth. The world's leading merchant bankers are busy flaunting their wares to the French government. The bulk of the work, though, seems likely to be won by French banks. Since the first wave of privatisation in 1986-88, French banks, such as Societe Generale and Paribas, have grown in size and sophistication, building up their international distribution networks. But there may be rich pickings for foreign banks with a strong presence in the US and the far East, in particular. Prominent among them is Goldman Sachs. Mr Sylvain Hefes, the first French partner of the US investment bank, believes Goldman Sachs can play a big role in the privatisation programme. The bank has been developing its presence in Europe over many years, advising on UK privatisations and, recently, helping to place shares in Repsol and Endesa of Spain. In France, it has been developing a high profile presence in the mergers and acquisitions field. Last year, for example, it advised - somewhat controversially - Assurances Generales de France about its purchase of a 25 per cent stake in AMB of Germany for Pounds 422m. Mr Hefes believes that US fund managers will have a keen appetite for the shares of French privatisation stocks. Many of those to be privatised are well known, world class companies such as Rhone Poulenc and Elf Aquitaine. US fund managers are relatively underweight in the French market and eager to increase their exposure to markets outside the US. Moreover, Mr Hefes argues that Goldman Sachs is the natural partner for US companies seeking investments in France. He points out that French companies have invested four times as much in the US as their US counterparts have done in France. Over the past few years, however, Goldman has advised Emerson Electric about its Pounds 290m acquisition of Leroy-Somer and helped the US drugs group Bristol-Myers Squibb buy a stake in UPSA. 'We have a dominant position in the world's equity market and we can also help develop partnerships, restructurings, joint ventures and strategic alliances,' Mr Hefes says. Mr Jacques Mayoux, former chairman of Societe Generale who acts as an adviser to Goldman Sachs in Paris, suggests that privatisation will have wider economic implications, increasing the role of the market in France. This is likely to produce greater industry rationalisation, leading to more focused groupings. 'Companies are going to have to think more in financial terms. They will have to consider how to pay dividends and how to present themselves to the market. After that, they may have greater flexibility to win market leading positions in different product areas, selling some assets and buying others,' Mr Mayoux says. He believes many French companies will also develop more international alliances along the lines of Renault's link-up with Volvo. This, of course, all means lucrative work for investment banks. Yet Goldman Sachs will probably take years to establish itself fully on the French financial scene. It has just 20 staff in Paris - although more bankers work on French projects from its European headquarters in London. Moreover, the French government is notorious in defence of national banking institutions. Given the presumed role of 'Anglo-Saxon speculators' in humiliating the franc, it may prove especially sniffy about US and UK banks.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MORGAN STANLEY'S ESTIMATE OF EUROPE'S PRIVATISATION CANDIDATES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                     Govt                                                  Holding         Value Country   Company               Industry      % of Co.

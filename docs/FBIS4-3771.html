			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ming Man] </F>   [Text] Chief Secretary Anson Chan left for the United  States last night on a week-long visit to lobby for the renewal  of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) status. Mrs Chan, on her  first official visit to the U.S. since becoming Chief Secretary,  said again that if trade sanctions were slapped on China, Hong  Kong would be the loser. "We have done some assessment of the  harm to our economy that this might do and our assessments  indicate that if MFN was withdrawn then our economic growth will  be halved and our unemployment rate will be trebled," she said.    The United States has already indicated that it could impose  limited trade sanctions on China unless its record on human  rights improves by June. During her visit, Mrs Chan is  scheduled to meet senior U.S. officials including Acting  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Treasury Secretary Lloyd  Bentsen. She is also seeking a meeting with U.S. Vice-President  Al Gore.    Mrs Chan dismissed claims that by fighting for China's  renewed MFN status, Hong Kong was disregarding human rights.  "There are probably no people anywhere on this earth who are  more concerned with human rights than people in Hong Kong,  particularly with the reversion of sovereignty of power to China  in about three years' time," she said. Mrs Chan repeated the  Hong Kong government's view that improving China's economy would  help improve the human rights cause. "We see for ourselves, for  example in Guangdong, that because they enjoy economic growth  they now have more choices. They are far freer, I would say,  than people elsewhere in the interior of China. Obviously  that's the way to go." Mrs Chan said an alternative way to  achieve an improvement in China's human rights record was to  keep discussing and pushing the human rights question while  maintaining trade relations.</p>

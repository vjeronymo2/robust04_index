			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Israeli Hypocrisy," the  newspaper TISHRIN editorial says: The world is awaiting a  positive UN Security Council [UNSC] stand condemning the heinous  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, providing for protection of  Palestinians under occupation, and underscoring the foundations  of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Meanwhile,  Israeli officials have been making a flood of statements,  demanding the immediate resumption of the negotiations, as if  the massacre did not take place, as if the settlers problem has  been resolved, and as if there are no longer any threats to Arab  lives.    TISHRIN adds: Israeli officials have leaked reports to the  effect that they have disarmed only two settlers. We should  remember that the population of Zionist settlers in the occupied  territories stands at 150,000. The settlers, who are armed to  the teeth, have not concealed their determination to persist  with their murders, sabotage, and massacres. This shows the  immense deception in which the Israeli officials are engaged, as  well as the immense disregard in which they hold the  international community.    The paper notes the Israeli officials' zeal for the  resumption of their stalled talks with the Palestinians. The  paper maintains that this reflects their fears over the future  of the Oslo and Cairo accords. This is because the two accords  have, practically speaking, given Israel a free hand in the  occupied Arab territories, and consecrated fully the Zionist  domination of affairs there.    The paper says: The two accords provide for security  arrangements, as well as a redeployment of Israeli troops to  protect settlements. By contrast, these accords have failed to  include any provisions regarding the protection of Palestinians  from the attacks of settlers or the Israeli Army.    TISHRIN believes that the Israeli demand that Syria declare  commitment to just and comprehensive peace is a clear  manifestation of Israeli hypocrisy. The paper reiterates that  Syria, through President al-Asad, has repeatedly declared such a  commitment. Moreover, Syria repeatedly saved the Washington  talks from collapse, and made repeated calls for a true peace in  the Middle East. However, Israel has lent deaf ears to these  calls. It has done all it can to blackmail the Palestinians and  push them toward a separate deal that neither realizes the  Palestinian people's aspirations, nor meets the requirements of  the desired peace in the region.    Concluding its editorial, the paper urges the UNSC, which is  continuing its debate on the Hebron massacre, to uphold the  principles enshrined in the UN Charter and prove the credibility  of the world community by dotting the i's and crossing the t's  and condemning settlement activities as a policy, approach, and  practice.    In a commentary published today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH  addresses the savage practices the Israeli occupation  authorities are perpetrating against the Palestinians of the  occupied Arab territories, saying: Since the Hebron massacre,  Israel has been enforcing a military siege against the occupied  West Bank and Gaza Strip, isolating their residents from the  outside world. It has clamped a curfew on some 2 million  Palestinians, and given its troops a free hand to spread fear  and terror throughout the occupied territories. These troops  have perpetrated murders, repression, and terrorism that are no  less heinous or hideous than the Hebron massacre.    The paper adds: What has taken place, and is currently  taking place in the occupied territories has failed to move the  conscience of the international community. To date, no punitive  measures or actions have been taken to make Israel halt its  bloody repression. Nobody has asked Israel to lift the curfews,  which have turned the lives of hundreds of thousands of people  into an intolerable inferno due to the acute shortages of food  and medical supplies.    AL-THAWRAH goes on to say: The reactions to the Hebron  massacre have been confined to useless condemnations and  denunciations that cannot prompt the Tel Aviv rulers to halt the  savage practices being perpetrated by their troops and settlers.    Concluding its commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: If it is really  concerned about security and stability in the Middle East, and  if it wants the peace process to achieve its objectives, the  world community must urge the UNSC to adopt a firm and decisive  resolution providing for the dismantlement of settlements in the  occupied territories, and for protection of Palestinians. Such  a resolution must make Israel do all that needs to be done to  promote the cause of peace.</p>

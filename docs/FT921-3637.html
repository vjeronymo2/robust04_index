			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pressure on margins cuts Blagden to Pounds 11m BLAGDEN, the packaging, chemicals and protective equipment group, yesterday reported a 17 per cent fall in profits after a year of pressure on operating margins. The company joined the swelling ranks of those unhappy with the current UK rules on advance corporation tax. It had an insufficient mainstream UK corporation tax liability and was forced to write off double the amount of ACT this year - Pounds 1.05m - compared with 1990, boosting the tax rate from 33 per cent to 38 per cent. Pre-tax profits in the year to December 29 1991 fell from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 11.1m on sales almost unchanged at Pounds 218.3m. The group's interest charge rose from Pounds 2.03m to Pounds 2.81m, despite a fall in gearing from 38 per cent to 36 per cent, because the group capitalised less interest associated with the building of a chemicals plant. It also borrowed European currencies and made deposits in the UK where interest rates were falling. Earnings per share fell from 19.6p to 14.8p and the group proposes to pay a final dividend of 5p, maintaining the total for the year at 9.5p. At this level the dividend is 1.6 times covered by earnings. On the packaging side - the group's most important division - Blagden announced it had bought a 50 per cent stake in a Belgian company that had developed a patented spray propellant using compressed air rather than CFCs and inflammable compounds. Mr Cameron Smith, the chief executive, said the group's pan-European business would cushion the slower-than-expected recovery in the UK and meant the outlook for 1992 was 'comparatively encouraging'.</p>

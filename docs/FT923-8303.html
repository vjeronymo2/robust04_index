			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Central banks step in to halt dollar's decline CONCERTED intervention by the world's leading central banks yesterday halted the dollar's decline but failed to give the US currency much of a lift. As many as 15 central banks bought dollars for D-Marks in what appeared to be a determined effort to establish a floor for the US currency. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's policymaking central council, said in Frankfurt that the buying was initiated by the US Federal Reserve. The intervention began as the dollar was falling towards DM1.461 in quiet lunchtime trading in Europe and continued during the afternoon. Analysts thought the central banks, which included the Bundesbank, the Bank of England and the central banks of France, Switzerland, Italy, Canada and Spain, bought more than Dollars 500m altogether. The intervention, however, was less effective than the most recent bout of concerted official support on July 20 when a similar number of central banks bought Dollars 400m at about DM1.447. Yesterday's action pushed the dollar up quickly by about 1 1/2 pfennigs, but it later slipped back to stand at DM1.4670 in late New York trading, while in Tokyo early today it opened at DM1.46575. July's intervention lifted the dollar by 5 pfennigs. A US Treasury Department official said the action was a sign that the US and other members of the Group of Seven industrial countries did not wish the dollar to depreciate. But statements by other policymakers gave less support to the US currency. The dollar softened after Mr Gaddum said there was no firm dollar exchange rate that the Bundesbank would commit itself to defend through intervention. Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary, was quoted by news agencies as telling a political gathering at Scottsdale, Arizona, that the US did not have a policy to cheapen the dollar. But any support provided by this remark was offset by Mr Brady's later statement that there was 'no reason why (US) interest rates shouldn't be lower'. Analysts speculated that the Fed intervened to prop up the dollar for fear it could start a free fall if it dropped through its previous record low of DM1.443, set in February 1991. There are few signs of inflationary pressure in the US but such a decline could harbour risks for the future. Of more pressing concern could be the fragile state of world equity markets. In the past week, Wall Street has fallen, while Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average has dropped to levels last seen in early 1986. Yesterday, it closed at 14,822,56, down 243.78. This morning share prices edged higher, with the Nikkei up some 50 points in initial trading. The intervention boosted European equities. German shares rose in after-market dealings, while in London, the FT-SE 100 index closed at 2,309.6, down 16.1, but well up on the day's low. In New York the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 6.48 at 3,331.10.

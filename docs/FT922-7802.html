			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / India outlaws Tamil Tigers India has outlawed Sri Lanka's separatist Tamil Tigers guerrillas, whom it blames for the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, Reuter reports from Colombo. Indian Home Minister Shankarrao Chavan described the Tigers, once armed and trained by India, as a threat to the 'sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country'. The Tigers turned against Mr Gandhi after he sent Indian troops in 1987 under a peace accord with Colombo to end more than four years of armed rebellion for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority.

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Somalia peace mission fails Mr James Jonah, the UN Under Secretary General, returned empty-handed from the war-torn Somali capital Mogadishu last night without any guarantees to prevent further bloodshed, writes Julian Ozanne in Nairobi. Mr Jonah met General Mohamed Farah Aideed but was prevented from meeting rival warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed because of fighting. He said Gen Aideed had ruled out UN attempts to broker a reconciliation between the two warring factions, rejected any foreign military or peace keeping force entering the city, even for purely humanitarian objectives, and refused to make any formal agreement for a cease-fire.</p>

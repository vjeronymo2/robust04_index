			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP "summary" of an interview with Foreign Minister Han </F> Sung-chu by unidentified ROK correspondents based in Washington  on 17 February]    [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is visiting the  United States, said in an interview with ROK correspondents  based in Washington on 17 February: "Today I had important  talks with Mickey Kantor, secretary of the Office of the United  States Trade Representative; Spero, undersecretary of State for  economic affairs; Tarnoff, undersecretary of State for political  affairs; Assistant Secretary of State Gallucci; and Assistant  Secretary of State Winston Lord. We exchanged views on ironing  out opinions to prepare for the third round of talks between the  United States and North Korea and also on South-North dialogue."  The following is a summary of the interview:    [Reporter] Will the nuclear inspection have to be completed  before the third round of talks between North Korea and the  United States is held?    [Han Sung-chu] Yes.    [Reporter] Did the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  side make compromises to some degree?    [Han] No. North Korea accepted all necessary measures in  guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards. The special  [tukbyol] inspection issue will be dealt with at the third round  of talks.    [Reporter] Even though North Korea accepted the nuclear  inspection, has the situation not turned back to that of last  March?    [Han] The situation has not changed greatly since last  March.  However, at that time the situation then was worsening while  currently the situation is improving to some degree. I believe  that the past situation will not be repeated.    [Reporter] What is your view on the issue of deploying  Patriot missiles and the issue of suspending the Team Spirit  exercise?    [Han] The issue of suspending the Team Spirit exercise will  be ironed out when North Korea receives the inspection and the  South-North dialogue is resumed. The United States and the ROK  agreed that the issue of deploying the Patriot missiles will not  be discussed until the IAEA holds its Board of Governors  meeting. The military needs for the two countries will be  examined.    [Reporter] Is there not a dispute between the ROK and the  United States regarding this matter?    [Han] It is a fact that the United States positively  examined the request by the commander of the U.S. Forces in the  ROK for the Patriot missiles. Since North Korea accepted the  nuclear inspection, it is not known whether Commander Gary Luck  will make the same request or take measures that will be in  harmony with our side's military assessment. The deployment  itself has not been decided upon yet.    [Reporter] When do you think that South-North dialogue will  be carried out?    [Han] There is a great possibility that North Korea will  respond to the dialogue. There is a possibility that the  dialogue will be held in the near future.    [Reporter] Which do you think was effective in the process  of  North Korea's accepting the nuclear inspection, dialogue or  pressure?    [Han] We were not going to wait forever to hold a dialogue.  The position of the United States and the ROK from the beginning  was to depend on another method if it became impossible to  resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue. North Korea did not  change its mind on accepting nuclear inspection but it was a  measure it had been planning to take in advance.    [Reporter] Are rumors that Kim Chong-il was in an accident a  false report?    [Han] There were such rumors but it has not been confirmed.  I believe that such rumors were spread because he did not  attend his birthday celebrations.    [Reporter] Please tell us about your dialogue with Secretary  Kantor.    [Han] I clearly told him that the rumors that those who  bought foreign-made cars would be subjected to a tax  investigation are not true. In connection with the issue of  protecting intellectual property, there is great possibility  that Korea is excluded from the priority watch country list on  intellectual property violations. The plan to expand NAFTA is  being examined by various countries, including the United  States. The establishment of relations with NAFTA is being  analyzed from various angles, such as that of an associate  membership, rather than selecting one alternative. It seems  that its framework will be revealed sometime in the middle of  this year.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Finance And The Family: Broker caps home loans until 1995 - News in Brief BROKER John Charcol is offering a 'cap and droplock' mortgage at a rate of 10.25 per cent (11.6 per cent APR) capped until August 1995, one of the longest capped rates available at present. Each July, borrowers will be given an option to switch to a competitive fixed rate. Loans must be not more than 85 per cent of the property's value, and repayment mortgages are not available. If borrowers do not want to take out building and contents insurance linked to the policy, there is a higher capped rate of 10.5 per cent. There is also an arrangement fee of Pounds 295, but only Pounds 95 is payable in advance and the balance can be added to the mortgage. Early-redemption penalties are three months during the capped period and one month thereafter.                         *      *      * Capital Home Loans is offering a three-year fixed rate mortgage of 10.20 per cent (APR 11.4 per cent). It is available for repayment and endowment mortgages. Customers who also take out CHL's building insurance get a one-year discount of 0.21 percentage points, giving them a first-year rate of 9.99 per cent. There is a penalty of three months' interest for redemption during the first three years. CHL is also offering five-year fixed-rate mortgages at 10.35 per cent (11.4 per cent APR). Building insurance is compulsory. Early-redemption penalties are the equivalent of five months' interest during the first three years. In both cases there are arrangement fees of Pounds 295, which can be added to the loan.                         *      *      * Latin American Securities, a subsidiary of Foreign &amp; Colonial, has launched a Luxembourg-based Sicav (an open-ended fund similar to a unit trust) specialising in Latin American equities. The launch follows on from the success of the Latin American Investment Trust, the best-performing such trust of 1991, and of country-specific Sicavs managed by LAS. The Argentinian Sicav has risen 237 per cent since its launch in February 1991, and the Mexican Sicav is up 241 per cent since it was established in November 1989. The argument in favour of Latin America is that the region has had widespread economic and political reform and appears committed to free-market capitalism. Economic growth rates are higher than in the developed world, which should lead to faster corporate earnings growth. But pessimists would argue that, after the recent sharp rises in share prices, the markets could be due for a correction. The Latin American Sicav has a single pricing structure and the minimum investment is Dollars 5,000, on which there is a commission payment of 5 per cent (the equivalent of the bid-offer spread on unit trusts). There is also a redemption fee of 1 per cent for those who sell within a year, and 0.5 per cent after that. The annual management fee is 2.25 per cent.                         *      *      * Midland Bank is reducing interest rates on its accounts. The net rate on the Orchard current account is being cut to 1.88 per cent from 2.27. On the Meridian current account, the net rate on balances under Pounds 1,999 goes down to 2.62 per cent from 3.04. On the Meridian savings account, the net rate is now 5.02 per cent (down from 5.58 per cent) on balances between Pounds 2,000 and Pounds 4,999. On Orchard savings accounts, the rate on the same balance is now 4.66 per cent (down from 5.21). The Tessa rate has been cut to 9.5 per cent from 10.00. Lloyds Bank is also cutting rates. The net rate on its Classic account is now 0.75 per cent on balances between Pounds 1 and Pounds 1,000, and 1.5 per cent on balances between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 5,000. On its gold account, balances between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,500 will pay a net rate of 2.63 per cent; the rate on balances between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 5,000 is a net 4.35 per cent. The Lloyds Tessa rate is now 9.5 per cent.                         *      *      * Those searching for fee-based advice in the north-east of England have a new service on offer: Fimbra member James A. Clancy of Ovington, Northumberland (0661-835-130). Clancy is linked with Adams &amp; Nevile Asset Management, an IMRO member, for investment management purposes.                         *      *      * National Counties Building Society, which has long offered one of the best rates on its Tessa, has cut the rate to 12 per cent. This, though, is still 2 percentage points above base rate. Meanwhile, the Woolwich Building Society has cut its savings rates. The net rate for its Prime Gold account on balances between Pounds 500 and Pounds 9,999 is now 6 per cent (5.79 on monthly accounts). The society's Tessa rate is 9.75 per cent on balances between Pounds 25 and Pounds 2,999; 10.75 on Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4,799; and 10.85 on amounts above Pounds 4,800.</p>

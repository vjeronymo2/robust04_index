			<p>BFN     [Text] Nice, France, May 4 (XINHUA) -- China has expressed  reservation about linking policy issues to a capital increase of  the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Chinese delegation to the  ADB's 27th annual meeting said here today.    The vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, Zhou  Zhengqing, heading his country's delegation to the ADB's annual  board of governors meeting in Nice, outlined China's views on  the bank's program and policies in the 1990s.    Zhou said that his government has always actively supported  the ADB's capital increase and made unremitting efforts for its  fourth general capital increase.    But China "has to express great regret over plans to link  policy consideration to capital increase" which were raised  during the ADB's recent talks, he added.    Zhou believed that as economic backwardness is the  fundamental cause of poverty, environmental problems and sexual  discrimination in the developing countries, the ADB should make  economic development a top priority and gradually furnish these  countries with the resources and capabilities to resolve these  issues.    "Rigidly linking projects to solutions of some social  problems is detrimental to supporting the economic growth of the  ADB's member countries and eventually harmful to social  progress," said Zhou.    Pointing out that China appreciates the ADB's efforts to  improve the quality of loan projects, he noted that the key lies  in increased cooperation between the ADB and those countries  offered loans.    He declared that China would, as always, strengthen  cooperation with the ADB and learn from other states who had  loans from the bank.    "China also appreciates the ADB's efforts to push the  economic development and social progress of its member  countries," said Zhou.    However, he called for the ADB to heed the specific  situations of its members in promoting its policies and  strategies on poverty alleviation, environmental protection,  raising women's status, populations and protecting forests.    He said that the ADB's policies and strategies in the above  fields should be sufficiently adaptable and flexible and be easy  to accept and implement.    Zhou also called on the ADB to make greater contributions to  the economic boom and social development of the Asian-Pacific  region.    In the last few years, he explained, loans and technical  assistance from the ADB had supported China's reform, its  opening up to the outside world and economic development, thus  helping to ease the restrictions on China's economy from  bottlenecks like energy, transportation and communication.    He said that with the global economy growing at a slow pace  in the past year, the economic growth in the Asian-Pacific  region had maintained a high speed increase of seven percent,  accelerating global economic recovery and development.    "This is mainly a result of the reform, structural  readjustment and open economic policies promoted by the  Asian-Pacific countries and regions based on their own  situations," he added.    The ADB's three-day meeting, which began yesterday, is  scheduled to focus discussion on how to improve ADB-funded  projects and properly handle the relationship between economic  growth and social issues.    Founded in 1966 the ADB is a governmental international  financial organization aimed at promoting Asian-Pacific economic  development and cooperation.    So far, it has provided loans totaling 47.7 billion dollars  for 1,179 projects.</p>

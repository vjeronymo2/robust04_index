			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Yeltsin renews push for early elections THE Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, yesterday stepped up his campaign to force parliamentary elections, announcing a two-month strategy to oust the existing, conservative legislature. At a press conference held to celebrate the second anniversary of the failed coup, Mr Yeltsin said parliament was blocking the economic reforms made possible by the victory of pro-Yeltsin forces in August 1991. But Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of parliament and one of Mr Yeltsin's most bitter opponents, vowed that early autumn elections will not take place. The existing Russian constitution makes no provisions for calling a poll before the current legislature's mandate expires in 1995.</p>

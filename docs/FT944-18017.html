			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Company News: Molson prepares to join Chinese brewing venture Molson, the Canadian brewing, retailing and special chemicals group, is expected to announce today that it is moving into China with a 'significant investment'. Molson Breweries, the brewing unit, is expected to take a stake in a joint venture established earlier this year by Foster's of Australia and the Hong Kong conglomerate Wheelock to set up breweries in China, where beer demand is growing at 20 per cent annually. Molson Breweries is 40 per cent owned by Molson, 40 per cent by Foster's and 20 per cent by Miller, a unit of Philip Morris of the US. Molson would not provide details last night, but a spokesman said: 'An agreement has been signed that is very significant both for China and for Molson Breweries' future.' Mr Philip Koven, analyst with Richardson Greenshields Canada in Toronto, said the deal would be 'very important for Molson Breweries' international growth, though the results may take some time to show'. In the first quarter ended June, Molson overall had net profit of CDollars 32.3m (USDollars 24.1m), or 55 cents a share, down 12 per cent from CDollars 36.8m, or 62 cents, a year earlier. Sales were CDollars 754m against CDollars 772m. Molson Breweries' sales improved with strong exports to the US but profits were only slightly higher because of Canadian beer price wars. Mr Marshall Cohen, president, said earlier this year that Molson would seek further international brewing expansion.</p>

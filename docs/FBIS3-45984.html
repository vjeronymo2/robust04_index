			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 18 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan Tuesday  [18 January] said ties between Taiwan and Thailand have been  cordial and will continue to develop.    In 1993, he noted, Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$1  billion with Thailand, whose economy has grown substantially in  the past decade. If the growth continues, Thailand will soon  join the ranks of newly industrialized countries, he added.    Currently, he pointed out, both countries are working on an  investment guarantee agreement, whose draft proposal was  exchanged last February. In addition, the two sides are  expected to sign a pact to avoid double taxation later this  month.    The premier made the remarks while meeting with Marut  Bunnak,  speaker of the Thai House of Representatives and president of  the Thai National Assembly.    Marut, leading a 14-member parliamentary delegation, arrived  in Taipei Monday for a six-day visit.    Lien told the Thai speaker that about 50,000 Thai workers  are  working in Taiwan, making up the largest group of foreign  laborers. Thai laborers have made contributions to Taiwan's  economic development, Lien said.    Moreover, he noted, Taiwan investors channeled US$4.4  billion  into Thailand as of August 1993 and Taiwan residents made about  500,000 visits to Thailand each year.    This is solid evidence of the close relationship between the  two countries, he said.    The Thai senator [title as received] was accompanied during  the visit by Director P.Y. Teng of the Foreign Ministry's East  Asian and Pacific Affairs Department as well as Edmund Y. Liu,  representative of the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in  Thailand.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Corruption curbs Czech crackdown: The country has yet to set up an intelligence service untainted by the former regime Four years after the revolution that swept away communism, the Czech republic is stepping up efforts to co-operate with western intelligence and police agencies in the struggle against international arms and drugs smugglers. However, the Czechs have yet to establish an intelligence service that is reliable and untainted by the former regime. As a result, there is concern that inexperience, slack controls and corruption are severely constraining the drive against organised crime. A new Czech intelligence service (BIS) was established at the end of last year, in the second reorganisation of the security services since the revolution. BIS has particular links with Britain's MI5 and MI6, as well as with Germany's BND. It has also forged ties with the international police organisation Interpol. Co-operation is taking place with Moscow, too. Last May, Mr Yevgeny Primakov, director of the Russian foreign intelligence service, paid a discreet visit to Prague in an attempt to improve contacts. However, former employees of the secret police (StB), many of whom still work in the Czech security services, are believed to be using their connections and access for illicit purposes. Two months ago Mr Vaclav Benda, chairman of the Christian Democratic party (KDH) termed as unacceptable the presence of roughly 65 former StB employees in the reorganised BIS. Several cases of illegal bugging - notably, within Justice Ministry offices  -and the theft and sale of classified Interior Ministry information have been reported in recent months. Among scandals involving former StB agents, the most notorious is an alleged attempt to blackmail Mr Viktor Kozeny, head of one of the country's largest investment funds. The alleged blackmailer, who is currently standing trial, is said to have used information gathered by the StB in his attempt to extort money from Mr Kozeny. Since the fall of communism, illicit activities of all kinds have proliferated. They include money laundering, extortion, drugs running, racketeering, prostitution, and trade in weapons, explosives, radioactive materials, stolen cars and pirated videos. White collar or economic crimes have also risen exceptionally quickly, growing 75 per cent in the first nine months of 1993 compared with the same period in 1992, according to Czech police statistics. Large quantities of Semtex explosive destined to be sold on the black market have been seized by Czech police since the spring, and several weapons caches have been found. Before the revolution, the former Czechoslovakia was among the world's 10 largest exporters of weaponry, ranging from tanks to small arms. Large amounts of weapons were left behind as Soviet troops withdrew following the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact military alliance.</p>

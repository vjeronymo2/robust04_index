			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Mellon Bank sees a mutual advantage - Richard Waters looks at the background to the US bank's takeover bid for Dreyfus There was only a limited time that US banks could have afforded to stand aside from the boom in the mutual fund business. The twin forces of rising stock and bond markets and falling short-term interest rates have sucked cash out of bank deposits: at current growth rates, mutual fund assets will exceed bank deposits in the US before the end of the decade. The near-Dollars 2,000bn that Americans have in mutual funds is already roughly equal to 80 per cent of the cash they have in the bank. Banks which have tried to break their way into the business have made rapid progress in the past year, but from a very low base. In the middle of this year, PNC Bank and BankAmerica each had around Dollars 20bn in assets under management, compared with Dollars 10bn at NationsBank and Dollars 5bn at Chase Manhattan, according to research by Lipper Analytical Services. In all, banks account for only an estimated 8 per cent of the total mutual fund business. Faced with such a position, a bank takeover of a mutual fund group seemed likely before long. Most commercial banks' shares are trading at high levels after the recovery of the past year, even after the correction in bank stocks since October. This has made it possible for banks to contemplate using their own paper to buy fund groups without facing a big earnings dilution, even at a time when the mutual fund industry is at a peak. Even so, Mellon predicts its earnings per share growth will be held back by 9 per cent next year as a result of the acquisition. If completed, Mellon's acquisition of Dreyfus, which accounts for 4 per cent of the mutual funds business, will catapult it ahead of other banks. It could also hasten a rush by others to buy a stake in the fund industry - though there is a shortage of publicly-held funds groups to target. Most of the leading companies are either privatively-held - like Fidelity Investments, the industry leader with Dollars 226bn under management at the end of October (up 35 per cent on a year before) - or part of brokerage groups. Merrill Lynch, with Dollars 116bn, ranks third, behind the privately-held Vanguard Group. This helps in part to explain Mellon's choice of Dreyfus, which has missed out on the mutual fund explosion over the past year. Dreyfus made its name in the 1970s with an aggressive push into money-market funds, a bias that has remained. Around 44 per cent of its fund assets are in short-term money markets, compared with an industry norm of only some 25 per cent. As investors have rushed out of money market instruments and into long-term equity and bond funds, Dreyfus has scrambled to catch up. But its assets under management at the end of October had fallen to Dollars 76.7bn from Dollars 81.2bn a year before, according to figures compiled by the Investment Company Institute. If US interest rates increase faster than the modest rise predicted by many market analysts for the first quarter of next year, then Dreyfus' fortunes could change quickly - and Mellon's purchase would look a lot smarter. Mr Howard Stein, Dreyfus chairman and chief executive, has been consistently cautious about the stock market's boom. It is a policy that was proved correct in September 1987 when, in an interview with Forbes magazine, he explained his reasons for not investing Dreyfus' own money in buying investment firms. 'Everything goes full circle,' he warned then. For Mellon, meanwhile, the Dreyfus deal represents the clearest sign yet that the Pittsburgh-based bank is emerging strongly from the credit problems which threatened to engulf it at the end of the 1980s. Under chairman Mr Frank Cahouet, Mellon has made a bold move into fee-based businesses far removed from its traditional commercial lending base. Earlier this year, it acquired the Boston Company from Shearson, making it one of the US's largest custodians. The Dreyfus deal will take its assets under management to Dollars 215bn. Its reliance on net interest income will fall still further: after the deal, 52 per cent of revenues will come from fee-based businesses, Mellon says. The Mellon move is likely to intensify the interest of regulators and other policy makers in the implications of a full-scale bank invasion of the mutual fund business. Mr David Hale, an analyst at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, questions whether 'the US will create a new form of universal banking in which banks supply the corporate sector with equity and long-term debt financing through new mutual fund affiliates, not just their traditional lending departments'. That would throw open again the question of how the banks are regulated, and by whom - at just the time when the Clinton administration has begun a tentative initiative to unify the fragmented regulatory framework that already applies to commercial banks.</p>

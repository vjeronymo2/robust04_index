U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has scheduled a  press  conference at 2 P.M. Tuesday (4 A.M. Wednesday Japan time) to  announce results of a U.S. probe into allegations by major U.S.  cellular phone maker Motorola Inc. of unfair competition in the  Japanese market. U.S. press reports said Kantor has decided to  initiate sanctions.    Japanese Ambassador to Washington Takakazu Kuriyama said he  has told the United States that Japan would take the issue to  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if Washington  took punitive action on the matter. The move, which is outside  the so-called "framework" trade talks, marks Washington's first  trade action against Japan following the collapse on Friday [11  February] of trade negotiations aimed at reducing Japan's global  trade surplus.    Washington has complained that sales in Japan of Motorola  cellular phones have been markedly smaller than those made by  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.    The U.S. Government may levy higher tariffs on Japanese  cellular phone imports in line with the 1974 Omnibus Trade Act.  U.S. trade laws also allow the government to impose retaliatory  tariffs in fields other than telecommunications, such as on  autos and auto parts.    In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura warned  Washington on Tuesday against "taking unilateral retaliatory  action," saying such a move would close the door to dialogue  between the two nations.    A senior official at the Japanese Ministry of International  Trade and Industry said he believes sanctions by the U.S. would  be counterproductive, arguing that would ultimately hurt U.S.  manufacturers.    If the U.S. raises tariffs on Japanese auto parts, a move  possible under U.S. trade law, it would affect U.S. automakers  and even trigger possible layoffs in the U.S. auto industry, he  said.</p>

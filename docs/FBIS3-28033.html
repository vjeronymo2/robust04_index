			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- The Chairman of "the  Democratic Liberal Party", Kim Chong-pil, at a press conference  Tuesday said that the deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles in  South Korea "actually presents no problem" because they are  "defensive weapons", according a to radio report from Seoul.    It is only too clear that the projected deployment of  Patriot  missiles in South Korea practically means an extremely grave  development that will frustrate the DPRK-USA talks for a  solution to the nuclear issue and increase the crisis of war in  the Korean peninsula.    Kim Chong-pil's treacherous balderdash clearly proves how  persistently the puppets are trying to bring weapons of  destruction into South Korea.    His outcry is no more than a shameless sophism to justify  the  criminal acts of the puppets in hastening the deployment of  Patriot missiles in South Korea.    The South Korean puppet clique must immediately stop their  reckless provocative moves to aggravate confrontation and  tension between the North and the South by deploying missiles.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham While most drugs stocks have been enjoying a minor recovery SmithKline Beecham is suffering a run of bad luck. The threat to its membership of the FT-SE 100 index is bad for sentiment, although there is scant evidence that the exclusion of a company from any index has much bearing on the performance of the shares. The US Food and Drug Administration's reluctance to approve a weak form of Tagamet, SB's biggest selling drug, for sale as an over-the-counter medicine is more serious. Time lost establishing a presence in the US consumer market carries a cost. Tagamet's US patent expires at the end of next year, so generic competition is already looming. Since marketing costs eat into profits in the early years of an OTC product, the delay makes it less likely that consumer earnings will fill the gap as prescription sales are eroded. The FDA has questioned Tagamet's efficacy as a heartburn remedy rather than its safety, so SB may yet win a swift and favourable decision. But that cannot be taken for granted. The FDA ruled against nicotine patches earlier this year because it could find no conclusive proof of their benefits. Still, the rigour of the US regulator will not alter the trend towards OTC medicines. Asking patients to pay for non-essential medicines dovetails with other efforts to contain government spending on healthcare. While profits on prescription drugs are being squeezed, margins of around 15 to 20 per cent on mature OTC products can no longer be ignored.</p>

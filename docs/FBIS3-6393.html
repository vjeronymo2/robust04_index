The officials of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry  said the next regular telecommunication talks between the  ministry and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission are  slated in Tokyo this summer. They said, under the current legal  systems in Japan, such services as telephones are regulated by  telecommunication law, while services like cable television are  controlled by broadcasting law. Legally, an organization can  operate in both fields.    Providing multimedia services -- a combination of both  telecommunications and broadcasting -- is therefore allowed to  any company except for organizations like Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT), KDD [Kokusai Denshin Denwa] and Japan  Broadcasting Corp. (NHK). Yet, the officials said, new  regulations have to be considered in actual multimedia services,  including ways to control privacy.    Meanwhile, the U.S. Government, pushing for an advanced  communication technology called information superhighway, is  apparently considering changing laws which now prohibit  organizations to operate in both telecommunication and  broadcasting fields, the officials said. Japan therefore wants  to suggest that this issue be taken up in the next talks so the  two nations can adjust respective legal systems regarding the  advanced telecommunication field, they said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Polluters Warned of Criminal Penalties"] </F>   [Text] In the latest move to stem pollution at its source,  the central government is urging local authorities to take stern  legal and economic action against violations of State  environmental laws and regulations.    Individuals and companies that pollute the environment will  face economic penalties, and serious cases must be prosecuted,  said Song Jian, State Councillor and Director of the State  Council's Environmental Protection Committee yesterday in  Beijing.    In a speech marking World Environment Day, Song pointed out  that the discharge of pollutants into the environment violates  both public ethical standards and State laws. It harms the  basic interests of all people and their offspring. He said it  was a crime similar to smuggling narcotics or marketing fake  medicine.    Song stressed that environmental protection must be based on  legislative administration accompanied by scientific and  technological advancement and economic development.    He also urged greater publicity to raise environmental  awareness.    One step in this direction will be taken on Wednesday, when  nine government ministries will jointly launch a TV programme of  lectures on China's environmental legislation at China Central  Television Station, Song said.    Commemorative activities were held throughout the country on  the global day, whose theme was "one earth, one family."    The Zhongwei Sand-Fixation Forest Farm in Northwest China's  Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region received national focus, since it  was honoured as one of the "global 500" projects by the United  Nations' Environment Programme (Unep).    Since 1987, 16 individuals and units in China have won the  title, which commemorates contributions to environmental  conservation.    For the past three decades, the farm has successfully  protected the railways from Baotou in the Inner Mongolia  Autonomous Region to Lanzhou in Gansu Province. In addition, it  has turned 280,000 hectares of desert and sandy land into oasis  and farmland.    The forest farm's techniques have been copied in other  provinces and autonomous regions, as well as foreign countries.    Also yesterday, the National Environmental Protection Agency  (NEPA) and the All-China Women's Federation jointly sponsored a  national meeting on Women and the Environment in Beijing.    One hundred women were praised for their contributions and  achievements in the country's environmental protection work.    Participants drew up a National Environment Declaration for  Chinese Women, which called upon women throughout the country to  devote themselves to global action against pollution and to  preserve the ecological balance.    The declaration says that Chinese women--comprising one-10th  of the world population--should take responsibility for the  sustainable development of the global environment.    The day also featured the opening of a three-day  China-United  States seminar on environment surveillance administration and  technology.</p>

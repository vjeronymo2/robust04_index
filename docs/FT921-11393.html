			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour highlights southern marginals - Housing MARGINAL seats in the south of England were targeted yesterday by Labour in a move to bring home to voters the effects of the Conservatives' policy on house prices over the past four years. Publishing a survey of house prices in 30 towns, Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, said it showed 'there is rightly a very substantial feel-bad factor running right through the very marginal seats that the Tories are desperate to defend'. Labour highlighted the fall in house prices in Mr John Major's Huntingdon constituency and Mr Norman Lamont's Kingston seat since the end of 1987 - by 28 per cent and 19 per cent in cash terms. The opposition offensive marks a renewed effort by Labour to point up the difficulties faced by people in the south-east under the Tories, after a Tory onslaught on the impact of Labour's tax plans on earners in London and the south-east. It also comes after Labour's national executive committee approved plans for an elected, strategic authority for London. Other areas where Labour highlighted the difficulties of homeowners were the north-west and the Midlands, which saw rises of more than 40 per cent in the numbers of court repossession orders made in 1991, and which contain a number of marginal Tory seats.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Assisted status 'sought for areas hit by defence cuts' THE GOVERNMENT is trying to gain assisted area status for parts of southern England affected by defence industry cuts in a last-minute addition to its proposed aid map, a leading Labour MEP said yesterday. Some coalfield closure areas in Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire have also been proposed as additions following European Commission objections last week to 15 areas the British government wanted to include, said Mr Wayne David, MEP for south Wales. Mr David claimed parts of London and the south, including Great Yarmouth, Southend, Dover, the Isle of Wight and Torbay were among currently non-assisted places included on the draft map discussed last week by Mr Tim Sainsbury, trade minister, and Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner. Mr David, who is also vice-chairman of the European Parliament's regional policy committee, said yesterday that he understood the government had since 'whittled down' the 15 to about six and added others. The map is based on travel-to-work areas. Mr David said the draft map also split up some of these areas - a precedent which is likely to be controversial in non-assisted areas where the overall jobless rate masks unemployment blackspots. The long-awaited map, which entitles companies in qualifying areas to grant aid, is expected to be made public next week. Mr David attacked the government's proposed inclusion of south-coast areas. He said: 'They are more concerned with the political nature of such actions than responding to economic necessity.' He claims that currently non-assisted areas that the government wanted switched to full or intermediate status are Mansfield, Thanet, Folkestone, Deal, Whitehaven, Ashfield, Isle of Wight, parts of London, Clacton, Southend, Chesterfield, Hastings, Torbay, Pontefract, Harwich, Ilfracombe, Great Yarmouth, Dover and Dewsbury. Areas suggested to be upgraded from intermediate to full development status are Fishguard, Forres, Haverfordwest, Kirkcaldy, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Areas suggested to fall from full status to nothing are Corby, Lampeter and Aberaeron. Areas suggested to be downgraded from full status to intermediate are Dundee, Cardigan, Shotton, Dumbarton, Neath and Port Talbot, Wrexham, Pontypridd, Flint and Rhyl and Abergavenny. Areas suggested to fall from intermediate status to nothing are Darlington, Newport, Doncaster, north Cardiff, Telford and Bridgnorth, Rochdale.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hall Engineering doubles to Pounds 3.75m with help of associates HALL ENGINEERING (Hold-ings) yesterday announced more than doubled first-half profits and joined the growing list of companies to offer an 'enhanced' scrip dividend to save cash and reduce its tax bill. The Shrewsbury-based steel stockholding, construction products and engineering group lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.55m to Pounds 3.75m as operating profit rose by one-third, the share of associated company profits jumped by two-thirds while the interest charge fell by one-third. Earnings per share jumped from 2.27p to 8.2p. The record Pounds 3.2m (Pounds 1.96m) profit from associated companies - almost all of which came from the four companies in Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong - served to highlight Hall's tax poser. As profits derive predominantly from overseas it is less able to offset its ACT liabilities. Hall is to accelerate the dividend payment by making an interim pay-out of 6.48p (3.3p) and, as an alternative, offer shareholders new shares based on an enhanced figure 50 per cent above the interim cash dividend. These shares can be sold to Kleinwort Benson at a minimum guaranteed price. Mr Richard Hall, chairman, said that if the scrip dividend was fully subscribed, the company would save Pounds 2.5m from not paying the dividend nor the related ACT. On a pro-forma basis earnings per share would improve by 2.1p and gearing would be lower by 8 percentage points. Hall's move, timed to pre-empt any possible Budget measures, comes as UK profits mount an impressive recovery, which will reduce the amount of ACT that the company has to write off. In steel stockholding, a deficit of Pounds 108,000 in the first half of last year was turned into an operating profit of Pounds 366,000 this time. 'There is much more stability in the market and we are having much less trouble getting our margins', said Mr Hall. The BRC steel reinforcement business, strengthened by new management, posted an operating profit of Pounds 117,000, compared with a Pounds 659,000 loss. In contrast, profits fell in the engineering division from Pounds 1.91m to Pounds 1.05m. This reflects a Pounds 500,000 provision for 90 redundancies at the Stadco pressings business, and a loss of Pounds 300,000 in Stadco's automation business, where profits on some important long-term contracts have yet to be booked.</p>

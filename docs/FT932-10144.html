			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Whale-watching nets big cash SOME 4m people a year pay to lean over the rail of a boat and scan the waters for Moby Dick, according to a UK government discussion paper. The report estimates that whale-watching - one of the latest temptations for tourists - is worth more than Dollars 300m (Pounds 190m) a year. It argues that whale-watching could be worth much more than killing whales for meat. The figures, prepared with environmental groups, have been published as part of this week's fierce campaign by anti-whaling countries and environmental groups to stop the IWC lifting its present ban on commercial whaling, as Japan and Norway want. The report says that in the early 1980s whale-watching, mainly confined to North America, raised only about Dollars 4m a year. But since 1981 revenue from the excursions - including whale-spotting from aircraft - has grown at an average of 49 per cent a year. North America has by far the greatest number of whale fans: the US collected more than 60 per cent of the estimated Dollars 320m worldwide revenues in 1991. Japan and Norway, which have observed the IWC ban since 1987, earned an estimated Dollars 3.8m and Dollars 1.6m respectively. In Norway's last year of commercial whaling its catch of 387 whales made the country only NKr13m (Pounds 1.23m).</p>

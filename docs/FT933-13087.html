			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Business and the Environment: A clearer path through the numerical maze - Designers need a simple method of assessing green criteria European companies tend to put the cart before the horse when it comes to making their activities environmentally cleaner. Only a small part of their efforts goes towards ensuring that their products are designed from the start to meet 'green' criteria, as well as be attractive and useful. Yet designers can make a positive contribution to environmental improvement. Despite accusations that its members tend to encourage consumption and built-in obsolescence, the design profession appears keen to help create greener products. Designers are well positioned to advance the cause of environmentally responsible industry, since they appreciate consumers' moods and have the ear of manufacturers. Their problem has been the tidal wave of data on the environmental impact of the many materials that designers use - 200 types of plastic alone. Designers are poor at making sense of all this. 'Industrial designers are not trained to interpret information that is presented in a scientific way,' according to Paul Burall, author of Green Design. Yet these data are vital for life-cycle analysis (LCA), emerging as the common practice for assessing the environmental impact of manufacturing options. Current waste management practices do not generally consider the manufactured product itself as part of that waste. This anomaly shows up in LCA. There is a growing belief that manufacturers should take responsibility for their products' environmental impact after sale. Germany, for example, plans legislation that will force manufacturers of electronic consumer goods to take back their products and ensure recycling. One difficulty is to insulate often innumerate designers from the tedious arithmetic of LCA for each material they may want to use. Just as designers seldom do the stress calculations that ensure their product will not fall apart, so they should not be personally responsible for the green calculations, according to Phil Seeney of the PA Consulting Group. For complex projects, the answer may lie in product development teamwork in which an LCA expert joins forces with engineers and designers. Meanwhile, the emphasis is on giving designers a foolproof ready reckoner for routine use. One programme aimed at developing a common LCA methodology called Milion has been developed by the Eindhoven-based European Design Centre and funded by the Dutch National Reuse of Waste Research Programme. In a pilot project, six companies volunteered to design or redesign a product according to Milion's criteria. The results show that 'environmentally elegant' products that use fewer materials and energy are possible for the same or lower production costs, a finding of interest to industries that too readily dismisses greening as an additional expense. In Sweden, companies, including ABB, Electrolux and Tetrapak, are participating in a national programme for ecological product development. The key to their system's workability lies in the calculation of an 'environmental load value' for each material or manufacturing process choice. This value is calculated as the product of an 'environmental index' and the quantity of material or energy. Each environmental index is calculated from a detailed LCA. Designers can thus use a simple constant and do not become embroiled in the theory and mathematics of the LCA itself. The technique can be used to compare the relative merits of steel or aluminium car body parts, for example. It takes into account the energy needed to extract the two materials as well as the quantity of material required to form the component, and the energy consumption of the car in use in both cases. Philips, the Dutch electronics concern, has established an even simpler points system for the various materials and processes its design department might use. Each material has its figure of merit; there is another figure for the degree to which that material is from recycled sources; others for additives, glues and finishes; and still others for various manufacturing processes. The designer simply tots up the relevant figures. Results are approximate but still useful, for example enabling comparison of environmental criteria between different countries where Philips has the option of manufacturing a product. It is important that the data be quantitative but also simple, says Philip White, in charge of environmental design research at Philips Corporate Industrial Design Centre. 'Limited use of numbers is fine with designers. But with engineers anything that doesn't use numbers is suspect.'</p>

			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Bob Quinn, vice president and general manager of the New York Yankees the last  two seasons, resigned to sign a two-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds in  the same position.  </P> <P> Quinn, 52, replaces Murray Cook. Asked whether Cook resigned or was fired, Red  owner Marge Schott told reporters: "I don't think that needs to be said, OK?"  </P> <P> Quinn's first objective is to find a new manager. He said interim manager Tommy  Helms, who took over Aug. 24 after Pete Rose was banned from baseball because  of alleged baseball gambling, remains a candidate.  </P> <P> Yankee owner George Steinbrenner named Harding Peterson, a former Pittsburgh  Pirates general manager, to replace Quinn.  </P> <P> "I am sorry to see Bob leave," Steinbrenner said. "He was one of the most loyal  and dedicated employees I have ever had."  </P></p>

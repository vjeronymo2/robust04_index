			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Germany casts shadow over fall in rates: Despite sterling's ERM exit, Europe still affects the UK economy IN OR OUT of the European exchange rate mechanism, Britain cannot ignore Germany. That point was underlined yesterday in the hour after the 1-percentage-point cut in UK base rates, when the pound fell 1 1/2 pfennigs on news of a large growth in the German money supply. While the drop in UK credit rates to 9 per cent caused widespread relief among politicians, mortgage holders and industrialists, the signs that inflation in Germany is still far from subdued slightly damped expectations about the scope for further cuts in borrowing costs. That said, yesterday's reduction in base rates to their lowest level since June 1988 would not have been possible were Britain still an ERM member. That will no doubt cheer the large number of anti-ERM Tory backbenchers as they listen to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in tomorrow's Commons debate on the economy. According to yesterday's announcement from the Bundesbank, the German M3 measure of the money supply grew 9 per cent in the year to last month on an annualised basis, well above the central bank's 5.5 per cent target. That signal that upward pressures on German prices remain strong will almost certainly increase the resolve of the Bundesbank to keep high its internationally important Lombard rate, so influencing the cost of credit in most European countries, whether they are ERM members or not. Even so, Mr Lamont now has the luxury - denied him since Britain entered the ERM nearly two years ago - of deciding on UK interest rates almost totally with reference to domestic economic conditions. Yesterday he showed his determination to make utmost use of the opportunity. Since Black Wednesday, when the pound suffered extreme turbulence on the foreign exchanges and Mr Lamont suspended the UK's ERM membership, the chancellor has had to keep only half an eye on the level of sterling. Thus it was that Mr Lamont was able to shrug off sterling's mid-morning fall, which saw the pound touch about DM2.52, before recovering to close in London at DM2.5450, up  3/4 pfennig on the day - about 23 pfennigs below the pound's DM2.778 lower limit applied during ERM membership. The 9 per cent base rates are likely to cut the cost of mortgages for virtually all Britain's 10m home buyers. They will also ease borrowing conditions for tens of thousands of businesses. As a result, the move may speed recovery from the UK's longest peacetime recession since the 1930s. Mr Lamont decided on a cut during discussions with Mr John Major, the prime minister. The final go-ahead was given after talks at 8.30am yesterday at the Treasury between the chancellor and his senior advisers. They included Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, Mr Andrew Turnbull, Treasury monetary expert, and Mr Eddie George, Bank of England deputy governor. Those people judged that the level of the pound, as it stood yesterday morning, already reflected the possibility of a cut in base rates, minimising the chances of a significant fall after the cut. Also, the signs of severe weakness in the UK economy - which has appeared flat for the past six months - fully justified an easing in credit policy. Inflationary conditions in Britain, which have eased considerably during the past few months of the recession, are thought to impose only a tiny threat to economic stability. The crucial question now is whether the direction of interest rates is firmly down, or whether considerations related to German credit policy, plus the requirement to maintain restraints on UK inflation, will hold up any further moves to cut borrowing costs. To keep up the spirits of Tory backbenchers, Mr Lamont will almost certainly want to follow up yesterday's move with a further cut in rates later in the year, possibly before the Conservative party conference which starts in Brighton in two weeks' time. But Mr Lamont emphasised yesterday that the UK remained committed to bearing down on inflation, and would put up borrowing rates should signs of large inflationary pressures reappear. Also the government cannot afford to ignore the exchange rate. If the pound falls too far against the D-Mark, inflationary pressures might increase because import prices would be higher. Assuming the government is paying more than lip service to the goal of rejoining the ERM when market conditions are more settled, Mr Lamont will not want the pound to fall too far out of alignment with the German currency. All that means, in the eyes of many economists, that Britain would be ill-disposed to see sterling fall much beneath around DM2.5. Against that, the continuing sharp pressures yesterday on many of the remaining eight currencies in the ERM - including the French franc - added weight to theories that the mechanism may soon have to undergo a fundamental readjustment or even be scrapped altogether to take into account the recent market turbulence. If the ERM is not long for this world, Mr Lamont can be forgiven for not spending too much time worrying about Britain's future place in it. On those grounds, the constraints on further cuts in interest rates may be somewhat less than they appear.</p>

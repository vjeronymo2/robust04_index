			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown first-half trading on target HILLSDOWN Holdings yesterday issued a trading statement saying that first half profits were likely to be 'very much in line with the budget for the period'. The shares rose 7p to 144p. One stockbroker explained the reaction to a seemingly innocuous statement saying, 'it was the first in-line trading statement from Hillsdown in years'. Hillsdown is the latest of a series of companies which have put out trading statements to avoid any suggestion that they are giving price sensitive information to a select audience. The company's half year ended on June 30 and it is seeing analysts next week. It felt that in the light of recent events - such as the Stock Exchange censuring London International Group when it briefed analysts on profits ahead of announcing results - it was better 'to err on the side of caution'. Hillsdown said that operating profits from continuing businesses would be not less than Pounds 80m in the half year, compared to Pounds 81.8m in the first half of 1992. It also published last year's interim results restated on an FRS 3 basis, to give analysts a base to work from. These showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 74.8m rather than the Pounds 78.1m originally published.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colonel General Georgiy Kondratyev, Russian </F> Federation deputy defense minister: "Russia's `Blue Helmets'"]    [Text] With the change in the geopolitical situation in  the world the participation of states, blocs, and public and  state structures in peacekeeping activity is put forward as a  priority avenue of their foreign and military policy.    The process of the formation of the CIS and also of states  which do not belong to this Commonwealth on the territory of the  former USSR and the existence of contradictions within them and  in some cases between them have led us to an understanding of  the need to create peacekeeping forces. Under present  conditions, when the European states that are CIS members are  displaying no interest in resolving armed conflicts by their own  efforts, Russia remains the only state with the military and  technical resources to conduct operations to maintain and  restore peace and is confirming this by its practice.    Of course, Russia directs its main efforts toward settling  crisis situations and armed conflicts in the regions directly  adjacent to its borders, since stability in these territories is  of vital importance for the Russian state and its citizens, 25  million of whom live in nearby foreign parts. It has been and  remains the only force capable of separating the warring sides  and sitting them down at the conference table. Life itself  shows that no international organization or group of states can  replace our peacekeeping efforts on the territory of the former  USSR.    At the same time we by no means rule out the enlistment of  peacekeeping forces under the UN or CSCE flag if, in the world  community's opinion, the need for that arises.    Russia's responsibility as a permanent member of the UN  Security Council for maintaining international peace and  security and as a state which bears the main brunt of  peacekeeping activity on the territory of the former USSR is  reflected in the Russian Federation Constitution, the law on  defense, the military doctrine, and other normative acts which  indicate directly that Russia assists the efforts of the world  community and various organs of collective security to prevent  armed conflicts and maintain or restore peace by the decision of  the UN Security Council or in accordance with international  commitments.    Thus for the first time peacekeeping in Russia has been  promoted to the rank of state policy.    The history of our state's peacekeeping goes back to 1973,  when the first 36 Soviet military observers took part under the  UN flag in the operation to monitor the conditions of the  cease-fire in the Near East.    In subsequent years military observers have taken part in  peacekeeping operations under UN auspices in Egypt, Israel,  Syria, Lebanon, on the Iraq-Iran border, in the Western Sahara,  Cambodia, Mozambique, and the former Yugoslavia. On two  occasions Russian military observers have been in Abkhazia along  the river Gumista where they confidently fulfilled their duties  and the bloodshed was halted for a while. And only the warring  sides' unconstructive policy prevented an end to the war in that  region at the time.    There was also a good chance of ending the war on the  Armenian-Azerbaijani border in September 1992 when to implement  the terms of the defense ministers' Sochi agreement, Russia,  Georgia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan were to assign  military observers to five zones of responsibility. But only  Russia did this.    To this day 105 Russian military observers are continuing  this hard service in many of the planet's trouble spots.    The failure to take decisive steps in nearby foreign parts  could plunge former regions of the USSR into even greater  bloodletting and the flames of war could move directly to  Russian territory. In accordance with interstate agreements the  Defense Ministry, without waiting for the adoption of a  legislative base on the peacekeeping forces, formed nine  battalions of Russian troops and sent them to South Ossetia, the  Republic of Georgia, and the Dniester Region of the Republic of  Moldova in the summer and fall of 1992.    At the same time at the request of the Tajik Government  units  of the 201st Motorized-rifle Division were ordered by the  Russian leadership to perform peacekeeping tasks and in the fall  of 1993 CIS Collective Peacekeeping Forces from Russia,  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan were formed and  introduced to the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.    The development of events in the south of Russia itself (the  situation in Ingushetia) and the absence of legislative acts on  the peacekeeping forces and the mechanism for activating them  made it necessary in order to end the bloodshed and maintain law  and order on the territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia in  accordance with the Russian Federation President's edict to  create a combined group of troops of about 12,000 men from the  troops of the North Caucasus Military District and the Internal  Affairs Ministry internal troops. Today the numerical strength  of the Russian Army servicemen performing peacekeeping tasks is  over 16,000.    The experience of the Russian "Blue Helmets'" participation  in settling military conflicts in nearby foreign parts enriches  world experience of peacekeeping. Thus their introduction to  zones of armed confrontation has been carried out under  conditions of continuing fire and their mission included  separating the warring sides. Another new element is that  alongside Russian peacekeepers representatives of the  conflicting sides and not only of neutral states are  participants in the operation to restore and maintain peace.    The establishment of Russia's peacekeeping forces is taking  place under complex conditions. We realize that the settlement  of armed conflicts is the common business of states of the  relevant region and the world community as a whole.  Consequently the burden of expenses should be shared between  them. This principle has been reflected in a number of  bilateral and multilateral agreements within the framework of  the CIS.    But most regrettably as of today in all trouble spots of the  former Union. Russia, as the mediator in the solution of  conflicts and with contingents of peacekeeping forces, which  surpass all other participants in the peacekeeping operations in  terms of personnel, equipment, and weapons, sometimes being  several times larger, receives no compensation for its  participation.    Moreover, funds for conducting peacekeeping operations are  not allocated from the federal budget and the financing of the  participation of the military contingent in peacekeeping  operations is through Defense Ministry funds.    The question of compensating for expenditure on these  purposes through subscriptions by states within the CIS  framework in accordance with the protocol of the Tashkent  meeting of heads of CIS states (May 1992) remains unimplemented.    Many politicians in the West are now speaking increasingly  frequently of our allegedly minor participation in peacekeeping  operations, unfairly restricting the numerical strength of the  peacekeeping forces to a battalion in Yugoslavia and observers.  In our view the new but noble mission of preventing bloodshed  should not be restricted to the political interests of  individual states but should be determined by the quantity of  the forces and funds used in humanitarian missions. It would be  fairer to view expenditure on financing these operations as a  direct proportionate contribution by Russia to the UN budget for  peacekeeping operations and to grant these operations a UN (or  CSCE) mandate).    In connection with the well known events in our political  life no legislative acts have yet been adopted on Russia's  peacekeeping forces. Their status has not been determined. The  armed forces contingents performing peacekeeping functions are  only assigned as peacekeeping forces by orders of the defense  minister. The mechanism for supplying (activating) these forces  has not been regulated either.    When planning operations to maintain and establish peace it  is essential to proceed from the premise that peacekeeping tasks  should be performed not by line units of the armed forces but by  specially created professionally trained peacekeeping forces  equipped for the purpose. Their numerical strength and  composition, the procedure for their use, and a whole series of  other questions must be precisely regulated by the state.  Unfortunately not everyone in our country yet understands that  the creation, staffing, and use of peacekeeping forces must be  determined legislatively by the supreme organs of state power  and not by the Defense Ministry.    Therefore in our view the priority task is the elaboration  and adoption of a Concept for Russia's participation in  peacekeeping activity and a law "on the procedure for supplying  peacekeeping forces for participation in peacekeeping  operations." It is also essential to approve their status  (position), that is to put a legal normative basis under Russian  peacekeeping.    At the same time one or two motorized-rifle divisions of the  Ground Troops (15,000-16,000 men) must be transferred to a new  organizational staff structure meeting the requirement for  autonomy when subunits perform peacekeeping missions. We have  now voiced proposals for putting these forces outside the treaty  framework for conventional arms limitation. It is also  necessary to create the appropriate material training base for  training them. The first sections of the training centers for  the 27th and 45th motorized-rifle divisions have already been  virtually created. But for the higher quality training of  personnel for operations in unusual conditions it is necessary  to improve them considerably. And again the question is based  on the financial famine which the armed forces chronically  experience.    The creation of Russia's peacekeeping forces should in our  view be implemented on the basis of the principles of the  compliance of their organizational structure, composition, and  numerical strength with the requirements of military doctrine,  with the concept of Russia's security, and with its  international commitments, centralized leadership, the maximum  use of the existing military potential and existing structures,  and a consideration for the continuity of national traditions,  the norms of international law, and the experience of other  states.    They must include Defense Ministry units and subunits  (military contingents), military, civilian, and militia  personnel (the leading staff of the mission, observers, and  experts), and communications, support, and servicing and  maintenance subunits.    Staffing with privates and sergeants should be (and already  is) only on a voluntary basis. Contracts should be concluded  with people who as a rule have already served in line units.  Today there are obviously not enough professional servicemen  under contract in the peacekeeping forces units. That is the  result of the discrepancy between material incentives and the  risk to life and the conditions of service of the "peacekeepers."    Peacekeeping forces' subunits must be staffed fully before  their training for peacekeeping activity begins. Right now  because of difficulties over staffing subunits often have to be  "assembled" at the last minute before being sent to armed  conflict zones.    By a decision of the Russian Federation Government an  Interdepartmental Coordination Commission has been created to  pool the efforts of ministries, committees, and departments on  questions of peacekeeping activity. Its organizational and  legal documents are being drafted. A Sector [napravleniye] for  Leadership of the Peacekeeping Forces has been operating in the  Defense Ministry for over a year now and controls the training  of peacekeeping forces subunits and their fulfillment f  missions. Unfortunately, because of its small size a number of  issues of a state law nature and of international and public  peacekeeping activity are beyond the sector's purview. These  questions are resolved by many directorates of the Defense  Ministry but for more high-quality and effective work it would  be desirable to unite these peacekeeping functions in a single  body.    In connection with the growth of the growth of the scale of  the peacekeeping forces' participation in the maintenance of  peace, in the United Nations the structure of the organs of  management is being improved and a professional military staff  is being formed for the operational control of forces assigned  by the United Nations. A special committee for improving  peacekeeping operations is being instituted under the UN  Security Council.    Theoretical questions of the preparation and implementation  of peacekeeping operations are also being elaborated, in  particular the NATO and U.S. concept for settling crises and  armed conflicts and the concept of second-generation operations,  and vigorous work is being performed to create UN "reserve  forces."    Russia is taking an active part in all these questions. In  particular the question of including the 27th motorized rifle  division in the UN "reserve forces" has been successfully  resolved and consultations are under way on questions of  peacekeeping activity between Russian representatives and  international organizations (the United Nations, CSCE, North  Atlantic Cooperation Council, NATO, and others) and on a  bilateral basis. In July 1994 it is planned to hold the first  joint Russian-U.S. command staff peacekeeping exercise.  Russia's 27th Motorized-rifle Division and the United States'  third infantry division will take part.    Russia's "Blue Helmets" now stand between the warring sides  in conflicts. By their activity they ensure cease-fires and  create conditions for a definitive settlement of conflicts by  political means. Despite a number of unresolved questions, they  are honorably performing their hard service, so essential today  in many regions.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] Tokyo Electric Power is proceeding with a plan to  establish a new large thermoelectric power station that will use  liquid natural gas (LNG) as the heat source in newly reclaimed  land in Tokyo Bay. Possibility of realization suddenly increased  with the specific mention by Tokyo Prefecture of the power  station site for the first time in the interim report of the Bay  Plan made public recently. For Tokyo, which has depended  unilaterally on power plants located in remote sites such as  Fukushima and Niigata Prefecture, the significance of "Edo  electric power" [Edo refers to traditional Tokyo] is great.    What is the number of power plants within the prefecture?    It seems a simple question, but it is a rather difficult  problem. That is because in addition to widespread use of  co-generation (thermoelectric combined supply) by plants, home  electric generation, and large buildings, many small diesel  power stations in outlying islands such as Miyakejima and  Ogasawara are under Tokyo Electric Power jurisdiction. It is  surprising, but there is even a small hydroelectric power  station in the upper stream of the Tama River within the  prefecture.    If narrowed down to Tokyo Electric Power's full-size power  stations, however, there are only three stations, Oi  Thermoelectric (oil), Shinagawa Thermoelectric (oil), and Hoshu  Thermoelectric (gas turbine). The total power generation  capability of these three power plants is about 1.67 million  kilowatts. It is no more than 3.5 percent of all Tokyo Electric  Power's power generation facilities. Compared with the amount of  electric power consumed, Tokyo has a setup that can supply only  a scant 8 percent of the electric power that it uses.    The reason that Tokyo Electric Power asked Tokyo Prefecture  to sell the reclaimed land for power plant use was actually  because of this self-sufficiency rate. Viewing large cities of  the world, New York locally supplies 44 percent and London  supplies 37 percent of its electric power.    Even in Japan, where power plant location is said to be the  most difficult in the world, Osaka supplies 40 percent and  Nagoya, 33 percent.    In Tokyo in the 1970's, there was a garbage war where ward  opposed ward concerning garbage incineration sites. The  residents strongly voiced that they did not want to build an  incineration site in their own ward to burn garbage coming from  other wards. It developed into a tumult where the border  crossing of garbage was monitored. Changing the viewpoint, it  was a dispute on the self-supply rate for each ward on garbage  incineration. As a result, garbage incineration sites have been  built in almost every ward.    A power plant is a public works facility with an order given  to a construction company and a location subsidy. It brings a  huge economic effect, such as property tax payments, to the  local area. No direct comparison can be made with garbage  incineration sites, where garbage collection trucks only form a  line, but they share a common point in that persuasion of the  local residents about location is difficult. That is why Tokyo  Prefecture ignored the logic shown previously in garbage  incineration with regard to electric power.    The building of a large power plant in Tokyo Bay is not just  an issue of obligation to a self-governing body and the  residents.    To use electric power generated in Fukushima and Niigata in  the prefecture, large-scale power transmission facilities are  necessary. At 386.4 billion yen, electric transmission  facilities account for 22.9 percent of all Tokyo Electric  Power's facilities investment, exceeding the total investment  for nuclear power and thermoelectric power stations. Simply  speaking, power transmission costs more than power generation.  Moreover, there is also the problem of transmission loss due to  heat in long-distance power transmission.    The new LNG thermoelectric power station which Tokyo  Electric  Power plans for the reclaimed land will be on the scale of 3  million to 4.5 million kilowatts. If it were completed with 4  million kilowatts, the electric power self-sufficiency rate for  Tokyo Prefecture would be about 27 percent in 2008 when  completion is scheduled. Even this cannot be called adequate,  but they say "the burden for the transmission network will be  decreased, and the stability of electric power supply will  increase by leaps and bounds" (Tokyo Electric Power).    With the combined cycle (compound power generation) used in  LNG thermoelectric power, energy efficiency is rapidly improved,  and facility size also becomes compact. There is also a  possibility that Tokyo Electric Power will be able to create a  power station of more than 5 million kilowatts at the same site  if the technology is available when the reclamation is finished  and construction begins.    However, difficult problems remain such as the procurement  and transport of the LNG fuel. In particular, the safety of  bringing in more LNG than the 300 LNG tankers a year that  currently enter Tokyo Bay should probably be debated.    However, the "economic democracy" of self-sufficiency in  electric power is a viewpoint that must not be forgotten in the  future energy business (Yasuhiro Goto).</p>

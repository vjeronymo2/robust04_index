			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Turkey roots out Kurds Turkish troops launched a largescale land and air operation yesterday against the separatist Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) rebels in north Iraq, writes John Murray Brown from Ankara. The military operation involves grounds troops up to 5km inside north Iraq and both helicopter and fighter air support. After winning assurances from Syria and Iran not to offer sanctuary to the PKK, Turkey is taking the opportunity before the snows arrive to force about 8,000 PKK rebels from their mountain bases. Turkish newspapers reported more than 5,000 Turkish commandos were now involved in rooting out the camps.</p>

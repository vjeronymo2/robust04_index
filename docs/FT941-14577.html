			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Brussels shies away from big aid packages The European Commission yesterday signalled that it was re-examining how best to keep alive prospects for economic and political reform in Russia. Officials said that Brussels was leaning toward more aid for training and other micro-economic measures aimed at encouraging private enterprise in Russia, rather than multi-billion dollar macro-economic stabilisation packages co-ordinated by the International Monetary Fund. This reflects growing sentiment that the EU should focus more on practical measures at municipal and regional level, especially now the hand of the economic reformers in Moscow appears to be weakened. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, outlined the new thinking in talks three days ago in Brussels with Mr Ivan Silayev, the Russian ambassador to the European Union. 'He told the ambassador that we only support President Yeltsin because he is a reformer, not because we simply want to support Yeltsin,' said one official. Between 1990 and 1993, the EU contributed almost three-quarters of world aid  -Ecu52.4bn (Pounds 41.23bn) - to Russia and the newly independent former Soviet republics, much more than the US and Japan. The Commission itself supplied Ecu3.5 bn, largely through specially targeted aid programmes. Mr Henning Christophersen, economics commissioner, said this week that western aid to Russia should be broadened. 'We should not forget how important it is for the reform programme to get the private sector to work in a more efficient way.' In a speech last Friday, Sir Leon called for aid efforts to include more social programmes and spending on infrastructure so that the average Russian citizen recognised his stake in economic reform. The new focus may provoke misgivings in the Clinton administration which - after some hesitation - has reaffirmed its faith in centrally-guided reforms based on lowering inflation and the budget deficit. President Clinton's message in his recent trip to Moscow was 'more reform in Russia and more money'. Negotiations between Moscow and Brussels have been stalled since the political and economic power struggle. Brussels officials are braced for an even tougher Russian stance, even though the outstanding obstacles are relatively few - notably, access to the Russian banking sector and the rules governing the trade of uranium between the EU and Russia.</p>

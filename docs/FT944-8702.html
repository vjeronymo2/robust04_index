			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BFI increases bid for Attwoods - Shareholders urged to reject Pounds 391m offer in favour of break-up plan Attwoods yesterday described the increased bid of Pounds 391m from Browning-Ferris Industries of the US as meagre and cynical, and urged shareholders to reject the offer in favour of the proposed break-up plan. BFI has nudged up its offer from 109p per share to 116.75p and declared it to be final. It has also promised to pay all investors who tender their holdings the final dividend proposed by Attwoods of 3.25p. The preference offer has been increased by 7p to 92p. Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods chief executive, said the break-up plan proposed as the final defence would still return better value to shareholders. 'We will do this by obtaining a full premium for control of three different businesses,' he said. 'This is in stark contrast to BFI's cynical attempt to take control of Attwoods at the lowest possible price.' Attwoods is expected to publish its formal response to BFI's offer next week and shareholders have until December 2 to decide. Mr Philip Angell of BFI said the increase would satisfy shareholders' desire for 'a little bit more'. Investors now had a simple choice: 'Pick the cash offer or an extended series of hurdles.' Under the break-up plan, shareholders would have to wait for Attwoods to get through the hurdles 'before they get anything - if they get anything at all.' The market view in London was that BFI had finely judged the increased offer. 'I think now it will be an uphill struggle for Attwoods,' said Mr Nigel Hawkins of Hoare Govett. 'The break-up was very much seen to be a last card, perhaps too little, too late.' However, Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell of NatWest Securities thought it might have been too finely tuned. 'If it had been Dollars 10 per ADR it would be all over,' he said. 'BFI may have misjudged it slightly.' Institutions, who were last week critical of Attwoods' break-up plan but still demanding a higher offer, had pressed BFI to alter the bid. They are thought to have wanted 100 per cent of the proceeds from the sale of German businesses. As the offer stands, shareholders - excluding Laidlaw of Canada, which has agreed to sell its 29.8 per cent to BFI under the original offer terms - will receive 80 per cent of the German proceeds. However, it is thought that the Takeover Panel insisted that BFI retain 20 per cent to guarantee that it would seek the best price. The increased offer and dividend payment represent Dollars 9.44 per American Depositary Receipt, equivalent to five ordinary shares. Attwoods' shares closed in London down 1p at 118p.</p>

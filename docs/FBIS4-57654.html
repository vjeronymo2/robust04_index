			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosita Regalado -- all quotations marks as </F> published]    [Text] The business sector affiliated with Consecomercio  [National Council of Commerce and Services], representing  approximately 40 percent of the Consecomercio activity, decided  to suspend importing and purchasing products for the nation's  industry in light of the instability of the U.S. dollar in the  Venezuelan market and the need to face up to the reality of  costs and prices.    The announcement was made by Consecomercio President Berend  Rossen, who warned of the inevitable shortage of goods and  services supplied by this private sector company. "We need to  implement a cost and price reality. That is why we are warning  the national government, by way of the Development Ministry,  that meetings with industrial sector representatives have  already taken place and we have not yet been advised. It will  depend on the government to continue with the Solidarity Pact  which enables consumers to have affordable prices of vital  imported goods such as food and medications.    Berend Rossen acknowledged that food prices had increased  during the past weeks not only as a result of the rise in the  U.S. dollar, but also for other reasons such as the  implementation of the bank debit tax and the increase of the  minimum wage.    With respect to the exchange rate situation, Rossen believes  that the BCV [Venezuelan Central Bank] must turn to a much more  open market such as the Caracas Stock Exchange in order to carry  out currency bids since this will allow the price of the U.S.  dollar to be fixed with more certainty. "There is the pressing  need to put a ceiling and a bottom on the official and parallel  currency market even when the commerce and service sectors do  not support the currency control measures."    The monetary authorities should present formulas to  stabilize  the currency market once and for all in order to provide more  security for importers and to ensure macro-economic equilibrium.  At the same time, there should be attempts to prepare an outline  for the procurement of additional "stand-by" type credits such  as the one obtained by Mexico with the IMF under situations  similar to what Venezuela is going through at this time.    Rossen proposed the future sale of gold and orimulsion on  the  market to compensate the drop in the currency market and he  pointed out that this will help restore the climate of trust in  Venezuela abroad.    Rossen is satisfied with the Venezuelan Government's policy  of once again proposing an increase in the price of gasoline as  another revenue alternative and as a way of preventing the  flight of Venezuelan goods to the Caribbean, Colombia, and other  markets where our gasoline and other products become contraband  items.    On the other hand, Nicola Escapaticci, president of  Consomercio Agriculture Commission disclosed that there is a  limited supply of certain items. There is a sugar shortage  because sugar is being illegally exported to Colombia; a rice  shortage because of a fall in national rice production; and  shortage of items such as powdered milk, which is being imported  from New Zealand.</p>

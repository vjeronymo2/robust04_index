			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana, April 3 (ATA) -- "Serbian police and army  have been openly collaborating with the paramilitary groups for  intensifying the violence and terror against the Albanian  population in Kosova", Adem Demaci, holder of the "Saharov"  Prize, and chairman of the Pristina Council for Human Rights  Protection, appealed through a letter to the homologue  international associations located in Geneva and to the  embassies in Belgrade.    Mr. Demaci writes that the Serbian and Montenegrins think  that in this way they can gain the favour of being the stronger  side in any negotiations mediated by the international factor.    "During the period of February-March 19, 1994, 2,500  Albanians have been cruelly mistreated in their homes, in front  of their families and in public places, 47 Albanians have been  sentenced with one to 10 years imprisonments by staged judicial  processes, 41 Albanian families have been expelled from their  homes and 2 innocent Albanians have been killed by the Serbian  police and army", Mr. Demaci points out.    The council give evidence of the tortures exercised on  13,400  Albanians, the rise of the number of Albanians forcibly  recruited in the Serbian Montenegrin Army as well the open  threat to the Albanians emigrants not to return to Kosova.    Mr. Demaci also protests in the name of the council against  the Serbian attack on the Albanian culture, such as the violent  closing of the Academy of Arts and Sciences and Arts in Kosova  and occupation of the Albanology Institute in Pristina.</p>

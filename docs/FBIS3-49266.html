The same sources claim that armed clashes are  taking place along the entire demarcation line and, in  particular, near Trsce and Trzacki Rasteli, but they do not  mention losses.    According to the western Bosnia news agency ZBIA, the 503d  and 517th Cazin brigades [loyal to Izetbegovic] are in disarray  after a large number of their officers and command personnel  joined the army of the autonomous province of western Bosnia.  This was confirmed by Nevzad Djeric, commander of the 503d  Cazin brigade, who has also joined the ranks of Abdic's army.    According to the same source, about 1,000 people from  Pecigrad, the largest residential area of Cazin, have moved to  Velika Kladusa to join Fikret Abdic and flee the terror  committed by the extremists in the 5th Corps of the so-called  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its commander, Atif Dudakovic.    Muslim-controlled Bihac radio has named Bozdar Sicel, deputy  chairman of the assembly of the autonomous province of Western  Bosnia, as being most responsible for recruiting the 503d and  517th Brigades for Abdic's army and for persuading the large  section of Pecigrad population to change sides.    Bihac radio also reported that clashes continue in Bihac  between Muslims and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] under the  command of Major General Vlado Santic, as do clashes between the  HVO and the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] headed by Dr. Ante  Santic, Vlado's brother. According to Bihac radio, there are  dead and wounded on both sides, but neither side has so far  reported any casualties.</p>

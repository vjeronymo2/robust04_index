			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (13): Iron finance minister drives on - Profile: Leszek Balcerowicz THE Polish programme of radical economic stabilisation and restructuring is associated with the name of one man. That man is Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, erstwhile academic economist, but since September 1989 executor of the 'Balcerowicz plan' in his capacity as deputy prime minister and minister of finance. The more politically-minded may regret his rigour, but he himself is determined to proceed. Asked about his goal for inflation this year, Mr Balcerowicz agrees that 'nobody can be sure whether we can achieve 1 per cent a month or something between 1 and 2 per cent. What's really important is for the rate of inflation to drop and to stay at the lower rate permanently. The original assumption for December to December inflation was about 32 per cent. It may be a bit higher, though we hope not much higher.' But, as he points out, 'this should be compared with annualised inflation of 2,000 per cent in 1989 and of 250 per cent in 1990'. Achieving that goal will be made no easier by the last jolt of price adjustments, necessitated by a fivefold increase in the cost of imported natural gas from the Soviet Union. The domestic price of natural gas was raised by 80 per cent in January and still needs to be raised by another 120 per cent. Asked about the timing of these increases, Mr Balcerowicz remarks that 'we had assumed the election was to be in June or May. It turns out that the elections are going to be in October and there is no time to wait. So the decision has to be taken earlier'. Naturally, this is not going to be popular, but 'if one wanted to minimise inflation in the short term, one would have to give up price adjustments and one would have to find sources of finance for gas and electricity. So what helps to make tough decisions,' continues the Minister in words that would delight Mrs Margaret Thatcher, 'is that there is no easy way out.' Is the minister concerned about the loss of competitiveness as Polish wages soar and the exchange rate remains fixed at 19,500 zlotys to the dollar? 'We are not contemplating any radical devaluation,' he insists. 'Having said that, it is quite normal that we are working on various concepts of exchange rate determination, though not a radical devaluation. But our intention is to use the exchange rate as an important stabiliser.' Mr Balcerowicz is equally determined to retain the highly unpopular system of wage control, according to which only 60 per cent of the inflation in a given month can be passed into wages in the state sector. Equally, 'our intention is not to have too great a budget deficit. This would probably require painful adjustments of expenditure to lower than assumed revenues,' which is made more difficult by the success already achieved in cutting subsidies, from 15 per cent of gross domestic product in 1989, down to 5-6 per cent today. With inflation rising above its trough of 1.8 per cent reached last August, to monthly rates of 4 per cent or more since then, Mr Balcerowicz admits that 'the results of the stabilisation turned out to be worse in the second half of last year than we expected, for three reasons. 'The first was the oil price shock. It was a double shock for us, because the Soviets started to increase the proportion of oil priced in dollars and the dollar price also started to increase. The second was the election campaign. A number of promises were made, including promises that if you doubled wages, then production would double and the standard of living would improve very quickly. I think this weakened the position of managers. The third is that there may have been a relaxation of macroeconomic policies, especially monetary policy.' If the mistakes have made him more determined, Poland has certainly been unfortunate, its present worry being the collapse in exports to the Soviet Union. The earlier forecast was for 3 to 4 per cent GDP growth this year, but 'if this tendency in trade with the Soviets continues we cannot hope for that rate of growth,' admits the minister. So, can the Government continue with its policies when enterprises are hurting, unemployment is soaring and even the fates are conspiring against it? 'So far as the government is concerned'' asserts Mr Balcerowicz, 'I think there is a cohesion. I have not had any problem with the basic elements of the economic strategy, contrary to some expectations. The difficulty is that you cannot expect that everybody would understand the difficulties and challenges of the economic situation. I am referring to the politicians. I would hope that they would understand, but, of course, not everybody understands why keeping wage controls is so crucial. But the people with whom we are working have a full realisation of what it would mean to sidetrack. It would be too dangerous not to continue.'</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Anglian appoints its advisers for flotation ANGLIAN GROUP, the double-glazing combine bought out for Pounds 84.5m from BET in December 1990, has appointed advisers for its planned stock market flotation which could value it at some Pounds 200m. NM Rothschild is the merchant bank and James Capel the stockbroker. The flotation, likely to take place in the summer, comes much sooner after the buy-out than expected, as the group has achieved record profits despite the recession. Anglian is the leading retail double glazing company in the UK with 7-8 per cent of the market. The prospectus is expected to show that Anglian made operating profits of Pounds 22.5m for the year to end-March, compared with about Pounds 15m When BET sold Anglian it was expected to make trading profits of Pounds 10m in the 1990-91 financial year. At the time BET bought a Pounds 30m 12 per cent loan note from Anglian to help finance the buy-out. This was refinanced in March. Proceeds of the float will repay the Pounds 30m debt, and Pounds 23m of preference capital and probably leave the company with some net cash.</p>

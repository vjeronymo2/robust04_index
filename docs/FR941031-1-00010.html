			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Financial liability includes any liability that could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arise as a result of offering the service. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such liability could arise if institution personnel make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management decisions on a customer's behalf. The primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern is whether such liability has the potential to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materially impact an institution's financial condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operational risk is the risk involved in implementing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service. This risk could occur if an institution fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly prepare for or administer a service. Examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> how this could arise are: (1) If significant staff training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required in order to competently offer the service, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not contemplated or planned; or (2) if there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial up-front costs in setting up a new service that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be recouped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, conflict of interest would include any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conflict that might arise between the interests of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution and those of the recipient as a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering the service. An example would be the conflict that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could arise when, as part of the farm business consulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service, an institution employee suggests a management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy that requires the recipient to borrow more money.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If risks were identified in any of these areas but some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification could eliminate, minimize, or control them, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service could be added to the list with special conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or institutional restrictions. In addition, in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better evaluate risk areas, a service could be placed on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list subject to the condition that it only be offered on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pilot basis by one or more institutions. If such risks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could not be minimized to a degree that would make the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service appropriate for System institutions to provide,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval to provide the service would be denied. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering the risks associated with a proposed new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service, the FCA would evaluate the risks as they pertain to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any System institution or the System as a whole. Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weaknesses would be addressed through the examination or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement functions of the FCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering the agency's role in reviewing proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services, the FCA considered a range of options,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the current prior approval approach and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal by the PPC work group. Under the PPC's proposal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions would notify the FCA of their intent to offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an existing or new related service program. If the FCA did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not object within specified time periods, the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could offer the service. Although this suggestion would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the current regulatory burden, the FCA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it would require every institution to submit a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program proposal to the FCA, it would still be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome than necessary. The FCA proposes instead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate each new service only once. If an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that the service meets the criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization, it could then offer such service once a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility analysis was prepared in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory requirements. The FCA believes this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process will reduce time needed for staff review and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory burden placed on System institutions, while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately minimizing the risks of offering unauthorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or unsafe and unsound services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Section 618.8015_Policy Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Existing &sect;618.8000(b) authorizes district and bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boards to establish policies pertaining to related service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. This section also includes general policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines and requires that the FCA approve the policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA proposes to amend existing &sect;618.8000(b) primarily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by eliminating the requirements that a district bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish a single related services policy for the district  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that the FCA approve these policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 618.8015 of the proposed regulation would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that each System institution offering related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services formulate policies pertaining to the development,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation, marketing, and offering of related services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change would reduce the supervisory burden of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding bank and appropriately place the responsibility on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the offering institutions. This change would not, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absolve the funding bank from providing the necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance on districtwide issues, such as its approach for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verifying the feasibility analyses of associations' related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;618.8015 would also eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that the FCA approve district and bank policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed change is consistent with the FCA's intent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove unnecessary prior approval functions and rely instead  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the examination function to evaluate compliance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance, and safety and soundness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA proposes to modify the existing guidance for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the content of the related services policy. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation would require the policy to include clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated purposes, objectives, and operating parameters. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the proposed regulation would require institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to link each related service program it offers to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business plan and long-term strategic goals. Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8015(b) and (c) retain the requirements in existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;618.8000(b)(1) and (2) that all related services be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offered on an optional basis and that all fees associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a service be identified and disclosed to the recipient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA proposes to eliminate as unnecessary the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific requirements in existing &sect;618.8000(b)(4) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banks and associations maintain detailed records because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other regulatory provisions exist that require maintaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such records in order to comply with the institutions'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal control policies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

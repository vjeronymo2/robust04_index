			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Saudi Hollandi to double capital Saudi Hollandi Bank, the Riyadh-based joint-venture bank 40 per cent owned by ABN-Amro Bank, has won approval from the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority to double its capital to SR420m (Dollars 113.5m), according to the official Saudi Press Agency. The bank said it would issue 2.1m bonus shares to existing shareholders, paid for by the transfer of SR210m from reserves into the bank's capital. Saudi Hollandi is set to become the last of Saudi Arabia's commercial banks to recapitalise since the end of the Gulf war - during which period most commercial banks have tapped a large influx of repatriated Saudi money in the local stock market to issue new shares. Saudi Investment Bank, the Kingdom's smallest, last week announced its plan to double capital to SR180m through a bonus share issue. Saudi Hollandi, which is completing a reorganisation and expansion, last year reported a 34 per cent rise in net profits at SR180m. Total assets at the end of the 1993 financial year stood at SR15bn. Mr Sheldon Boege, the bank's managing director, recently forecast a 10-12 per cent rise in earnings in 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 Jun (MENA)--Counselor Tal'at Hamid, press  adviser to the Arab League secretary general, said the  confession by Yusuf Sha'ban, member of the Fatah-the  Revolutionary Council, that he was responsible for the bombing  of the American plane over Lockerbie in 1988, is not the first  of its kind that acquits Libya of this crime.    Commenting today on Sha'ban's confession, Hamid said there  is  another piece of evidence proving that Libya is not involved in  the bombing: The president of the Swiss company that produced  the timer used in the bombing retracted his testimony, on the  basis of which Libya was condemned.    Hamid said the Arab League dealt with the Libyan-Western  crisis objectively and rationally in accordance with the UN and  Arab League Charters.    He said the Arab League's proposal that the two Libyan  suspects be tried by a Scottish panel of judges in the  International Court of Justice in The Hague was meant as a  chance for a fair trial based on the legal rule that the suspect  is innocent until proven guilty.    Hamid described the West's solid rejection of any peaceful  solutions to the crisis as lacking in an objective justification.</p>

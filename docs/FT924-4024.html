			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / City centre combats crime with TV net BRITAIN'S biggest city-centre street surveillance camera scheme, linking a closed-circuit television network to banks of screens in a police control room manned round the clock, goes into operation today. The Pounds 300,000 scheme will monitor the movements of known criminals in Newcastle upon Tyne city centre and hopes to deter and record crime by constant filming. Some traders hope the 16 zoom-lens cameras, supplemented after dark by infra-red lighting, will help to thwart increasingly audacious professional gangs. The network aims to help to reduce street disorder in one of Britain's most vibrant city centres. Within its central 1 1/4 square miles, Newcastle has 147 pubs, 116 restaurants and nine nightclubs. City centre businesses, from small shopkeepers to Marks &amp; Spencer, have contributed nearly half the set-up costs.</p>

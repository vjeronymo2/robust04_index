Mr. Pu Jie died of  illness in Beijing on 28 February 1994.    When Mr. Pu Jie was critically ill, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan,  Tian  Jiyun, Cheng Siyuan, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Zhao  Puchu, Qian Weichang, and Gu Mu visited him at the hospital.  Qiao Shi asked Cao Zhi to visit him at the hospital. When Mr.  Pu Jie passed away, Hu Jintao telephoned Mr. Pu Jie's relatives  to send his condolences and to express his regards to them.    Those who went to the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery to  pay  their last respects to the remains of Mr. Pu Jie included Tian  Jiyun, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, Ye Xuanping, Wang Zhaoguo, Ngapoi  Ngawang Jigme, and Zhao Puchu. Leading comrades of the NPC  Standing Committee, the CPPCC National Committee, the United  Front Department of the CPC Central Committee, the State  Nationality Affairs Commission, the Beijing Municipal CPC  Committee, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and other  concerned departments also took part in paying last respects to  the remains of Mr. Pu Jie.    Japanese Ambassador to China Junihiro Michihiko was present  as a representative of the Japanese emperor and empress, who  sent a wreath.    Born in Beijing on 16 April 1907, Pu Jie, of the Man  [Manchu]  nationality, was a younger brother of Aisin Giorro Pu Yi, the  last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. When he was young he studied  at Prince Chun's residence in Beijing and served as a study mate  of Pu Yi. After 1929, Pu Jie was sent to study at Gakushuin  University in Tokyo and at the Japanese Military Academy. After  returning to northeastern China in 1935, he served as a military  officer with the puppet state of Manchukuo, which was supported  by the Japanese Army. In 1937, he married Hiro Saga, the  daughter of the Japanese Marquis Saneto Saga. After the  Japanese Army surrendered in 1945, he and Pu Yi were captured by  the Soviet Red Army. In August 1950, they were handed over to  the Chinese Government to be detained for reform. In November  1960, they were pardoned and freed. After being released, the  party and the government showed great concern for and took very  good care of Mr. Pu Jie. During the sixties, he was cordially  received by Premier Zhou Enlai. Because of the concern shown by  Premier Zhou Enlai, he was able to be reunited with his wife and  daughter, who had lived in Japan and were parted from Pu Jie for  many years, and to live together with them in China. From May  1962, Mr. Pu Jie served as a special member of the CPPCC  Cultural and Historical Data Research Committee and as a member  of the Beijing Municipal CPPCC Committee. After 1978, he was  elected a deputy to the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC's;  a member of the Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth NPC Standing  Committees; and a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities  Committee. The fact that Mr. Pu Jie transformed himself from  being a brother of a feudal emperor into a citizen of New China  and then advanced to become a member of the highest legislative  organ of the people's political power demonstrates the CPC's  great vision and brilliant policy regarding the transformation  of society and classes and also demonstrates Mr. Pu Jie's high  quality of seeking truth and a bright future.    Mr. Pu Jie supported the CPC and loved the socialist  motherland. As a vice chairman of the NPC Nationalities  Committee, he conscientiously carried out his duties as a  representative of the people, put forward many valuable  suggestions for further improving nationality affairs work, and  made active contributions to safeguarding the unification of the  motherland and strengthening the unity of various nationalities.    For a long time, Mr. Pu Jie dedicated his life to promoting  peace and friendship between China and Japan. He visited Japan  many times and enthusiastically received visiting Japanese  friends from various circles. He actively introduced the great  achievements of China's reform, opening up, and modernization  drive. He made painstaking efforts to promote friendship  between China and Japan. In 1991 he was awarded an honorary  doctor of law degree by Japan's Ritsumeikan University.    Mr. Pu Jie was a world-renowned calligrapher. His  openhearted and graceful poems were full of sincere sentiments.  He authored the "Selected Poems of Pu Jie."    According to Mr. Pu Jie's will, his ashes will be spread  over  the vast land of China.    In appreciation for the concern shown to Mr. Pu Jie by the  party and the state over a long period, his daughter Kosei  Fukunaga asked the CPPCC National Committee to present a portion  of her share of her inheritance to the state.</p>

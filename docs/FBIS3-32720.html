			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the FSLN to mark "this month of the </F> 60th anniversary of Augusto Cesar Sandino's death, as well as  the upcoming special FSLN Congress, responding to the mandate of  the Sandinist Assembly and the desire of militants to increase  reflection and debate on the nature of our party"; place and  date not given]    [Text] The FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] views  the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers of the Army  and police as the fruit of the RPS [expansion unknown], and it  endorses the subordination of their institutions to human  rights, the Constitution, and the laws of the Republic.  <H5>  Political Democracy </H5>   The legitimacy of political power depends on the people's  general representation and on the involvement of every civilian  organization.    The FSLN respects and democratically strengthens the  political institutions and values most representative of  national culture, administrative honesty, universal suffrage,  the separation of the branches of state, national sovereignty,  and independence, and it discourages, questions, and fights any  exclusionist political culture.    As a democratic party, the FSLN represents all the sectors  in  Nicaragua regardless of race, religion, social class, gender,  ethnic group, or political position, as well as those struggling  for peace, stability, security, and the political rights of all  Nicaraguans. As a revolutionary party, the FSLN is struggling  for real social participation in civilian and state concerns and  institutions nationwide, especially by workers, the general  masses, and dispossessed sectors in Nicaragua.    The FSLN respects, promotes, and develops civic means of  enhancing the people's and popular organizations' involvement in  demanding their political, social, economic, and cultural rights.    The FSLN defends all Nicaraguans' individual safety and  freedom from abuses by the state or any other national or  international institution.    The FSLN is struggling to preserve the nation's ecosystem by  promoting technical and cultural practices that will strengthen  the conservation, improvement, and maintenance of our resources.    The FSLN promotes economic policies that are favorable to  all  social sectors, especially producers in the countryside and in  the cities; the democratization of loans; investment  oportunities; and the exchange of commercial and financial  information between producers and workers. It also promotes  policies that discourage the flight of capital and the  plundering of resources.    The FSLN uses every possible source of influence, nationally  as well as internationally, to allow the state to safeguard the  nation's economic development and to regulate the social  distribution of wealth.  <H5>  Partisan Organization </H5>   The FSLN is open to all sectors of Nicaraguan society and  aspires to represent all of society, whether from a position of  opposition or while in power, in order to achieve democracy,  economic development, and social justice. Its primary concerns  are the poor and unemployed, who constitute the majority of  Nicaraguans.    The FSLN is a revolutionary, democratic, and participatory  party struggling to reconcile freedom and individual initiative  with the party's interests and the programatic principles by  which it is governed.    The FSLN is a party that promotes national and international  political alliances with other parties to achieve the goal of  social and economic well-being for all of society in general and  for the low-income sectors in particular.  <H5>  Proposal From the Sandinist Democratic Left </H5>   The de jure state, social justice, and humanistic socialism  -- The FSLN defines itself as a revolutionary party whose  fundamental goal is to struggle and work in the short- and  mid-term for the establishment of a de jure state, social  justice, and humanistic and democratic socialism which will  consider the individual, the family, and the community its main  concerns. To this end the FSLN is opposed to the implementation  of liberal and neoliberal principles and measures to resolve  Nicaraguan society's political, social, and economic problems.    The FSLN aspires and proposes to all of Nicaraguan society  the gradual and progressive achievement of humanistic socialism  in which the de jure state is combined with social justice and  political and economic democracy in which popular sectors and  organizations can truly participate in the Nicaraguan nation's  political and economic power. To achieve these goals, the FSLN  must join with all forces interested in eliminating dictatorial  and authoritarian trends in the political sphere, as well as  polarizing and exclusionary trends in the area of economics,  which still prevail in Nicaragua's capitalist society.    The FSLN advocates relations based on respect and mutual  benefit, as well as peaceful coexistence with the neighboring  governments and peoples of Central America and the Caribbean,  and especially with the United States.    The FSLN joins with the peoples of Latin America and the  Caribbean to defend self-determination and national sovereignty.  <H5>  Political Power </H5>   The nation's sovereignty rests with the Nicaraguan people.    The people are the source of political power, which is not  expressed solely by the state apparatus or government  institutions, but also by the institutions and organizations of  civilian society -- namely, trade unions; labor unions;  churches; municipalities; student, women's, professional,  artistic, ethnic, cultural, agro-environmental, sports, and  youth organizations; and nongovernment organizations in general.    The FSLN must encourage the creation and democratic  development of local, municipal, territorial, and cooperative  authorities without excluding anyone.    The FSLN advocates a system of full autonomy for the peoples  and ethnic communities of the Atlantic Coast.  <H5>  Economic, Social, and Cultural Democracy </H5>   As a democratic party, the FSLN represents all sectors  seeking national economic development and social justice. As a  revolutionary party it especially represents the popular forces,  middle classes, professionals, intellectuals, and artists  seeking equitable participation in the distribution of the  nation's wealth.    The FSLN opposes any position that advocates the restoration  of the oligarchic system, such as exclusionary and neoliberal  policies that foster contradictions, conflicts, and social  instability.    The FSLN respects public and private property and any other  form of property; it struggles for the democratization of  property; and it promotes and encourages all forms of  associative property -- namely, communal, cooperative, APT  [expansion unknown], municipal, autonomous, labor, federative,  and joint businesses.    The FSLN is struggling to democratize the economy; to make  it  respond to the needs of the majority of people and not to the  needs of minorities; to prevent its competitiveness from  becoming oligopolist; to ensure that it is based on ethical and  popular criteria and not on demagogic morality; to ensure that  society and the state will guard it without jeopardizing its  role in the effective and productive allocation of resources;  and to ensure that it will be an economy that favors human  beings and not capital.    The FSLN promotes economic policies that seek productive  growth and involve the granting of opportunities based on an  individual's work, productivity, and initiative, as well as  promoting policies through which the assurance of employment,  health, education, and housing are considered priorities.    The FSLN is developing every possible initiative and measure  to diminish the poverty and unemployment suffered by most  Nicaraguans.    The FSLN is struggling to provide the minimal conditions for  a dignified life to every individual who for reasons of age,  gender, or physical disability have no access to society's  general benefits.    The FSLN takes its inspiration primarily from the historic  and cultural roots of the Nicaraguan people, and it is trying to  establish an economic model that will be the most beneficial for  the nation as a whole and for the largest and most impoverished  sectors in particular.    The FSLN respects the autonomy and interests of social and  popular organizations, supports their demands and struggles, and  strives to attract them to the party's way of thinking.    The FSLN is a broad, democratic party that can be joined by  all citizens who accept the party's way of thinking, respect the  unity of Sandinism, and abide by decisions made by the majority.    The FSLN encourages consensus among its members through  debate and dialogue as a method for settling internal  disagreement.    The FSLN regards renovation, modernization, change, and  internal democracy as factors to strengthen Sandinism from the  left.  <H5>  Methods of Struggle </H5>   The FSLN regards as legitimate the combination of  parliamentary and legal methods of struggle, as well as popular  mobilizations and public debates.    The FSLN believes that the struggle of any one popular  organization must be backed by the largest possible consensus in  the organization's own rank-and-file. The organization should  strive for the help, coordination, and solidarity of similar  organizations, and it should strive to persuade the population  to endorse its goals.    The FSLN regards humanistic knowledge, education, and  training as essential tools for strengthening the political,  social, and economic ethics of Sandinists and all Nicaraguans in  general.    The FSLN regards direct, secret, and universal suffrage as a  legitimate means of electing municipal and parliamentarian  representatives, presidents, and all other officials, both  within the government and within political parties.</p>

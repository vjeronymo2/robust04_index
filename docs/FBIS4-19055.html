			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Martina Fietz: "Blow of Liberation"] </F>   [Text] Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] Chairman  Kinkel has got himself a breather. With his statement that he  wants to continue the Christian-liberal government coalition in  Bonn after 16 October, he has given the party the opportunity to  pursue the election campaign for itself. Without constantly  having to answer the question about its loyalty to the  coalition, the FDP now can announce its positions emphatically  and loudly.    With this, Kinkel primarily makes concessions to the critics  in his own camp who have repeatedly called for the party to  acquire a profile, and not without reason, by the way. After  all, the FDP has lost its traditional role as the only party  that can provide a majority.    What the new "public relations work" of the liberals can be  like became basically clear when it was affirmed that the  solidarity surcharge would be reexamined after three years. The  rejection of a higher petroleum tax is a move to distance itself  from the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union  [CSU]. The basically positive commitment of the partner also  challenges the CDU/CSU. In particular, in economic and in  financial policy, the junior partner will try to distinguish  itself from the senior partner.    Apart from the fact that the liberals have basically set the  course for a continuation of the government coalition, the  coalition statement has not yet been formulated. And one  remembers that it is to become a "conditioned" election  statement. In any case, Kinkel said yesterday that anyone who  wants to prevent a red-green formation or a grand coalition must  vote for the FDP. There was no mention of a Social  Democratic-Liberal coalition.</p>

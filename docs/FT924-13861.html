			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Aminex losses rise 20% AMINEX, the Irish-quoted oil exploration and production group, increased pre-tax losses by 20 per cent from IPounds 50,470 to IPounds 60,415 (Pounds 62,834) in the half year to June 30. Gross revenues fell from IPounds 398,900 to IPounds 198,600. Losses per share were unchanged at 1p. Mr Brian Hall, chairman, said the group had reached agreement with its principal lenders to repay 75 per cent of all monies outstanding, and to repay the balance over the next two years. This would improve the financial position and, together with the expanded exploration portfolio, strengthen prospects.</p>

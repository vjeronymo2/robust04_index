			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Castello's Column, by Marcelo Pontes: "The Clash Between </F> Osiris and Clovis"]    [Text] The clash between Revenue Secretary Osiris Lopes  Filho and the executive secretary of the Ministry of Finance,  Clovis Carvalho, is not one of these feuds that generate  emotions every day, but the electrical charge released on the  day when the two fell out left resentments that are still giving  Minister Rubens Ricupero a headache.    Osiris got Fernando Henrique Cardoso to sign, on his final  day as finance minister (Wednesday of Holy Week), the proposal  to modernize the Federal Revenue Secretariat. A career civil  servant, professor of tax law, and very familiar as few others  are with the machinery by which taxes are collected, Osiris  thinks the time has come to improve working conditions at a  government agency that has proven its efficiency.    That is why he conceived the idea of setting up a treasury  intelligence service to uncover the more sophisticated kinds of  tax crimes that cannot be reached by traditional audits. The  proposal gives the revenue service a more dynamic operating  structure and enables it to hire additional inspectors.    A happy Osiris told the people at Revenue about the  minister's signature and awaited publication in the OFFICIAL  GAZETTE. He waited a week. He sent some of his staffers to make  inquiries at the Ministry of Finance, to find out what happened.  He learned then that the proposal had gotten stalled in the  hands of the executive secretary, Clovis Carvalho.    So Osiris phoned Clovis. The conversation began cordially  but  ended disastrously. Clovis confirmed that he was holding up the  proposal because the text contained some details he did not  agree with. A few words, he said, had to be changed. The  situation was intriguing, to say the least. An executive  secretary of a ministry holds up a document signed by his  superior and virtually revokes it at the instant when the  transition from one minister to another allows a decision-making  vacuum to occur in the public administration.    Extremely protective of his prerogatives and political  clout,  since in a span of few months he had emerged from the anonymity  of the rank and file of the civil service to become a candidate  for minister, Osiris, the real name of the "lion" of the Revenue  Secretariat, told Clovis Carvalho on the phone that he would  tell his staff and the press who was holding up the proposal to  modernize the revenue service.    Clovis reacted by saying that Osiris was blackmailing him.  Osiris argued that he would simply be speaking the truth, as  confirmed by Clovis himself. When Clovis said for the second  time that he was being blackmailed, Osiris went into a rage and  abruptly told him, in stentorian tones, where to go. Then he  hung up.    Osiris then warned his staff that if the proposal Clovis was  holding up were not released, he would resign from the Revenue  Secretariat. He did not convey this threat to either the  minister of finance nor Planalto Palace, from which he had  departed to take the helm of the tax-collecting machine.    Minister Ricupero went into action, but the issue is still  unresolved, almost three weeks later. Osiris is feeling  resentful. Clovis has the proposal. One considers himself strong  enough to take on any fight. The other has carried to an extreme  the principal trait for which he is known within the economic  team: that of being a tough guy, the man assigned to say "no" to  anyone, no matter who, when necessary.    This time, Clovis said "no" to Osiris but also to the  previous minister, who had put him in the job and worked to keep  him there under Ricupero. If he wants to fight with Osiris,  Clovis, who is very close to the rest of the economic team,  should not be all alone.</p>

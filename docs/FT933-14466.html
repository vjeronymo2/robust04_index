			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Water clean-up will add Pounds 54 to bills, warns regulator MR IAN BYATT, the water regulator, yesterday warned the government that it risked large increases in household water bills unless it delayed the timetable for cleaning up the UK's water supply. If all obligations to improve quality were met, the typical household water bill in England and Wales could rise Pounds 54 a year in the five years from 1995, and a further Pounds 23 in the five years after that, Mr Byatt warned. This would amount to an annual rise of 5 per cent in real terms. In a report to ministers, 'Paying for quality: the political perspective', he said Britain's water quality obligations were confronting the industry with enormous costs which would have to be passed on to the consumer. 'I do not believe that customers would want to see their water bills rising at this rate,' he said. 'Domestic customers have already suffered a squeeze in their incomes. Business customers competing in difficult markets may be hard-hit by large increases in water bills and the cost of treating trade effluent.' Mr Byatt singled out European Community regulations for placing 'an unmanageable burden' on customers. The cost of implementing the urban waste water directive had soared from an estimate of Pounds 2bn to Pounds 10bn, he said, and the government should consider going to Brussels to negotiate a five-year extension. He believed the UK was not alone in its concerns about EC standards. Other regulations which could be reviewed include those on drinking water, sewage disposal, run-off of fertilisers, dumping of sludge at sea and the clean-up of bathing beaches. Mr Byatt said it was 'not a matter of going back to the Dark Ages, but of how far and how fast we proceed'. The report was welcomed by consumer groups such as the Ofwat National Customer Council and industry but attacked by environmentalists for seeking to postpone the clean-up. Mr Chris Smith, Labour's environment spokesman, called it misdirected: 'Where pollution cannot be prevented, it should be the polluter, not the water consumer, who pays to remove it.' Mr Tim Yeo, minister at the environment department, said the government would gauge public reaction and try to respond by early autumn. He said the report 'shows there is an inextricable link between higher standards and prices'. The report forms part of a campaign by Mr Byatt to hold down costs in the water industry, and to deal with public concern about water bills. It is addressed to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, and Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary. The report updates a preliminary paper issued last year by Mr Byatt in which he laid out the cost of cleaning up Britain's water, which has suffered from decades of underinvestment.

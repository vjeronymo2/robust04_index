			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Builders and estate agents encouraged - House sales boost forecast BUILDERS and estate agents yesterday welcomed the cut in interest rates and said it should encourage the recent resurgence in house sales. 'A four-bedroom house in Islington put on the market at more than Pounds 200,000 in January 1990 received an agreed offer of just under Pounds 170,00 on Monday,' said Mr Tony Copping Joyce, senior partner at central and north London agents Copping Joyce. 'A flat in Canonbury in north London on offer at Pounds 120,000 in March 1991 has just sold for Pounds 105,000.' He said those were examples of properties which had remained on the market for several years and were now beginning to sell. 'This does not mean that a sustained recovery is under way but I do believe that the bottom may have been reached,' he added. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said that the base rate cut was larger and earlier than had been expected. As a result, he said, house prices might even start to rise during the second half of this year. Previously he had forecast a further 5 per cent reduction in prices this year, but now expects them to remain flat over the 12 months. House sales, which had slumped from a peak of 2m in 1988 to just 1m last year, could be between 1.25m and 1.3m this year according to Phillips &amp; Drew. The number of potential buyers visiting show houses and estate agents and building societies' offices has jumped since the end of November following one of the worst-ever autumns for house sales. Some of the improvement may to be due to buyers reviving purchases postponed during the September sterling crisis when interest rates fluctuated wildly. According to the country's 30 largest estate agents, which account for half of all house transactions, agreed sales rose by 18 per cent last month compared with December 1991. Most encouraging has been the increased interest from buyers in southern England where prices have fallen by up to 30 per cent since 1989. Mr William Wells, partner of Mullucks in Hertfordshire said: 'In the first few weeks of this year we sold several homes for more than Pounds 300,000 when the market for this price bracket was dead last year.' Mr John Cowley, a partner of Crisp Cowley in Bath, said that activity during December - normally a poor month for sales - and January was between a fifth and a quarter higher than during the corresponding months a year earlier. 'A sign of the times is that an increasing number of clients who have been renting have told us that they are unlikely to renew their leases and that they judge that now is the best time to return to buying,' Mr Cowley said. Housebuilders, too, have reported a sharp increase in visitors and sales since the end of November. They warn, however, that there was a similar uplift in sales at the beginning of last year. Mr Richard Andrew, chief executive of Wimpey's homes division, welcomed yesterday's interest rate reductions as 'well-timed and necessary'. 'Whilst we are seeing flickers of renewed interest, there are still many house buyers who lack confidence,' he added. 'Let us hope this is just the right stimulus to encourage those who have been hesitating.'</p>

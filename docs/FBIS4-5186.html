			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On the night of 6-7 April, the  people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK]  cooperated to fight in self-defense in order to defend their  villages, houses, cattle, crops, and land. They fought against  the invading forces and the war materiel that has been brought  in to prepare for successive offensives in the area between  Routes 69 and 68 and the area east of Route 68. Here are the  preliminary results:    I. Liberation and destruction of positions:    1. The Banteay Chhma position was completely liberated and  destroyed. Two big warehouses containing weapons and ammunition  have been burning for five hours already. All the villages  around Banteay Chhma have been liberated.    2. The big garrison (?at Soeng) and the Kouk Mon township  have been liberated and destroyed -- all the way from Beng and  Kou to Rumchang townships -- along with all the positions in the  surrounding communes and villages. Two big warehouses at  (?Banteay Soeng) were burning throughout the night, until 0900  on 7 April.    II. Liberation and [words indistinct] people:    1. Nearly 2,000 families -- a total of over 90,000 people --  have been liberated.    2. Eighty-nine villages have been liberated.    3. The people -- who have been the victims of the war of  aggression by the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their  puppets for three years, particularly victims of the two-headed  government and UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] and  of the burn- all-kill-all campaign of August 1993 -- have risen  up and cooperated with the NADK. They have attacked the  invading forces and enlisted as soldiers by the hundreds. The  people are moving in throngs to meet the NADK. They have  embraced the NADK with tears flowing to express their sentiment  at meeting with them. It was as if they had been reborn.    III. Seizure of weapons:    1. According to preliminary reports, two T-54 tanks, a 37-mm  antiaircraft gun, a 122-mm D-30 gun, a 100-mm gun, and a 120-mm  gun were seized at (?Banteay Soeng);    2. A DK-82 gun, an 82-mm mortar, and a 12.7-mm gun were  seized in Kouk Mon.    3. A DK-75, a DK-82, an 82-mm mortar, a 12.7-mm gun, a big  central field radio, and so on were seized in Banteay Chhma.    4. A fully-stocked warehouse with assorted ammunition was  seized, including AK's, AR-15's, B-40's, B-41's, grenades,  12.7-mm ammunition, and so on. The people are taking this  ammunition out of the warehouse. A BM multiple rocket battery  was also seized.    IV. Nhoek Bunchhai's [government general] villa was  attacked, destroyed, and reduced to ashes. The people say they  fed him for over 10 years, but he became a U.S. mercenary  following the July 1993 merger of the Para soldiers and the  communist puppet troops. He has been biting and cutting the  throats of countless people. The people are looking for Nhoek  Bunchhai to try him for his great crimes.    V. Our forces control all strategic roads. The people and  the NADK are in control of all strategic roads and are waiting  to ambush the invading forces' reinforcements.    On the morning of 7 April, two tanks left Samraong  accompanied by 40 soldiers. When they were east of Tonle Sar,  we ambushed them and forced them to retreat. Leaders of the  communist Vietnamese puppets such as Nhoek Bunchhai and other  Para leaders are shouting in panic. They shout: The United  States, France, Australia, and Japan have gathered dollars to  buy over 1,000 tonnes of weapons and ammunition from communist  Vietnam and Russia so Nhoek Bunchhai and Dien Del can continue  fueling the war against the NADK. Now the people and the NADK  have taken everything. A quantity of this ammunition has been  reduced to ashes.    They talked to one another in panic over the field radio,  saying that this attack by the people and the NADK has affected  Divisions 3, 9, 7, 8, 11, and 12.    The people shouted these insults back: You are all  mercenaries waging war to kill the people. You have sold  yourselves to foreigners to kill Cambodians. Countless people  -- the old, the young, men, and women -- have been killed by  warmongers. Villages, cattle, paddy, and rice have all  vanished. You do not even spare baby diapers. You have  undressed and raped hundreds of our daughters like animals.  Each of our daughters was gang-raped to death. You bayonetted  and pumped bullets into the girls after raping them. You are  evil! You are Cambodians; how can you kill Cambodian people  like this? Your blood is so dark! How similar your blood is to  that of the black-tooth communist Vietnamese and the blood of  communist Vietnamese puppets Hun Sen, Chea Sim, Sin Song, Sin  Sen, and Sar Kheng!    The anger of the people will become as strong as a prairie  and bush fire; nothing can stop it.</p>

Our special correspondents in  Chisinau report as follows:    [Begin Anca Florea recording] This morning, Chisinau Radio  broadcast an interview granted by President Mircea Snegur. The  questions and especially the answers convey the preelectoral  picture of the Republic of Moldova. We will try to sum up what  he said.    President Snegur assessed that the 27 February elections are  linked to the opinion poll on 6 March. The first will create a  parliament, the second an answer to a complex question that will  form the foundation of the Constitution.    He called on the citizens of the Republic of Moldova to cast  their vote urging them not to be indifferent to their fate,  although, quote, even a small percentage will ensure the  validation of the elections, unquote.    President Snegur expressed the hope that a parliamentary  majority will be achieved, which, quote, could work actively,  without useless discussions, unquote. Western interest in this  country was explained by the President of the Republic of  Moldova through the preservation of stability in a conflict area  in the past one and a half years, contrary to other areas of  conflict in the former Soviet Union, where this was not  possible. He added that the separatist tendencies are also of  interest, especially for the foreign observers who have arrived  in Chisinau.    In connection with future relations with the future  parliament, President Snegur said, quote: No parliament will be  able to cooperate with the president if it tries to promote a  more or less conservative line or to stop the reform process,  unquote.    This is why President Snegur emphasizes the need to create a  parliamentary majority.    The first event that will follow the elections is the  signing  of the 'Partnership for Peace' program in Brussels and the  signing of the documents on its entry in the CIS, President  Mircea Snegur affirmed.    Asked about the participation of the Gagauz people in the  elections, the president of the Republic of Moldova affirmed  that the differences with the separatists can be solved only  through conciliation, quote: I am firmly convinced that solely  compromise will help us reestablish the republic's integrity,  unquote.    In connection with the current political, economic, and  social situation of the Republic of Moldova, President Snegur  stated that the people belonging to the nomenklatura are not the  only guilty ones. He said, quote: The nomenklatura are those  who are working, who are still able to do something, and  therefore I do not agree with promoting the idea of only new  people. We have had a revolutionary government, a reformist  government, and a national reconciliation government. What the  revolutionaries achieved in one year can be noted today: Ever  since 1990-91 we have been unable to recover our senses because  there was only destruction, unquote.    In concluding his interview granted to Chisinau radio  stations, President Snegur did not reject the idea of a  presidential republic, if necessary, reiterating that without a  parliamentary majority there are no prospects.    As a general assessment, President Mircea Snegur said,  quote:  We have to be optimistic and compare the situation in the  Republic of Moldova with the situation in other countries within  the area of the former Soviet Union. Being supported by  international bodies, we hope that we will elect a parliament  which, in cooperation with the presidency, will give an impetus  to the positive beginning which exists in the Republic of  Moldova.

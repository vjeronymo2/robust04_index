			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Seasonal sales lift Vodafone Cellular telephones group Vodafone produced the second-biggest gain in the FT-SE 100 stocks, responding to a report that sales of cellular telephones are currently running at record levels. The shares were additionally helped by inclusion in a number of stockbrokers' 1994 'best buy' recommendations. The story had much less impact on the UK's other cellular telephone companies. BT, which has a majority stake in Cellnet, eased slightly, while Securicor Group, which controls the minority in Cellnet, managed only a minor improvement. Connections to the Vodafone and Cellnet networks have been increasing rapidly in recent months following low cost tariff initiatives introduced by both networks. Vodafone shares finished the run-up to Christmas at an all-time closing high of 592 1/2 p, a net gain of 10 1/2 p. Turnover reached a highly respectable 1.9m shares. BT, which hit a record 489 1/2 p a week ago, failed to make any progress, closing a fraction easier at 486p, with the partly-paid 2 1/2 down at 227p. Securicor 'A' edged up 4 to 892p. News and electronic information group Reuters Holdings was heavily traded as investors took profits following recent outperformance. The shares fell 16 to 1864p with US sellers leading the price correction. The shares had risen sharply as a result of a bear squeeze and talk that the company was considering a bid for Quotron, the US dealing screen subsidiary of Citicorp. One dealers said 'considering the stock is at a 50 per cent premium to the market it's surprising that the fall is so slight and the volume is so high - there has been good two-way business. By the midday close more than 1m shares had been traded, equivalent to the average turnover on a full day. A further 1m shares were traded in the form of options. Shares with listings in New York were generally weak as US investors, anticipating a hike in their domestic interest rates, repatriated funds. Hanson eased a halfpenny to 272 1/2 p, Glaxo slipped a penny to 722p, Wellcome fell 2 to 651p and Shell lost a penny to 718p. However, volumes were low. The English power generator stocks extended their recent powerful performances, as the market continued to adopt the view that the companies will be able to avoid a reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. A decision by Professor Stephen Littlechild, head of Offer, the industry regulator, whether to refer the companies to the MMC is expected early in January. Recently, Professor Littlechild said a reference could be avoided if the companies sold some power stations to rivals and gave assurances on electricity pricing levels. National Power, the larger of the two groups, raced up 8 to a peak 505p while PowerGen, which earlier last week agreed to buy Pounds 123m worth of North Sea assets from Lasmo, put on 5 to a record 567p. There was no shortage of business in the banks which recovered strongly after recent profit-taking and switching over the past few sessions. A Cazenove upgrade and broker buy recommendations drove Standard Chartered up 10 to 1231p. NatWest was the most heavily traded bank stock and the FT-SE 100's best performer, the shares climbing 15 1/2 , or 2.6 per cent, to 607 1/2 p. There was also heavy activity in the bank's traded options. Abbey National moved up 8 to a peak 496p after an encouraging forecast on the UK housing market by the Council of Mortgage Lenders. Insurance broker CE Heath climbed a further 23 to 413p, responding to a Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation and speculation that a predator could be stalking the group. A series of exceptionally trades in Clyde Petroleum, the soil exploration group ,at a deep discount, was said to have been the completion of a 'bed and breakfast,' or tax-related deal. A total of 33m shares traded at 35p with the stock price rock steady at 47p. MARKET REPORTERS: Christopher Price, Peter John, Steve Thompson. Other statistics, Page 25</p>

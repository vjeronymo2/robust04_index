			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The London Commodity Exchange COCOA market submitted to a minor correction yesterday, easing further in the afternoon as the market seemed reconciled to let the profit-takers return, albeit temporarily, to the driving seat. The December futures price closed at Pounds 862 a tonne, down Pounds 18 on the day and Pounds 28 below this week's peak. 'We've been seeing this for some time - the market rises sharply, drops back about Pounds 25, but then picks itself up again,' one dealer said. COFFEE futures had also been showing substantial losses but recovered towards the close as traders anticipated positive statements from members attending talks on technical aspects of the retention scheme in Bogota. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices ended firmer and near the day's highs as the market staged a technical rally to yesterday's declines against a background of a renewed widening in the cash premium. NICKEL prices were pushed lower during the morning by European merchant selling and stop-loss sales, although levels below Dollars 4,500 eventually attracted covering and trade interest, and the market ended at Dollars 4,515, down Dollars 15.

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE higher-than-anticipated PSBR figure included in the chancellor's Budget speech caused a retreat in stock index futures after an advance earlier in the session, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened around the 2,577 level, the March contract on the FT-SE moved forward, taking a firm overnight on Wall Street as its cue. However, nervousness about the Budget statement caused March to relinquish earlier gains and it retreated to 2,566. The positive opening on Wall Street led to dealers moving to cover positions which triggered a squeeze, sending the March contract forward to reach 2,592, the high point of the session. The contract retreated on the PSBR news following falls in the sterling and gilts markets. March closed at 2,570, down 4 on the previous session and around its fair value premium to cash of around 4. Further falls in the March contract were recorded in after-hours trading and dealers expect today's session to open lower. In LTOM, volume improved to 22,232 lots, with the FT-SE accounting for 7,639 contracts of the day's total. Among stock options, Amstrad traded 2,525 lots, with the June 30 puts particularly busy.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> THE END OF NATURE By Bill McKibben (Anchor: $9.95). Bill McKibben argues that  by altering the chemistry of the atmosphere with pollutants, humans have so  profoundly changed the Earth that the natural world no longer exists: Every  square inch of the planet has been irrevocably altered.  </P> <P> Sadly but rationally, he reflects on the biological, environmental and  psychological implications of his thesis. The greenhouse effect is causing the  climate to change more quickly than it ever has in the past, and no one knows  whether animals and plants (and humans) will be able to adapt to the rapidly  rising temperatures, highly acidic rain and increased exposure to ultraviolet  radiation. The most frightening aspect of this scenario is its irreversibility.  The recently passed Clean Air Accord only slows the rate at which pollutants  are added to the atmosphere. Even if the burning of fossil fuels ceased today,  the climate would continue to warm and the ozone layer to deteriorate for  decades (the chlorofluorocarbons already in the air will remain there for at  least another century). Mankind has casually launched a juggernaut, and  McKibben offers a warning of what will follow and an elegy for what has passed.  </P></p>

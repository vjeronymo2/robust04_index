			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Texas Instruments plans Dollars 1bn plant TEXAS INSTRUMENTS yesterday announced plans to build one of the world's largest semiconductor plants in Dallas, Texas. Construction will begin this year. The plant is expected to cost between Dollars 750m (Pounds 506m) and Dollars 1bn during the next five years. TI is the fourth US chip maker to announce plans for big new plants this year. In April, Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, said that it would build a Dollars 1bn addition to its factory in New Mexico. Advanced Micro Devices followed in July, saying its next plant, to be built in Texas, would cost between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn. Motorola is putting a Dollars 1bn investment into a Texas plant that will combine research and production. These investments reflect booming demand for semiconductor chips. Worldwide sales are expected to increase by more than 20 per cent this year to about Dollars 80bn. They also signal the rising strength of US manufacturers. Japanese semiconductor producers, who outspent their US competitors in the 1980s, have now been overtaken by US producers. US semiconductor industry capital expenditures are projected to increase by 37 per cent to more than Dollars 5.5bn this year, accord-ing to Integrated Circuit Engineering, a US market research firm. Japanese companies plan to spend Dollars 4.2bn on new plants and equipment, an increase of 2 per cent on last year. Capital spending by the European semiconductor industry is expected to total about Dollars 1.1bn, up 6 per cent. The cost of new semiconductor production plants has escalated during the past few years, total costs rising from about Dollars 250m in 1990 to nearly Dollars 1bn today. Much of the increase is due to more sophisticated production equipment. Only the world's largest semiconductor producers can now afford to keep pace. By the end of the century there may be fewer than a dozen state-of-the-art chip factories in the world, industry executives predict. Texas Instruments' expansion plans are typical. The company's new Dallas facility will be built in two phases, construction of the first phase beginning immediately, followed by an expansion that will more than double the size of the plant. When it reaches full production in 1998, the plant will employ about 550 people, TI said. The new plant will eventually produce chips as small as 0.12microns, or 800 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair - about one quarter the size of today's most advanced chips.</p>

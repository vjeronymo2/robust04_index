			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Baird's withdrawl catches some 'on the hop' Cartoonist Garry Trudeau was among many caught on the hop by Zoe Baird's midnight withdrawal. His Doonesbury strip this week has featured Ms Baird already in office as attorney general. Mr Trudeau normally delivers his strips 10 days in advance and Ms Baird will feature again in today's cartoon. But those already delivered for use later next week, also about her, will be replaced.</p>

During the past year, more than 2,900 enterprises were sold  or merged through the 16 property rights exchange centers in  cities like Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Shenzhen.  Altogether 400,000 workers have been relocated.    State-owned assets still make up the biggest proportion of  total social assets in China today. The assets are under the  mandate of central or local governments, or various  administrative ministries.    However, under the old planned economic system, state-owned  enterprises did not have enough latitude to decide their own  management affairs and their fixed assets could not be  circulated on the market.    It is estimated that about a third of the state-owned  enterprises are running at a loss while another third are  running with poor management.    The transfer of property rights is mainly conducted by way  of  enterprise mergers or transformation into a share-holding  system. In the 1980s, more than 6,900 enterprises were merged,  with over eight billion yuan of property rights transferred.    Consequently, 4,095 enterprises came out of the red and the  annual level of losses by state-owned enterprises was reduced by  522 million yuan.    In addition, some other practical methods such as contract  and leasing systems have been taken to revitalize state-owned  enterprises and at the same time to prevent the drain of state  fixed assets.    With regard to the share-holding system, in which China  began  pilot schemes in the mid-1980s, the government had approved the  setting up of 13,000 share-holding companies by the end of 1993.    By the end of last year, a total of 122 companies, with  208.6  billion yuan in capital, listed their stocks on the Shenzhen or  Shanghai stock exchanges. So far some 25 million Chinese people  are involved in stock transactions.    Hainan, designated to be a province by the State Council in  1988 and now China's largest economic zone, is striving to  become a regional center for property rights transactions.    The province has about 3,000 state or collectively owned  enterprises, one third of which are running at a loss. Experts  say that the small proportion of state-owned enterprises makes  them easy to be auctioned or merged without too much social  impact.    By the end of 1992, the province had more than 2,000  foreign-  funded enterprises and 83,400 industrial and commercial  enterprises dealing with various industrial sectors, retail  selling, catering trade, tourism, and real estate. The  bankruptcy of firms has made transactions in property rights a  brisk business.    The province now has ten auction institutions, with fairly  experienced auction businessmen, for these transactions.    Specialists and bodies handling property assessment,  transaction notarization and property lawsuits have also come  into being.    So far, the province has 30 bar associations, a dozen  accountancy offices and some 50 auditing offices.    To coordinate the transactions, the province has set up a  unified social insurance system covering workers in varied  ownership sectors. The system deals with unemployment,  pensions, medical care and injuries at work.    Sichuan is also one of the country's first provinces to  implement trial reforms in the transfer of property rights of  enterprises.    In 1993 alone, 408 enterprises in the province eliminated  losses and began to create profits after their property rights  were transferred.    With the development of the property rights business, China  has promulgated a series of relevant laws and regulations on  bankruptcy, company and state enterprises.    Economists believe that the development of the property  rights business will play a more and more important role in  re-organization of the country's production factors and in  raising its productivity.</p>

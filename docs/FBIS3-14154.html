			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 23 Mar (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak today  received a letter from Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat.    Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa stated this after receiving the  letter during his meeting today with Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser.    Musa said he and Dr. Sha'th discussed recent developments  from the Palestinian and Israeli points of views and the  situation in Hebron.    On the other hand, Dr. Sha'th stated that he has come to  Cairo to continue the negotiations started in Tunis to insure  the speedy implementation of the Security Council resolution  [904] and provide the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab  territories, especially in Hebron, with protection in view of  the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.    He noted that today's meetings, as well as the conference  for  supporting the Palestinian police that will begin in Cairo  tomorrow, will focus on providing safety and security for the  Palestinian people, particularly in Hebron.    Dr. Sha'th said that the Palestinian delegation under his  chairmanship and the Israeli delegation under the chairmanship  of Amnon Shahaq, the Israeli chief of staff, will hold a meeting  later today to resume the Tunis negotiations on implementing the  Security Council resolution and insuring protection for the  Palestinian people.    He added that tomorrow's meeting is to decide on the number  of Palestinian policemen needed to keep the peace in the  Palestinian territories. It has become clear after the Hebron  massacre that there is a dire need for Palestinian policemen who  are capable of establishing security.    Sha'th described the Security Council resolution on the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre as good, despite the U.S.  reservations.    He said it is the first resolution that provides certain  elements of international protection for the Palestinian people.  It asks the Israeli side to provide protection to the  Palestinian people.    On Israel's proposal to provide an international presence in  the occupied territories by extending the term of  representatives from the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief  and Works Agency in the occupied territories, Sha'th said that  the presence of these two organizations does not obviate the  need for international presence as stipulated in the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the Security Council  resolution. He noted the continued suffering of the people in  Hebron, who have curfews imposed on them.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Groups of protesters, members of the Alfa Cartel  Trade Union Confederation, CNSLR [National Confederation of Free  Unions in Romania]-Fratia, and the National Trade Union Bloc  [BNS], began gathering in Aviatorilor Square in Bucharest this  morning . Among the protesters our correspondents also spotted a  group of miners who had come from Hunedoara. Also represented  are the trade unions of Copsa Mica and others from the counties  of Mehedinti, Galati, and other regions.    From the makeshift rostrum in Aviatorilor Square the crowd  was addressed by Alfa Cartel Chairman Bogdan Hossu, CNSLR-Fratia  Chairman Victor Ciorbea, [CNSLR-Fratia] Executive Chairman Miron  Mitrea, and other trade union leaders. They all criticized the  Vacaroiu government, considering it solely responsible for the  economic and social disaster currently facing Romania's citizens.    At about 1200 the participants in the rally left Aviatorilor  Square to march on the Victoriei Square-Romana Square-Revolutiei  Square route. They are to return to Victoriei Square where --  in accordance with the alterations in the program arranged by  the organizers of today's protests -- another rally is to take  place.    Both during the rally held in Aviatorilor Square and the  march, the participants chanted antigovernment,  antipresidential, and anticommunist slogans, our correspondents  report.</p>

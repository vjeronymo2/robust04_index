			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Anti-monopoly moves in Japan JAPAN'S Fair Trade Commission, the country's competition watchdog, yesterday brought the first criminal charges under its anti-monopoly law in a case of alleged bid-rigging. The charges against four top printing companies said to have been involved in rigging bids to supply the Social Insurance Agency follows domestic and foreign criticism of the commission's failure to take legal action in past cases. The US government has persistently called on the commission to take tougher action against any cartels which may block foreign companies' entry into the Japanese market. The commission provoked a storm of domestic criticism last year when it failed to take legal action under the anti-monopoly law in a bid-rigging case involving several construction companies. The four printing companies, Dai Nippon Printing, the industry leader, Toppan Moore, Kabayshi Kirokushi and Kitachi Information Systems have been charged under Article 3 of the law which bans practices unfairly limiting market transactions. The four companies are alleged to have rigged bids to supply special seals for pension documents, worth about Y6.1bn (Pounds 35.6m) between 1989 and 1992. It is thought the companies made excess profits of about Y1.5bn from the deal. The specific charges relate to alleged bid-rigging between May and September last year. The FTC's action, which follows normal criminal proceedings against executives from the companies involved, is unlikely to mark the start of a more legalistic approach. The commission decided on the legal action after the four companies had ignored informal guidance to refrain from the alleged bid-rigging. The four companies face the charges because they are seen to have flouted the commission's authority. If the companies are found guilty they could face fines up to Y10m (Pounds 58,000) each or their executives could be sentenced to prison terms of up to five years. In addition to the criminal charges, the FTC plans to impose administrative penalties on the companies, which could include deducting profits. The Social Insurance Agency has banned the companies from its contracts for two years.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ferfin cuts debt by near 30% Capital increases and asset sales enabled Ferruzzi Finanziaria, the financial holding company of Italy's Montedison industrial group, to cut debt in the first six months of this year by nearly 30 per cent to L15,768bn (Dollars 10bn). At end-1993, Ferfin's debt stood at L21,951bn, or 5.5 times net equity. The debt-equity ratio had come down to 1.7 by June 30. Last year creditor banks of Ferfin and Montedison agreed to convert some of their loans into equity to rescue the group from near-collapse following years of alleged mismanagement. Ferfin also reported a return to pre-tax profit of L144bn in the first half, compared with a loss of L840bn in the first six months of 1993. The group said that it expected the second half to be even better than the first, but warned that the net result of the group would still be negative. In 1993, Ferfin reported a consolidated net loss of L2,419bn, and Montedison a net loss of L1,611bn. In the first half Ferfin's turnover rose to L11,431bn, against L11,489bn.</p>

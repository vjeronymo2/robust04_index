			<p>930630 FT  30 JUN 93 / Letter: Potentially painful position Sir, The new chancellor, in his FT interview ('A rounded bloke at the Treasury', June 25), declared his to be 'essentially a political post', but did not feel disqualified from handling monetary policy, which is essentially technical - like the administration of justice - and must be non-political to achieve the best results. Small wonder, in the debate over an independent Bank of England left to conduct monetary policy free from political interference, Clarke acknowledged himself to be 'sitting on the fence' - an uncomfortable position, nevertheless, if maintained for any length of time.

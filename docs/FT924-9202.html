			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: News Corp continues to advance NEWS Corporation, the international publishing and film group controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, has continued its strong recovery by more than doubling net earnings in the September quarter. Newspaper, magazine and television results rose strongly, and the company yesterday declared a 101 per cent lift in operating profit to ADollars 216.1m (USDollars 154.30m) from ADollars 107.5m in the period. The result, in spite of a 2.6 per cent fall in revenue to ADollars 2.59bn from ADollars A2.66bn reflecting the sale of businesses, was mainly due to two factors: Net interest fell to ADollars 206.2m from ADollars 255.5m following reduced borrowings and lower interest rates, asset sales, capital raisings and refinancings; The result included a large turnround - to an ADollars 36.1m profit from an ADollars 39.6m loss - from equity accounted investments, including BSkyB in the UK and Ansett Transport Industries and Pacific Magazines and Printing in Australia. Newspapers enhanced their position as the biggest earners, with operating income up to ADollars 164.3m from ADollars 122.9m. Magazines and inserts followed with income up to ADollars 96.1m from ADollars 80.1m, and television income rose to ADollars 72.9m from ADollars 52.3m. However, income from the HarperCollins book publishing division fell to ADollars 82.0m from ADollars 101.7m and filmed entertainment income was down to ADollars 15.8m from ADollars 48.5m. The US remained the main profit centre, although operating income fell to ADollars 246.2m from ADollars 269.2m. Fox Broadcasting and Fox Television increased earnings, but profits fell at Twentieth Century Fox Films. Australian and Pacific Basin income also declined, to ADollars 76.6m from ADollars 89.7m, but adjusted for the float of 55 per cent of the company's magazine and commercial printing operations, profits in Australia and Hong Kong rose 16 per cent. UK income rose to ADollars 109.6m from ADollars 61.3m, with newspaper profits up 35 per cent on higher operating margins, reflecting the first full quarter's benefits from operating and printing plant efficiencies and lower newsprint prices. The 50 per cent-owned BSkyB turned a loss into a profit. Weekly revenues exceeded Pounds 6bn (Dollars 9.3bn), with more than 80 per cent from subscriptions. Directors indicated that Pacific Magazines and Printing performed ahead of projections in spite of a soft advertising market, and the 50 per cent-owned Ansett Transport Industries returned to profit through better yields. The News result followed a tax provision of ADollars 30.8m, compares with ADollars 8.0m, and depreciation of ADollars 57.6m, against ADollars 58.1m. It excluded an abnormal loss of ADollars 22.4m mainly reflecting unrealised foreign exchange losses. News shares closed at a 1992 high of ADollars 28 on Australian stock exchanges yesterday, up 20 cents. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 11 May (AKP) -- His Majesty Norodom  Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, has disclosed that massive  corruption also exists within Khmer Rouge ranks.    At an audience with the representatives of the losing  parties  in the general elections and the Muslim and the Chinese  communities in Phnom Penh on 7 May, the king rejected an  allegation made by some that "leaders of the FUNCINPEC [National  United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and  Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the Cambodian People's Party  [CPP] are corrupt, while the Khmer Rouge [KR] are good."    "The revenue acquired by the Khmer Rouge from the sale of  precious stones and logs has not been used to serve the people  at all," said the king, adding that money pocketed by the group  has not been spent to build schools, bridges, roads,  monasteries, but to purchase arms and ammunition.    "Besides, nonscientific exploitation of the precious stones  in Pailin accorded by the Khmer Rouge to foreign entrepreneurs  has led to the pollution of the Sangke river and a large part of  the Tonle Sap lake," said the king, who also denounced the  perfidious maneuvers of the Khmer Rouge, who massacres its own  people under the pretext of attacking Vietnam.    His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk calls for an end to the  confrontation between the Khmer Rouge and other Cambodians to  promote a climate of mutual comprehension, thereby achieving  national reconciliation.    The king underlined that the internal conflict only benefits  neighboring countries. He called on all Cambodians to accept a  roundtable meeting or new general elections.</p>

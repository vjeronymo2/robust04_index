			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / US Money and Credit: Fast reactions from worried politicians CRAZY things are supposed to happen in election years. Certainly the near-instantaneous cut in the US discount rate which accompanied appalling unemployment figures released last Thursday, smacked of some very worried politicians. For the bond market, however, this meant that July 4 fireworks arrived a few days early. A very sharp rally in bond prices began at 8.30am, as soon as the Labor Department figures hit the screens. By the end of the day, the benchmark longbond had gained almost 1 1/2 points, while its yield had slumped from 7.74 per cent to 7.63 per cent. This was the lowest closing yield for the issue since late January. In other parts of the bond market, reaction was even more marked. At the short end, for example, the rate on three-month Treasury bills slumped to 3.24 per cent, said to be the lowest since the early 1970s. The point is that no one now expects Thursday's cut to be the last. The unemployment data were truly awful - showing that employers cut payrolls by 117,000 last month, pushing the unemployment rate up to 7.8 per cent in May, from 7.5 per cent in April. Most pundits had been looking for an improvement in the jobs situation last month; instead, the unemployment rate stands at an eight-year high. Worse, this news came on the heels of some other disappointing data, underlining the widespread weakness in the economy. The June index from the National Association of Purchasing Managers, for instance, suggested that although the manufacturing sector grew last month, the rate of increase was lower than in May. And, at the beginning of the week, housing statistics showed that new home sales fell for the fourth month in a row, putting May's levels about 20 per cent below their January peak. But at least part of the jobs problem is structural, suggesting that 'a quick fix' will be tough to achieve. A number of leading industries - from banking to airlines - are undergoing very significant consolidations at present, shedding jobs and reducing capacity en route. Cheap money is unlikely to alter this process. Equally, sizeable cutbacks in defence spending continue to hurt; only last week, Hughes Aircraft Corporation announced that it would axe around 15 per cent of its workforce over the next 18 months - in excess of 9,000 jobs. So it is highly questionable whether Thursday's cut of 50 basis points in the discount rate, to 3 per cent, will be enough. Most pundits suggest that the speed of Thursday's response indicates that the Federal Reserve has now abandoned its neutral stance towards interest rate policy, even if officials are still divided. 'The Fed's kneejerk reaction to reduce the discount rate . . . says a great deal more about the Fed than the state of the US economy,' comment analysts at Nomura. 'To respond so quickly . . . indicates a state of near-panic among the Fed governors. It measures the extent of their desire to achieve economic growth at the expense of other economic objectives.' Mr Robert Brusca, at Nikko Securities, puts the point more bluntly still. 'Mr Greenspan (Federal Reserve chairman) is in very hot water. The Federal Reserve he has presided over may have botched recovery on two separate occasions, and now he must testify before the house and senate banking committees beginning on July 21. This does not give him much time to act.' Like virtually every pundit on Wall Street, Mr Brusca suggests that further easing will follow - the only question being when. It is after all, an election year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Carlos Roberto Reina in </F> Tegucigalpa -- live or recorded]    [Text] I am appearing before you today to tell you I have  instructed the national defense and public security minister to  go early tomorrow morning to the National Congress and submit a  bill amending Article 276 of Constitution, whereby a voluntary,  educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military service  will be established in Honduras. The aforementioned  constitutional article reads as follows: Military service is  obligatory for citizens 18-30 years old. A special law will  regulate this.    I am certain the legislators of my fatherland will approve  this constitutional amendment, allowing my government to begin a  new historic phase in the fulfillment of the fundamental civic  duty of serving and defending the fatherland. Congressional  approval of the constitutional amendment I am introducing will  also constitute an important landmark in relations between  civilian society and the military institution.    The young men of Honduras and their parents can rest assured  that with this amendment there will be no more forced  recruitments, as has been done traditionally. We must all be  aware that the elimination of obligatory military service in no  way means the termination of an inescapable duty for all  Hondurans -- the duty to serve and defend the fatherland.  Honduras needs a quantitatively and qualitatively capable and  competent Armed Forces. Our young men must regard the Armed  Forces as an institution offering a great many opportunities for  their overall development.    A voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic  military service reconciles the fulfillment of duty with  legitimate aspirations that encourage every young man to do his  part for his fatherland based on his aptitude, merits, and  capabilities. By way of this constitutional amendment we are  requesting, our Armed Forces will represent an affirmative  manifestation of the immortal maxim of our greatest hero: Yes,  battles are won with volunteer soldiers.    My fellow countrymen: Implementing the constitutional bill  on  voluntary, educational, social, humanistic, and democratic  military service is a true manifestation of the faith the  Honduran people have in dialogue as an effective instrument to  renew our republican institutions, strengthen the rights of  human beings, and consolidate democracy. The constitutional  amendment has the patriotic support of all sectors  representative of society. I would like to present all of them  with a testament of my recognition for their valuable  contribution.    It is proper to acknowledge the cooperation provided by the  National Congress president and first vice president, the  commander in chief and top officers of the Honduran Armed  Forces, the members of the cabinet, and the presidential  advisers who joined the commission that drafted this bill, which  basically reads: Article 276 -- Citizens 18-30 years old will  fulfill their military service in a voluntary manner during  peacetime, under an educational, social, humanistic, and  democratic system. The state has the power to call citizens  into the military ranks in accordance with the law. In the case  of a war between nations, all Hondurans capable of defending and  serving the fatherland are soldiers.    My fellow countrymen: By submitting the constitutional  amendment bill which establishes a voluntary, educational,  social, humanistic, and democratic military service, I am  keeping one of the key promises of my presidential campaign. I  said it as a candidate, and I am reiterating now as the  constitutional president of the Republic. I am going to keep my  promise. I am committed to doing so. I have the support of the  government team, and, most of all, I have the support of the  people and the protection of God. The president will not fail  you. Thank you very much.</p>

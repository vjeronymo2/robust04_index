			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEA VIEW LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SEA KINGS STOP NO. 7 SADDLEBACK  </P> <P> If Corona del Mar High School's 41-35 Sea View League victory over Saddleback  proved anything Friday night, it was that woeful, bumbling starts can be  overcome -- no matter who you're playing.  </P> <P> For host Corona del Mar (11-6 overall, 2-0 in league play), the upset over the  county's seventh-ranked team seemed to come almost as a surprise. Saddleback  (12-7, 1-1), the league's two-time defending champion, has not lost to Corona  del Mar since 1987, and Corona del Mar Coach Paul Orris admitted that negative  thinking might have been creeping in to his team's mind-set.  </P> <P> "You start second-guessing yourself, I think," Orris said. "You start wondering  if you're ever going to beat them."  </P> <P> Corona del Mar need not wonder anymore. Although the Sea Kings played a  skittish first half -- they often seemed a half-step behind -- they still  managed a 19-18 halftime lead.  </P> <P> The start of the third quarter didn't look much better. Both teams, plagued  with turnovers, seemed out of sync offensively. But with 2:30 remaining, Corona  del Mar found its groove, going on an 8-0 run that left Saddleback behind,  31-24.  </P> <P> Although Saddleback went to a full-court press in the fourth quarter, Corona  del Mar remained poised. Saddleback missed seven of 11 free throws and did not  score a field goal in the quarter until Andre McFarlane (11 points) hit a  three-pointer with 11 seconds remaining to cut Corona del Mar's lead to 41-33.  </P> <P> Orris praised his team's defensive effort -- it held Saddleback to 30% shooting  from the field -- as well as the play of Jackson, who led all scorers with 19  points, and Warren Johnson, who held Saddleback forward Jimmy Galbert to five  points.  </P> <P> "Warren Johnson did a great job on Galbert," Orris said. "We weren't sure,  matchup wise, who could guard him. I just challenged Warren to take him.  Galbert tried to throw Warren around, but he just maintained his composure. . .  .  </P> <P> "This is not the best win we've had, but it's an important one."  </P> <P> Corona del Mar, which moves into a first-place tie with Tustin, also had 10  points from Jon Upham.  </P> <P> Estancia 86, University 62 -- Agustin Heredia scored 28 points to lead host  Estancia (10-6, 1-1). Mike Haas added 19 and Paul McDaniels 16 for Estancia.  Estancia led, 33-27, at the half and outscored University, 26-17, in the third  quarter.  </P> <P> Tustin 65, Newport Harbor 58 -- Tustin trailed, 46-41, to start the fourth  quarter but outscored host Newport Harbor, 24-12, in the final quarter. Robert  Laubach led the way in the final quarter for Tustin, making 10 of 11 free  throws. David Beilstein led Tustin (15-2, 2-0) with 18 points. Eddie Martinez  scored 17 for Newport Harbor (11-6, 0-2).  </P></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The princess and the peeping toms / Finding the voyeurism of the British media offensive LAST MONDAY the many millions who watched ITN's news bulletin were unwittingly and at a stroke turned into voyeurs. The television company had - at who knows what price? - bought films from some international peeping-tom, showing the Princess of Wales stripping off at the side of the swimming-pool of the British embassy in Cairo. The peeping-tom effect was enhanced by the fact that the film was framed by bushes in the shape of a keyhole - the cover for ITN's paparazzi. Inadequate cover, as it happened, because the Princess eventually noticed the intrusive lens, and rushed away from the pool, understandably very upset. Naturally, ITN did not have the courage to show this part of the film - it is important to their conceit that viewers should not realise they are party to a deeply resented intrusion. I don't want to sound too much like Sir Bufton Tufton, Private Eye's imaginary Tory right winger, but I cannot believe that in the golden days of Sir Alastair Burnet, ITN would ever have dreamt of such an illicit piece of snooping. Illicit, but not technically illegal. In Britain we have no privacy laws, except, anomalously, in the field of computerised information. The French do have such laws, which may explain - if good food doesn't  - the decisions of characters such as the Duke of Windsor and Sir Oswald Mosley to settle there. Perhaps it also explains why France has no newspaper quite like the Sun, which excelled itself in hypocrisy on the morning following ITN's drooling poolside voyeurism. 'Diana's fury at TV peak show' was the front-page headline. And, of course, inside, the newspaper published stills of the film, which, as they themselves report, so distressed the Princess. Another paper reported that, while Fleet Street's finest had turned a blind lens, freelance paparazzi had been led up to a long-distance vantage-point by Egyptian security men - in exchange for a peek through the zoom lens at the undressing Princess. ITN had clearly decided that their viewers were on the same moral level, as these venal Egyptian 'security' men, and perhaps they are right, though I doubt it. It has long become clear that the popular press, and perhaps now the television companies, are obsessed with the Princess of Wales, subjecting her to far more scrutiny, intrusion and comment than any other members of the royal family, including the monarch. And even newspapers such as The Times, fired by the arrival of overnight colour-printing, do not like a week to pass by without a picture of the Princess of Wales. The main reason, I suspect, is no more complicated than the fact that the lady is astoundingly beautiful and photogenic. But it cannot be right to reduce her to the level of a kind of royal Brigitte Nielsen. Unlike the starlet, the Princess does not wish her partly clothed body to be the fantasy of men from Egypt to Edgeworth, and, unlike her husband and many of her in-laws, she does not go on television programmes and chat shows to promote some new book or collection of etchings. The spokesman for ITN, Glyn Mathias, said last week, when asked to justify the use of his company's peeping-tom journalism: 'There was a legitimate news interest.' Mathias was, I am sure, referring to the forthcoming book on the Princess of Wales by a Mr Andrew Morton, about which every British newspaper, with the exception of the FT and the similarly high-minded Independent, has been agog for weeks. According to advance reports, the book's most astounding claim is that, some years ago, the Princess of Wales attempted suicide. If that is true, one would not have to be a qualified psychiatrist to hazard that such despair could have been the result of the constant, intense and heartless intrusion of the press and television into the Princess's private life. But somehow I do not expect the journalistic 'royal rat pack' to press this point. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

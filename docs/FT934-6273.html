			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (2): Push comes to shove - The insurance market Nudged and prodded by new European Community rules, the Belgian insurance market is edging into the harsh light of liberalisation. The transformation is likely to be dramatic. Until recently, the country's insurance control authorities had to vet tariffs and conditions before a new policy could be launched, limiting insurers' creativity. Unit-linked life insurance policies were not allowed. Motor insurance tariffs were among the most rigid in Europe: until last year a 22-year-old boy-racer burning up the back streets of Brussels' roughest quartier was subject to roughly the same tariffs and conditions as a 53-year-old spinster poodling round the picturesque Ardennes. With the EC already framing legislation to liberalise the insurance market, a 'round table' of all those involved in the Belgian insurance market was convened in 1990, with the objective of laying the foundation for deregulation in Belgium. The result has been a pile of technical and fiscal reform, coming on top of the EC liberalisation programme which comes into full effect in the middle of next year. There are still teething problems. The non-life sector is barely profitable, and most large Belgian insurers agree that the Belgian authorities will have to allow greater increases in fire and car insurance premiums. At the same time, the right to discriminate between car insurance policy-holders has created an underclass of high-risk drivers who are almost uninsurable. As a result of years of rigid controls, the insurance market is strangely underdeveloped compared with the rest of northern Europe. Whether expressed in terms of premium per inhabitant, or as a share of gross national product, the Belgian insurance sector is less than half as important as the British market, and lags behind its French, Dutch and German counterparts. Belgium's extensive system of social security and pensions also means that the market for life insurance has not developed as quickly. Life business represents only a third of the BFr330bn of premium income in Belgium, compared with 55 per cent in the Netherlands. Insurance brokers - the principal distribution network in Belgium - have tended to concentrate on the sale of non-life policies. But although Belgium is a small country, it is also a comparatively wealthy one. Belgians are among the world's biggest savers (up there with the Japanese and the Swiss). 'One can take a pessimistic or an optimistic view,' says Mr Wautier Robyns of the UPEA, trade association of the Belgian insurance industry. 'There's not a lot of insurance awareness among the Belgian public - but compared with surrounding countries there's plenty of room for development of the Belgian market.' That does not necessarily mean that Belgium is waiting to be consumed by powerful outsiders. In fact, other than insurance companies linked to trade unions or political parties, most of the 250 or so insurers operating in Belgium are either subsidiaries of, or already have strong links with groups outside the country. Belgium's two largest quoted insurers are AG and Royale Belge. AG is part of the Fortis joint venture with Amev, the Dutch financial services group. Royale Belge is controlled by UAP, the French insurer. Both AG and Royale Belge are gearing up for the challenge of liberalisation. Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, chief executive of Royale Belge, says the UAP connection means that his company will be 'better protected' than many others once the single market in insurance is declared open next summer. Mr Maurice Lippens, chairman and chief executive of AG, believes that competition is already so fierce that it will be very difficult for new companies to set up. Many smaller units of large non-Belgian companies have already been forced to pull out of the Belgian market, he points out: 'It's all very well to have a nice map of the world and put flags all over it, but it just doesn't work, unless you have a substantial percentage of the market and a back-up office.' But that does not mean that the large insurers are resting on their laurels. Instead they are in a fierce battle for the life business and their main weapon is bancassurance. Most of the Belgian banks now have some links with the insurance sector. The principle is simple: to sell basic 'stock' insurance products through ordinary branches. Fire and life insurance, for example, can be linked to more traditional banking products, such as mortgages. The aim is to unlock some of those famous Belgian savings. 'For the private consumer, going into a bank branch is part of daily life, but going to put a question to an insurance broker is less common,' points out Mr Robyns of the UPEA. The Belgian consumers' association is backing the initiative, and opposes plans for unnecessarily restrictive legislation which might oblige bank staff to become qualified insurance intermediaries. The association believes that would impose extra costs, deter the banks from entering the market, and drive customers back to the brokers, whose expertise in selling life products has been much criticised. Fortis claims to have won itself a head start in this potentially lucrative market by buying from the government a 50 per cent stake in CGER-ASLK, a network of banking and insurance branches, earlier this year. With CGER-ASLK already claiming 14 per cent of the Belgian market in personal life insurance, and Fortis adding a further 12 per cent, Mr Lippens believes the other banks and insurers will have difficulty catching up. Mr Gerard, unsurprisingly, begs to differ. His company has joined Winterthur, the Swiss insurance group, in a bancassurance deal with Banque Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's three largest banks. He says the alliance is at an early stage, but foresees a healthy future. He also believes there may be short-term problems marrying the different cultures, wages and personnel of Fortis and CGER-ASLK, although in the medium term it is clear he sees Fortis as a tough competitor in bancassurance. As the UPEA points out, Europe's single market initiative has 'really shaken up the Belgian market'. The next few years will reveal how many home-grown insurers are strong enough to survive.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Northamber cuts loss to Pounds 495,000 Northamber, the computer equipment distributor, reduced its pre-tax loss by half, from Pounds 980,000 to Pounds 495,000, in the six months to October 31, thanks to increased sales, a decline in bad debts, and cost savings. Turnover rose 13.5 per cent to Pounds 45.3m (Pounds 39.9m). Mr David Phillips, chairman, would not comment on when Northamber was likely to move back into the black, but said he was 'quietly confident' about the performance in the current six months. There is no interim dividend.</p>

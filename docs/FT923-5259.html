			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Survey of Aerospace (4): Price-cutting war becomes fiercer - Airlines head for third year of losses THE AIRLINE industry is still suffering from the extended hangover of the general economic recession and the air travel slump caused by the Gulf conflict last year. Although traffic showed signs of recovery during the first half of this year, capacity is still outstripping passenger demand; and airlines are engaged in a fierce fares discounting war, to maintain market share in anticipation of an eventual rebound in business. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) - the industry's trade organisation, grouping more than 200 international airlines - has warned that, for the third consecutive year, airlines are likely to report a big loss on international scheduled services in 1992. The latest estimates put the 1992 loss at around Dollars 2bn. This is not as high as the record Dollars 4bn loss reported by the industry in 1991, the worst year in the history of aviation, which followed a loss of Dollars 2.7bn in 1990; but it is still a disappointing and worrying performance. 'The financial recovery will be crucial to the ability of the airlines to offer better services, more tailored to consumer needs,' warns Mr Gunter Eser, IATA's outgoing director general. 'It is not a case of going from famine to feast. It would be good to see the airlines achieving merely the sort of return on their money invested that anybody could get by putting it in the post office,' he adds. After falling by 3 per cent last year - the first decline in air traffic since the introduction of the jet aircraft - passenger traffic has increased so far this year by 8 per cent and cargo by 4 per cent, compared with 1990, the year before the slump provoked by the Gulf conflict. But this traffic growth has not matched the rise in overall capacity, which is 12 per cent higher than in 1990. In a nutshell, the fundamental problem of the industry is that too many aircraft are flying with empty seats. The response of most airlines to the slow recovery in traffic has been to cut costs in an effort to improve productivity. Nearly 50,000 jobs were lost in the industry in 1991 as a result of restructuring. But these moves have not been sufficient to offset the pressures of overcapacity in the market. The financial problems of airlines, especially of the weaker carriers, coupled with increasing liberalisation and deregulation in the industry, are now expected to accelerate the general trend towards greater concentration in the industry, as well as the possibility of more airline bankruptcies. The last 18 months have seen a number of airlines disappear, including famous names like Pan Am and Eastern, and younger ones like Air Europe. Several US airlines are struggling under the protection of the US bankruptcy laws. Others are scrambling to forge partnership and strategic alliances with other airlines, to build up their critical mass and compete in an increasingly global airline market. Even a profitable airline such as British Airways has been anxious to negotiate international partnerships to strengthen its overall competitive position. BA , which has been actively looking for allies in Europe, the US and the Asia Pacific region, successfully forged this summer a transatlantic alliance with USAir, the sixth largest US carrier. BA will be investing Dollars 750m in USAir to buy a 21 per cent voting stake as well as an equity stake of up to 44 per cent in the American carrier. BA had earlier unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a merger with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. It has also indicated it was interested in taking a stake in Qantas Airways, the Australian carrier. After more than 10 years of deregulation in the US, the American industry is already heavily concentrated around a handful of giant carriers, including, among the three largest, American Airlines, Delta and United Airlines. These carriers have now set their eyes firmly on expansion into the European market, which will be opened up to much greater competition next year following the recent approval of the European Commission's third package of air transport liberalisation measures. To respond to the challenge of giant US carriers - as well as large airlines from the Asia Pacific region, which has continued to enjoy above average traffic growth - the big European carriers believe it will be necessary for them to grow even bigger. 'At present, there are at least 60 airlines in Europe that matter: that's 40 too many,' says Mr Bernard Attali, the chairman of the Air France group, which in terms of annual turnover is Europe's biggest carrier. But consolidation is increasingly worrying European air transport regulators, who fear that this risks undermining the competition they are seeking to encourage through liberalisation. But liberalisation in Europe faces other obstacles. The two biggest are congestion in the skies, because of inadequate air traffic control systems; and crowded airports. Both threaten to squeeze out new entrants into the newly liberalised European air transport market. European governments are addressing the problem of air traffic control by seeking to harmonise and modernise the different systems. But the process is likely to take several years. In the meantime, air traffic control in Europe remains extremely fragile. 'The situation is critical for our industry,' says Mr Attali. 'You can't expect competition to work as long as there is congestion,' he adds. Crowded airports are another significant problem. The EC is attempting to draw up regulations to ensure that new entrants can secure take-off and landing slots at congested European airports like London Heathrow or Frankfurt. But most EC member states are objecting to such a system, which would include a proposal to confiscate slots from established carriers to hand them over to new entrants. The difficult financial situation of airlines and traffic growth artificially constrained by insufficient or badly used infrastructure could deprive the consumer of the benefits of liberalisation in Europe, the industry warns. 'We are heading for a formidable battle,' Mr Attali says. 'Deregulation in the EC will give consumers a good short-term deal with lower fares, but in the longer term it could have perverse effects, as it has had in the US.' Already the gap between low discounted fares and business or normal fares has widened. Businessmen are becoming increasingly frustrated by the high fares they pay to subsidise the discount business. 'Fed up with living in crowded skies and airports, the business traveller will one day say enough is enough, and will try to cut back on air travel,' says one international airline executive. A decline in business travel would have severe implications for the industry. Although businessmen account for only 20 per cent of all air travel, they provide between 50-60 per cent of all airline revenues, according to IATA estimates. After three terrible years, the industry is clearly hoping that there will eventually be a sharp recovery in traffic, as has been the case after previous down cycles. But it can no longer rely on recovery alone to resolve all its difficulties. 'If airlines want to survive in the longer term, they must behave like entrepreneurs and like any other industry, and adapt capacity to match demand,' argues Mr Eser. As businesses, the airlines can no longer continue defying all the laws of gravity.</p>

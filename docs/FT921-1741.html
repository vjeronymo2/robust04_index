			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Laporte to unveil further details of split with Solvay WHEN Laporte unveils its preliminary results tomorrow the British specialty chemicals group also plans to announce details of the proposal to deconstruct Interox, its Pounds 500m joint venture with Solvay, Belgium's largest chemicals company. The decision to dissolve one of the chemical industry's oldest joint ventures - it has lasted 21 years - follows a divergence of interests between the two groups. While Laporte has concentrated since the early 1980s on high-value low volume products, Solvay has stayed in the capital-intensive bulk chemicals arena. Under the terms of the deal presently being negotiated, Solvay will acquire Interox's bulk hydrogen peroxide and persalts businesses which have a turnover of about Pounds 200m. Laporte will acquire the subsidiary's organic peroxides and persulphates operations which have sales of about Pounds 65m. In addition, two-thirds of Solvay's 25 per cent stake in Laporte will be cancelled - equivalent to 16.7 per cent of the group - while the other third  -representing about 8.3 per cent - will be placed on the market. Laporte says both hydrogen peroxide, sold to the textiles and paper and pulp industries, and persalts, used mainly in detergents, do not fit into its strategy. The main problem is they are highly capital intensive. Interox's debt over the last five years has risen from Pounds 25m to more than Pounds 100m, with most of the increase being used to fund capital programmes in these two areas. Prices for hydrogen peroxide have also been falling as the area attracts more competition. The British company says Solvay is well placed within the sector because its caustic soda operations provide hydrogen as a by-product, offering an almost free resource for peroxide manufacture. It argues that the Belgian group's integrated operations will put it in a strong position to cope with a downward pressure on prices. In contrast, the two businesses Laporte is acquiring - organic peroxides, used as catalysts to manufacture polymers, and persulphates, required for the production of acrylic fibres - are not capital intensive. What they do require is the sort of sophisticated technical processes in which Laporte specialises. Laporte says these businesses fit into its strategy of investing in areas with high margins, strong cash-flow and a high technical content. Between 1980 and 1990, the proportion of Laporte's profits provided by specialty chemicals increased from a third to two-thirds. After Akzo, the Dutch company, Interox is the second largest European producer of organic peroxides with sales of about Pounds 45m a year. Laporte estimates the world market, which is growing annually at about 5 per cent, is worth about Dollars 750m (Pounds 434m). Interox is also the largest European supplier of persulphates, with sales of about Pounds 20m. Demand for the chemicals is increasing at about 7 per cent year, with a market valued at Dollars 120m. Laporte says the deal will not dilute earnings during the first year and should significantly enhance them afterwards. Last year Laporte earned a dividend of Pounds 18.7m from Interox. However, this should be offset by tax gains, a lower dividend bill because of the smaller equity base, and a reduced investment programme without the capital-intensive bulk hydrogen peroxide operations. The group also expects to make savings by closing Interox's manufacturing sites in Australia and Brazil, and concentrating its efforts in Munich and Teesside, where it is investing Pounds 15m over the next two years.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Personal View: Next steps for education I welcome the Financial Times' decision to devote four leading articles to education policy this month. They recognised the priority that education commands in British politics. Nevertheless, I was surprised at the writers' readiness to urge a pause in the reform of education in favour of consolidation around a 'new consensus emerging across the party divide'. To the extent that there is a new consensus, it has been built on the government's agenda for reform set in 1987 with the Education Reform Act. In just over three years The national curriculum framework has been virtually completed to the timetable first established. Tests for all seven-year-olds have been introduced and the main principles of tests at 14 have been settled. The principle of publishing test results is widely supported. Schools have been given greater autonomy through local management. Two thirds of secondary schools and one third of primary schools control their budgets; the rest will do so by April 1994 at the latest. Local management of schools has transformed their funding and management. Two hundred schools have taken the further step of acquiring Grant Maintained status as a means to wider managerial freedom - and are thriving on it. The numbers going on to higher education have been massively increased. None of this was considered possible in 1987. We started as we always seem to do when embarking on social reform in the UK with the usual trench warfare in support of old and unsatisfactory systems. The government has demonstrated that it is possible to reform education swiftly and effectively if the case for change is established and the objectives and timescales are clear. It has required hard work by teachers and administrators to maintain the pace of change. My aim now is to take forward the reform programme and maintain the momentum behind efforts to secure better standards. The impetus partly derives from issues thrown up by reform itself. I doubt that there would have been any serious thinking about classroom practice in primary schools without the motor of change produced by the introduction of the national curriculum. The case for a new national system of school inspection lies in the need to underpin the new autonomy of schools with a more rigorous system of quality assurance and accountability to parents. This strategy has to be built on logical steps. I propose that schools should play a bigger part in training future teachers, who need the experience that can only come from school-based work supervised by serving teachers. There have been experiments with this through the last decade, including the Articled Teachers' Scheme. We must apply the lesson of those experiments. I will want to think further about primary teacher training in the light of the report I published on Wednesday on primary school curriculum organisation and classroom practice. The same principle of more school-based training should apply to primary teachers as well. The test is whether the newly-qualified teacher has skills that can be made to work in the classroom. I have tried to take forward a debate about how primary school teachers have responded to the requirements of the national curriculum. The demands of the curriculum have made it clear that the ways in which primary pupils are taught and the ways their classes are organised are not always designed to get the best from children. There must be a new debate among teachers based on hard evidence about what approaches are effective and not on dogma about child-centred education. That is why I have published the report of the three wise men. I shall distribute it to primary schools and I hope it will form the agenda for considering and planning change. The Schools Bill - intended to implement the policies in the Parent's Charter - extends schools' 10-year-old obligation to publish information about their performance. More data will allow parents to see how schools perform relative to each other. Regular inspection is an essential supplement to information about performance - increasingly so as schools' autonomy grows. The Schools Bill lays down clear requirements about the frequency of inspection and the publication of reports. Her Majesty's Inspectorate will be responsible for overseeing the system. There will be national consistency; open, fair reporting; and accountability to parents. There is a good case for pressing forward with these changes. They maintain the fundamental direction of reform. I have always expected argument about their pace, cost and details, but the changes are part of the consensus, not a departure from it. There is wide agreement that we need radically to improve vocational education and training in post-16 education, and especially to increase staying-on rates. The first of the new general vocational qualifications will be introduced from September in some further education colleges and schools - and will be more widely available from September 1993. They will be designed mainly for young people in full-time education who want to keep career options open and will be of equal value and equal esteem to A levels. The government intends to bring in an Advanced Diploma from 1994 which will further strengthen the esteem of vocational routes to higher education and encourage breadth of study post-16. Legislation is being prepared to remove further education and sixth form colleges from local authority control to complete the process of devolution begun by the Education Reform Act. The government's aim is to give these colleges more flexibility, more freedom from town-hall bureaucracy and to endow them with the ability to respond better to growing demand from industry and students. The new funding arrangements will give the colleges every incentive to increase recruitment and widen choice. There should be no let-up in the pressure for better standards. The steps I am taking are not short-term measures served up on the altar of an approaching election. Each is justified on its own terms and is part of a strategy to sustain education reform. Improving teaching and learning remains the most urgent priority in education, and an important one for society. The author is secretary of state for education.</p>

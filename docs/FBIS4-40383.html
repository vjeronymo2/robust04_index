			<p>BFN     [Text] By the year 2010 the share of electricity generated  at nuclear power stations in Russia will grow to 30 or 35  percent compared to 14 percent last year. These figures were  disclosed at a Wednesday news conference in Moscow by the Deputy  Minister of Nuclear Energy Lev Ryabev.    According to the official, nuclear power engineering is  going  to expand as the production of oil and coal is going to decline;  experts predict that only gas extraction is going to grow: from  620 billion cubic meters now to 780 billion in 2010.    Between 2001 and 2009 Russia will shut down all nuclear  power  plants of the first generation. All of them were designed  before 1973 and do not meet modern safety norms. Such  generators are located at the Leningrad, Kursk, Novovoronezh and  Kola stations.    Ryabev said that power units of the third generation are now  being developed and are equipped with safety systems which do  not rely on human actions. The first power station of the third  generation should be built in 2000 or 2002.    The ministry is also working on reactors of the fourth  generation which according to Ryabev will be based on principles  of "natural safety." These plants would be designed so that no  escape of radiation is possible under any condition, the  minister said.    Russia is determined to develop a closed production circuit  in nuclear power engineering: Usable uranium will be extracted  from used fuel and most of the highly active wastes burned in  fast reactors.    Ryabev stressed that Russia has enough nuclear fuel to last  till the year 2020 and the uranium ore extracted in the Chita  Region is being exported. He said the ministry is open to the  question of changing forms of ownership. "So far nuclear  facilities are government property, but we are not ruling out  the possibility that they can be turned into joint-stock  companies or sold to private owners," Ryabev said.</p>

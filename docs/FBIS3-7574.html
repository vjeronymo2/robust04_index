He said, "I think that unfreezing  Japan's participation in peacekeeping forces (PKF) and carrying  out PKO, based on the five principles as efforts to contribute  to the international community, are the limits of the national  consensus." He further touched on the stand of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] on this issue and said: "The  SDPJ will agree to cooperate in election campaigns for the House  of Councilors. However, it may oppose the plan to review the PKO  (Cooperation Law)." Thus, Ichikawa reiterated his view that the  agreement between the coalition parties on defense, foreign  affairs, energy, and other basic policies are indispensable  prerequisites for the future establishment of a new-new party  [shin-shinto] and for cooperation in election campaigns for the  House of Councilors.    Ichikawa denied the possibility of dissolving the House of  Representatives to contest a general election under the present  multiple-seat constituency system, saying: "Some people are  hoping for such a situation. However, we would be trampling on  the people's will if we contest (elections) under the current  system after the enactment of the Political Reform Law. The  current situation will not result in the mass resignation of the  cabinet or the dissolution of the Diet."</p>

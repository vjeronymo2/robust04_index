			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Clouds gather over BAe A SPATE of negative stories drove British Aerospace down sharply. The fall started early as the market focused on a company presentation at Tuesday's aerospace and defence conference at Charterhouse Tilney, where the company had talked of problems in its civil aviation order book. The early doubts were quickly followed by unconfirmed speculation that BAe would issue a profits warning within the next few days. Sentiment was further weakened by reports that UBS Philips &amp; Drew was about to issue a sell note detailing large provisions likely to be required because of problems in the regional aircraft division. Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite is already predicting that BAe will have to make provisions of around Pounds 1bn for rationalisation and the regional aircraft subsidiary. He also believes the company will be forced to cut the dividend by 50 per cent, but he adds: 'The defence side continues to trade strongly.' The shares reacted by falling 20 but were helped off the bottom by bargain hunters and eventually settled 17 down at 250p after 5.6m traded. BP drilling fears British Petroleum shares, weakened on Tuesday by a series of profits downgrades by leading broking houses, were given further rough handling yesterday following reports that drilling at the company's latest operations in Colombia had been suspended for environmental reasons. Cusiana is widely regarded as one of BP's biggest exploration triumphs in recent years. At the close of business, BP was trading a net 6 lower at 238p, with specialists said to have been very nervous about the stock finishing below a previous long-standing closing support level of 240p. Turnover was a good 5.7m shares. Tobaccos upset Tobacco issues finished above the day's lows but still well down after the US Supreme Court ruled against them on liability from personal injury lawsuits by smokers. The court ruled that, in spite of the health warning printed on cigarette packets since 1966, the manufacturers are not protected against legal action. This could have important implications for the industry, with a possible 50 cases waiting to be heard in the US, seeking millions of dollars in damages. Rothmans 'B' ended 19 weaker at 1091p, while BAT Industries, with a larger exposure to the US tobacco market, lost 24 at 733p, after touching 705p. Turnover in BAT was a hefty 9.5m shares. Mr Simon Willis, analyst at County NatWest, said it is important to remember that the tobacco industry pushed for the case to be heard by the Supreme Court, believing it would be protected by the post-1966 health warning. Although this has proved wrong, he pointed out that each case will have to be decided individually, and as yet no big award has ever been made against the tobacco companies. Wellcome weak Speculation surrounding Wellcome's share offer, with some details due to be announced today, helped to weaken the shares, which dropped 18 to 913p. Although the drugs group is only due to indicate the size of the offer, talk in the market focused on the price, with most talk putting the shares at between 800p to 850p. At the moment, Wellcome Trust holds 75 per cent of the group and is today expected to relinquish up to two-thirds of its holding. A big agency cross in Granada saw 6.55m shares moved at 255p, while total turnover in the stock reached 17m with the price down 11 at 255p. More holiday price war worries knocked 13 off Airtours at 253p and a further 2 from Owners Abroad at 73 1/2 p. Solid results from First Leisure sent the shares forward, although they receded in late trading to close a net 3 up at 308p. Rank Organisation was in demand, edging a penny ahead to 670p in chunky volume of 2.5m. The latest news about the flotation of Lasmo's North American oil refining businesses triggered an initial flurry of selling which saw the shares down to 169p, but was quickly followed by covering of short positions taken out in the stock. The shares ran up to touch 177p but later slipped back to close 2 firmer on the day at 174p. Turnover was a hefty 5.3m shares. Another downgrade in publishing group Pearson, this time said to be from Cazenove, further depressed the shares, which closed 23 lower at 380p. A downgrade in RTZ left the shares 10 adrift at 584p. SG Warburg cut Pounds 30m from its profits forecast for this year to Pounds 355m and snipped its dividend forecast from 21p to 20.5p, blaming poor gold and copper prices. Some exceptionally heavy business associated with programme trade activity was said to have been behind the more excessive moves in banking shares. The UBS Phillips &amp; Drew buy recommendation boosted Abbey National 3 to 277p, but worries about exposure to losses in India continued to unsettle Standard Chartered, 6 off at 425p. Merchant banks gave further ground, SG Warburg ending 18 cheaper at 512p and Kleinwort Benson 5 lower at 286p. Reports of a broker profits downgrade left Redland 12 off at 498p. Dealers said some analysts had reduced their estimates to around Pounds 210m. The second line construction stocks included several weak performers, notably CALA, down 8 at 64p, and Costain, off 3 at 48p. Whitbread 'A' fell 8 to 411p in spite of comment by chairman Mr Sam Whitbread that 'we are beginning to see the first tentative signs that business may be looking up'. Bass, hit Tuesday by negative comments from Lehman Brothers, eased 3 to 595p, although Lehman's preferred companies, with more emphasis on the international spirits trade, fell even further. Guinness lost 11 to 558p and Allied-Lyons 8 to 641p. Ratners slipped another  1/2 to 7 1/2 p on further good turnover of 3.6m shares. The poor sentiment in British Aerospace spilled into Rolls-Royce, which declined 6 to 155p as turnover rose to 7.2m shares. A profits downgrading knocked Vickers down 8 to 139p. US investment bank Lehman Brothers reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 11m to Pounds 20m to reflect continued difficulties at the company's Rolls-Royce Motor Cars sub-sidiary. A profits warning by Henlys Group caused a slide in the shares of 22 to 55p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (15).

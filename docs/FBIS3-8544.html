			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Poland has reached an agreement with the London  Club, whose members are our commercial bank creditors.  Difficult negotiations have been going on for four years, and  finally last night there was a breakthrough. Agreement was  reached on the main conditions for settling the Polish debt.    These conditions include a comprehensive and realistic  reduction of the debt, according to the statement published this  morning. Mr. Krzysztof Krowacki, who led our delegation, says  the agreement fulfills the basic requirements of the Polish  side. First of all, our payments will be within the framework  of the projected capabilities of the balance of payments and the  state budget. They will be low in the first five years and will  remain low during the most intensive period of payments due in  accordance with agreements with the Paris Club. All of the  components of the debt have been reduced. Also reduced were the  costs of servicing the debt. Repayment periods will be longer,  payments per one unit of debt will be lower, and the debt itself  will be reduced further. The combined reduction of the debt  exceeds 45 percent.</p>

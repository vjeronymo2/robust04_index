			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Move to curb NHS drugs bill THE National Health Service will no longer pay for nicotine smoking cessation patches, under proposals announced by the government yesterday, Paul Abrahams writes. The proposal is part of a larger package detailing products which doctors will no longer be allowed to prescribe, part of the government's efforts to control the burgeoning NHS drugs bill which last year grew 14 per cent. The products range from Perrier, Malvern and Evian mineral waters to Ambre Solaire sun cream, aromatherapy massage oil, Johnson &amp; Johnson's prickly heat powder, and Pickles' nail bite lotion. Details of the drugs on the first of 10 categories on the new NHS blacklists were also given. The category, for topical anti-rheumatics, included 40 medicines. Among them were American Home Products' Algipan, SmithKline Beecham's Ralgex and its Beecham analgesic cream, Boots' Menthol and Wintergreen Embrocation, and Culpepper's Healing ointment. Companies and patient groups now have a month in which to respond.</p>

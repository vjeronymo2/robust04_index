			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chemex Intl swings back to the black Chemex International, the USM-traded chemical analysis company, swung from losses of Pounds 94,199 to profits of Pounds 49,046 pre-tax for the half year ended March 31. The turnround reflected both a 28 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 780,052 (Pounds 610,607) and the cost benefits of moving to new premises. The improved turnover figure was largely due to introducing products to a wider marketplace. Some 40 per cent of samples came from overseas, principally from Europe, Africa and east Asia. Earnings per share of 0.12p compared with previous losses of 0.24p. Comparative pre-tax losses took account of exceptional provisions of Pounds 43,038.</p>

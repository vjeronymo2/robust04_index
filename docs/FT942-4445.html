			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / International Company News: Steven Green renews link with Milken in Heron bid - Trusts belonging to the junk-bond king are among partners bidding for Heron Eight years ago Mr Michael Milken, then the unquestioned junk-bond king, backed a near-Dollars 200m deal which enabled Mr Steven Green to buy a string of supermarkets in California. Times have moved on. Last year, Mr Milken was released from jail after serving a sentence for securities-related offences, and is battling prostate cancer. Mr Green, meanwhile, has continued to add to a property empire built up over the past 20 years. This week, the connection was renewed. Mr Milken's family trusts (the beneficiaries are his three children) are among the members of a limited partnership put together by Mr Green to bid for Heron, the UK property group. 'Mike Milken financed one of my real estate transactions. He had an opportunity to see how we turned that investment into a very substantial profit to the participants,' Mr Green said yesterday. Until recently, Mr Green was little known outside US property circles. That changed in 1990, when he was thrust into the limelight as chairman of E-II, a holding company whose interests included the Samsonite luggage business, Culligan International, a maker of water purifiers, and the 500 Fashion group. A protege of Mr Meshulam Riklis, the US deal-maker who had bought E-II from American Brands in 1988, Mr Green was caught in the middle of a heated battle for control of the company. Mr Riklis had been ousted in a bondholder revolt. Investors led by Mr Carl Icahn, the financier who at one time owned TWA, later rejected Mr Green's plans for restructuring the debt-laden company and forced it into bankruptcy protection. In the following years, Mr Icahn and Mr Leon Black, supporter of Mr Green and a former head of mergers and acquisitions at Drexel Burnham Lambert, fought for control of E-II, before Mr Black finally held sway a year ago. Now renamed Astrum International, the holding company has emerged from bankruptcy protection, with Mr Green still at the helm. He has in the meantime been growing his US property vehicle, Auburndale Properties. This now owns more than 11m sq ft of residential and industrial property in the US. With the bid for Heron, Mr Green hopes to launch himself for the first time in the European property markets.</p>

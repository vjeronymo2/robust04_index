			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Second opinion - Ballot Box Ballot Box reported last Saturday that a poll in Pulse showed that the Tories were still the favourite party of family doctors. It has been pointed out to us, however, that Pulse is by no means the only GPs' magazine. One correspondent says that it is simply the one preferred by rightwing doctors. Doctors on the left tend to go for General Practitioner, which has slightly different findings in its poll. According to GP, doctors are swinging to the Liberal Democrats who have the support of 36 per cent, against 33 per cent for the Tories and 30 per cent for Labour. The figures from Pulse were Tories 29.8 per cent, Lib Dems 24.8 and Labour 17.8. The GP poll was taken before John Smith announced his tax plans, which could have made a difference to voting intentions. Either way, doctors' support for the Tories has fallen sharply since the last general election: from 45 per cent according to Pulse, and from 61 per cent according to GP.</p>

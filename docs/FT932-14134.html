			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (13): Success of the decade - Laser printers WHEN THE research organisation Dataquest asked businesses what they look for in laser printers, compatibility and price came out at the top of the wish list - beating speed and print quality hands down. Dataquest's findings paint an accurate picture of laser printer products in the 1990s. Organisations expect laser printers to be reliable, robust and capable of producing excellent print quality. But they are still looking for improvements in value for money, standardisation and flexibility. Yet the laser printer has been the success story of the decade. Market research company Romtec says that non-impact printers (a category which includes inkjets and lasers) will dominate the UK printer market by 1994, growing from a 49 per cent market share in 1991 to 67 per cent in 1994. But when laser printers were first introduced in the mid-1980s, they were expensive and unreliable. Pioneered by market leader Hewlett Packard (HP), lasers are now the printer of choice for organisations which need a more flexible approach to printing than the average daisywheel and dot matrix device can provide. The reason for the laser's success lies in its ability to produce limitless typefaces and fonts, as well as graphics and drawings. An impact printer like a daisywheel is incapable of producing more than one typeface on a single page, or of producing any figurative images at all. The fact that most of us now use graphical applications of one kind or another - including word processors and spreadsheets with multiple font sizes and styles - means that we demand more from printers. There is nothing worse than creating a beautiful graphical document on-screen, only to see it reduced to a tedious text-only format when it is printed. Printer manufacturers have worked hard to bring laser technology down to the level of the desktop, so that users can have a personal laser printer attached to their PC. But the most exciting developments in laser printing in recent months have not come on the desktop, but on the network. THORNY ISSUE Network printing has always been a thorny issue for large organisations. The management of printers has become more difficult as PC software applications provide more flexibility, because there has never been any guarantee that a particular printer will obey commands generated from a particular word processor or spreadsheet. The result for large organisations has often been chaos, with confused network servers being brought to their knees as users attempt to print documents in fonts not available on the device that they have chosen. Network operating systems have added to the problem, hiding printer management functions deep inside their software - making it difficult for anyone but the network manager to set up printer queues from multiple users to output devices. Recognising the difficulties that large organisations have with network printers, operating system vendors like Novell and Microsoft have recently added much better printer management facilities to their software. Novell Netware 4.0 allows users to print documents more easily to remote devices, while the Microsoft Windows Printing System simplifies the set-up of laser printers with application software. Printer manufacturers have also done their bit. HP's LaserJet 4 printer and Bi-Tronics interface, which allows bi-directional communication between printer and host, simplify processes such as printer set-up, network printing and fault diagnosis. Instead of simply not printing, a laser printer can use the Bi-Tronics interface to send a message to the user, telling them that there is no paper, or that there is a paper jam inside the printer. PC manufacturer Compaq is a relative newcomer to the printer market, but deliberately designed its first Pagemarq laser printers for network printing. Pagemarqs are built around fast reduced instruction set computing (Risc) processors and include more memory than the average laser printer. They can also cope with different printer control languages used by different software packages, and switch a utomatically between different modes. VALUE FOR MONEY An emerging issue in laser printing is value for money. Although the price of laser printers has fallen steadily, the cost of running and maintaining them does not begin and end with the purchase price. Like copiers, laser printers need to have toner and ink cartridges replaced regularly. Manufacturers have now begun to measure the value for money achieved by their printers in terms of cost per page, working out average costs over a year. Kyocera Electronics is pioneering the idea of lower printing costs, comparing the running costs of its new Ecosys FS-3500 network printer (0.6 pence per page) against the 1.4 pence per page average of an equivalent H-P printer. Kyocera is keen to sell its laser printers as 'eco-friendly' machines that use up fewer resources, as well as cost less money to run. But it will be cost that drives organisations to choose better value for money laser printers in the future. Kyocera's own research found that 75 per cent of UK organisations would only buy from an environmentally conscious supplier if its costs were competitive. Nevertheless, there must clearly be a place in the future for cheaper laser printing. Companies are also looking for cheaper colour lasers, which are still too expensive for the average user. And while the growing use of Windows and Netware will simplify the network printing process, there are still great strides to be made in the way that software talks to printers. The days of the plug-and-go network printer are still some time away.</p>

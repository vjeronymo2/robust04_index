			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Court order for US arm of Pilkington - Ex-employees deny wrongdoing LIBBEY-Owens-Ford, the US subsidiary of Pilkington, the glass products group, has obtained a court order preventing sensitive internal information that had allegedly been fraudulently acquired from being damaged or misused. The order came after Lof alleged in a US court that its former chief executive and two executive vice-presidents had conspired with an Ohio University business professor, Clarence Martin, to give data-processing contracts to a company they jointly controlled, Computer Technology Management. CTM allegedly charged some Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) in unwarranted consulting fees for managing the information, described as Lof's 'central nervous system'. Mr Ronald Skeddle, former chief executive, and Mr Edward Bryant and Mr Darryl Costin, vice-presidents, were fired from Lof last month. Pilkington then said that the problem did not involve 'a major financial loss' and that Lof's customers and operations were not affected. The former executives, named in court rather than in court papers, and Mr Martin, have through their lawyers denied any wrongdoing. Lof has further alleged that in or around March 1991 the defendants 'conspired to create a scheme to acquire valuable gas wells owned by Lof at an artificially low price and to thereby convert the assets of Lof to their own use and enjoyment.' In March the defendants allegedly channelled a leasing contract for robots to a company controlled by Mr Martin, at an 'exorbitant lease rate grossly in excess of fair market value leasing rates', the court paper said. Lof has demanded the defendants pay compensatory and punitive damages, return illicit profits, and rescind contracts with their former company.</p>

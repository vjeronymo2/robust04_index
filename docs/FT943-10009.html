			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Media Futures: Format war may threaten videoconference industry Fears are growing that arguments over standards could plunge the videoconferencing industry into the sort of battle that raged over VHS and Betamax video formats. Videoconferencing equipment once cost Pounds 40,000 or more, limiting its use to multinationals able to afford studio suites and technical backup. Now, for about Pounds 3,000, a miniature video camera and specialised hardware and software can be added to a conventional personal computer to create a desktop conferencing system. The result is that large companies are showing interest. In the UK, International Business Machines, ICL and Olivetti are providing the machines for British Telecom's extensive trials. Mr Ian Henley, business development manager for the videoconferencing division of Softwright Systems, feels, however, that the the industry is threatening to fragment into self-interested groups. Softwright is a small Berkshire-based systems house which developed key elements of the software used by BT and IBM in their videoconferencing systems. Mr Henley's fears have been intensified by Intel, the world's largest semiconductor company, which this year launched a raft of videoconferencing products complying with its proprietary 'Indeo' (Intel Video) standard. It also announced the establishment of an industry consortium to lay down personal videoconferencing standards. The consortium includes AT&amp;T, Northern Telecom, Compaq and Picturetel. Mr Henley says that an industry consortium already exists, the curiously named MCCOI (Multimedia Communications Community of Interest) supporting existing standards covering the key technologies used in video conferencing systems - video and data conferencing (known technically as H320) and multipoint data conferencing (T120). About 72 companies support MCCOI including Apple, BT, IBM and Siemens. Mr Henley asks: 'Intel's actions could be interpreted as an attempt to wrestle proprietary control of the desktop video market away from H320. Could they really be about to launch another VHS/Betamax battle just when the acceptance of H320 seems to have removed one of the last hurdles to progress?' Intel replies that it will support both Indeo and the MCCOI standards, arguing that Indeo products - which cost about half as much as H320 standard systems - are better suited to the price sensitive personal computer market.</p>

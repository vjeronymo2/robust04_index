			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Minister criticises Alitalia managers Wildcat strikes by Alitalia cabin staff seriously disrupted flights for a second consecutive day yesterday. Staff are opposing radical restructuring plans for the loss-making national airline. Further disruptions are likely through the weekend and a strike by all the airline's staff is scheduled for July 11. However, an air traffic controllers' strike planned for today and tomorrow has been postponed for two weeks. Mr Publio Fiori, transport minister, unexpectedly announced an inquiry into the failure of the management to foresee the strike action and avoid inconvenience to the public. His criticism of management for ignoring the union behind the strikes risks undermining the tough proposals in the restructuring plan. The union yesterday claimed 75 per cent of the domestic and international flights were cancelled. Alitalia said the figure was 323 flights out of 606. The union was formed last year by cabin staff who felt the regular unions did not represent their interests. As it has no more than 300 members out of the 18,000 Alitalia staff the management excluded it from restructuring discussion last month. However, the strike has been backed by other unions, making the impact far greater. The Alitalia management is discussing with the unions a plan to cut 4,000 jobs and completely rewrite existing work contracts (the pay packets of cabin crew are calculated on 504 different elements). This is seen as the first big test of the Berlusconi government's desire to cut restrictive practices, introduce labour flexibility and reduce the padding in state-owned groups. But the labour problems at Alitalia contrasted sharply with a breakthrough in industrial relations over a new wage and work conditions agreement just concluded between the employers and the 1.5m members of the engineering workers' unions. The agreement, reached for the first time without any strikes, is likely to become the benchmark for all other wage deals - including key public sector pay talks in the autumn. The agreement is evidence that union leaders and Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, are prepared to adopt a more consensual approach in the light of last July's labour accord ending indexed wages. Under the engineering unions' agreement, wages to the end of 1996 will rise only in line with the official inflation index. There was no attempt to recover the loss in earning power during the past two years of recessions. But workers will be entitled to year-end productivity/profitability bonuses. The average working week will be 39 hours.</p>

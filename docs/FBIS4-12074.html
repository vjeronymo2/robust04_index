			<p>BFN     [Text] Muscat, April 4 (AFP)--Yemen's rival leaders,  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, failed to settle their political dispute during talks in  Salalah south of here, an Omani government official said Monday.    "It appears the two sides have still not reached agreement,  especially on military matters," Omani Minister of State for  Foreign Affairs Yusuf Bin-Alawi Bin-'Abdallah [name as received]  told reporters.    Salih and al-Bid met on Sunday in the Omani city of Salalah  -- their first meeting since they signed a reconciliation accord  in Amman on February 20 calling for widespread reforms.    Omani television showed the northern and southern leaders,  who have been embroiled in a dispute since last August over the  running of their country, embracing and relaxing at a dinner  hosted by Sultan Qabus.    Bin-'Abdallah said Oman may pull out of a commission set up  jointly with Jordan to try to implement the military clauses of  the reconciliation accord.    North and South Yemen were united in May 1990 but their  armies have not been merged and the south has called for  decentralization.    The accord said the opposing armies should be redeployed and  military checkpoints removed from certain areas.    At least 20 people were killed in clashes which broke out  soon after it was signed.    Bin-'Abdallah said Oman would have to consult with Jordan,  "to halt our involvement in the military commission, because it  can no longer fulfill its role."    The commission could not function "without any political  progress," he said.    "The Yemenis must make efforts themselves, the party leaders  must resolve the difficulties and make concessions for there to  be political progress."    The minister said the military commission's work was  obstructed by divisions between the three ruling parties in  Yemen's coalition government.    Salih heads the General People's Congress, while al-Bid is  leader of the Aden-based Yemen Socialist Party, which ruled  former Marxist South Yemen. The third party is parliamentary  speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar's Muslim militant movement  Al-Islah.    Al-Bid has refused to take up his duties in Sanaa since the  dispute erupted.    Salih arrived in Doha Monday for his first visit to Qatar  since the January-February 1991 Gulf war.    He was met at the airport by the Amir of Qatar, Shaykh  Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al-Thani.    Relations between the two countries soured over Yemen's  pro-Iraqi stance during the Gulf crisis which followed the  August 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.    Al-Bid left Oman for Aden Monday, the official Omani news  agency said.    More than 40 deputies began a sit-in at the Yemeni  parliament  in Sanaa Monday after it was announced that the talks in Oman  had failed.    A participant said the protest was "against any split or  attempt to undermine unity" in the country.    Other deputies were due to join the sit-in later Monday, he  said.</p>

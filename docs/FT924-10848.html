			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Political Notebook: A question of confidence IN THE present climate at Westminster it is hazardous to anticipate how Mr John Major's government will behave during the next few hours, let alone over the following week. For the beleaguered prime minister the medium-term now extends to the day after next. His cabinet sorely lacks a Lord Whitelaw to provide the calm wisdom which saved Lady Thatcher from so many catastrophes in her early years as prime minister. So it would be folly to predict with certainty now the shape and outcome of next week's debate on the Maastricht treaty. But Downing Street has at last begun to clear away the debris under which it successfully buried the government over the weekend. The risible threat that Mr Major would call a snap general election if he lost the vote has been lifted. The naive among the prime minister's advisers have realised that while he is perfectly entitled to stake his own future on a single (and constitutionally unnecessary) vote, he cannot bind his party, nor his cabinet, to the same mast. The conventional wisdom now is that a defeat next week would wound Mr Major seriously, probably mortally, but somehow the Conservatives would soldier on in government under a new leader. Mr Major's colleagues have begun to acknowledge that it is not enough simply to berate the Euro-sceptics on the Conservative back benches. They have to win back the hearts if not the minds of a deeply disgruntled but basically loyal group of Tory MPs whose votes will make the difference between victory and defeat on Wednesday. By calling them together for friendly chats in small groups before his semi-public appeal to the parliamentary party later today at the 1922 Committee, the prime minister has at last started playing to his strengths. Mr Major wants a substantive motion on Maastricht, one that will demonstrate to recalcitrant backbenchers that his authority has been restored and to his EC counterparts that he remains a reliable player in the European game. Most of his cabinet colleagues share that view. Mr Kenneth Clarke is the most forceful in arguing for a showdown with the rebels. That has led many on the right to accuse him of plotting to ensure Mr Major's downfall. Anyone who has listened to the prime minister's passionate defence of his European strategy knows that on Maastricht he needs no encouragement from declared Europhiles. So the option favoured by most at today's cabinet will be a motion which faces down the rebels without deliberately inflaming the waverers  - in spite of the risk that hardened Euro-sceptics will then back a wrecking Labour amendment. But the present atmosphere at Westminster - increasingly reminiscent of the final days of Lady Thatcher - means that outcome cannot be regarded as a foregone conclusion. If Mr Richard Ryder announces that his whips will not be able to whittle down the number of Tory rebels to below 30, Mr Major will be forced into another retreat and to opt for an adjournment motion. One (pro-European) cabinet minister has taken to quoting Winston Churchill: 'It is no use committing suicide if you are going to regret it in later life.' Against that, Labour's U-turn on Maastricht should encourage the prime minister to gamble. Many of those Tories who have been threatening to defy the whips know now they have a qualitatively different decision to make. There are perhaps a dozen Tory dissidents who could not care less who is in Downing Street. But the more sophisticated dissidents regard the only realistic alternatives - Mr Clarke, Mr Michael Heseltine or Mr Douglas Hurd  -as less acceptable than the present incumbent. With Mr John Smith ready to shrug off his European credentials in favour of political opportunism, there will be intense pressure on the Tory side to maximise Labour's discomfort. The opposition's demand for still further clarification from Denmark before the legislation can be considered in the Commons looks as convincing as Downing Street's threat of a general election. Mr Smith has accepted that the only way that Labour can credibly vote against next week's motion is by stating that it has nothing to do with Europe and everything to do with confidence in the government. But that means the Conservative party also now has a simple choice: does it have confidence in its own government?</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / FBI in raids on National Medical Shares in National Medical Enterprises plunged yesterday on news of FBI raids of the hospital company's offices and hospitals in a national investigation of possible health insurance fraud, writes our New York staff. On Wall Street, shares in National Medical dropped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 8 yesterday. The company used to own the British nursing home group, Westminster Healthcare Holdings, and now holds 42 per cent of its shares. National Medical is already facing suits from many of the big US insurance companies alleging that National Medical defrauded them of more than Dollars 750m (Pounds 507m), and more than 100 former patients have sued the company for fraud, physical mistreatment and false imprisonment. National Medical has sued 19 insurers on charges of conspiring to delay or deny payments for patients. California-based National Medical last year earned about Dollars 133m on revenues of about Dollars 4bn. The probe is part of a Justice Department and FBI decision last year to give top priority to health care fraud.</p>

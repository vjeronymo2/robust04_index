			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Education in Patriotism Must Start </F> From Childhood"]    [Text] In Chinese history, patriotism has always been a  great banner to mobilize and inspire the people to unite and  strive as well as a common spiritual pillar among people of all  nationalities. The on-the-spot meeting on education in  patriotism in primary and secondary schools in Shanghai jointly  convoked by the Central Propaganda Department, the State  Education Commission, the Ministry of Radio, Film and  Television, the Ministry of Culture, and the Communist Youth  League Central Committee will give a powerful thrust to and be a  powerful promotion of unfolding education in patriotism in  primary and secondary schools in depth and breadth in a  persistent manner.    Education in patriotism is basic engineering for improving  the quality of the entire nation. The focus of this basic  engineering is the broad masses of teenagers. The population of  primary and secondary pupils on campus approaches 175 million  across China; they are a generation that straddles the 20th and  21st centuries, and will be the main force in building socialist  modernization in China in the 21st century. The histories of  various countries teach us that only when the younger generation  has a good knowledge of the history of its own country and  nation, and shapes such knowledge into a strong patriotic  awareness, while converting its will to render service to the  country into conscious actions to serve the motherland, will it  be possible for it to become a generation that can accomplish a  lot. When we grasp firmly the education in patriotism among  primary and secondary school pupils, the entire society will be  affected, and the main theme of patriotism will be sharper and  more conspicuous, while the building of socialist spiritual  civilization will mount a new level. In a nutshell, putting  education in patriotism in primary and secondary schools in an  important place on the agenda, while earnestly implementing it,  is a mission history has bestowed on us.    Our party and government leaders attach great importance to  the education in patriotism among primary and secondary school  pupils. Party and government leaders, including Jiang Zemin,  have repeatedly stressed that it is imperative to make the  concepts of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism the "theme  of the entire society." Party and government leading departments  at all levels have created many good methods, which are vivid  and lively, of conducting education in patriotism among the  broad masses of teenagers, and accumulated many fresh  experiences. A very successful example is precisely the use of  fine films and television movies to unfold education in  patriotism in primary and secondary schools across China. This  activity has aroused a warm response from the whole society,  with very good effects.    However, we must also see that the gap between our work and  the requirements of the times, as well as the rich contents of  patriotism, is still great. For instance, a small number of  departments and units do no more than pay lip service, writing  documents on conducting education in patriotism among teenagers,  rather than taking practical measures; some of them lack  understanding of teenagers' actual conditions, and fail to study  the characteristics of education in patriotism during the new  period; the education lacks essence, and is also pointless. In  other departments and units, the forms of education are  monotonous and rigid, always being the same thing and with no  differences in level. Much work and joint action in various  social aspects are called for to grasp and take care of the  matter with common efforts to further conduct education in  patriotism in depth and breadth in a persistent way.    China is a country with a long history and a brilliant  culture, and one that is advancing toward modernization with  full vitality. To conduct education in patriotism among primary  and secondary pupils, it is precisely necessary to bring forth  the fine traditions of patriotism, and help this generation of  teenagers to understand the outstanding contributions our  ancestors made to the civilization of mankind and the tremendous  and profound changes in all aspects in China since reform and  opening up, thus augmenting their pride in the nation. From  history to reality, there are extremely rich potential resources  for conducting education in patriotism in various arenas of  social life. Better effects will be achieved if we link the  fine traditions of the Chinese nation to the reality of reform  and opening up.    Patriotism reflects people's rational understanding of the  relations between the individual and the motherland; at the same  time, it contains people's lofty feelings for the motherland.  It is a kind of consciousness and spirit embodied in conscious  actions as well as every single specific matter. To augment  education in patriotism, it is precisely necessary to grasp the  art of education. It is necessary to work hard at such links as  seeing the truth, knowing the situation, stirring up passion,  and cultivation to stimulate the broad masses of teenagers'  devotion to "having knowledge of, cherishing and building the  Chinese nation." It is necessary to adopt various methods and  ways as well as diversified propaganda vehicles, and to be  familiar with the forms the masses love to hear and see, while  infiltrating all aspects of teenagers' study, labor, life, and  amusement with the education in patriotism. The school is an  important place in which to conduct education in patriotism  among teenagers. That being the case, the education in  patriotism must run through the whole course of teaching and  education from kindergarten through college, with institutions  set and mechanisms formed. It is imperative to give full play  to the roles of the forms teenagers love to hear and see, such  as films and television, drama, books and magazines, music,  drawing, and calligraphy, so that patriotism may strike root  among teenagers. In addition, it is necessary to be good at  giving play to the educational role of various kinds of museums,  memorial halls, historical remains and ruins, as well as famous  mountains and rivers.    Education in patriotism is systems engineering, as well as a  long-term strategic task. It is necessary to persist in it and  to continuously blaze new trails so that it may be unfolded in  greater depth and breadth. Let us hold aloft the banner of  patriotism, and strive for the magnificent cause of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>

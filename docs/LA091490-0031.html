			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS / OPEN FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> 'PACIFIC ROOM' HAS TOO MANY COOKS  </P> <P> Just when you thought it was safe to go in the water of the Pacific Rim, along  comes "The Pacific Room." This murky joint work by David Hodgson, Erika  Sukstorf and Lui Sanchez might work if somebody were spoofing performance  artists stricken with a case of empty pretensions.  </P> <P> At the Callboard Theatre, though, nobody is spoofing.  </P> <P> While it's clear who wrote -- if that's the word for it -- the seven  disconnected portions of "Room," and crystal clear that Hodgson did the  choreography (with bows to Etienne Decroux), it's also painfully clear that too  many co-directors have their hands in the show. Namely Hodgson, Sukstorf and  Sanchez, in deep need of an editor.  </P> <P> Pieces such as "Ya Chou Yu," "Classroom," and "Fijian Woman" have Sukstorf  playing with such poor East Asian and American ethnic accents that they  unintentionally reinforce stereotypes. Sanchez's "Universo Nativo" is all  emotion and no content, while the group pieces -- "Island" and "A Peaceful  Space on the Edge" -- are no emotion and no content.  </P> <P> Ironically, the work far from the Pacific Rim remains in the mind: Hodgson's  "Du Mein Herz," sharply coupled with Schumann lieder.  </P> <P>  At 8541 Melrose Place, on Mondays through Wednesdays, 8 p.m., Fridays, 10:30  p.m., until Sept. 21. $12; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> ROBERT KOEHLER  </P></p>

(Djemal Nazzar)  reports:    [Begin recording] [(Nazzar)] The UGTA is meeting the  national  federations of all the sectors. The meeting is taking place to  assess, coordinate, and make preparations for the congresses of  some federations. This meeting, the first of its kind, has come  late, according to the UGTA secretary general, in view of the  UGTA's many national activities, particularly its participation  in talks with the government, contributions to the political  dialogue, and participation in the national concord [wifaq]  conference. The secretary general briefed the trade union  cadres on the results of the conference; he also talked about  the role of the workers in the transitional phase.    [Benhamouda] Our role as the General Union of Algerian  Workers is naturally to contribute to strengthening and  supporting the state. However, what is important to us is  rebuilding the economy; to rebuild it as a strong economy so  that we can protect our workers.    [Nazzar] The UGTA's negotiations with the government  received  the lion's share of time in discussions. Abdelhak Benhamouda  talked about another new point that would be raised at the  forthcoming negotiations with the government. Again, the point  concerns a salary increase.    [Benhamouda] We will be starting additional negotiations  when  we submit this file to the head of government. The negotiations  will address the difference [between the UGTA demand and the  government's offer], because the treasury minister said only 8  billion [currency not specified] while we had agreed on 32  billion. Therefore, we will demand a salary increase in the  next phase. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (16): Be sure it's the best then wait 10 years - Investing in wine / If you know what you're doing, it can still make sense to buy a good vintage early, pause until it's ready, then sell half and drink the rest If you are very rich you must, on occasions, have something to celebrate, and then your thoughts will descend to your cellar. A decent bottle of wine is a natural accompaniment to a privileged life. There was a period in the 1980s when wine got caught up in an investment frenzy. Everyone was hooked on the idea that, by judicious buying, you could drink for nothing. Just acquire the best vintages early and, by the time they were ready for consumption, sell half the stock at a profit and drink the rest for free. This wonderful idea holds true - just. But you must be knowledgeable, and be prepared to wait 10 years at least. And you must buy the best. If you bought Mouton-Rothschild, a first growth claret and one of the most desirable of wines, in 1982 you might have paid Pounds 500 for a case. You can sell this wine at auction now for around Pounds 1,500 a case - if you can bear to let it go. Many investors paid over the odds for indifferent vintages and were caught by the recession, which hit the wine market hard in 1991. This year, prices have increased slowly but steadily at auction - where many serious buyers acquire their supplies - and prospects look good for the autumn season. With surplus cash earning little interest stuck in a bank, investing in blue-chip wines is becoming attractive again. Some wines have already shot ahead, especially the touted claret, Cheval Blanc. A case of 1982 was Pounds 800 a year ago and now sells for nearer Pounds 1,500. Christie's, which sold wine to the value of almost Pounds 9m last season, recently offered five cases of 1947 Cheval Blanc, placing an estimate of Pounds 10,000-Pounds 15,000 on the lot. It sold for Pounds 18,000. This is exceptional, although demand for the best wines, which basically means top growth clarets and a few select burgundies, has certainly strengthened in the past year. In the same auction, Christie's designed a ready-made cellar of 195 cases of the finest wines. It carried an estimate of Pounds 200,000-Pounds 300,000 and sold for Pounds 340,000. The wine experts are free with their advice. Serena Sutcliff, of Sotheby's, recommends the great vintages of the 1980s, in particular 1986, 1988 and 1990. A case of Mouton Rothschild 1990 might cost up to Pounds 600 (Latour and Margaux slightly less), but when it is ready for drinking in the early years of the Third Millennium it should be superb, and much more costly. She also recommends the top Sauternes of 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, which can be acquired for around Pounds 200 a case. The finest white wine of al,l Chateau D'Yquem, is in a different price class: Pounds 900 for a case of 1986. Serena Sutcliff also recommends vintage ports, especially the 1977, the best vintage since 1963. A case of Taylor only costs Pounds 150. If you want to celebrate now, you will have to pay much more for your wine. The market should receive a tremendous lift in October when changes in the local laws allows, for the first time, wine auctions to be held in New York. At its first sale, on October 8, Sotheby's is offering a bottle of 1945 Latour, a truely great wine, for around Dollars 900 (Pounds 580). If this seems a modest outlay, try bidding for a wine produced before the Phylloxera disease ravaged Bordeaux, a magnum of 1870 Lafite which had once been in the cellar of Glamis Castle. It carries an estimate of up to Dollars 20,000. A decade ago, there was great interest in exotic old wines, especially from the Americans. But doubts about authenticity, to say nothing of the dubious drinking qualities of most 19th century wines, hit this market hard. Few serious drinkers will buy wines produced earlier than 1945, and for a decade or so after then only the top clarets stay in their prime. Along with the first and second growth clarets, Paul Bowker of Christie's sees potential in the best burgundies. In the past Romanee-Conte dominated the burgundies. Now a run of good vintages in the 1980s, in particular 1983, 1985, 1986, 1989, and 1990, has increased interest in, and the value, of these wines, raising first growths to Pounds 500 a case. The fact that the vintages of recent years have been indifferent makes the burgundy of the 1980s a good wine for trading as well as drinking. Of course, many people think that champagne is the wine for celebrations. It has a much shorter life span than claret, and the French reckon that after 20 years even good champagnes are past their prime. Krug, Bollinger and Dom Perignon are the most sought-after brands, with a mature champagne of the late 1970s costing around Pounds 600 a case. But, as in all things, buy what you enjoy, not what you think may appreciate.</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / RMT claims new move in rail row The RMT transport union last night said that it had made fresh moves in the rail dispute in talks at Acas, the conciliation service. It said: 'We've made further proposals to Railtrack through Acas. There has been a response made from Railtrack which to some extent raises more questions than it answers. Both sides are now reflecting on the position.' But the union dismissed hopes of an immediate resolution, saying that nothing in the day's negotiations could be regarded as 'a dramatic breakthrough'. The latest national strike in the union's dispute with the state-owned Railtrack company is due to start at noon tomorrow and last 24 hours. The company expects more than a third of the network to run normally during this week's disruption. Trains are expected to run this week from London's Waterloo to Guildford, Surrey, and to Yeovil in Somerset for the first time during the strikes. This morning the union's leadership will announce plans for next week with a possible move to a 48-hour period of dis-ruption. On Thursday the result of the union's ballot of its supervisors will be announced, and if this produces a majority in support for industrial action in sympathy with the signalling staff they could join any planned strikes after August 11. Railway signal workers in south-west England were yesterday discussing whether to accept an informal local offer of lump sums, said to be up to Pounds 800 each, in return for working during strikes ordered by the RMT. Railtrack said the reported 'offer' to signal workers in some areas was nothing more than a repackaging of money 'which has always been on the table'. BT unions' anger, Page 8</p>

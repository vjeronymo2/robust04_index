			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / St Columbus's salutary lesson for the banks: The growth of the credit unions AS BANKS digest last week's opinion poll showing a steady fall in the number of customers satisfied with their services, they could take a salutary look at the St Columbus parish in Bradford. Eighteen months ago, after the main bank in the area closed its branch, the parish set up a credit union. The union has now taken over the old branch and is running a service that its 180 members think meets many of the roles of the bank. Mr Joseph Yewdall, a voluntary worker at the union and a chairman of the National Federation of Credit Unions, said: 'There's a lot of people here who have no access to banks. I think we're showing that there can be an alternative.' The St Columbus story is more common than it used to be. After decades of being regarded as a poor man's social fund, the credit union movement is growing fast, doubling in number from 203 in 1989 to an estimated 405 last month. The UK form of credit union involves up to 5,000 people who have a 'common bond', such as working for the same employer, forming a savings fund. Members are usually allowed to borrow up to three times their savings, up to Pounds 5,000. Credit unions are not allowed to 'leverage' their funds by lending more than deposits. In return, and on the assumption that the 'common bond' will make members wary of defaulting, they do not have to hold capital. Mr Michael Parkinson, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions, said assets and membership had risen by 40 per cent in the past year, and the 190 credit unions in his association controlled about Pounds 30m of savings. The movement is still in its infancy compared with the US and Ireland, where 23 per cent of the population are members. Mr Derek Lee, the registrar of friendly societies and the unions' regulator, describes it as 'tiny'. Yet Mr Al Charbonneau, chief executive of the World Council of Credit Unions in Wisconsin, is impressed by the growth rate. Nevertheless, he warns that it will be 'many years yet' before Britain's credit unions are able to offer the wide range of financial services provided by unions in the US, Canada and Australia - including the issuing of credit cards. One reason for the growth lies in the increasing reluctance of banks and building societies to open their doors to poorer customers - leaving the unions as almost the only source of cheap loans and savings accounts for many. While credit companies such as Provident Financial, which collect weekly, charge annual percentage rates of interest on loans running into three figures, credit unions are legally allowed to charge only 1 per cent a month  -12.7 per cent APR. At St Columbus union workers said most residents could not get a bank account. One said: 'Never mind the money, to get a bank account you need a 10-year passport or driving licence - and people around here just haven't got that.' The credit union, by contrast, has a relatively open-door policy. Any member of the local community can join without needing to provide extensive documents. Members of the credit union who prove to be reliable are allowed to take larger loans. Those who save receive an annual dividend, usually about 5 per cent, calculated by dividing the annual surplus made by the union. Like most credit unions, St Columbus also offers a bill paying service and, in conjunction with the local TSB bank, household and life insurance policies. It is required to invest funds securely under the Credit Unions Act 1979. A second reason for growth is the shift in the composition and clientele of the new unions. Although the movement has been best known for its 'community' based unions, its fastest expansion is in the workplace. According to Abcu 60 per cent of the movement's assets are held in employee unions. These range from local government unions to those in the police force and taxi services. This month British Airways has become the first private-sector company to establish a union for its 48,000 employees. Expansion has forced more professionalism on the credit unions, with some of the larger ones employing full-time staff. But it has also led to growing demands for new financial powers along the lines of the US unions. Mr Graham Tomlin, the BA engineering manager who set up the union, wants it to be able to offer mortgages, cheque books and credit cards. 'I don't see why we couldn't do that. The demand is definitely there,' he said. Yet such ambitions may cause some prudential worries about the movement. The act envisaged unions retaining enough profits to hold reserves equal to 10 per cent of assets, but the figure stands at 7.18 per cent. In addition, Mr Lee said he was 'disappointed' that the industry had not responded to pressure to ensure that depositors would not lose all their savings if a union collapsed. Officials from the Registry of Friendly Societies are meeting credit union managers to consider proposals for legal reform. The movement would like legislative reform to be put to parliament soon.</p>

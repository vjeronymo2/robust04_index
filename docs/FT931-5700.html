			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Air New Zealand up 8.6% at half-year AIR New Zealand yesterday announced an 8.6 per cent rise in net profits to NZDollars 60.9m (USDollars 32.18m) for the six months to December, from NZDollars 56.1m a year earlier, in the face of difficult markets. Sales advanced 6.9 per cent to NZDollars 1.16bn from NZDollars 1.09bn. Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, said the result compared with record losses by US airlines and generally lower earnings reported by Asian and European carriers. He said the profit was achieved as the global industry was experiencing little or no growth, excess aircraft capacity and aggressive price competition. Mr Matthew expects the company to announce profits for the full year similar to last year's NZDollars 115.1m, given the difficult trading conditions in the industry. Air New Zealand said total assets rose by 16.8 per cent to NZDollars 2.81bn. Shareholders' funds rose 9.7 per cent to NZDollars 1.08bn. The directors said demand was 'soft' in the company's traditional markets of the US, UK and Australia and New Zealand. The increasingly important Asian markets of Japan and Taiwan experienced slower growth. Flight revenue to Asia rose 13 per cent, but net earnings were relatively flat. The company reported 'other revenue' was up NZDollars 57m to NZDollars 256m. This was mainly due to strong growth in international cargo, while its New Zealand subsidiary, Mount Cook Airlines, performed well due to a good ski season. Passenger sales revenue rose 2 per cent to NZDollars 907.85m. Interest costs fell to NZDollars 26m from Dollars NZ34, and one-off redundancy costs totalled NZDollars 8.2m. The interim dividend is unchanged at 4 cents a share.</p>

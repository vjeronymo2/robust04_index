			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Black skies, red tape, green fields, grey area - Environmental rules have poured out of Brussels and could blunt the competitiveness of European companies In the past two decades European countries have wished on themselves more than 200 environmental rules. That formidable legislative effort, which stretches from the levels of sulphur allowed to stream out of power stations to the circumstances in which you can legally shoot birds, has won immense public support. The European Commission, ministers and green campaigners argue that regulation can bring commercial benefits. Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission's president, has said that 'an ambitious environmental policy . . . could create hundreds of thousands of jobs'. But many European countries are concerned that it could be a drag on their international competitiveness. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, has warned that 'the UK's commitment in principle to environmental protection must not come at the expense of industry and competitiveness'. Putting numbers to the cost of environmental protection is not easy, but industrialists have amassed a long checklist to support their claim that the green burden is too heavy, particularly in the oil and chemical industries. Concawe, the oil industry's European environmental lobby, claims the cost of meeting new limits on sulphur in fuel oils will amount to Dollars 3.3bn in the short term, and more than Dollars 5bn eventually. The UK chemical industry estimates spending on environmental protection rose from 9 per cent of operational costs to 14 per cent between 1990 and 1992. The German electricity industry has spent DM22bn on cleaning up its power stations. The UK water industry says the Urban Waste Water directive, under which sewage cannot be pumped into the sea, will cost it between Pounds 6bn and Pounds 12bn, and that roughly half its current Pounds 40bn investment programme is prompted by European directives. International comparisons, while difficult to make, support these industrial snapshots. Figures suggest that environmental rules are hurting European competit-iveness on several fronts. For a start, European companies may be handicapped even compared to rivals in industrialised countries, let alone developing regions. According to the OECD, total environmental spending by public and private sectors in northern European countries appears to outstrip that of Canada and Japan, and to be roughly equivalent to that in the US - around 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent of GDP. The Commission's own figures also support northern European companies' complaints that they face tougher rules than companies in southern Europe. German spending, the highest in Europe, is roughly double that of Italy, Portugal and Spain. Compliance with many rules is lowest in the Mediterranean countries and in Ireland - as far as anyone can tell. Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the environment commissioner, acknowledges figures are incomplete and that 'in the absence of statistics we cannot say anything' about the degree of enforcement. He hopes the new European environment agency being established in Copenhagen will plug these gaps. The result of high environmental standards, companies say, is that Europe loses companies and industries. For ICI, the international chemical group, the need to comply with mercury emission standards was 'the final straw' for its chlorine plant at Hillhouse, UK, according to Mr Michael Wright, environmental spokesman. 'We just closed the plant,' he says. Some people, including many politicians and environmentalists, reject these fears. They argue that tough rules bring commercial benefits. Clearly, new markets in environmental technology provide compensations. If some companies have to clean up, then others can sell them equipment  - UK water companies have found customers abroad for water treatment devices. However, some studies argue the potential of these markets has been overstated. Moreover, studies agree that these rewards are reaped only by the handful of countries in the lead - mainly Germany, the US and Japan. Last year the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) concluded that, on balance, environmental regulation had not harmed Germany as a place to do business, largely because tough standards had helped the environmental technology industry. A second claim is that higher energy and waste disposal costs make companies more efficient. ICI's Mr Wright says that 'rules have given us an incentive to use less inputs and reduce waste'. But some dispute whether those gains count as a benefit of green standards. Mr Wright acknowledges that 'we could have been doing this already without the regulation, had we focused on it, but it depends where you put your effort'. A third argument is that 'green' products may be more popular with consumers. But manufacturers say they are unsure how much market share they gain because they tend to improve products at the same time. These claims for the benefits of green rules are not conclusive enough to dismiss worries about the damage to European business. A better response to industrialists' woes, perhaps, is that even if competition is suffering, the case is easily overstated. Mr Martin Houldin, environmental director at consultants KPMG Peat Marwick in London, says: 'I believe the environment is in its infancy as a competitive factor, whether as a plus or a minus. The international differences in the cost of labour are generally so much more important that the environment pales into insignificance.' Nevertheless, concern about rising environmental costs may have turned the legislative tide within Europe. Some countries which blithely put their names to directives a decade ago have begun to cast a beadier eye on new proposals from Brussels. The Commission's plans for more recycling of packaging have been scaled down after the ambitious German recycling scheme plunged into near-bankruptcy. Brussels's most-publicised environmental plan, a tax on fuel and its carbon content, has also stalled in the light of widespread opposition. Moreover, there is growing pressure, particularly from developing countries, to prevent Europe from wielding protectionist tools to shield itself if it finds that it cannot afford its social and industrial standards. The conclusion of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has brought new heat to that accusation. Some European countries want to shut out imports from countries that do not share their environmental standards, but developing countries fear that Europe will abuse these principles to shut out as much competition as possible. The Commission has already warned Denmark that its ban on ozone-depleting substances may have to be modified, and has questioned Dutch plans to restrict timber imports. Mr John Gummer, UK environment secretary, says: 'We urgently need to write 'side agreements' into the final version of Gatt to set out a way of resolving these conflicts.' That new scrutiny - from inside Europe and beyond - may help Europe tackle the legacy of two decades of over-enthusiastic rule-making. It may also help it improve a poor record in designing workable and affordable environmental rules.</p>

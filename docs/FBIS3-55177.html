"This does not correspond to reality", the press service  said  and blamed the lawyer of Lukyanov, who is standing trial for  organising the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, for misinformation.    The press service said that the president had sent a message  of greetings to all the lawmakers elected to the new parliament  in which he expressed hope for joint constructive work.    However, the lawyer of Lukyanov presented the message, while  speaking in court, in such a way as if it had been sent  personally to Lukyanov.    "Unfortunately, reporters failed to realise this `nuance'  which exposes defects in professional ethics of the lawyer", the  press service said.</p>

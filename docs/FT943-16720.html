			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tenants and the Revenue I live in a leasehold flat, and along with the other 13 tenants in the building, have a 1/14th equal share in a limited company that owns the freehold. As a company, we act in all matters concerning the building, including collection of charges due. The company does not generate a 'profit' and any surplus funds at the end of the financial year are carried forward for use in the future. No dividends are paid to shareholders and nor are any likely to be. On this basis, why does the Inland Revenue produce assessments for tax, and how can we prepare our company accounts to avoid what appears to the Revenue to be a profit? Since the company is assessable under the rules of Schedule A, the way in which its accounts are drawn up will not affect its annual corporation tax bill, as the company's auditor will confirm. Broadly speaking, the expenditure actually incurred in each year is deducted from the rents and service charges due from the tenants in the year, and any balance is chargeable to corporation tax. If surplus funds are put on deposit or invested, the resulting income will also be chargeable to corporation tax under the rules of case III of Schedule D (or otherwise, depending upon the precise nature of the investment.) No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

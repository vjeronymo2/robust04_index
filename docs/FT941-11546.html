			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US cold weather boosts oil market Oil prices firmed yesterday amid forecasts of continuing cold weather in the north-east US. The price of the benchmark Brent blend was Dollars 14.75 a barrel in late London trading yesterday, 40 cents up on Tuesday's close of Dollars 14.35. The cold weather in the north-east US has put considerable strain on supplies of heating oil. European heating oil prices have also risen as arbitrage opportunities to supply the US market have appeared. The strong US demand has helped to underpin crude oil prices, which have been lingering around the Dollars 14 level for several weeks. But traders in London said it was too early to say whether the this week's price rises, based on technical factors and the weather, could be sustained. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries has based its hopes for an early boost in crude oil prices on increased winter demand in the US, Europe and Japan eroding stockpiles.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Roberto Maroni by MONDO ECONOMICO </F> correspondent; place and date not given: "A Kinder Tax System  for Those Who Invest"]    [Text] Maroni speaks. No to uncontrolled laissez-faire. Yes  to a market economy that protects the weak, with a public  presence limited to guaranteeing the rules. A less onerous tax  system which burdens companies less. A fight against waste to  reduce government spending. The Lega is prepared to accept  alliances on its economic and political programs. Will it be  Mario Segni? Will it be Berlusconi? "The turning point of the  Congress was opening the door. We are ready to talk: it is not a  take-it or leave-it document. But careful: time is short. A  decision must be made by 15 January." Roberto Maroni is  speaking, Umberto Bossi's right arm.    "Waste must be eliminated, the extraordinary assistance to  the South, refinanced for 5 trillion lire. Social welfare must  be limited, the system of assistance to firms reexamined.  Government administration must be reformed. Not only by firing  the loafers, as Segni says. The structure must be re-examined in  order to improve services and cut costs."    [MONDO ECONOMICO] What should be the role of the state in  the  economy?    [Maroni] The public role must be eliminated. The state must  guarantee respect for the rules. But it should be the market  that makes the rules. That way, a real social state can be born,  free of welfare abuse. The demise of the public presence must  come about by privatization and a rewriting of the rules. But  careful! Privatization must be real, actual publicly held stock  companies must be created in Italy. I would not want to find the  parties once again as owners, impersonated by Mediobanca  [Financial Credit Bank], by the great families, by the friends  of the friends. As for the rules, they must not be written only  in the halls of Parliament, but with the collaboration of the  interested persons. The hot subjects are: credit, Antitrust, the  Mammi law and privatization.    [MONDO ECONOMICO] Firms are asking for a less onerous tax  system. Are they right?    [Maroni] The tax system must be reformed, to make it more  equitable and simpler. For firms, we are thinking not only of  not taxing profits that are reinvested, but even about  additional fiscal incentives for investors. And it must be done  so that private savings are directed toward investing in  companies. We have in mind the modernization of the stock  exchange and the creation of local stock markets, more  accessible to small companies. Perhaps that way the banks will  stop behaving like usurers and be more ready to run a risk.</p>

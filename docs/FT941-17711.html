			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Major defends tax increases Mr John Major said yesterday that the government had to raise taxes and cut spending to ensure that the recovery would last.

But he said he had to raise taxes because his overriding objective was 'sound finances', otherwise the recovery would be built on sand.

In his new year message, Mr Smith warned that as many as 95 per cent of households would be worse off next year because of higher taxes. Mr Major stressed that the joint declaration on Ulster that he signed with Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, made clear that the majority in Ulster would decide whether they wanted to remain within the UK.

We have thrown down the gauntlet of peace. So now the onus is on Sinn Fein to pick it up.' Mr Major concluded by underlining the importance he attaches to the European elections in June. 'The European parliament matters to the future of Europe,' he said. 'So the elections matter to us. That is why we must fight them to win.'</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Growth rate slows for Oce-van der Grinten OCE-VAN der Grinten, the Dutch maker of photocopiers, design engineering plotters and office systems, said second-quarter net profit rose by 6 per cent to Fl 30.1m (Dollars 17.7m) on sales up 9 per cent at Fl 696.1m. The rate of growth is slower than the first quarter, when both net profit and sales posted gains of 11 per cent. Overall, net profit in the first half rose by 8 per cent to Fl 51.2m, while turnover increased by 10 per cent to Fl 1.35bn. More than half of the rate of increase in sales was due to the acquisition in 1991 of Bruning, a US maker of design engineering equipment. Operating profit in the first six months to May 31 fell by 11 per cent to Fl 74.6m. However, income from leasing office equipment nearly doubled, surging to Fl 33.8m from Fl 19.7m. If leases are included, overall operating profit rose by 4 per cent to Fl 108m, or at about half the rate of net profit. Financing charges were 12 per cent higher at Fl 38.8m, but taxes were substantially lower, falling by 15 per cent to Fl 18.6m. The company's fiscal year ends on November 30.</p>

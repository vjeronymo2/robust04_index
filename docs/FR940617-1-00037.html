			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. One comment requested that scrubbing devices such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brushes or sponges that are impregnated with approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobial ingredients be included in the monograph. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment requested clarification of the agency's views on trays or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kits that contain povidone-iodine and disposable instruments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (scissors, forceps, and hemostats) packed in a sterile package,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are designed to reduce the incidence of cross-infection in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This tentative final monograph does not provide for the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of devices such as brushes or sponges impregnated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antimicrobials, or of trays or kits that contain povidone-iodine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and disposable instruments, because the monograph is intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulate only OTC drug active ingredients. Since these comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were submitted, the agency has established procedures (see 21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 3) describing how it determines which agency component has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products comprised of any combination of a drug and a device. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, interested parties are encouraged to read the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document (Ref. 1) for guidance: ``Intercenter Agreement Between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and the Center for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Devices and Radiological Health.'' (See &sect;3.5 (21 CFR 3.5).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This agreement is on file in the Dockets Management Branch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (address above).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Intercenter Agreement Between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Center for Devices and Radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health in OTC Vol. 230001, Docket No. 75N&hyph; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 183H, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. One comment expressed concern that the tentative final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monograph failed to provide consumers with an antibacterial skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleanser for home use. The comment noted that, in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional health care personnel, many consumers have a need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for cleansing products containing antibacterial agents for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of promoting good individual and family hygiene. Uses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such products include the following: (1) To reduce bacteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the hands and face to a greater extent than can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished with ordinary soap, and to prevent accumulation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bacteria from potential sources of contamination. The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examples were cited: Cleansing oneself after changing a baby's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diaper, or after assisting aged or ill members of the household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with their toilet needs, and before preparing a family meal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The added benefit of an antibacterial cleanser for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minute cuts and abrasions from shaving and other minor traumas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The need for an antibacterial cleanser other than bar soap  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on local parts of the body such as the face because soap (alkali  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> salts of fatty acids) can be irritating or too drying for some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals' needs. The comment recommended a new product class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under proposed &sect;333.90(a) (skin antiseptic) to be identified as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Antimicrobial (or Antibacterial) Personal Cleanser'' with claims such as ``decreases bacteria on the skin'' and ``contains an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> antibacterial agent.'' The comment also suggested that the 10-day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum use limitation would not be appropriate for this product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class, but use could be restricted to 5 or 10 times daily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another comment recommended that antimicrobial soaps be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to make claims relating to general health care and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personal hygiene similar to the claims allowed for health-care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel handwashes. The comment stated that an antimicrobial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soap will reduce bacteria or the transfer of potentially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogenic micro-organisms in the home and, therefore, serves as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a preventive health care aid in controlling diseases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third comment requested the addition of a fourth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indication for alcohol active ingredients in proposed &sect;333.98(b)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow use as an antibacterial handwash to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross-contamination from one individual to another. The comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argued that products containing alcohols are often used as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handwashes by athletic trainers to help prevent the spread of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skin infections from one individual to another in situations in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which soap and water are not available, e.g., on the playing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fourth comment asserted that numerous other meaningful and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> truthful indications can be used which enhance the safe and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective use of a health-care personnel handwash. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the terms ``microbicidal cleanser'' or ``antiseptic germicidal skin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleanser'' are appropriate and meaningful terminology describing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this use indication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

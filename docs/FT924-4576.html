			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: US group in Hungary venture COLUMBIAN Chemicals, the industrial chemicals subsidiary of Phelps Dodge of the US, yesterday announced a Dollars 55m joint venture in Hungary to produce carbon black, the material used in manufacturing rubber and car tyres. Columbian is taking a 60 per cent stake in Columbian Tiszai Carbon, the new entity, in partnership with Tiszai Vegyi Kombinat (TVK), Hungary's largest chemicals company, which will hold the remaining 40 per cent. The Dollars 55m planned investment will be part-financed with a Dollars 33.5m loan package involving Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the US government investment promotion corporation, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the London-based multilateral institution aiding eastern Europe. The joint venture partners said that the new carbon black factory on TVK's Tiszaujvaros site in eastern Hungary would use by-products from existing refining facilities at the same location and so enjoy substantial savings on transport costs. Excess gas from the plant would in turn generate steam for TVK's other operations. Columbian, the world's second-largest carbon black producer, said that half of the planned 50,000 tonne annual production would go for export to help meet west European demand. The company added that it expected to benefit in the longer-term from the influx of car companies into Hungary, which executives expected would be followed by an investment by a leading international tyre manufacturer. Columbian investigated existing carbon black plants in eastern Europe but decided to avoid involvement because of the cost of bringing the old facilities, which have a terrible reputation for pollution, up to acceptable environmental standards. Cabot of the US, the world's largest producer of carbon black, took a different route in forming a joint venture earlier this year with Deza, an established producer of the material in the Czech republic.</p>

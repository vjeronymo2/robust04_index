			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / The Week Ahead: Results Due British Aerospace on Wednesday is the big results event of the week. It is the one chance for Mr John Cahill, the distressed group's new chairman, to clear the decks and produce - as he has promised - a solution to the company's regional aircraft problem. At interim stage a year ago it unveiled a sharp plunge to pre-tax profits of Pounds 86m (Pounds 146m) and a Pounds 432m rights issue. Whatever profits it eked out in the first half of this year will be swamped by restructuring costs which, on the most pessimistic forecasts, could approach Pounds 750m. The week will bring more results from the battered construction sector. The reported profit or loss at Tarmac tomorrow and Costain on Wednesday will be less interesting than the news the companies might deliver on restructuring efforts essential to their recovery. Tarmac is likely to report an interim loss of about Pounds 14m (pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.2m, itself a sharp decline from the previous year) and a dividend of 2p (3p). Provisions are likely on the value of its landbank and for restructuring costs. Costain might make a minimal profit of around Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 5.7m) but it too needs to take hefty provisions. Partial flotation of its Australian coal business has yet to be finalised but should generate a much-needed Pounds 45m or so. But it needs more help than that and the markets will want to hear of further restructuring plans. Barratt Developments, the volume house builder, took its pain in 1991, with a loss of Pounds 106m. For the year ended this past June it should report a small profit of up to Pounds 7m and perhaps a modest dividend. It is back under the management of Sir Lawrie Barratt, its founder, but is suffering from the sharp margin and volume cuts of the housing market. PARLIAMENT Thursday - Debate on the economy. Friday - Debate on foreign affairs.

			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN SOFTBALL TEAM BEATS UNLV BEFORE LOSING TO THE RAIN  </P> <P> For Coach Gary Torgeson, the Tournament of Champions offers an opportunity to  see how his Cal State Northridge softball team will fare against Division I  competition.  </P> <P> Torgeson did not get much of a chance to preview the Lady Matadors on Friday,  however, after CSUN's afternoon game against Sacramento State was rained out.  </P> <P> In CSUN's morning game, pitcher Debbie Dickmann threw a 2-hit shutout to lead  the host team to a 1-0 victory over Nevada Las Vegas in 8 innings.  </P> <P> "We're not out here to lose, but I was actually more concerned with getting  some games played so I could get a look at our personnel," Torgeson said.  </P> <P> The coach liked what he saw against UNLV, especially the strong effort of  Dickmann, a Division II All-American who was 22-4 with 17 shutouts last season.  Dickmann allowed just 2 singles.  </P> <P> Lisa Erickson scored the only run in the eighth. She reached base on a bunt  single, advanced on another, then scored on a wild throw after a fielder's  choice.  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors will play San Diego State this morning unless rain forces  another cancellation. Only six of 12 games were completed Friday.  </P> <P> The Lady Matadors will play San Francisco in a second game this afternoon.  RALPH NICHOLS  </P></p>

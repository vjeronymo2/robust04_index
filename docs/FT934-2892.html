			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Rome agrees steel reforms with EU Italy and the European Commission yesterday agreed restructuring plans for the Italian steel industry, which could clear the way for an overall rescue plan for Europe's troubled steelmakers. The plans are now likely to be put to European Union industry ministers at a special meeting next Friday, where they will require unanimous approval. Discord between Rome and Brussels was the main reason why EU ministers failed to agree a deal on subsidies for European state-owned steel producers last month. The chances of unanimous agreement on state aid to the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and east German industries at next week's meeting will now depend on other member states, notably Britain. Yesterday's agreement followed a meeting between Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the Italian prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. The agreement was struck yesterday morning by Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, and Mr Paolo Savona, Italian industry minister. Under the deal, Ilva, the Italian steelmaker that is to be privatised, will no longer have to close a third reheating furnace at its Taranto plant in southern Italy. But to maintain the balance between capacity cuts and subsidies, any private buyer of Taranto would be forced to close 500,000 tonnes of capacity in its own flat product activities. Agreement on state aid to the steel industry is essential to trigger a co-operative programme of production cuts by private steelmakers, which have been suffering from lack of demand and overcapacity.</p>

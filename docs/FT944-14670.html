			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Modest growth for Colgate-Palmolive Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, posted modest growth in the three months to September with a 6 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 151m, writes Richard Tomkins. As in the second quarter, the bright spot was the growth in overseas sales, particularly in emerging markets. The biggest drag on profits was the continued downturn in North American sales, attributed to reductions in retail inventories. Group revenues, boosted by growth in emerging markets, rose by 6 per cent to Dollars 1.9bn. Operating profits were 13 per cent ahead at Dollars 255.7m, but net income was hit by a big increase in the interest charge. Earnings per share, boosted by extensive company share repurchases, rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 1.00.</p>

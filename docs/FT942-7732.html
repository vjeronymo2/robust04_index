			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: US expansion behind 46% rise at Domino Shares in Domino Printing Sciences yesterday rose 27p to 517p following a sharp advance at the interim stage. The Cambridge-based printer manufacturer is benefiting from heavy investment in the US where sales grew 49 per cent in all sectors. The group also announced the acquisition of certain assets and intellectual property rights of Directed Energy for Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m), to be satisfied by shares and up to Dollars 1.8m cash. The Californian company has developed digital laser technology for use in the coding and marking market. Profits before tax jumped 46 per cent from Pounds 3.73m to Pounds 5.44m. Earnings per share rose by the same percentage to 13.65p (9.35p). An interim dividend of 3.2p is declared, 20 per cent ahead of last year's 2.65p. Sales rose 10 per cent to Pounds 41.4m (Pounds 37.6m). In the Americas, where Domino's chief competition is Videojet, owned by GEC of the UK, sales rose from Pounds 9.5m to Pounds 14.2m. In Europe, however, they fell 10 per cent to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 18.5m) while the UK was flat at Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 5.7m). There was an encouraging 22 per cent rise in the rest of the world from Pounds 3.91m to Pounds 4.76m. The group performed particularly well in Saudia Arabia, Dubai and Singapore. PackTrack, the diversification into mimeographic printing, is near to break even with sales in the first half of Pounds 674,000. Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said his prediction at the end of last year that the group would return to its traditional rates of growth and profitability had been fulfilled. The forward order book, worth Pounds 6m, was the best the group had achieved, he added. 'We are confident that we will continue to grow profits through the second half,' he said. Domino traditionally makes most of its sales in the second six months of the year and full year profits could be almost three times the interim figure. The group is one of a small number of mainly UK-owned companies which dominate the continuous ink-jet printing market. Continuous ink jet printers are able to print on a variety of surfaces using different kinds of ink and are able to withstand the rigours of the factory floor.</p>

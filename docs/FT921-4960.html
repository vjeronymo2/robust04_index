			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian group plans high-tech tea estate HARRISONS Malayalam, part of the Rs2.5bn (Pounds 54m) RPG group, plans to set up a tea estate in the West Dinajpur district of West Bengal that promises to set new standards of productivity in the Indian tea industry. The company has decided to take the route of clonal plantation in its effort to achieve a productivity rate of 3,500 to 4,000 kg a hectare, compared with present yields averaging about 2,500 kg a hectare at its existing plantations in the south Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The company is acquiring 1,000 hectares for the Rs150m project, according to Mr K Ahmedulla, executive director. Highly productive clones will be supplied by the Toklai tea research centre and planted at the optimum density of 14,000 a hectare, compared with about 10,000 plants a hectare in most existing tea estates. Planting is to start by June 1992 and should be completed within seven years. Production is forecast to reach 3.5m kg a year in ten years. The company also plans to set up a modern processing factory adjoining the estate. The company hopes to produce 15m kg of tea in 1992, up from 14m kg last year, at its tea estates in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, covering 6,000 hectares. Tata Tea, India's largest plantation company, and Krasnodar Tea Company have formed a joint venture in Russia called Tata Krasnodar Industries in which the partners will have equal holding. The objective is to promote the export of Indian tea and other agricultural products to Russia. The company has acquired a tea blending and packaging plant at Sochi from Krasnodar Tea. Packet tea produced at the plant will be labelled 'an Indo-Russian Star Product.' Tata Tea, which has secured an initial order of 3m kg of black tea, worth Rs160m, from Agroras, the Russian import agency, will get the tea packed at the Sochi plant. India has traditionally been dependent on the former Soviet Union for its tea exports. Last year the Soviet Union took 109.6m kg of India's total tea export of 203.57m kg, but there is uncertainty about India's tea exports following the disintegration of the Soviet Union.</p>

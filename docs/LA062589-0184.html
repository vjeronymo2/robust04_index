			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT MAKES A COMPUTER SUPER?  </P> <P> Want to start a high-tech metaphysical debate? Ask two engineers what  constitutes a supercomputer.  </P> <P> Many users define supercomputers as the fastest machines available on the  market at any given time. Still others contend that there are qualitative  differences that separate supercomputers from the rest of the pack.  </P> <P> Among these differences are price -- supercomputers cost well over $1 million  each -- and how supercomputers process data. Traditional computers process  digits or numbers sequentially, one-by-one, adding two numbers together, then  multiplying the sum by another number, and so on.  </P> <P> Supercomputers, instead, use "vector processing," which allows the machine to  perform a single calculation on an entire row or column, with just a single  instruction. It's a far faster process and typically suited to large scientific  problems. According to some accounts, problems that could take 24 hours to  solve on a traditional minicomputer, such as a VAX3 from Digital Equipment  Corp., could be completed in less than an hour on a Cray supercomputer.

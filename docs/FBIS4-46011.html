			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Three Experts in Iranian Nuclear </F> Program Abducted"]    [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Gunmen have  abducted a Chinese engineer and two of his Iranian companions in  southeast Iran.    A statement issued by the Interior Ministry in Tehran  yesterday pointed out that the Chinese citizen, whose identity  is not known yet, was working on the uranium mining project in  Rudan. The policy of developing uranium resources is considered  part of Iran's nuclear program, that is with technological  support from China and North Korea. It is believed that the  three abducted people handle very sensitive information  concerning Iran's nuclear program. It is not clear whether the  abduction operation is political in nature or was carried out by  a gang of robbers active in that area.    The abduction of foreign nationals has over the past few  months become a big problem for the government in many parts of  Iran. In January, a 22-year-old Australian tourist disappeared  while on his way to Shiraz, capital of the south. There has  been no news of him since. In February and March, three North  Korean technicians said to have been working on military  projects near the Gulf were abducted. They still have not been  released.    Last month, the body of a North Korean man was found near  Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan. It was said that someone lured him  and then killed him for unknown reasons.    The government has advised foreign nationals not to leave  major cities individually. Excursions organized for European  tourists have been canceled or their routes altered to avoid the  danger of being attacked by armed gunmen on the road.    The Iranian Interior Ministry's report shows a big increase  in all types of crimes, from small-scale riots through to  organized and large-scale armed robbery and murder. This  coincided with the smuggling of thousands of arms from Pakistan  and Afghanistan to all areas in east and south Iran. Sometimes  convoys of smuggled goods and drugs travel for hundreds of miles  inside Iranian areas, protected by armed groups supported by  personnel carries and tanks.    The number of foreign nationals working in Iran is estimated  at about 18,000, compared with 1.2 million before the mullahs'  revolution in 1979. But there are also 2.2 million Afghan  refugees, 1.2 million Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds and Shiites,  and at least 1.2 million illegal immigrants from Pakistan,  Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan.</p>

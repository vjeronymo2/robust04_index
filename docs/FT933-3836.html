			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Bardon in loss after Pounds 60m provision against US sale BARDON, the debt-burdened quarry products group, made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 59.5m for the six months to June 30 compared with profits of Pounds 4.6m, after providing for a one-off Pounds 60m provision against a US investment it plans to sell. Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, expected slow improvement. 'There are clear signs of an underlying recovery in orders, with encouraging volume increases in most areas of our business. The critical issue is pricing, which has been much slower to respond.' He forecast an unchanged dividend of 2p for 1993, and the interim is again 0.8p. Losses per share were 17p (earnings 0.5p) and 0.4p adjusting for the exceptionals. Turnover improved to Pounds 160.5m (Pounds 151.4m), mainly on US orders. Mr Tom said: 'These are very large jobs so you don't actually get an immediate benefit. In the current year we will see some benefit, but not as great as people might expect.' Bardon Roadstone, the English quarrying business, enjoyed a sound half year. It met its budget despite a fall in aggregates demand in the UK. Operating profit dropped to Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 13.4m) as both the Scottish businesses performed poorly compared with the previous period. Operating profits from US operations fell because of disposals and exchange rate effects. Net interest charge declined to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 8.8m) and borrowings at the half-way stage stood at Pounds 312m (Pounds 237m) before a Pounds 72m rights issue in July. 'The interest cost was little changed, on reduced dollar debt, due to the lower exchange rate this year. This more than offset the benefit of a stronger dollar on US earnings, which are seasonally low in the first half,' Sir Peter Parker, chairman, said. In addition to the rights issue, Bardon is planning a private placement of US loan notes worth Dollars 72m. This should reduce gearing to 60 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h) General Industry. OSHA is making no changes in the protective clothing provisions for general industry. Paragraph (i) Construction and Shipyard Standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several protective clothing issues in this rulemaking. The first issue involves the impact of the Class system on the personal protective clothing provisions. The existing standard requires that protective clothing be provided and worn when exposures exceed the PEL. The revised standards maintain this requirement. In addition, the revised standards require the use of personal protective clothing when Class I work is performed and when Class III work involving TSI and surfacing ACM is performed in the absence of a negative exposure assessment. OSHA believes that this change brings the standard in line with OSHA's 1986 intentions wherein the Agency believed that removal of thermal insulation and surfacing materials would result in exposures that exceed the PEL. This rulemaking record shows that some employers have developed control strategies that can reduce exposures below the PELs, for most of the time. However, as previously discussed, work with high-risk materials has substantial potential for over-exposure. Furthermore, studies have documented that in the past workers have brought asbestos contaminated clothing home with them and thereby caused exposure and asbestos-related disease among family members. OSHA believes that this standard must prevent such conditions, and the nature of Class I work and Class III work with high risk materials merits special consideration. Nearly all rulemaking participants agree on this point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA notes however, that the judgment to require protective clothing for asbestos work is a subjective one, to some extent, requiring judgment on the part of the competent person. The hazard from asbestos is associated with inhalation of fibers that are in the air, not from asbestos that comes in contact with the skin, like some other chemical that OSHA has regulated (such as methylenedianiline and benzene), which are absorbed through the skin and are systemic toxins. Asbestos fibers that are on clothing can become airborne, so OSHA continues to believe that situations where airborne fiber levels are high are also those which are likely to contaminate clothing. Therefore, the regulation continues the requirement for protective clothing and its proper disposal/cleaning. OSHA does not believe, however, that protective clothing is required for every operation involving asbestos. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the 1986 standards OSHA did not require that protective clothing be impermeable; in fact, OSHA responded to concerns that disposable clothing which was impermeable not be permitted because it was claimed to contribute to heat stress (see discussion at 51 FR 22722). Although the issue was not remanded to OSHA by the Court, several participants in the current rulemaking focussed comment on the issue of whether OSHA should require work clothing during asbestos work be impermeable to asbestos fibers in each of its asbestos standards. Most of those who addressed the issue expressed support for having such a requirement (Exs. 7&hyph;10, 7&hyph;67, 7&hyph;69, 7&hyph;138, 7&hyph;192, 7&hyph;195, 1&hyph;242, Tr. 1122, 1142, 1950, 3003 and 3156). It should also be noted that several of these commenters were manufacturers of such fabric or clothing. They also encouraged OSHA to set a requirement that all garments meet the requirements of the ANSI standard 101&hyph;1985. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Charles Salzenberg of Dupont presented a study which was performed at their behest by A.D. Little which indicated that neither shampooing the hair nor showering following simulated asbestos exposure completely removed fibers from hair or skin (Ex. 76) to support their request for an impermeable clothing requirement. In response to questioning about heat stress, he stated that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We've had projects for years on improving the breathability of Tyvek and in fact we have some material that exhibits improved breathability and the problem you always get when you get more breathability, you get more asbestos. There doesn't seem *&blank;*&blank;* a way to have a perfect filter that keeps out all fibrous material but lets a lot of air through *&blank;*&blank;* (Tr. 3444). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA continues to believe that heat stress is also a concern in use of protective clothing made of impervious fabric. It should again be noted that the route of exposure of asbestos fibers which creates a health hazard is inhalation, not skin absorption. The Agency reiterates its belief that non-disposable work clothes provide sufficient protection provided they are properly cleaned after work and laundered. The Agency agrees that disposable fiber-impermeable clothing can be safely worn if ``employers *&blank;*&blank;* use appropriate work-rest regimens and provide heat stress monitoring *&blank;*&blank;*'' (51 FR 22722). However, OSHA does not believe that totally impermeable clothing is a necessary requirement for asbestos work. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (10) Hygiene Facilities and Practices <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (j) Construction and Shipyard Employment Standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA is changing the decontamination requirements in minor details to correspond to its new system of categorizing asbestos work according to its potential risk. The primary requirement that asbestos abatement workers be decontaminated following their work using a 3-part system_an equipment room, a shower room, and a clean room, is retained. Thus, most workers performing Class I work, removing TSI or surfacing ACM or PACM, as before, must use a shower adjacent to and connected with the work area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the introduction of new provisions identifying 4 classes of asbestos work, it is necessary that OSHA modify its requirement for hygiene facilities and practices to reflect these changes. OSHA continues in its belief that the requirements must be proportional to the magnitude and likelihood of asbestos exposure. Therefore the most hazardous asbestos operations_those involving removal of more than threshold amounts of thermal system insulation or sprayed-on or troweled-on surfacing materials must employ a decontamination room adjacent to the regulated area (most often, a negative-pressure enclosure) consisting of an equipment room, shower room, and clean room in series through which workers must enter and exit the work area, as required in the 1986 standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Council of Economic Ministers has asked the Bank  of Thailand and the National Economic and Social Development  Board (NESDB) to revise their figures for this year, including  the inflation rate, Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin said  yesterday.    Mr Tharin said the revision was necessary because of higher  exports and stronger growth, which will cause inflationary  pressures.    "We want the two agencies to control inflation within the  earlier target of 4.2-4.5 percent, because if it accelerates  beyond that, the general public will be affected," he said.    High food prices have contributed much to higher inflation.  Prices of agricultural commodities including vegetables have  gone up, particularly in the provinces, affecting the living  standards of rural people.    Higher consumption of electricity in the first quarter (up  18.2 percent on the figure for the same period last year) could  also cause oil prices to rise, which is why the two agencies  must study how to control the factors which contribute to  inflation, he said.    The two agencies yesterday presented to the Cabinet an  assessment of the economic situation in the first quarter of  this year when inflation was as high as 4.8 percent. The  inflation problem needs to be tackled urgently, Mr Tharin said.    The Cabinet asked both agencies to revise the growth rate  based on three major factors: improving exports, government  spending and investment in the provinces, and private investment  particularly outside Bangkok.    The two agencies have one month for the revision, which will  then be submitted to the Cabinet for further consideration.    Meanwhile, Roengchai Marakanon, deputy governor of the Bank  of Thailand, said Thailand's inflation was tending to decline  since credit growth is being sustained, thanks to the likely  interest rate rises.    Annual inflation is expected to average the projected 4.8  percent and will not exceed this level, he said.    In the past month, exports rose to 16 percent, against the  projected 14.8 percent, while imports stood at only 10 percent.  The country's foreign trade for the month was also  satisfactory, he said.    Dr Olan Chaiprawat, president of Siam Commercial Bank,  shared  Mr Roengchai's view, saying rising interest rates would result  in a sustained inflation rate in the long run.    Dr Olan added that the country's inflation this year stemmed  from rising food and petrol prices. If these two categories of  goods are not taken into account, the country's inflation rate  would not surpass 4 percent.    Moreover, when comparing the projected annual inflation rate  of 4.8 percent with the country's projected 8 percent growth,  the overall economy is not unsatisfactory, he noted.    "Inflation in countries like Italy and France is growing  faster than that of Thailand. In those nations, the inflation  rate is as high as 4.5 percent while the economy grows at only 2  percent," Dr Olan said.    "Thailand is likely to be subject to high inflation only in  the case of high global inflation."    As for credit growth, which is usually viewed as a catalyst  for inflation, he said that in commercial banking, it stood at  only 15- 16 percent. It has not yet exceeded the alarming 20  percent level, he said.    Nevertheless, when taking into account loans extended  through  the Bangkok international banking facilities (BIBFs), the figure  may jump beyond 23 percent.    Dr Olan concluded that he believed that this year, the Thai  economy would expand steadily in a stable fashion. At present,  Thailand almost tops the global list in the proportional-usage  of gross domestic product (GDP) in investment.    About 60 percent of Thailand's GDP is consumed locally,  while  40 percent is used in investment. Korea uses 30 percent of its  GDP for investment, he said.    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak said Thailand  would try to maintain export growth this year at the high level  of 22 percent through various means, including expanding the  country's competitiveness in international markets.    Dr Suphachai said Thailand's export growth rate in the first  quarter was up 21-22 percent on the figure for the same period  last year, against a target of only 15 percent.</p>

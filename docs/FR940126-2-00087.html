The NRC has regulated activities at the site since June 1, 1986, under a source and byproduct material license issued in accordance with title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 40. Prior to June 1, 1986, activities at the site were regulated under a license issued by the State of New Mexico in accordance with its status as an NRC agreement state. During the period of State regulatory authority, the Homestake site was placed on the EPA's Superfund National Priorities List at the request of the State. A copy of the MOU, which delineates agency responsibilities at the site, is printed following this notice. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Ramon E.

Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document establishes the roles, responsibilities, and relationships between Region 6 of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Region IV of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``Parties,'' regarding remedial action at the Homestake Mining Company (HMC) uranium mill in Cibola County, New Mexico. The Parties have overlapping authority in connection with this site and, consistent with the purposes of the March 16, 1992, interagency Memorandum of Understanding between EPA and NRC entitled ``Guiding Principles for EPA/NRC Cooperation and Decision Making,'' this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will help assure that remedial actions occur in a timely and effective manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Basis for Agreement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NRC will assume the role of lead regulatory agency for the byproduct material disposal area reclamation and closure activities and EPA will monitor all such activities and provide review comments directly to NRC. The objective of EPA's review and comment will be to assure that activities to be conducted under NRC's regulatory authority will allow attainment of applicable or relevant and appropriate requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (``CERCLA''). 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq., outside of the byproduct material disposal site. NRC will require the Licensee to implement an approved disposal site reclamation plan which meets the requirements of 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, as amended at 52 FR 43553 through 43568 (November 1987), ``Uranium Mill Tailings Regulations; Ground Water Protection and other Issues,'' which conforms with EPA 40 CFR part 192, subpart D. EPA and NRC agree that the requirements of 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, are the Federal environmental and public health requirements applicable or relevant and appropriate to the disposal site. EPA and NRC believe that conformance with 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, will generally assure conformance with CERCLA requirements. However, each party will be responsible for assuring compliance with its specific regulatory requirements as discussed in this section. The parties believe that the U.S. Department of Energy or another responsible State or Federal authority will assume responsibility for long-term care of the byproduct material disposal site following remediation of the site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of New Mexico was responsible as an ``Agreement State'' for licensing and regulating uranium mills within the State until June 1, 1986, at which time, NRC reassumed this authority at the request of the Governor of New Mexico. Prior to this change, EPA had placed the HMC site on the National Priority List (NPL) of sites for response action under CERCLA. EPA's policy is to list only those uranium mills meeting criteria for placement on the NPL which are located in Agreement States, i.e., States which have entered into agreements with NRC pursuant to section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, to regulate certain nuclear activities in a manner compatible with NRC's program. Mills in States where NRC has direct licensing authority have not been placed on the list. Although New Mexico is no longer an Agreement State insofar as uranium recovery operations are concerned and NRC has reassumed primary jurisdiction, the site was properly placed on the NPL and the physical conditions resulting in that placement are still present. After completion of the closure of the disposal area and other remedial measures undertaken in full compliance with 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A (the applicable Federal standards for disposal site reclamation), EPA, pursuant to 40 CFR parts 425(e) and 515(c)(3) and in consultation with the State of New Mexico, shall determine whether all required response actions with respect to the site have been implemented. Following such a determination, the site may be considered for deletion for the NPL. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

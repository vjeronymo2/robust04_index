			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (7): British bankers scramble to unbundle - John Thornhill finds that UK takeover activity is at a 25 year low WITH takeover activity in the UK at a 25-year low, merchant bankers have been scrambling around for new ways to make a living. The last dribbles of the UK privatisation programme, a smattering of international joint ventures and the recent wave of rights issues have kept many of them occupied. But advising companies about the latest fashion for unbundling and restructuring a business is perhaps providing their most lucrative pastime. Arguably, the trend began with BAT Industries in 1990; it decided to unbundle itself rather than face the predations of Sir James Goldsmith. Merchant bankers were well rewarded for hiving off the Argos retailing chain and the Wiggins Teape Appleton paper business into separately listed companies. Since then they have been merrily trying to spot other companies which could benefit from more 'focus'. Courtaulds performed the same trick with its textiles business - and Racal did it with Vodafone. In the past year, there have been several other examples of UK companies restructuring themselves with the aim of concentrating on discrete industries and releasing additional shareholder value: ICI, the chemicals giant, has demerged its pharmaceuticals business, creating a separately listed FT-SE 100 company, Zeneca, capitalised at more than Pounds 6bn. ICI argued that the deal was driven primarily by industrial logic: the demerger would enable both its chemicals and pharmaceuticals companies to develop more aggressively in their chosen markets. Charter Consolidated has simplified its shareholding structure, and effectively bought its independence, by selling its 38 per cent in Johnson Matthey for Pounds 342m and buying out its own 36 per cent shareholder, Minorco, for Pounds 236m. The company claimed this would enable it to focus on expanding its core industrial concerns. Richemont is untangling its international web of corporate assets, to create two separately-quoted tobacco and luxury goods businesses, Rothmans International and Vendome. As well as releasing cash for both Richemont and other shareholders, the move should create more clearly delineated businesses with simpler shareholding structures. This unbundling trend has resulted from a variety of pressures, other than the threat of takeover. First, fund managers appear increasingly attracted to companies which 'stick to their knitting'. Big institutional investors have grown increasingly sophisticated at spreading risk and diversifying their own portfolios. The traditional rationale for agglomeration - namely to smooth out cyclicality of earnings - is therefore dropping down the list of investors' needs. Managers, too, appear to have learned from the excesses of the 1980s, when some companies went wild exploiting paper money and lax accounting standards to grow shaky businesses by means of acquisition. Management gurus now preach the steadier virtues of organic growth and 'core competences'. Companies now seem more inclined to conclude agreed deals in related industries than make hostile approaches in unrelated sectors. This lessens the associated financial and managerial risks. Buyers are likely to have far more familiarity with the target company, and can undertake extensive due diligence. As Ken Costa, director of merchant bankers S G Warburg, puts it: 'In the 1980s you flirted with all the girls in the street and married someone from across town. This time, you flirt but marry the girl next door. You know all the family history and all the rows, because you are next-door neighbours.' The other important element in the equation, though, is the low inflation which prevails in much of the developed world. High inflation corrupted the value of cash, encouraging managers to splash out on assets as a hedge. 'The idea was that you could not hold cash, because inflation would erode its value. Instead, you invested in a huge capital base which would help you out by appreciating in value,' says Mr Costa. 'But there is now no embarrassment in giving back money to shareholders.' Reuters has perhaps established a precedent in returning Pounds 350m of surplus cash to shareholders by means of its share buy-back scheme. These changing corporate trends have important consequences for merchant bankers. They suggest that opportunistic hostile takeover bids, which formed their staple diet in the 1980s, will be infrequent. This may make life tricky for the small merchant banking boutiques, which are heavily reliant on the success fees derived from traditional M&amp;A work. Companies seem likely to continue shedding peripheral businesses as they focus on their main areas of skill and knowledge. When expanding, they seem more likely to buy unwanted divisions of other companies than to launch bids for quoted assets. The recent experience of the predatory MB-Caradon is perhaps illustrative of the trend. After scouring the stock market for any value in the quoted building materials sector, the cash-rich predator has homed in on an parcel of building-products assets owned by RTZ, which is slimming down to its core mining interests. Merchant banks need intimate contacts and a fair degree of lateral thinking to initiate and benefit from such deals. Those banks with strong analytical teams are perhaps best placed to spot the opportunities. But the more austere climate of the 1990s will not necessarily put merchant bankers out of fashion. Asset reshuffles and corporate restructurings can prove just as profitable for merchant banks as takeover deals. This is especially true if such deals span different countries' regulatory and tax regimes. The restructuring of Richemont's tobacco and luxury goods business provides a case in point. The reshuffle created two companies with twin listings on the London and Amsterdam, and London and Luxembourg, stock exchanges. 'What you lose in hostility, you make up for in complexity,' Mr Costa says. 'It just puts a premium on ingenuity and innovation.'</p>

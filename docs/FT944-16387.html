			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / International Company News: TWA mounts restructuring campaign Trans World Airlines, the US airline struggling to avert a financial crisis, yesterday started campaigning to win support for a sweeping financial restructuring that will nearly halve its debt. Late on Tuesday, TWA announced a rescue plan under which creditors are being asked to swap Dollars 800m of the company's Dollars 1.8bn debt for new equity, taking their stake in the airline from 55 per cent to possibly 70 per cent. Employees, who now own 45 per cent of the airline, would see their stake diluted to as little as 30 per cent. If the rescue plan succeeds, TWA believes it will be able to survive the lean winter months and return to profitability next year. If it fails, the airline will almost certainly have to file for some form of bankruptcy protection again. TWA, once one of the world's biggest and best-known airlines, last went into bankruptcy protection in 1992, weighed down by debt from a leveraged buy-out. It emerged from a chapter 11 reorganisation in November last year, but has not made a profit since. Earlier this year, most of the airline's senior executives were replaced. Since then, many unprofitable routes have been axed, the airline's Atlanta mini-hub has been closed, 3,000 jobs cuts have been announced, and the airline's labour unions have agreed to productivity increases worth Dollars 130m-Dollars 140m a year. Yesterday Mr Robert Peiser, chief financial officer, blamed TWA's present financial difficulties on over-optimistic revenue assumptions by the previous management. When the expected revenues failed to emerge, he said, the airline had found itself unable to cover its costs. The new management, Mr Peiser said, had changed strategy by concentrating on costs. 'Our revenue forecast for next year is about flat with this year, and yet we see substantial profitability because of the cost savings we already have in place.' TWA's problem is that all its credit facilities are drawn and it has insufficient cash to pay its debts. If it is to stave off looming bankruptcy, it has to persuade its creditors to swap their debt for equity. Some analysts question whether creditors holding debt secured on the airline's assets would be prepared to take such a risk. But to address this difficulty, TWA is proposing to treat the various classes of debt-holders differently, asking those with the least secured debt to take the most equity. The proposal is backed with a threat, too. TWA says that if some creditors do not agree to the restructuring, it will file a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan - one reached with the prior consent of some creditors - which would be aimed at impairing the rights of those who held out against the restructuring. 'It would be a tactical strike, a narrowly-focused option targeted at those people who did not co-operate,' Mr Peiser said. TWA would nevertheless need the support of at least two thirds of its creditors before it could file such a plan. Over the next few weeks, it will be campaigning hard in an attempt to secure it.</p>

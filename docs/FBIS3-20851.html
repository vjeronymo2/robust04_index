			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:CSO     [Unattributed article: "Czech Citizens of Slovakia"]    [Text] By the end of 1993, approximately 43,000 Czechs had  applied for Slovak citizenship. This year, additional  applications, which are routinely processed by the Slovak  Ministry of Interior, are being received. Those that come from  the Czech Republic get preferential treatment. According to the  ministry, two or three applications on the average arrive daily,  and their processing takes approximately one month. Slovak  authorities demand that applicants furnish their birth and  marriage certificates, an extract from the crime register, and a  certificate verifying their permanent residence in the Slovak  Republic. Bratislava has so far not made available any  statistics on the number of Slovaks who have, up to now,  requested that their Slovak citizenship be supplanted by Czech  citizenship.</p>

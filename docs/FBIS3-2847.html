			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liu Haimin (0491 3189 3046)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- In a group discussion  of the government work report with delegates from Tibet, Hu  Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the CPC Central  Committee Secretariat, said: Only by gaining a clear  understanding of the situation, keeping overall interests in  mind, uniting as one, and working in a down-to-earth manner can  we constantly push the cause of reform and construction forward.  He firmly believed that Tibet will be better off tomorrow.    Having attentively listened to delegates' remarks, Hu Jintao  noted: This year is an important year for deepening reform and  stepping up development; we must accelerate the establishment of  a socialist market economic structure under the condition of a  high- speed economic growth and strive to achieve sustained,  rapid, and healthy economic development while changing  enterprise operating mechanisms. Currently, we are under a good  situation, shouldering heavy responsibilities, facing many  difficulties, and having a bright future. He stressed: The CPC  Central Committee has scientifically analyzed the current  situation, definitely set "seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability" as the overall interests of the entire party and the  whole nation, and demanded that all kinds of work be  subordinated to and serve the overall interests. We must gain a  clear understanding of the situation, keep overall interests in  mind, unite as one, and work in a down-to-earth manner. We  should not only press forward in the face of difficulties --  steadfastly and constantly push the cause of reform and  construction forward -- but also judge the hour and size up the  situation and study and resolve contradictions and problems  cropping up in the course of progress with a sober mind.    Hu Jintao said: Development and stability are two major  issues for Tibet's work. The establishment of a socialist  market economic structure has brought Tibet new opportunities  for economic development; in the meantime, however, some new  conditions and problems have surfaced too. In face of the new  situation, we should further emancipate the mind and guide  Tibet's economic development with new concepts and thinking that  are suited to a socialist market economy. We should firmly keep  Tibet's special conditions in mind, consider the reality in  Tibet in approaching all problems and doing everything, and make  Tibet's stability and economic development, as well as the  pursuit of interests of various nationalities in Tibet, the  starting point and standpoint of our work. We should  continuously carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard  struggle, do a solid job, and fulfill all sorts of work.    Hu Jintao concluded: The CPC Central Committee and the State  Council have always attached great importance to Tibet's work  and shown concern over people of various nationalities in Tibet.  Since reform and open policies were launched, the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council have adopted a series of special  policies and flexible measures for Tibet, which have favorably  promoted economic development and social progress in Tibet and  are well received and supported by people in Tibet. In the  course of developing a socialist market economy, the CPC Central  Committee and the State Council will continue to pay attention  to and show concern for Tibet as usual. We believe that with  the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee, vigorous  support of other fraternal provinces and regions, and the  concerted efforts and hard struggle of various nationalities in  Tibet, Tibet will be better off tomorrow.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] It is very important to raise farmers' incomes in  the Second Long-Range Development Plan (PJPT II). The farm  sector will remain an important factor because it is still the  main source of income for the Indonesian people.    President Suharto stressed this point at a ceremony held in  the State Palace, Jakarta, when he presented honors to winners  of the 1993 national intensification contest on Thursday (10  February). Mrs. Tien Suharto, Vice President Try Sutrisno and  Mrs. Try Sutrisno, several members of the Sixth Development  Cabinet and Minister of Agriculture Sjarifudin Baharsjah were  present at the ceremony.    On this occasion the president symbolically gave a savings  account of five million rupiahs and a hand tractor to the winner  of the first prize, Super-INSUS [Special Intensification] Unit  Number 1 of Cilacap County, Central Java; the prizes were  accepted by Hidayat, the chairman. The same prizes were given to  A. Wakidi, Chairman of Tani Sumber Makmur Group III and KUD  [Village Unit Cooperative] III of Sragen County, East Java.    As the first-prize winner in the 1993 Mina Padi  intensification contest, the Mina Rejeki farmers' group and the  Bangun Tani KUD from Banjarnegara received a savings account of  5 million rupiahs, a power thresher unit, fishing equipment and  all administrative necessities. All of these prizes were  accepted by Head of the Administrative Section NA [expansion  unknown] from the Mina Rejeki farmers' group.    Another saving book with the same amount of money, ship  chandler's equipment and all administrative necessities were  also given to Liwondullah Kuswanto, chairman of the Bakung  farmers' group and to the Mina Suryo KUD of Cilacap, Central  Java. This group was the first-prize winner in the 1993  fish-catching contest.    Mrs. Tien Suharto symbolically gave a soy-cake slicing  machine and three dozen plates to Mrs Chr. Suryanti, a female  farmer from the Sumber Makmur III Farmers' Group of Sragen. The  same prizes were given to Mrs. Kuryati, a female farmer from the  Mina Rejeki farmers' group of Banjarnegara accepted [as  published] and Mrs. Dariyah Manijo, a female farmer from the  Bakung farmers' group of Cilacap, Central Java.  <H5>  Primary Source </H5>   The president stressed that efforts to increase farmers'  incomes is no less important than other initiatives. During PJPT  II the farm sector will continue to be the primary source of  income for most Indonesians.    At the same time, along with the increase in population and  the increase in people's income, the demand for farm products is  also increasing. On the other hand, these developments reduce  the amount of farm land. "That is why we must be able to  increase the ability of farmers to raise the scale of their farm  enterprises through the development of group farm enterprises  through the application of various aspects of agribusiness and  agroindustry," the Head of State said.    These measures, said the Head of State, must also be matched  by an increase in the role of the KUD in servicing farm  production, capital and marketing. It is hoped that these  efforts will give an increased value to farm enterprises  oriented toward agribusiness.    In addition, to raise social well-being on a broad scale in  the years to come, the president continued, the farm sector must  continue to be developed along with the development of the  populace so that the agricultural sector can continue to play  its role and will be able to supply the food needs of the entire  population of Indonesia.    The agricultural sector must also be capable of providing an  incentive for the growth of domestic and export industries, as  well as take part in producing equitable growth and in  increasing village dynamics. The president also stressed that  sustaining self-support in food must at the same time be  directed toward increasing the quality of nutrients that people  consume. That is why self-sufficiency is not limited to just  rice but also covers diversification of food production and  consumption. Once again the president stressed, "no less  important is increasing farmers' incomes".    He suggested that raising the living standards of farmers,  the largest sector of society, has been in the center of the  developmental battlefield from the start. That is also why the  field of agriculture always gets the most attention.    But he admitted that developing agriculture is not an easy  task which can be carried out quickly. The development of  agriculture requires perseverance and takes a long time. The  president said that development efforts have yielded  satisfactory results, proved by ever-increasing farm production  which has resulted in self-sufficiency.    The president hopes that we can continue these initiatives  and at the same time try to increase farmers' income so as to  decrease the number of farmers living below the poverty line.    At the same time, Agriculture Minister Sjarifudin Baharsjah  said that the goal of these activities is to provide the  farmers' groups and the KUDs with the greater motivation and  energy needed to persevere, and be diligent and energetic. It is  hoped that the heads of development-unit agencies and BIMAS  [Mass Guidance] managers will increase their cooperation in  developing and servicing the KUDs and the farmers.    Moreover, it will encourage the cooperation and partnership  between farmers who participate in farmers' groups with KUDs and  development companies [as published]. He also said that these  measures will also increase farmers' production, income. .</p>

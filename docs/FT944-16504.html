			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Tory MP for Dudley West dies The government was yesterday faced with the likely reduction of its Commons majority to 13 after Mr John Blackburn, the Conservative MP for Dudley West, died of a heart attack aged 61. Mr Blackburn's death in the early hours of yesterday morning leaves the Conservatives facing a by-election in a marginal Midlands constituency at a time when the party is trailing Labour in the polls. It reduces the government's majority temporarily to 14, but Labour would be disappointed not to make further inroads by overturning the majority of 5,789 that Mr Blackburn had in the 1992 general election. Such a result would make it even harder for the government to push controversial legislation, such as the planned Post Office privatisation, through parliament. Mr Blackburn, a former policeman and one-time sales director of Solway Engineering, was staunchly loyal to the party line throughout his 15-year parliamentary career.</p>

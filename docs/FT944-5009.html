			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / People: Hutchings and the price of promotion Greg Hutchings, who earned Pounds 1.2m last year as chief executive of industrial and foods conglomerate, Tomkins, could earn less this year in his new role as executive chairman. The promotion is part of a reshuffle announced yesterday. Hutchings enjoys a complex remuneration package which includes incentive payments based on earnings, dividend and share price performance, but given the company's share price performance over the past year, it was probable Hutchings' earnings would be less than last year's. Since January, Tomkins' shares have fallen from a high of 282p to last night's 216p. Leaks to the weekend press forced the early announcement yesterday of the reshuffle, which was originally planned for January. Michael Moore, Tomkins' part-time non-executive chairman for 11 years and a director since 1981, is retiring at the age of 58. The company said yesterday the reshuffle had been planned for several months and denied there had been any acrimony over Moore's departure. Other directors are to be promoted; Ian Duncan, becomes deputy chairman and retains his post as managing director (finance). Bob Muddimer, chairman of the foods division Ranks Hovis McDougall, becomes joint managing director, operations, with Tony Reading, head of the company's US division. Jim Butler and Lionel Stammers have resigned as non-executive directors to focus on their other board commitments. They will be replaced by Roger Holland, chairman of Cray Electronics, and Mr Ali Wambold, a managing director of Lazard Brothers in London.</p>

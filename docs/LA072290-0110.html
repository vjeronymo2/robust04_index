			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TEACHER'S WORLD  </P> <P> Jay Mathews' review of Samuel G. Freedman's "Small Victories: The Real World of  a Teacher, Her Students &amp; Their High School" (May 20) brought back memories  of New York's Lower East Side that haven't surfaced, except for the faintest  ripples, in more than 50 years.  </P> <P> How times have changed! The area was then predominantly Jewish, although there  were also some Poles, Italians, Russians and other Middle-European immigrants  who belonged to different religious groups. . . .  </P> <P> What they had in common was their awareness that they were all, in some way,  part of an underclass and that the only way to improve their lot was through  hard work and schooling.  </P> <P> These were boys who came to school only after having delivered papers, opened  their fathers' small grocery stores or seen several younger members of the  family off to school. The girls were surrogate mothers to large families,  cooking, cleaning and sewing, and working after school when they could find  jobs.  </P> <P> Like today's students, they too required a great deal more of their teachers  than often the teachers were equipped to give. I recall vividly the pain I felt  when one girl in a civics class said she was ashamed that her father was a  street cleaner. We spent most of that class hour trying to make her proud of  the contribution he was making. Everyone got involved and there were a good  many secrets revealed in class that day. . . .  </P> <P> I like to think that I may have helped a little. Somewhere I still have a poem  by a young tomboy named Adele Kupchik, which, she told me, she had written to  thank me for "making me see." I wonder what happened to Adele. I hope she  doesn't live on Pitt Street any more.  </P> <P> ETHEL BOOTH  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Minmet talks with Gulf Exploration terminated Minmet has ended discussions with Gulf Exploration Consultants over its possible acquisition of the Dublin-based electronic information, mining and exploration group. Instead, Emerging Money, its information services division, has been sold to Gulf, a US shell company in which Minmet has a significant stake. Mr Paul Bristol, Minmet chairman, said: 'It is better if Gulf is seen to be providing only financial information, rather than being muddled together with our other businesses.' Minmet exchanged the assets of Emerging Money in return for 37.9m shares in Gulf, taking its stake to 60 per cent. Gulf intends to revive its listing on Nasdaq in the new year.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Back with a bang Now that the take-over of Confederation UK Holdings plc by Sun Life of Canada has received regulatory approval, Confederation Bank makes a return to the Highest Rates table with its market-leading Tessa (tax-exempt special savings account) of 9 per cent, fixed for five years. Building societies are slowly filtering increases through to their savers. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is the largest society to announce new rates so far, with increases of up to 0.4 per cent. Northern Rock has re-opened its Go Direct account. Although the account must be opened by post, cheques may be deposited and withdrawn from branches after that. Fixed rates continue to be in favour. Leeds and Newcastle have both launched new fixed products. Norwich and Peterborough has increased rates on all its fixed products; it now pays up to 8.55 per cent on a three-year bond. The market leader for three years remains Coventry at 9.10 per cent. For those requiring gross interest, rates offshore are also slowly increasing on ordinary accounts. The majority of banks have increased rates but the only building society subsidiary to increase has been C&amp;G Channel Islands Ltd. Confederation Bank (Jersey) Ltd returns with its Flexible Investment account. Guaranteed income bonds also continue a gradual rise. Eurolife went up to 7.75 per cent on a five-year bond to lead this week, only to be leap-frogged by Laurentian Life paying 7.85 per cent and then by Liberty Life, with rates up to 8.25 per cent (10.31 per cent to a basic-rate taxpayer) at Pounds 50,000.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / 'Archaic' annual Budget attacked BRITAIN'S annual Budget should be scrapped and replaced with a more considered system of formulating fiscal policy, according to Sir Douglas Wass, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury. In comments shortly before tomorrow's Budget statement, Sir Douglas said the Treasury's 'archaic' secrecy in preparing for it was unnecessary and reduced the possibilities of a public debate about tax policy and the workings of the economy. His comments will add to the disquiet about the Budget process expressed by some MPs, former government officials and people in financial markets. Sir Douglas was the longest-serving Treasury permanent secretary since the 1950s, having held this job between 1974 and 1983. He served under two chancellors, Labour's Mr Denis Healey and the Conservative, Sir Geoffrey Howe. He is now chairman of Nomura International, the European arm of the Japanese securities house. Sir Douglas is unconnected to any political party. But his proposals come close to official thinking by Labour, which wants to improve on the Budget process by publishing an annual UK economic assessment which would link government spending and income. Sir Douglas said the Treasury should open up the process of making economic forecasts, possibly by handing this job to an independent body outside Whitehall. The forecasts are published twice a year, in the Budget and in the Treasury's Autumn Statement on public spending. Reducing secrecy over official forecasts would strengthen public confidence that Treasury projections were being made on purely economic grounds, and not tinged by political bias. Sir Douglas said the Budget speech, which the chancellor normally gives in March, should be replaced by two discussion documents or green papers, to be published in October and January. The first of these would be a draft Finance Bill which would deal with relatively non-controversial aspects of tax-collection such as changes in tax law in specific sectors. The second green paper would be a broader planning exercise - linked to the Autumn Statement - which would match up government spending commitments with likely revenues. The Treasury would publish a draft of its tax proposals, so it could be studied ahead of enactment by a Commons select committee. Notification of possible tax changes in advance would have an 'imperceptible' effect on people's behaviour. According to Sir Douglas, other countries publish their tax proposals 'without provoking economic breakdown'. Men in raincoats, Page 7</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Traffic cops on the digital beat THE digital networks that will distribute voice, data and video services into homes of the future will need very fast chips to act like the silicon equivalent of a traffic policeman, allowing connection to several selected services, writes Paul Taylor. IBM researchers, at Yorktown Heights, New York, have developed such an ultra-fast switch chip that can handle data at the rate of 5bn bits per second - more than double any previously reported rate - in each of 16 channels simultaneously. This gives the chip an overall data rate of 80bn bits per second - equivalent to transferring the text from more that 18,000 average-sized novels in one second. Other potential applications for the chip include acting as a central high-speed data traffic controller in a multi-processor network system. IBM researchers built the experimental chip around a unique three-device cell - comprising two transistors and one resistor - which allows cells to be packed much closer together. As a result the new chip offers higher speed and lower-power consumption than today's chips which use cells with five transistors each. IBM: US, 914 945 3884; UK, 0705 321212.</p>

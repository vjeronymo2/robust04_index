			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases after seven-day climb POSITION adjustment ahead of the weekend pushed prices down, and share prices fell for the first time in seven trading days despite buying by arbitrageurs and public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 8.43 to 17,470.61, falling after its longest consecutive rise since February last year though still up 2.6 per cent on the week. The index fluctuated between the day's low of 17,368.61 and high of 17,569.21. Volume fell to 250m shares from 311m. Although the Nikkei fell, other market indices reflected the underlying, positive sentiment. Gainers led losers by 531 to 426 with 173 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.48 to 1,307.54, while the second section also advanced. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.95 to 1,055.96. Dealers covered short positions while public funds were seen small-lot buying. However, traders said that genuine buying by institutional investors was absent. Securities issues recovered after a fall on Thursday's announcement by Nomura Securities of compensation totalling Y23bn to individual clients, due to slack sales procedures. Nomura Securities gained Y50 to Y1,450 and Daiwa Securities Y25 to Y835. Banks, which annnounced interim earnings results on Thursday, were mixed. Dealers adjusted positions on bank issues as brokers noted increased inquiries from financial authorities concerning share price movements. Traders said short-selling hedge funds, wary of being questioned by the ministry of finance, were reluctant to take out new positions. Bank of Tokyo fell Y10 to Y1,340 and Sakura Bank remained unchanged at Y1,150. Some high-technology issues which rose on Thursday on buying by public funds, fell on profit-taking. NEC fell Y12 to Y671 and Hitachi lost Y3 to Y723. Precision makers gained ground on hopes of a recovery in the US economy. Canon rose Y20 to Y1,330 and Citizen Watch gained Y11 to Y905. Honda Motor also advanced, by Y60 to Y1,380. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 55.20 to 18,788.59 in volume of 29.1m shares. Roundup DOMESTIC and international influences lifted most of the region's markets, but Australia failed to regain its momentum. NEW ZEALAND extended its bull run yet again, the NZSE-40 index closing 20.26 higher at 1,545.27, up 6.9 per cent on the week, in moderate turnover of NZDollars 29m. Fletcher Challenge closed up 11 cents at NZDollars 2.11 amid rumours that it is about to announce an asset sale. HONG KONG got a boost from London traded stocks and the Hang Seng index climbed 73.49 to 5,986.67, 1.8 per cent higher on the week, in turnover up from HKDollars 1.81bn to HKDollars 1.97bn. Banks posted the sharpest increases, with HSBC Holdings and its Hang Seng Bank unit both rising HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 60 and HKDollars 54 respectively. BANGKOK rose as a Bt10bn rescue fund pooled by brokers had started buying. The SET index rose 11.25 to 869.49, fractionally down on the week, in turnover of Bt5.82bn. SINGAPORE took its gain on the week to 2.4 per cent as the Straits Times Industrial index closed 10.97 higher at 1,447.96. AUSTRALIA stayed flat in mixed trade, still 2.9 per cent higher on the week as the All Ordinaries index finished 0.1 lower at 1,450.8. Turnover was ADollars 385m and CSR was the star of the day, rising 14 cents to ADollars 3.75 on improved earnings. SEOUL fell on pre-election jitters.

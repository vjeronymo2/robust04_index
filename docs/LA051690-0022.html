			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBERTY GOES BEGGING;  </P> <P> LAW: A FEDERAL JUDGE CONSIGNS PANHANDLERS TO A CLASS OUTSIDE THE PROTECTION OF  THE FIRST AMENDMENT. WHAT MORE CAN THE HOMELESS LOSE?  </P> <P> A few of those hissings and slitherings that intimate the presence of the  snakes of meanness of spirit are rather too audible in the cadences sounded in  U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Frank X. Altimari's affirmation of the New York  City Transit Authority's ban on panhandling on its subways.  </P> <P> We might wish that Judge Altimari was up to a little more respect for the  decencies of hypocrisy than he showed in the fleeting nod he gave to the altar  of our ritual pieties about suffering humanity in general before he dismissed  one of its most abject segments in the particular.  </P> <P> In essence, the Court of Appeals ruled that individuals cannot beg in the  subways, but that organized charities can. Judge Altimari's distinction -- it  scarcely amounts to a difference -- is that solitary beggars convey no message  except their desire "to extract money from those they accost," while  respectable, presumably because organized, solicitors communicate information  and disseminate views and ideas. The homeless beggar's want of shelter  therefore extends to the First Amendment because his conduct fails to meet the  standards for "variety of speech interests" that qualify a candidate to lodge  under even its roof.  </P> <P> Altimari may or may not have been often reduced to the exigencies of subway  travel, but there is small chance that he could have and escaped the  too-frequent experience of the passage by some ragged stranger mutely holding  forth his paper cup, and then one's sudden halt to turn and drop a puny mite.  If a face that can thus abrade the laggard conscience is not a kind of speech,  then what are we to take communication to be?  </P> <P> It is Altimari's view that, "while there is no doubt that giving alms is  virtuous, in the Western tradition there is also no doubt that the virtue is  best served when it reflects an 'ordered charity.' " This is a precis of  Western tradition that some of its historians may find lamentably shortened.  The Franciscan order would be the last to suggest that it is purer than in the  days when its saintly founder went barefoot on the byways begging bread for the  poor and, of necessity, also for himself.  </P> <P> Altimari supports his preference for "ordered charities" by citing the Supreme  Court's opinion that it was unconstitutional for Maryland to limit fund-raisers  to 25% of the proceeds of their appeals. The plaintiff was a professional  solicitor, and while we might go too far if we called a man a hustler for  keeping for himself a quarter of what he has gleaned for those in need, we have  to recognize him as indeed the stateliest of beggars.  </P> <P> It is hard to dispute the Court of Appeals' judgment that the panhandler is a  nuisance. Reminders of suffering humanity are always nuisances, but there are  altogether worse ones attendant upon the companionships enforced in public  transit. Of course, beggars now and then accost, but the run of them are too  beaten by circumstances and the shame to which they have been reduced to be up  to exertions beyond standing all but unconscious of the faces that tithe for  them.  </P> <P> Altimari gives special weight to a Transit Authority survey that "revealed  that, in fact, two-thirds of the subway ridership have been intimidated into  giving money to (beggars)." It would not be easy to conceive a greater excess  of frivolity in the judicial temper than this certification of a study of  beggars bought and paid for by their declared enemies. After all, the  conservative canon embodied by this judge has no article more sacred than the  one that abjures courts from substituting what the public might say for the  strict prescriptions of the Constitution. The subway beggar is indeed unique;  he is condemned to the first class whose First Amendment credentials are  disqualified by a poll.  </P> <P> Talk about nuisances. You cannot walk through an airline terminal without being  afflicted by devotees of the martyred Lyndon Larouche bawling the noxious  notions of a convicted swindler and unrepentant caterer to paranoid fantasies.  No one would suggest that their right to ventilate their views could fairly be  tested by a public-opinion poll that included the rational and civilized  majority of citizens.  </P> <P> But the First Amendment remains the guaranteed protection of every sort of  nuisance except the beggar who appeals to nothing worse in us than our pity and  is now consigned by a circuit court to a station lower than a four-letter  obscenity's.  </P></p>

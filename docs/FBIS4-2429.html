			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- The resignation of  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is not expected to  weaken Japan's support for Taiwan's bid to join the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a high-ranking trade  official said Saturday [9 April].    Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign  Trade  (BOFT) said the Japanese administration is usually free from  political interference.    "Hosokawa's successor is not likely to change Japan's  established policy of supporting Taiwan's GATT bid," Huang said.    He pointed out Taiwan's entry into the Geneva-based world  trade regulatory body is in Japan's interest under the current  GATT framework.    "Japan enjoys a huge trade surplus with Taiwan," Huang said.  "Japan would benefit further from Taiwan's market opening  following its GATT entry," he noted.    Huang is scheduled to visit Tokyo late this month. While  there, Huang will hold informal GATT-related tariff concession  talks with Japanese officials and discuss other bilateral trade  issues. Japan has not yet proposed a list of items it wants to  negotiate with Taiwan for tariff reductions.    Huang said he hopes Japan's new cabinet will take more  positive steps to redress its huge trade surplus with Taiwan,  which reached a record US$14.2 billion in 1993 and is likely to  hit US$16 billion this year. "If the growing trade imbalance  remains unresolved, it will become a political issue," he warned.    Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations, Taiwan  has maintained close economic relations with Japan because of  historical and geographical reasons.    Li Shang-chia, chief executive of a Taiwan-Japan trade  promotion task force under the semi-official China External  Trade Development Council, said he believes Hosokawa's quitting  would not affect economic relations between the two countries.    C. F. Ku, chairman of the Chinese National Association of  Industry and Commerce, echoed Li's view. Still, Ku said he  worries that the political fallout of Hosokawa's resignation may  slow transfer of Japanese technology to Taiwan.    Ku, also chairman of the Taiwan-Japan trade promotion fund,  said Hosokawa's departure may delay Japan's political reforms  and market opening, and even cut into Japan's foreign aid and  investment. "As Japan's gross national product accounts for  about 20 percent of the world's total production of goods and  services, its policy changes would certainly have an impact on  the global economic development," Ku noted.    "The government should keep close watch on Japan's political  and economic development following Hosokawa's resignation,  particularly who will be the next minister of international  trade and industry," he added.</p>

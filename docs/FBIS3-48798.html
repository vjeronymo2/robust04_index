			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroto Kosuge, MAINICHI </F> SHIMBUN political reporter: "Mass Media Versus Political World"]    [Text] The fact that Ichiro Ozawa shifted from his  closed-door "informal press conferences" to open "formal press  conferences" poses a question concerning political reporting and  politicians' statements.  <H3>  Ozawa Has Obscured His Actions to the Degree That He Has  Distanced Himself From Reporters </H3>   Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa played a leading role in the formation of the coalition  government and will play a key role in the full-scale  reorganization of the political world based on the new election  system. It need not be said that Mr. Ozawa's future actions will  be of foremost concern to political reporters. However, the  atmosphere prevailing around Mr. Ozawa is completely in contrast  to that normally seen in connection with a political leader. If  one were to ask, do reporters swarm around in the presence of  Mr. Ozawa? the answer would be, "No," and no reporters are to be  seen in the mornings or evenings around the Ozawa residence in  Fukazawa, Setagaya ward.    Leaders of the past who aspired to become prime minister and  were gaining momentum towards that goal were in all cases  exposed to the mass media offensive. Even Mr. Ozawa had been  exposed to such an environment not long ago. Such leaders  normally studied how to deal with political reporters, plotted  to guide public opinion to their advantage and attempted to  confirm public reaction by influencing reporters into writing  about their views. Since such guidance often included major news  items, political reporters have found it quite difficult to  prepare articles without subjecting themselves to such  manipulation. In recent years, typical leaders who used the  method were former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and former LDP  Vice President Shin Kanemaru, but Mr. Ozawa has not continued  the mass media approach of the Tanaka faction and the Keiseikai  and has assumed methods which refute such an approach.    The following four points cover the media policy launched by  Mr. Ozawa after the recent House of Representatives' election:  1) Will not respond to early-morning and late-night  news-gathering; 2) Will not hold informal press conferences; 3)  However, in compensation, will respond to any questions during  formal press conferences; and 4) When a reporter wants a  personal interview, he will be asked to specify his purpose and  make a prior appointment.    In summary, he made a declaration that he would make himself  available to the mass media in a "formal" way. Three months have  passed since this Ozawa policy was implemented, but comments  concerning it vary widely. His policy emphasizing "formal" press  conferences has been welcomed as being proper in recent times  when adhesion between politicians and political reporters has  been criticized, but, on the other hand, some sources criticize  the fact that Mr. Ozawa's routine actions are more difficult to  discern to the degree that the policy distances him from  reporters. The policy poses the serious issue of political  reporting and politicians' statements, beyond what was  envisioned by Mr. Ozawa.    The site is waiting room No. 25 assigned to Shinseito in the  Diet building. The time is during the Ozawa press conference  immediately following the early-in-the-week coalition government  summit meeting and the air is filled with tension. The  conference can be attended by anyone not belonging to the press  club such as weekly magazine reporters and special foreign  reporters, and no restrictions are imposed on questions. The  conference on 12 October lasted for 40 minutes.    Reporter: The Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] is taking a lot of time to debate proposed revisions to  the Self-Defense Forces Law. Are you in a position to agree with  the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] revision plan?    Ozawa: I am in agreement with the substance of the  proposed revision plan. However, although this statement applies  to the LDP as well, the issues of peace and security have not  necessarily been adequately debated within the coalition  parties. (omission) Even the LDP cannot be proud of the fact  that it has not done an adequate job in this respect. I am not  about to agree to an LDP proposal just because the coalition  parties have not completed their debate on the issue.    Reporter: A Communist Party Diet member posed a  question in the Diet about Mr. Ozawa exercising control over  general contractors in Iwate Prefecture, but...    Ozawa: I have received donations from all kinds of  people and would have to assume that general contractors were  among them. I know there is a Tosho Club, but it is not an  individual support group. Neither I nor my office has ever heard  any rumors about the dam construction project.    Reporter: The Korean daily press quotes Mr. Ozawa  as saying that parliamentary dissolution and general elections  will take place after autumn next year and formation of a new  party will take place as soon as the outlook for those actions  becomes clear.    Ozawa: Since there are appropriate cut-off points  to accomplish certain actions, it is only appropriate to assume  that party reorganization will take place in connection with  changes in election systems, and differences in  intergenerational perceptions do exist within the LDP as well as  within the coalition parties. (omission) We must admit to the  existence of such intergroup differences in concepts. This is  why we can expect reorganizations in both ruling and opposition  parties.    Otherwise, questions posed covered a broad range such as the  liberalization of rice imports, consumer tax rates, and Russian  President Yeltsin's visit to Japan. At the end of the press  conference, he was asked, "It has been some time since you  discontinued informal press conferences, how do you feel about  that topic now?" Mr. Ozawa responded by saying, "I find nothing  wrong with that approach. I do not comment on things I cannot  discuss with the press, but do comment on topics when it is  permissible. I feel discontinuance of the informal press  conferences was not a bad idea." Later, increased attention was  focused on Ozawa press conferences to include the one held on  the 16th in Shizuoka city when he clarified his position of not  objecting to tariffication of rice imports.    Individuals posing questions during press conferences are  required to first state their company and personal names and if  they should inadvertently forget to do so, Mr. Ozawa will not  respond. Whenever a question is not clearly stated, Mr. Ozawa  makes a naked display of his displeasure. At times, he even  reminds the attendees, "Please research your questions  thoroughly before you come to the conference." Foreign  correspondents also attend the conferences and at one session  when a British Broadcasting Corporation reporter asked, "May I  pose a question in English?" Mr. Ozawa rejected the request,  saying, "No. This is the Japanese Diet." At any rate, Mr.  Ozawa's attitude of never smiling and refraining from use of  flattery towards the press contributes to the creation of a  "pervasively contentious" atmosphere between him and the press.  There was the view that Mr. Ozawa himself will probably come to  the point where he himself will not be able to tolerate the  exclusive use of the formal press conference, but Mr. Ozawa has  clearly denied that view, saying, " I will not take any action  to revive the informal press conference."    Ozawa's office has stated that it will respond to requests  for news-gathering appointments other than formal press  conferences on a case-by-case basis. As an example, the office  has said that it is prepared to respond to requests which make  the purpose clear in such terms as "We wish to conduct an  interview on international contributions," or "We have heard of  a certain scandal and we would like to confirm the facts." It is  a case where the office will not respond to requests for  late-evening or early-morning news-gathering sessions where the  purpose is unclear, but will respond, to the extent feasible, to  any requests for U.S.-style news-gathering sessions based on  appointments.  <H5>  Unusual Scenes Enacted During Informal Press Conference Days </H5>   Political news-gathering can be subdivided into four major  categories: formal press conferences, walk-along  question-and-answer sessions, informal press conferences, and  exclusive news-gathering sessions. All reporters aim for  exclusive reporting which uncovers special tidbits, but in the  case of influential leaders, time restrictions and  news-gathering onslaughts often require informal press  conferences where the leader is confronted by questions, and  replies are recorded by several reporters. There is this  news-gathering technique where reporters hold walk-along  question-and-answer sessions as they walk next to the  influential leader. Even if in-depth questioning is impossible,  simple "Yes" and "No" responses provide the basis for valuable  information sought by the reporter.    In the past, numerous reporters once covered Mr. Ozawa in  this manner, but now even if reporters ask a question of him, he  responds, "If I were to reply now, it would not have the value  of a statement made at a press conference." Such brusque  treatment has led to the situation where reporters tend to shy  away from him.    Late-night or early-morning news-gathering sessions in which  politicians are periodically visited at their homes is a  technique peculiar to Japan. There are some politicians who  loathe that approach and some who will speak frankly only in  their home environment. Previously, Mr. Ozawa responded to  early-morning news-gathering sessions at his home in Fukazawa.    Special criticism has been addressed to the abuses of  informal press conferences. The contents of such conferences  have normally been treated on an off-the-record basis and are  quoted with such anonymous references as "sources," "senior  officials," "leader" and "official." Politicians dislike making  commitments and tend to use ambiguous statements in reference to  sensitive issues at formal press conferences and make frank  statements at informal press conferences where direct  attribution is not made in subsequently published articles.  Chief cabinet secretaries over the years have held informal  press conferences after formal sessions, leading to the  possibility of strange articles which refer to statements made  by the same chief cabinet secretary as if they came from two  different individuals, such as, "The chief cabinet secretary  made a statement during the press conference which revealed  ".....," which was later interpreted by a government official as  "...."    On the other hand, there have been times when statements  made  during an informal press conference become an issue and the  question is posed at a formal press conference held by a senior  government official asking, "Was the statement made this morning  by a government source true?" In reality, the senior government  official and government source are the same individual and  frequently that same individual acts out an unusual role, saying  "That statement by the government source was in error."    Informal press conferences are attended by reporters  assigned  to cover a specific individual and basically tend to cause the  concerned politician to be relaxed and prone to speak frankly,  significantly more so than when conducting a formal press  conference attended by an unspecified large number of reporters.  Moreover, because informal press conferences are composed of  reporters belonging to an inner circle, there is little chance  that off-the-record pledges will be violated, and if a pledge is  broken and an article of attribution is published, an off-limit  order is issued and the reporter loses temporary access to the  politician. Even in those cases where politicians do not detect  violations of the off-the-record rule, fellow reporters  occasionally "inform" the politician of such violations. The  practice is such that it can be called a mutual reporters'  "surveillance system" and a system which enables politicians to  cause reporters to write only those articles which are  advantageous to the former.    Nevertheless, the content of informal press conferences is  often published in weekly magazines. In July, a segment of an  informal press conference was published in a weekly magazine,  which sharply angered Mr. Ozawa and became one reason for  discontinuing informal press conferences. It is also true that  Mr. Ozawa took measures such as off-limit actions in the past  and that for reporters, he was a very difficult politician to  cover for news-gathering purposes.    Former LDP Vice President Kanemaru made maximum use of  informal press conferences as a way of manipulating the  political situation and flow of information on policy decisions  without clarifying the source of the information. If such  information was released anonymously, he would be able to escape  any responsibility. Put another way, he released information  anonymously, because he did not wish to shoulder responsibility.  Further, politicians deliberately make statements at informal  press conferences knowing that they will be conveyed to rival  politicians. In effect, that comprises a situation in which  reporters play the role of intelligence brokers. Even though  reporters sensed the risks inherent in the informal press  conference format, it was impossible for them to totally  disregard the words of influential leaders, and they had no  choice but to recognize that informal press conferences were a  rich source of information on the frank sentiments of  politicians.    The high appraisal given to Mr. Ozawa's discontinuance of  informal press conferences represents one side of the coin, the  reverse of which reflects criticism of information released at  irresponsible "backstage" sessions. The strong view persists  that formal press conferences cover news in principle and that  informal press conferences and exclusive news-gathering sessions  reveal the true sentiments, and such views have led to the  situation in which the formal press conference format for  political reporting has been compromised. Politicians who do not  manifest differences in what they say between formal press  conferences and informal press conferences are referred to as  "uninteresting politicians," "politicians who lack strategy,"  and "politicians in name only" and typical among them is Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata who is compared with Mr. Ozawa in this  respect. House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi of the  SDPJ, currently in the process of seceding from the party, is  regarded as an uninteresting politician despite her popularity  with the general public.    Again, the reason is that she is a politician lacking in  inside stories. Politicians such as LDP lower house member  Junichiro Koizumi state, "I have nothing to say off-the-record,"  even when you meet him personally and repeatedly makes bold  statements, but Mr. Koizumi is a very exceptional politician.    In summary, placing more significance on "unofficial" than  "official" utterances in the political world can be seen in  relationships between politicians and the mass media,  diminishing the significance of statements made by politicians  in the public arena. We must admit that the mass media added  credence to such an atmosphere. Appreciation for the Ozawa  format rests on the hope that it will accelerate restoration of  credence to the "official" version in politics.  <H3>  Why Were Reporters Unable To Uncover Personnel Decisions  Made Behind Closed Doors? </H3>   However, there has been criticism of the Ozawa format. I  believe the political reporters' foremost function is to report  on the actual process leading to policy and personnel decisions  influencing national government affairs. In other words, I am  speaking of reporting on the so-called actions and thought  processes of politicians and bureaucrats. That is, "Who met  whom, where, and what was said."    This issue concerning news-gathering is currently being  widely debated in the form of criticism over political  reporting, but it nonetheless pertains to work which is of  foremost importance to a political reporter. These particular  points do not become obvious in the process of conducting formal  press conferences. Such reporters must function as vigilant  "observers" closely associated with politicians. We are not  speaking of writing articles to curry the favor of politicians  for the purpose of seeking information or "adhesion" emanating  from avoidance of articles which cover relations between various  personalities. We are speaking of a situation which has no  connection with criticism of ties between political reporters  and politicians which is being widely covered at the present  time.    After the House of Representatives election of 18 July, Mr.  Ozawa disappeared from the public arena as soon as he declared  the discontinuation of late-night and early-morning  news-gathering sessions. Everyone had expected that Tsutomu Hata  would be the candidate for prime minister, but then the prime  minister candidate was shifted to Japan New party President  Morihiro Hosokawa, which was obviously a personnel action taken  by Ozawa. Reportedly, this personnel decision was made at an  undesignated place in Tokyo on 22 July in a discussion between  Ozawa and Hosokawa.    It was very difficult for political reporters to uncover the  complete details on this closed-door personnel decision. Because  of Hosokawa's popularity, public criticism did not arise during  the decisionmaking process of this designation, but it was  considerably more difficult to discern in comparison to previous  LDP presidential elections and I believe it would not be  unreasonable to hear criticisms which label the actions as  closed-door politics.    Prime Minister Hosokawa was designated as such on 6 August  and he initiated work on organizing a cabinet, but in the  process of news coverage concerning appointments to the cabinet,  appointees which were not revealed to the very end were those  from Shinseito. Appointment of Mr. Fujii as minister of finance  was one that most of the mass media was unable to anticipate.    Why was that the case? The answer lies in the fact that Mr.  Ozawa would not release information to his close associates and  the inability to track Mr. Ozawa's actions. Needless to say,  such information would not necessarily have been available  through informal press conferences or late-night and  early-morning news-gathering sessions, and Mr. Ozawa himself  said, "I cannot under any circumstances discuss personnel  matters with any one."    However, it is indispensable for the mass media to maintain  surveillance over politicians no matter how much the latter may  dislike the practice, and it is only logical for the mass media  to criticize the approach in which that function is abandoned  from the outset in sole compliance with the wishes of Mr. Ozawa.  Even if as a minimum commentators and scholars may comment on  the Hosokawa government, the current approach precludes the  fulfillment of the political reporters' role to report on the  authoritarian drama involving the shift from Hata to Hosokawa.    A midlevel Diet member of the LDP's Obuchi faction provides  a  very level-headed appraisal of the Ozawa format, saying, "Having  freed himself from coverage by closely associated reporters, I  imagine he finds it easy to engage in behind-the-scenes  politics. The only purpose of the formal press conference is to  cover the official version of news."    Mr. Ozawa has said, "Political articles should deemphasize  factional or personality disputes and provide more complete  coverage of policies. Reporters should avoid late-night and  early-morning news-gathering sessions and devote more time to  research." However, although this is a very appropriate  statement addressing press coverage which places excessive  coverage of political situations, it is alsao extremely  self-serving.    The prime minister is truly the foremost politician who must  make available information on his actions for reporting by prime  ministerial reporters who stalk him day and night. Needless to  say, if the prime minister wishes to make confidential  movements, there are a number of ways he can accomplish that,  but the mass media has established a system called prime  ministerial reporting to keep the public informed of his  movements.    Setting aside discussions on whether it is functioning  properly, the system pertains to the resourcefulness of the mass  media. It is inadvisable to create a myth about Ozawa, but I  believe Mr. Ozawa compares with the prime minister based on the  interest exercised in him in political circles. Even many  aspects of former influential leaders like Yoshida, Hatoyama,  and Kishi were invisible and the public tolerated that fact, but  in this information age, we must refrain from tolerating  politicians of that type and Ozawa should not be treated as an  exception.  <H3>  How Will Reporters Assigned To Cover the Political Situation  Perform News-Gathering Tasks? </H3>   As indicated in the preceding text, reactions to the Ozawa  format are complex. It may be that the upheaval in the political  world has imposed a situation where the political mass media  stands at a crossroads. No reporters believe that their job is  complete once they finish a formal press conference with Ozawa.  Although it is a task of utmost difficulty, they use a variety  of techniques to approach and gather information on Mr. Ozawa.  In that respect, the very fact that late-night and early-morning  news-gathering sessions and informal news conferences are no  longer held has caused reporters to intensify their  news-gathering efforts.    However, a positive appraisal of Mr. Ozawa's format might  generate the expectation that it will inspire a movement for  restoring political "statements" to matters of genuine political  concern. LDP House of Representative member Koichi Kato  comments, "Even for politicians, formal press conferences  without informal follow-on press conferences would be a big  relief. However, we will have to be articulate during the formal  press conferences and that will require us to be well-versed in  potential topics of discussion. I believe the future will demand  that type of politician."    Leadership exercised by the LDP in the past was embodied in  "political power" or in other words "rights and interests." The  LDP was not a political party that emphasized ideology like the  SDPJ or Communist Party. LDP Diet members were required to  coordinate matters concerning rights and interests, rather than  matters concerning theory, and politicians who spoke of theories  were shunned.    Now that the LDP has lost political power, it must take the  initiative in stating its goals and concepts. It can no longer  survive under past concepts where it devoted itself to  coordination of rights and interests, now that it is no longer  in control of the government. Now that all aspects such as  diplomacy, defense, agriculture, and economic policies must be  reviewed, politicians must express their views publicly to  provide a sense of direction to the general public. They must  also use logic to rebut any criticism. This trend will probably  be accelerated by the existence of television which tends to  influence political reporting. At any rate, television reporting  is very realistic in terms of the audio and visual display  transmitted to the public.    Further, Mr. Ozawa's assertion that we should discontinue  diet interpellations handled by bureaucrats and convert to  interpellations in which ministers and parliamentary vice  ministers play a central role should be considered in the  context of the preceding statement.    I believe the Ozawa format has become controversial because  it was launched by Mr. Ozawa who is a powerful politician who  previously played a central role in connection with Takeshita  and Kanemaru politics. If the format had been launched by some  other politician, the mass media would not have given it much  attention. I believe the reason why Mr. Ozawa assumed the format  was that he felt that the political turmoil required  increasingly difficult behind-the-scenes coordination, that he  would have no time to cope with the mass media and he wished to  "avoid" the situation where he would be pursued by the press.  When it comes to people like Mr. Ozawa, reporters will gather at  their press conferences and television will organize special  programs.    I believe he embraced a realistic attitude that he should  express himself freely whenever such an occasion presented  itself.    However, aside from Mr. Ozawa's motivations in launching the  format, it is a fact that it presented the political mass media  with the question of just what is political reporting and  political news-gathering?</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures had a volatile session with the day dominated by the negative CBI distributive trades survey for December and talk of a big rights issue in the equity market, writes Joel Kibazo. Sellers were seen at the start of trading in the March contract on the FT-SE which opened at 2,767 and within an hour of the opening the contract had fallen to 2,755, as economic worries following the CBI report dominated the market. The falls in the future led the underlying equity market lower. Bargain hunting led to a recovery in both markets, and March reached the day's high of 2,775 shortly after 11pm and remained at the higher levels though on thin trading for the next few hours. The tentative early performance on Wall Street led to another retreat in the contract to 2,743 once again draging the cash market with it. March closed at 2,745, down 24 on the previous close and around its fair value premium to cash of about 8. turnover remained low at 7,671. Turnover in the traded options improved on Monday's level reaching 26,797 lots. The FT-SE 100 option traded 12,882 contracts, and the Euro FT-SE 1,113 lots. Business among the stock options was poor with British Airways, the most actively dealt stock option trading a mere 965 contracts. This was followed by ICI at 842 lots and by Ladbrokes at 806.</p>

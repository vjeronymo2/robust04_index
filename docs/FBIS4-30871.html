			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 31 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia will this  week submit a request to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  once again to extend the deadline for the regulation of  Yugoslavia's status with the IMF until mid-December, Zarko  Trbojevic, chief advisor to the governor of the National Bank of  Yugoslavia, told TANJUG on Tuesday [31 May]. The deadline was  extended last December until June 14, 1994. Trbojevic said that  an IMF Board of Directors decision of December 14, 1992, said  that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to  exist and is thus no longer an IMF member. He said this was the  first such decision of the board ever to occur since the  founding of the IMF.    Under the IMF decision, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's  share in the succession of the former Yugoslavia's assets and  liabilities with the fund amounts to 36.52 per cent. All former  Yugoslavia's successors were given one month (expiring on  January 14, 1993) officially to agree or disagree with their  respective shares in former Yugoslavia's assets and liabilities  in the IMF.    Yugoslavia notified the IMF that it accepts its share,  bearing in mind that this amount could not be permanent because  the share of each IMF member-country should reflect its real  economic power. The IMF said that Yugoslavia's status would be  regulated if Yugoslavia settled its share of outstanding debts,  passed a law on accepting obligations ensuing from the IMF  Constitution, and if the IMF gave a positive assessment of  Yugoslavia's liability to fullfil its obligations under the U.N.  sanctions. All things considered, Yugoslavia has urged the IMF  Board of Directors to extend the deadline for meeting these  conditions, which the IMF did both in June and December 1993.    The Yugoslav Government has said that its top priority task  is to maintain and reactivate its cooperation with the IMF and  the World Bank.</p>

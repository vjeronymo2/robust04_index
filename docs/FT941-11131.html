			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax liability on dividends I am very unclear on the tax liability on dividends paid gross by offshore companies to UK residents. Are these taxed at 20 per cent as UK companies, or at 25 per cent? Also, for a higher-rate taxpayer, is the additional tax due on a UK company dividend (on which there has been a tax credit of 20 per cent) an additional 15 or 20 per cent of the grossed-up figure? Taking your questions in reverse order. The additional charge for a higher-rate taxpayer is at 20 per cent: ie. 40 per cent minus the 20 per cent tax credit. Foreign dividends are taxable at 20 per cent (subject to any credit due in respect of tax charged in the country of origin) in the hands of basic-rate taxpayers, except for those taxpayers who are assessable on the remittance basis (Irish dividends being excluded from this exception). As with UK dividends, higher-rate taxpayers are chargeable at 40 per cent. Section 77(2) of the Fianance Act 1993 says: 'The section 207A inserted in the Taxes Act 1988 by sub-section 1 above shall apply, as it applies to income chargeable under Schedule F, to any income which: (a) is chargeable under Case V of Schedule D; (b) is such that, being a dividend or other distribution of a company not resident in the United Kingdom, it would be chargeable under Schedule F if the company were so resident; and (c) is not such that the tax is chargeable by virtue of section 65(5)(b) of that act on the full amount of the actual sums received in the United Kingdom.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

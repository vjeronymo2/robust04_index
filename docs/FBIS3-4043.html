Premier Li Peng's presence was welcomed by all the deputies.  The Premier cordially shook hands with them. Ruan Chongwu,  head of the deletion, told Premier Li Peng of Hainan's primary  work in 1993 and the conditions of Hainan's national economic  development. [passage omitted]    After earnestly listening to the deputies' speeches, Premier  Li Peng said that the Hainan Special Economic Zone has its own  characteristics. Its development should not follow Shenzhen's  pattern -- characterized by comprehensive development, but  should focus on certain areas to make breakthroughs in. Hainan  currently has some difficulties due to its weak economic  foundation, but it has the advantages of rich resources and  favorable policies. These benefits must be given full play to  accelerate the building of Haikou, Yangpu, and Sanya and propel  the whole province to make progress. [passage omitted]</p>

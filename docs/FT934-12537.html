			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: BMW ahead of industry trends BMW is continuing to resist the worst effects of recession, the luxury German carmaker claimed yesterday. Although sales fell 9.8 per cent to 406,500 units in the first nine months of this year, deliveries were still higher than for the same period of 1990, the last 'normal' year before German unification, it said. Production, at 396,700 cars, was down 12 per cent compared with 25 per cent for the German automotive industry as a whole. BMW exports were only 7 per cent lower, compared with an overall drop of more than 20 per cent. Turnover also fell a relatively modest 6.6 per cent to DM21.9bn (Dollars 13.1bn). The company had been able to 'build a bridge over the cyclical dip', it said. In the domestic market, a 22 per cent rise in sales in eastern Germany, to 15,100, helped offset a 17 per cent decline in the west, where new registrations overall are down 19 per cent. BMW attributed much of its relative success to growth in north America and south-east Asia, where deliveries rose 17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively. With an eye on further high-potential markets, the company is preparing to open assembly plants in the Philippines and Vietnam. Yesterday's figures suggest a marginal improvement from the halfway mark, when turnover was 8.8 per cent lower than in 1992, and when the company reported net earnings down 39 per cent at DM255m. Although the international market appeared to have reached the bottom of the slump, recovery is not expected to appear before the middle of 1994.</p>

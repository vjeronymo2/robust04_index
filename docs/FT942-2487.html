			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Arts: Celebration at the fairs - Business is booming at both Grosvenor House and Olympia this year No one is more surprised than the dealers. From Grosvenor House and Olympia to the specialist Ceramics Fair at the Park Lane Hotel, the London art market is humming. Last year, visitors to the Grosvenor House Art and Antiques Fair idly inspected the odd item. But as the doors opened this year, and those at the head of the queue purposefully strode in, it was clear that business was about to be done. It was clear, too, that the dealers were there to move their stock. Most seem to have decided that they can no longer afford to use Grosvenor House simply as a showcase. Gone are the Pounds 1m pictures, the Pounds 6m sculpture, bravura displays of suites of powder blue and gilt Austrian furniture. Truly exceptional works of art were relatively few, although Angela von Wallwitz was rewarded by showing her spectacular Meissen wine ewer in the form of a fantastical roaring beast. Modelled by JG Kirchner for Augustus the Strong's Japanese Palace in Dresden around 1728 and over half a metre high, this found a new home in the first two hours of the private preview. Most stands appealed to the middle of the market and recorded a high turnover of less expensive items. Good 'brown' English furniture was, as ever, the mainstay of the fair; Apter-Fredericks, for instance, sold half his stand on preview day. The demand for jewels and precious objets d'art appeared no less enthusiastic. By noon on the first day, New York-based A La Vieille Russie had achieved sales exceeding the total of their business at the 1993 fair and by the first weekend, silver dealers JH Bourdon-Smith had sold 30 exhibits. Much to the dismay of the Jeremiahs, the long-overdue abolition of dateline restrictions this year did not alter the character of the fair. Instead it treated us to Yves Mikaeloff's appropriately surreal display of the petal-backed ebony armchairs that Sue and Marie created for a famous Paris perfumery in 1923, and the traditional likes of the Phillip de Laszlo portrait at the Christopher Wood Gallery. The most unexpected sight was the bare buttocks and suspenders of an Allen Jones tucked in among the old and modern masters at The Dover Street Gallery. Far more dramatic was the transformation for the better of the appearance and quality of experience at the fair. George Carter's elegant, understated and unifying design gave the stands a more substantial feel (no more flimsy partitions) and substantially higher ceilings. Even the air conditioning seemed more efficient. The Grosvenor House Fair, which closes this Saturday at 6pm, could not have hoped for a better Diamond Jubilee. Over at Olympia, the Fine Art &amp; Antiques Fair could celebrate its 21st year too. Long considered the poor relation of Grosvenor House, it has gone from strength to strength, attracting ever more serious exhibits and visitors as well as finding room for more off-beat collectables. Here, too, furniture and silver enjoyed an exceptional year - some even record sales. Silver dealers Marks Antiques, for example, sold a pair of Paul Storr wine coolers for around Pounds 40,000, and two rare James I goblets for the same sum. The fair drew a record 37,549 visitors - and purchases out of the Metropolitan and Berlin Museums. A similar tale was told at the International Ceramics Fair which got off to a rip-roaring start on June 10. What was noticeable here, unlike Grosvenor House, was that all the really good things seem to have sold, mostly on the first day. English exhibits were far more interesting this year and the quality of the French porcelain as good as ever. Crucially, prices were more competitive too. It was the liveliest fixture in years. Anyone doubting that it is still possible to find exceptional and relatively inexpensive works of art on the market should make a pilgrimage to Agnew's current show, Arte Sacra Antica (43 Old Bond Street, W1, until July 22). In pride of place among this small but choice group of 14th and 15th century panel paintings, illuminated manuscripts and maiolica hangs a 'lost' crucifixion by Gentile da Fabriano, the leading Gothic painter in Italy. The panel, its gold ground overpainted, had been sold at Phillips in 1991, catalogued as workshop of Ugolino di Nerio, for Pounds 68,000. The Crucifixion has been identified as the crowning panel of Gentile's partially re-assembled 'Valle Romita' altarpiece of 1410-12 in the Brera Gallery, Milan, where it was on display last year. Despairing of a sale, or perhaps to force the Italians' hand, the painting is on offer in London at Pounds 2.5m.</p>

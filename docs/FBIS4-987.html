			<p>BFN     [Text] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN  secretary general in Mozambique, says he was not aware that $17  million had been earmarked for the Trust Fund [preceding two  words in English] for political parties, including the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], as was reported in  today's NOTICIAS. The newspaper was citing a source from the  United Nations in New York.    The top UN official in Mozambique said he doubts whether the  source can make available $17 million, when [words indistinct]  requires such assistance. Ajello said the UN Operations in  Mozambique [Unomoz] had a draft document drawn up in New York,  which has taken into account Unomoz's recommendations in Maputo.  Ajello said this document cannot fix the value of the Trust Fund  because it is established on the basis of voluntary  contributions from donor countries.    Aldo Ajello said on the basis of information collected by  Unomoz, a minimum amount of $2.8 million has been established  for the Trust Fund.    The UN representative in Maputo also spoke about the return  of the Italian contingent. He said that these troops were  expected to return by the end of this month.    [Begin Ajello recording, in English fading into Portuguese  translation] We expect that this operation will be completed by  the end of this month. Regarding the Beira Corridor's security,  we are deploying other available forces along the corridor and a  new plan has almost been concluded. The withdrawal of the  Italian contingent was announced a long time ago, and,  unfortunately, it cannot be renegotiated because there is no  government in Italy. Thus, the battalion has begun its  withdrawal in phases. Ajello said a plan has already been drawn  up to face the situation, because the UN Security Council had  already requested that the UN reduce its forces in Mozambique.  So, it is not the only contingent that will leave Mozambique.  Other forces to be withdrawn from Mozambique will be announced  in due time. The reduction of military contingents will not,  however, affect Unomoz's operational capacity. Some forces will  be reduced, but the country will not receive new UN battalions  [words indistinct]. [end recording]    Regarding the confinement and demobilization of government  and Renamo forces, Ajello said the numbers are encouraging. On  the government side, only 55 percent of troops have been  confined, while Renamo has already confined 80 percent of its  troops. The government has, however, promised to confine 100  percent of its troops by next week. Regarding the  demobilization process, the opposite is true. The government is  demobilizing a greater percentage of troops than Renamo.</p>

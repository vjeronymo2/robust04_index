			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV WITH AN ATTITUDE;  </P> <P> THE LANGUAGE AND RHYTHMS OF TODAY'S BLACK YOUTH CULTURE ARE READY FOR PRIME  TIME, BUT WHAT MESSAGE IS BEING SENT?  </P> <P> T.V.J.!!!!!! GIMME THAT BEAT!  </P> <P>  The Homeboy Shopping Network is chillin' on the box. Wiz and the Iceman, the  hustling homeboy hosts, are on the mike, bragging to viewers about the great  bargains they're selling from a truck loaded with stolen goods.  </P> <P> "We got car phones, we got car stereos, we got car alarms," the Iceman boasts.  </P> <P> Adds Wiz: "Yeah, and if you act now, we can probably get the car."  </P> <P>  B-B-BUST THAT F-FU-FU-F-F-FUNNY MOVE!!!!  </P> <P>  The Fresh Prince is in the kitchen of a Bel-Air mansion, teaching his young,  upper-crust cousin how to put more spunk in her funk, more glide in her stride.  </P> <P> "Less like George Michael, more like (M.C.) Hammer," instructs the Prince,  demonstrating with a twisting thrust. "Look, baby, you've got to put more butt  into it."  </P> <P> NOW PUMP IT UP!  </P> <P> Thirteen-year-old Lester is dissin' his black father and white stepmother on  their plans to eat "Ray," a turkey he has befriended in their Baltimore home,  for dinner. "Y'all wanna snuff my main man?" he moans. "That's a zip down on  the flip side."  </P> <P>  CAN'T TOUCH THIS! BUT YOU CAN LAUGH AT IT!  </P> <P> To some observers of the new television season, the infamous philosophy of  revered soul poet Gil Scott-Heron may appear to be coming true: The revolution  is being televised. And it's something of a laughing matter.  </P> <P> The language and rhythms of young inner-city life are moving from the boom  boxes of teen-age cruisers into the square boxes of America's living rooms.  Sparked mostly by the growing crossover popularity of rap, the staying power of  NBC's youth-oriented "A Different World" and the popularity of Arsenio Hall's  syndicated talk show, television comedy is increasingly becoming more black --  and white -- and rap all over:  </P> <P> * Fox's "In Living Color," the first network comedy-variety show with an  African-American perspective, has earned critical acclaim and an Emmy Award.  </P> <P> * "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air," a comedy about a teen-age rapper transplanted  from the mean streets of Philadelphia to a Bel-Air mansion, was hailed during  the preseason by NBC program executive Brandon Tartikoff as the show that the  top-ranked network felt would secure its No. 1 status.  </P> <P> * "True Colors," a new comedy about an interracial family on Fox, features a  black teen who bewilders his white grandmother with rap lingo.  </P> <P> * Even the soft-edged "The Cosby Show" is featuring new teen characters that  network executives admit reflect a more street-wise attitude than the regular  Cosby family members.  </P> <P> Hip-hop has gone High Concept.  </P> <P> Most observers eyeing the new trend say network television is trying to hook  young audiences reared on MTV while offering adults a unique, fast-paced  cultural perspective. It's another way to try to stop viewership from further  erosion, they say.  </P> <P> Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment, said that his network and  others are tapping into what's current and happening. "We're always trying to  push ourselves and be relevant -- that's what television has to be," he said.  "I think all these shows are trying to pick up on this urban sensibility."  </P> <P> But the question has also been raised by media experts, sociologists and some  entertainment industry executives about whether viewers are actually getting a  raw deal with the raw comedy.  </P> <P> "Network television has taken something current and hot, and is trying to wring  all the value out of it," said Sherrie Mazingo, a USC journalism professor  specializing in social aspects of the mass media. "But they haven't put enough  thought and substance into it. It's just one-line premises."  </P> <P> She and other critics contend that television, because of its commercial  nature, is just skimming the surface of the young and vibrant African-American  culture, and has largely watered down or diluted the dynamics of the material  it hoped to celebrate.  </P> <P> "It's always a step forward when television goes beyond Jack Benny's Rochester  or Stepin Fetchit, but it's difficult for television to reproduce an accurate  sensibility," said Gerald Horne, chairman of the black studies department at UC  Santa Barbara. "Perhaps the writers of these shows have problems getting  certain perspectives past the standards and practices committee. Perhaps that  accounts for the inability to accurately capture that sensibility."  </P> <P> Some watching the urban-tinged shows say they are pleased to see African  Americans depicted in a more realistic and favorable light than they were in  such 1970s and 1980s shows as "What's Happening," "That's My Mama," "Sanford  and Son" and "The Jeffersons" -- or even in current series such as ABC's  "Family Matters."  </P> <P> "In Living Color" is cited by several sociologists and academicians as the most  accurate and effective in reflecting the diverse attitudes and culture of  Africa-Americans. But they added that the improvement in the general images  presented is not enough, and could, in fact, be sending a dangerous message to  viewers.  </P> <P> "We still live in a segregated society, and the images on television don't  always represent a broad spectrum," Horne said. "Maybe it should. I know that  there was a certain environment that produced Rochester and 'Birth of a  Nation,' and that environment still exists. There could come a time when all we  have is distorted images or no images at all. It would be naive to rule that  out."  </P> <P> Charges of the perpetuation of negative racial and sexual stereotypes have been  leveled against "In Living Color." "Fresh Prince"' has been criticized for its  attempt to squeeze a rapper into a conventional "fish out of water" sitcom  format. "True Colors" has been knocked as not going far enough in dealing with  the obvious tensions of such an interracial union.  </P> <P> On the other hand, some TV viewers feel that some of the rap-tinged humor has  already gone too far. James Carrey, the only white male member of the "In  Living Color" troupe, said that he was once approached by a white fan who said  that he wished the show would "knock off the black (stuff)." Rosie Perez, who  choreographs the show's "Flygirls," said that a major record company executive  warned her when she was first hired that middle America would not cater to  hearing rap music during the frenetic dance routines.  </P> <P> Entertainment industry insiders and outsiders say the timing of the new trend  probably has more to do with economics than social awareness.  </P> <P> "The success of 'In Living Color' made it obvious to network executives that  blacks on television can make money," said Franklin Ajaye, a comedian and actor  who wrote for the show during its first season. "It also has a lot to do with  Madison Avenue. When they started putting rappers in ads, that sealed it."  </P> <P> Herman Gray, associate professor of sociology at Boston's Northeastern  University, pointed out that the networks were establishing the shows "at a  time when there is a decline in viewership. They need a new market. And the  clothing and music of young urban African-Americans has a proven crossover  appeal to suburban white kids, so there is definitely a move by the networks to  get a new audience."  </P> <P> "Fresh Prince" creators Andy and Susan Borowitz said that the new hip-hop trend  was also a response by network executives to the deteriorating popularity of  the standard family-oriented comedy that reached its peak in the 1980s.  </P> <P> "It was a white, middle-class kind of comedy, but it's losing share points,"  Susan Borowitz said. "If it wasn't skewed for older audiences, it was being  written by older people for younger audiences, and that doesn't work."  </P> <P> NBC programming chief Littlefield had said in a previous interview that the  network had been inspired to produce a rap-oriented show by cover stories about  rap in Newsweek and Time magazines, and by "Yo! MTV Raps." "I was . . . feeling  waves of something new and contemporary running through various streams of  culture in America. We felt there was a drum beat going on out there, and we  looked at our development (schedule) and said, 'It's not represented,' " he  recounted.  </P> <P> Many rappers appear to be happy with the dawning of the hip-hop TV age. Popular  rap artists hang out at tapings of "In Living Color" and "Fresh Prince." They  beg to have their records played during "In Living Color's" dance segments. The  tapings have a party-like atmosphere. Audience members rap in their seats and  dance in the aisles.  </P> <P> One person who is not surprised by the emergence of "hip-hop" comedy, and the  breakthrough success of "In Living Color" in particular, is Keenen Ivory  Wayans, the show's creator, executive producer, co-writer and co-star. He  believes that even though his program has a black perspective, the appeal cuts  across several age and ethnic groups.  </P> <P> Following its debut on Easter Sunday last April, "In Living Color," which airs  Sundays at 8 p.m. on Fox, earned mostly high praise -- and an Emmy Award for  best comedy/variety series -- for its pointed, irreverent sketches. The show  has also been praised for its biting, sometimes brutal parodies of celebrities  such as Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson and Ted Turner.  </P> <P> "I knew it would catch on," Wayans said. "I always had a good feeling about it.  It was different, but I knew people would watch it if it was funny. It has the  same appeal as hip-hop or rap. It's hip-hop TV, but it's something that reaches  the masses."  </P> <P> Exactly what message the masses are getting, however, is the subject of an  escalating debate.  </P> <P> NBC's "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air" is the most-hyped and most controversial --  attempt by network television to get into the groove. It premiered with what  many felt were admirable credentials. Music producer and composer Quincy Jones  is a co-executive producer. Noted African-American playwright and actor  Samm-Art Williams is a producer and writer. Actress and choreographer Debbie  Allen directed the pilot and other episodes.  </P> <P> The show revolves around Will, an inner-city teen from Philadelphia (played by  real-life rap star Will Smith of D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince) who  moves in with his stuffy, wealthy relatives in Bel-Air to escape from getting  into trouble with the homeboys back home.  </P> <P> Will's street smarts frequently clash with the country-club values of his  family, who, for the most part, seem to have lost touch with their cultural  roots. The family and butler are mystified, bewildered and, at times, horrified  by Will's antics and lingo.  </P> <P> One of the main targets of Will's barbed wit is his pompous, Ivy League  college-bound cousin Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro), whose main enjoyment in life  appears to be a good game of golf:  </P> <P> Carlton (offering the Prince a snack): What do you say to an Oreo?  </P> <P> Will: I say, 'Whassup, Carlton?'  </P> <P> Will's new environment and his enrollment at the fictional Bel Air Academy also  puts him into conflict with his old street-wise friends. During a recent  episode, Jeff (Jeff Townes, a.k.a. D.J. Jazzy Jeff) interrupted Will, who was  working on a poem for the poetry club:  </P> <P> Jeff: Man, I got this new Ice Cube tape. It's dope.  </P> <P> Will: I ain't got time for that. I've got to finish this poem.  </P> <P> Jeff: Poem? Then what you gonna do? Bake some cookies? Hem a dress?  </P> <P> What sold NBC on the show, Littlefield said, was Smith. "When I was looking at  a tape of the Fresh Prince and his music video, there was just something  electrical that was jumping out," he said. "It was his personality, it was his  attitude. It was a hip character attitude of the kind that had not been on  network television.  </P> <P> "We thought, 'How do we package that sensibility? The sensibility was so wildly  entertaining.' We thought to put it in a world that didn't understand it." He  noted that the program was not so much a showcase for rap as it was a showcase  for Smith.  </P> <P> But "The Fresh Prince" has not been the critical or ratings hit that NBC  executives had predicted. Critics of the show have included some in the cast  and crew of "In Living Color," who felt Smith was appealing, but that the  concept had more gloss than substance.  </P> <P> They are not the only ones blasting the show.  </P> <P> Other media watchers have attacked the Fresh Prince character as a barely  disguised version of the "J.J." character on the 1970s "Good Times" television  show. J.J. (Jimmie Walker) was the focus of heavy criticism by blacks, who  described the depiction of his cartoonish demeanor and mock bravado as  insulting and unrealistic, especially in a show about a struggling family  living in a housing project.  </P> <P> Sociologist Gray, who is working on a book dealing with African Americans in  commercial television, said that "Fresh Prince" reflects an unfortunate dulling  of the rap culture.  </P> <P> "It really does tame much of the very rap sensibility it wants to celebrate,"  Gray said. "I think they lost courage. This was a grand opportunity to take rap  seriously, to see what the internal sensibility was. But once a concept like  that gets into the machinery of television, it just gets too hard to combine  the two elements."  </P> <P> USC's Mazingo said of "Fresh Prince": "It's dumb. It's stupid. It's insulting  and demeaning, idiotic and flimsy." She said that it represents "the  perpetuation of the classic stereotype throughout literature and popular  culture of the black as buffoon, as the comedic clown."  </P> <P> Mazingo, a former NBC News editor and producer, considers the show's premise to  be its main problem. "The premise is unbelievable," she said. "It says you can  take a kid of the ghetto, plunk him in Bel Air, and the values will fit  together comfortably. That is not real."  </P> <P> Littlefield disagreed with the critics who charged that the show had watered  down rap. "We're really presenting this character in all forms of his life --  in his school life, in his social life," he said. "I don't think we've  compromised there.  </P> <P> "The show is in its early stages, and is still evolving. But the essence is  that this family can learn something from him, and he from them. That tension  makes it entertaining. He's not all right, and they're not all wrong."  </P> <P> The Borowitzs insist that they are hearing nothing but praise from viewers  about the show's point of view and realism.  </P> <P> "Those people who are unhappy with what we're doing? They're not writing us,"  Susan Borowitz said. "But we have received lots of letters from viewers for  addressing intercultural class awareness. We've also received letters praising  us for having Will being interested in education."  </P> <P> Andy Borowitz added, "Teen-agers can smell a fake faster than anyone, and this  has become the hottest show in America with teen-agers. That's a key to how  we're doing."  </P> <P> Besides, presenting a gritty picture of an inner-city youth is not the object  of "Fresh Prince," the couple said.  </P> <P> "This show will not be just one thing," Susan Borowitz said. "There will be  moments where we will address racial issues. Then there will be other weeks  when we just have a great time."  </P> <P> Andy Borowitz added, "This show will do more if there is a broad-based appeal.  You can't be angry all the time. Otherwise, 'The Life and Times of Sylvia  Plath' would be the No. 1 show."  </P> <P> Another new show with a hip-hop element, Fox's "True Colors," has drawn  basically a "thumbs down" from critics and media observers, despite its  breakthrough premise as television's first comedy series about an interracial  family.  </P> <P> In the show, Ron Freeman, a widowed black dentist (Frankie R. Faison) with two  teen-age sons, confronts life in Baltimore with Ellen Davis (Stephanie Faracy),  a divorced white kindergarten teacher, her teen-age daughter and her grouchy  mother, Sara (Nancy Walker), who doesn't care for her new son-in-law.  </P> <P> The Davis character summarized the family's problems in the pilot episode:  </P> <P> Ellen: We've got two different families, three generations and two races, not  to mention a woman who hasn't smiled since the Dodgers left Brooklyn. One day  we just said to these people, "Surprise, you're a family." . . . It's a wonder  the house is still standing.  </P> <P> Much of the humor on the show, which airs Sundays at 7 p.m., comes from the  interaction between Lester, the hip-talking youngest son (Adam Jeffries), and  Sara:  </P> <P> Lester: Yo, Grandma. Check this out. Yesterday, I was shootin' some hoop over  in the project, right? And this dude come up to me and say, 'My main man, let's  do for some change,' y'understand? So I say, 'Homes, let's go.' So we're  mixin', right? And WHAM! BAM! Man walks home with his jive and I walk home with  his five. Can ya dig that?"  </P> <P> Sara: That's very nice. (Turns to Ron.) What the hell did he say?  </P> <P> The show is languishing near the bottom of the ratings. Michael J. Weithorn,  the creator of "True Colors" and a former producer of "Family Ties," said that  the new awareness of hip-hop culture had changed expectations of what his show  should be, and, ironically, has hurt it.  </P> <P> "In the past few years, America has become more comfortable with a more honest,  edgier presentation of black culture," he said. "Before, television executives  were concerned that blacks had to be unthreatening. Anything else was  unacceptable."  </P> <P> Weithorn said he had basically just wanted to make "True Colors" a comedy about  conflicts between personalities, not racial tension. But he said that he may  have made a mistake in making his new family too comfortable with each other  and their situation.  </P> <P> "Now I want to bring in more of a raw edge, but I don't want it to be  gratuitous," he said. "I don't want the viewer recoiling."  </P> <P> But it may already be too late. Mazingo said that many conservative viewers  would already be turned off by the program's premise, and that the rap element  would not bring in younger or more liberal viewers.  </P> <P> Although many inside and outside the industry are predicting imminent  cancellation of "True Colors," the verdict is still out on how effective "The  Cosby Show" -- often criticized by blacks as presenting what they feel is a  homogenized and sugar-coated view of African-American family life -- will be in  pumping up the volume.  </P> <P> "Cosby" a few weeks ago introduced Cousin Pam (Erika Alexander), a 17-year-old  inner-city youth who is a niece of Claire Huxtable (Phylicia Rashad).  </P> <P> Her first brush with the Huxtable lifestyle came when she tried to persuade  Cliff Huxtable (Cosby) to allow her to go visit her "homies . . . uh, friends"  in the Bronx at a late-night party. Cliff raised his eyebrows when Pam said  "homies."  </P> <P> Pam's friends attempted later in the program to get Pam to break curfew and go  to the party. But everyone wound up spending the evening with the Huxtables,  happily drinking cranberry juice.  </P> <P> The attempt to make "Cosby" a tad grittier was not lost on the writers of "The  Fresh Prince." A recent episode showed Will remarking on the development as he  scanned a TV Guide: "Ooooooooh!!! Bill Cosby has a street-wise niece coming on  the show. That should be decent!"  </P> <P> A one-hour episode scheduled to air last Thursday focused on Pam, her friends  and the community center where they hang out. "It's fresh territory we haven't  been in before," Littlefield said. "Pam has friends who are clearly more  street-oriented than the Cosby family is."  </P> <P> He maintained that the new urban emphasis was a natural one for "Cosby," and  was not inspired by criticisms.  </P> <P> "Every successful series, when it's in its senior years, develops and expands,"  Littlefield said. "It's just a natural place to do this now."  </P> <P> The depiction of young inner-city culture in future network television shows  will be largely determined by the success of the current programs, academicians  and media experts say. But some added that they do not foresee future efforts  being significantly more realistic.  </P> <P> "There will be more rap-oriented shows, but I think they will eventually  disappear," Mazingo said. "They are a fleeting phenomena. The way they are now,  they are not substantive enough to hold the attention of the target audience,  which is young black adults, or other segments of viewership. So the networks  will move to something else."  </P> <P> "It can go either way," Gray said. "But I think there's a movement towards  diversity, particularly in the state of California, where the television  industry is based. To the extent that climate gets stronger, television may put  forth more positive images."  </P> <P> The worst-case scenario, he said, would be if the shows continued to be  "watered down and normalized. But the culture will keep moving, it will always  keep moving. It is dynamic. And television will not be able to deal with that  until the medium is much more open."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Abidjan, June 17 (AFP) -- "Between 1,000 and 2,000  men" would be needed to try to halt the genocide in Rwanda under  a French proposal to lead a military intervention in the  country, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Friday [17  June] during a visit to Ivory Coast.    Earlier reliable UN sources had suggested similar figures.  Juppe did not indicate how many of these troops would be  provided by France.    Speaking in Abidjan, the minister said the operation would  only be carried out "under the flag and with the green light of  the United Nations." He described the effort as "humanitarian  operation with the protection of force."    He stressed that France would require the support of other  countries "in order that there is no ambiguity over France's  intentions."    US Secretary of State Warren Christopher had expressed his  country's support for France's initiative earlier the same day,  Juppe said, adding that it was one of many expressions of  support.    Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie had also given his  support, but the question of sending Ivorian troops was not  discussed.    The Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) has  declared itself opposed to the French initiative, but Juppe said  France would "try to convince it."    "Even if victorious on the ground, the Front will never be  able to govern alone," Juppe said.    In order to resolve the conflict quickly, there should be an  immediate ceasefire and reinforcements for UN trooops in Rwanda  should be sent "as quickly as possible", the minister said.    He described as a "pure invention" the "most serious  allegations" reported by the Brussels daily LE SOIR that French  soldiers were involved in the April 6 attack which killed the  heads of state of both Rwanda and its neighbour Burundi.    Juppe said he had also discussed the economic situation in  Ivory Coast with President Bedie and Prime Minister Daniel  Kablan Duncan.    He said he was pleased to see that there were encouraging  signs following the devaluation of the CFA franc last January.    "The battle isn't won but catastrophe has not taken place.  It is necessary to stay on course," the minister said.    Juppe was due to leave Abidjan early Saturday for Dakar, the  last stage on his brief African tour, his first since being  named head of French diplomacy in 1993.</p>

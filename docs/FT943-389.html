			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Frogmore shares up 25p as net assets rise 26% Frogmore Estates yesterday surprised the stock market with a 26 per cent rise in net assets for the year to June 30. Shares rose 25p to 444p in response to figures which also showed a 54 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 16.4m. The company spent Pounds 40m on acquisitions during the year, bringing total expenditure to Pounds 155m since March 1992. Much of this was on retail properties, which now account for 25 per cent of its property assets. Mr Phillip Davies, managing director, said the company's retail properties had shown especially good capital growth over the year. 'We have been very deliberate in our acquisitions, always looking for an angle rather than just picking up income-producing assets,' he said. Frogmore also has a Pounds 115m portfolio of trading properties, which are held for short-term gain and carried in the balance sheet at the lower of cost or market value. Investment in housebuilding joint ventures increased by Pounds 10m to Pounds 38m during the year and residential trading property assets now amount to Pounds 41m. Mr Davies said the residential assets would be sold this year following refurbishment, although this should contribute to trading profits. Frogmore also plans to sell around 600 new homes this year, against 689. Net rental income rose from Pounds 16.9m to Pounds 20.1m during the year, reflecting rents from acquired properties and additional lettings. Around Pounds 2.2m annual income has been lost following early surrender of the lease on 180,000 sq ft of office space in High Holborn for Pounds 7m cash. The site is being considered for redevelopment. Housebuilding contributed a gross profit Pounds 4.6m against Pounds 3.1m last year. After a loss on sales of trading properties of Pounds 929,000 (Pounds 193,000 profit) and administrative expenses of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 3m), operating profit for the year increased from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 20.4m. Net interest charges were higher at Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.1m) and taxation lower at Pounds 1.7m (Pounds 2.4m) following the release of Pounds 3m provisions. Earnings per share were 29.8p (21.1p). The final dividend is 13.2p (12.4p), making a total of 17p for the year. COMMENT Yesterday's pleasing increase in net assets will consolidate Frogmore's reputation as one of the canniest companies in the sector. A June year-end meant that yesterday's figures included the best of the rise in commercial property values, but the company has outperformed the wider market. The acquisitions made over the last two years look well-timed. Even if the property market has gone off the boil, Frogmore's large portfolio of trading properties and interests in housebuilding add spice to the earnings mix. Yesterday's rise in the shares is fully justified.</p>

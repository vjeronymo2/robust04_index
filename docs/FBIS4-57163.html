			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enelcys Calderon] </F>   [Text] "To increase economic relations with the United  States," for the purpose of "opening new paths for future ties,"  with Venezuela is one of the objectives of Ambassador Pedro Luis  Echeverria. On Tuesday he appeared before the Senate's Foreign  Relations Committee for approval of his designation as  Venezuelan ambassador to the U.S.    The future ambassador explained relations between Venezuela  and the United States are of a broad and diverse nature. One of  the major elements of relations is the economic relationship.  This economic relationship is evidenced by the export of energy  products and nontraditional exports such as those manufactured  by the state's basic enterprises, as well as investments by  Venezuela and the U.S. in each other's economies.    Regarding the proposal that the envoy in Washington also  hold  the post of ambassador to the OAS and other international  organizations with headquarters in that city, Echeverria replied  it is worth considering. "I think the OAS will undertake major  tasks in the coming years. It would be a great amount of work,  but I think with good organization a well-structured embassy  could handle those commitments in the future."    Although he supports the proposal to improve the expenditure  structure abroad, Echeverria feels that under the current  circumstances that cannot be done because the topics to be  discussed in the OAS in the immediate future require the active  presence of an ambassador.</p>

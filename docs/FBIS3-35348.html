The paper says in its editorial for 24 February: This,  however, does not mean we are calling for stopping the activity  of the Lebanese resistance, which is a legitimate act against  any occupier. But resistance must stem from genuinely patriotic  elements; it must not be left to groups with suspect objectives.    The paper says Hizballah is working on behalf of Iran,  implementing its policies and receiving financing and arms from  it.    The paper says Iran sponsors terrorist groups in a number of  Arab and Islamic countries, and is trying to foil the peace  talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese.    AL-AKHBAR concludes that imposing Lebanese Government  control  over Hizballah is an essential step that is in Lebanon's  interest.</p>

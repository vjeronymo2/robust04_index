			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Steel sees future in the east - Andrew Baxter on the company's long term growth possibilities Tucked away in British Steel's results statement is a figure which could hold the key to the group's long-term growth strategy as it grapples with the maturity of its traditional markets and continuing confusion over subsidies in Europe. Turnover outside the UK and continental Europe, classified as other areas, rose from Pounds 641m to Pounds 735m for the year to the end of March. As British Steel says, North American and east Asian markets were strong. Stripping out North America, turnover in the rest of the world was between Pounds 350m and Pounds 400m, compared with Pounds 340m, of which Asia accounted for Pounds 264m. The year before it had reached Pounds 390m as British Steel, in the depths of the UK recession, desperately sought markets where steel was in demand. The figures are important because they encompass developing countries where demand for steel is still growing fast, notably east Asia, and is set to continue that way for a decade or more. But they also present a challenge to British Steel, which accepts that the numbers cannot grow much more unless it develops its presence in these markets. British Steel has been one of the main beneficiaries of Asia's net deficit in steel production, helped by a joint venture it set up with Jardine Matheson of Hong Kong in 1986, and by a network of British Steel sales offices. The latest one, in Ho Chi Minh City, is just about to open. Among the record 30m tonnes of steel imported by various producers into China last year were more than 100,000 tonnes of British Steel long products used in construction. The company has followed and supported British industry in the region. Its structural steel has been supplied to big projects in Hong Kong, the Philippines and Taiwan. It recently received its first order from Vietnam, for 100 tonnes of structural sections. But along with most of its European and US competitors, British Steel has no mills in Asia, and most of the steel it sells in the region is exported from the UK. The company is thus faced with heavy transport costs and the threat from countries such as China and India which want to become self-sufficient in steel or even net exporters. 'If you have not turned your export sales into domestic production, you will lose out,' said Mr Edward Hadas, steel analyst at Swiss Bank Corporation. 'At some point that export market won't be there.' British Steel's three-pronged strategy for the region and other steel markets such as central and eastern Europe, recognises that it must have a presence there, although it falls short of turning them into 'core' strategic regions. It believes it ought to be able to optimise revenues by being aware of opportunities in these markets and becoming involved in projects when something more than a commodity grade of steel is needed. Having built up a worldwide marketing capability it has the necessary shipping, financing and other skills to make a successful steel sale. Thirdly, and most significantly, it is developing what it sees as a 'pathfinder' role, recognising the difficulty of predicting which markets will have the strongest growth. The aim is to position the company within individual markets to increase its knowledge, and identify possible investment decisions and potential local partners. Investments could be anything from a service or distribution centre to a full-blown mill. For example, if British Steel was to become a large supplier in flat-rolled steel markets in Asia, as demand for cars and domestic appliances accelerates, it may have to make such investments. Mr Brian Moffat, British Steel's chairman and chief executive, said the company was more likely to invest to add value to the steel process rather than manufacture raw steel. Characteristically, though, British Steel is not rushing, and Mr Moffat said 'nothing is immediately imminent'. However, some observers believe the company should not wait too long, or risk being shut out by the expansion plans of indigenous producers - especially the Chinese. Mr Hadas said the rational strategy for British Steel would be to use any excess cash flow to invest in processing or producing steel where demand growth was higher. Expansion outside Europe and North America should be at the top of the company's list of strategic priorities, he said. The risks may be relatively high, but the company had technical, management and marketing expertise to offer. Ultimately, the world's expanding steel regions look like providing a test for Mr Moffat in one of his two key tasks at British Steel - finding ways to grow its revenues. His prowess in the other task, continuing the fight to contain costs and boost productivity further, is already proven. Meanwhile North America is not being ignored. The company said it was finalising a study to make a significant investment in Tuscaloosa Steel, its Alabama subsidiary, to create a 'world competitive' mini-mill producing steel plate.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                        1993     1994 TURNOVER                                            Poundsm  Poundsm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              By destination  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK                                                    2,197    2,233 Rest of Europe                                        1,465    1,223 Other areas                                             641      735 Total                                                 4,303    4,191  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           By product grouping  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Uncoated strip products                                 860      955 Coated strip products                                   854      918 Sections and plates                                     871      931 Tubular products                                        438      390 Stainless products                                      189        - Other steel products                                     65       74 Total finished products                               3,277    3,268 Semi-finished products                                  228      237 Total steel industry products                         3,505    3,505  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Distribution                                            685      566 Others                                                  113      120 Total                                                 4,303    4,191  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

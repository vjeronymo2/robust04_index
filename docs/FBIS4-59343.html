			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The current aggression by the al-Ahmar gang on the  armed forces of unity and democracy has been dealt with by the  local newspapers. SAWT AL-UMMAL newspaper in its issue affirmed  that the criminal acts by the al-Ahmar military family  culminated with the ignition of the civil war and the  inter-Yemen war.    The newspaper indicated that the ugliest images of envy had  become evident in the hundreds of dead and thousands of injured.  The newspaper said in this connection: We do not find words to  express this criminal tragedy experienced by our Yemeni people  today as the result of a sick president and a family which is  mainly concerned to preserve its interests and continues to  [word indistinct] the people's fortunes and wealth. The  newspaper quoted the proverb which says: He who digs a hole for  his brother falls in. The newspaper went on to say that the  al-Ahmar ruling family has declared confrontation between it and  the people. The people must therefore join their armed forces  in order to decide the match and normalize the matter by  restoring the authority to the people so that the people and  their armed forces could stand against this crime, which is  commanded by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 'Ali Muhsin al- Ahmar and his  brother, Muhammad 'Abdallah Salih and other highwaymen. SAWT  AL-UMMAL said that the conspiracy against the people became  complete with the ruling family's decision to declare a state of  emergency. By this the family unmasked its ugly face, which is  hostile to democracy, unity, and civil and human rights.</p>

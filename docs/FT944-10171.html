			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danish pigmeat co-ops study merger proposal - A controversial plan Danish co-operative slaughterhouses, which already include some of the largest pigmeat companies in Europe, are considering merging to form what the Association of Danish Slaughterhouses claims would be the biggest pigmeat processing group in the world. At this stage the idea is only the subject of a debate among the farmers who own the businesses; there have been no merger negotiations as such. If the merger takes place the resulting company will be the second largest industrial group in Denmark, with a turnover of between DKr30bn and DKr40bn (Pounds 3.12bn-Pounds 4.16bn). Denmark's pigmeat industry has turned in an impressive performance since it made its reputation at the beginning of this century as a supplier of bacon for the British breakfast table. It now claims world market shares of 20 to 30 per cent, varying by product, for internationally-traded pigmeat. The country has only 5m people, but produces 20m pigs a year, exporting 80 per cent of the pigmeat produced. Pigmeat is Denmark's largest single export product, worth about DKr18bn in 1993, about 8 per cent of the country's merchandise exports. The industry owes its success, say the Danes, to the co-operative structure, which gives farmers control all the way from the pig sty - through breeding and processing to sales and marketing. 'We are able to produce raw material of a uniform high quality, and have a system of production which meets the consumer's demand for pure, healthy and nourishing meat products,' says Mr Bent Sloth, pig farmer and chairman of the Association of Danish Slaughterhouses. The industry has rationalised rapidly. Three decades ago there were almost 100 co-operative slaughterhouse companies; now there are just four - Danish Crown, Vestjyske (West Jutland), Steff Houlberg, and Tican - plus the associated companies that process meat into hams, sausages and other value-added products. Mr Sloth favours the merger, which in itself is a sign of how the idea has matured. His predecessor as chairman was voted out in the mid-1980s for supporting a proposal for a pigmeat monopoly company. 'It is time for the Danish pig industry to give priority to competing with the pig producers of other countries rather than with each other,' Mr Sloth declares in an issue of the slaughterhouse association's magazine devoted to the merger issue. He argues that if the Danish companies do not merge with each other one or other of them may well merge instead with a foreign company. 'But if the supplier chain is extended to other countries, where the same quality guarantees cannot be provided, we risk losing all the advantages which the Danish industry enjoys.' He does not think there is any risk of loss of commercial dynamism if domestic competition is largely eliminated. The company would be measured by its ability to pay its farmer-suppliers a better price for their pigs than the co-operatives' foreign competitors are able to pay theirs, he argues, and this would keep the company on its competitive toes. The chairmen of the four co-operatives are less sure. Mr Bent Claudi Lassen, chairman of Danish Crown, the largest of them, concedes that there will be advantages in terms of international sales and marketing strength, as well as economies of scale to be exploited. But counterbalancing these advantages, in his view, are the problems of managing such a gigantic enterprise. Mr Bent Maribo, chairman of Steff Houlberg, ranking third among the four, is unequivocally opposed to a one-company solution. 'It will not mean a strengthening, but a weakening, of the Danish sales position,' he says. International buyers, especially in Japan, which is the most valuable export market for Danish pigmeat, want to have a choice of suppliers, and if there is only one Danish company, they will exercise their choice by buying more from Taiwan, the US and France, he warns. For similar reasons, Danish buyers will begin buying a higher proportion of their meat from abroad, while the private Danish suppliers, who account for about 4 per cent of the market, will gain market shares as well. Domestic competition, says Mr Maribo, is one of the factors which has made the Danish slaughterhouses among the most efficient in the world. Eliminate this competition 'and measuring success will be difficult', he says. Mr Egon Kristensen, chairman of Vestjyske, agrees. 'Monopolies haven't always been the most efficient,' he points out.  ------------------------------------------------------------ DANISH PIGMEAT EXPORTS IN 1993  ------------------------------------------------------------ Destination                Tonnes               Value                                         (billion DKr) France                     90,445               1,238 Germany                   176,023               2,453 Italy                      88,304               1,184 UK                        145,431               2,547 EU total                  529,458               7,811 Japan                     139,920               4,519 US                         52,472                 732 World total               783,588              13,812  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

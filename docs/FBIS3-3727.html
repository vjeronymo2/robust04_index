According to local economic officials, last year the per  capita net income of farmers from the province's 70 poverty-hit  areas reached 448.9 yuan. Farmers from the province's 37 other  major poor areas achieved a per capita net income of over 350  yuan, basically solving the difficulty of having enough to eat  and wear.    Poverty-stricken areas, which make up two-thirds of  Shaanxi's  total area and served as revolutionary bases in the past, are  mainly located in the province's northern and southern parts,  featuring poor natural conditions, inconvenient transportation  and slow economic development.    Since the early 1980s, the central government, together with  the provincial government, has decided to list the province's  northern and southern areas as the main targets of the  help-the-poor program, and given them great financial support  and large quantities of manpower. With the focus on economic  development, the program has helped poverty-hit farmers to  overcome difficulties and solve the problem of making a living.    In carrying out economic development, local farmers pin  their  hopes on capital construction of agriculture to help them to  prosper and have made painstaking efforts towards such  development.    For instance, by the end of last year, farmers in the  province's poverty-hit areas had cultivated about 1.1 million  hectares of farmland and had been blessed with grain harvests  for many years running.    Consequently, northern Shaanxi, which used to suffer serious  soil erosion, has brought 30,000 sq [square] km of erosion-prone  land and 90 percent of the shifting sands zones (566,667  hectares) under tight control after having adopted a series of  measures to carry out comprehensive harnessing work.    Moreover, forest and grass cover in the province has been  raised from the former 11 percent to the present 36 percent,  greatly improving the ecological environment for farming.    Local officials from poverty-stricken areas have also made  active efforts and have built bases for carrying out diversified  economic development in accordance with characteristics of  mountainous areas and plateaus, in a bid to form highly  efficient pillar industries for various poor localities.    In line with market demands, northern Shaanxi has stressed  the development of businesses concerning cigarette-making,  growing and processing of fruit and potatoes, and breeding of  sheep, while southern Shaanxi has laid its focus on the  development of products such as tea, fruit, medicine and edible  fungus. The efforts have begun to pay off.    Statistics show that earnings from diversified economy of  northern and southern Shaanxi now makes up 70 percent of their  local total output value of agriculture.    In the meantime, local officials have made a success of  technical popularization and training, greatly improving the  general competence of farmers from poverty-hit areas, as well as  the level of productive forces in those areas.    Over the past few years, governments at provincial,  prefectural and county levels have worked closely and have  sponsored more than 100,000 training courses of various kinds  for poverty-stricken areas, and have established 4,900 exemplary  scientific and technological households (centers).    At present, the main laborers in 56.7 percent of the rural  households from the province's poverty-hit areas have mastered  one or two special skills to become prosperous.    Poverty-hit areas of the province have also made active  efforts to build more rural and township enterprises. The  endeavor has generated positive results.    Meanwhile, governments at various levels have actively  strengthened exchanges of cadres with economically developed  provinces and municipalities, injecting great vitality into the  economic development and social progress in poverty-hit areas of  the province.    In addition, 60 departments at provincial level have sent  260  cadres to 53 poor areas of the province to help carry out  help-the-poor work. These cadres have helped poor areas launch  197 projects and introduce more than 200 million yuan of outside  investment into poor areas.</p>

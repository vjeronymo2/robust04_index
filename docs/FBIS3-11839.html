			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Victor Andres Ponce -- part one of three] </F>   [Text] The Supreme Court has 18 justices distributed in two  civil courts and two criminal courts. Regarding the higher  courts, there are 249 judges distributed in 20 superior courts.    According to experts, the most urgent problems of judicial  reform are not at those levels. In fact, according to the new  charter and the Judicial Branch Organic Law, the Supreme Court  will have less work because it will no longer be the last resort  but only a court of cassation. In other words, it will review  the request of the party that the process follows the  established rules without making judgment on the sentences. The  superior courts (court of appeal) will now become the last  resort.    A judicial branch executive council source said the appeals  court does not require so many courts, but rather a high  specialization of verdicts. Therefore, the main problem at this  level would be the judges' qualification and specialization.    Anyway, there is a deficit in solving cases. In 1993, Lima's  civil courts did not resolve 25 percent of the cases. Regarding  criminal courts, only 10 percent of the cases were unresolved.    Also, according to the requests received by the Executive  Council for the creation of courts and appeal courts that were  not fulfilled, there is a shortage of 25 to 30 percent of judges  in the entire country.  <H5>  Shortage of Judges </H5>   It is at the lower court level where the shortage of judges  and the judicial system's bad organization are clearly seen.  According to figures provided by the judicial branch personnel  directorate, there are 563 lower court judges at the national  level among the civil, penal, juvenile, labor, and mixed courts.  According to studies by the Inter-American Development Agency  (AID) in coordination with Catholic University based on an  agreement with the judicial branch, if the existence of 184  provinces in the country is taken into account, and 381 civil,  penal, and mixed courts, it can be said that there is an average  of two lower courts per province (the main demand for justices  is in the criminal and civil courts).  <H5>  Is There a Shortage of Criminal Judges? </H5>   Of the 381 judges, 187 are criminal judges. If we take as a  point of reference the number of inmates who have not received  sentences yet, we would conclude that the number of judges is  highly insufficient. In the penitentiaries, 75 percent of the  inmates are not sentenced. Sometimes they wait several years  before they are found innocent. Only 25 percent of the cases are  resolved.    But there are exceptions: In the Arequipa judicial district,  unsentenced inmates reach 50 percent. An investigation should be  made to find out why it is more efficient.    In a Catholic University poll of Lima criminal judges, the  majority said they had from 100 to 2,000 cases, with an average  of 550. In answer to a question on how many cases were  appropriate for efficient work, an average of 250 was given.    If a comparison is made of this alleged ideal number of  cases  per judge with the average number of cases for each judge, the  conclusion is that the number of criminal judges in the lower  courts should be at least doubled.    The difference found by the poll is also the result of the  shift of judges on duty that can lead to corruption, because one  filing a lawsuit can choose "his judge." The experts' proposal  is to assign a fixed number of judges per shift. This could be  changed according to the process' complexity.  <H5>  Effects of Penal Legislation </H5>   There are factors other than the number of judges. One of  them is indiscriminate laws. For example, Congressman Cesar  Fernandez Arce maintains that the antidrug trafficking law does  not establish any difference between a drug "pusher" and the  chief of a drug trafficking gang, consequently crowding prisons  in the jungle region. This is why the judicial branch Executive  Council has decided to present draft bills reforming the  antidrug law and to apply the new Penal Procedural Law in order  to reduce the amount of defendants by 75 percent in the whole  country.  <H5>  Effects of Informatics </H5>   The executive branch has implemented a pilot program in the  Second Lima Penal Court with the help of U.S. organization AID  and the judicial branch.    The contrasts were evident the day we visited that  courthouse: Unlike other courthouses, there was no crowding of  people and there were no mountains of files on the tables.    A secretary informed us that the proceedings'  computerization  has expedited the work because files, decisions, and proceedings  are in a computer file. However, the secretary added, given the  lack of trained administrative personnel, the secretaries (of  which there are two in each court) are the ones responsible for  feeding the files into computers, a procedure that overloads  them with work.    The computerized service's results are nonetheless evident  because the average number of sentences issued by Lima courts  during 1993 -- according to the Lima Appellate Court -- was 18  per month. In the case of the Second Lima Penal Court it was 36.  This result shows that the procedures' computerization can  double a judge's productivity.  <H5>  Effects of the New Procedural Law </H5>   The new Penal Procedural Law takes effect 20 May if its  implementation is not suspended again for the fourth time. The  main new provision established by this new law is that an  inquiry's commencement and procedures, besides the indictment  procedures, must be made by the District Attorney's Office.    The courts must determine the acquittal or not of the  defendants and issue sentences. In other words, the penal courts  would be relieved of long inquiries and will pass sentences.    According to the current law procedure, in cases of oral  trials a penal court commences an inquiry and presents its  findings to an upper penal court (second instance). In case of  petty crimes, summary trials -- in which the same judge carries  out the investigations and issues a sentence -- are held.    "It is, therefore, very different to hear an average of 550  trials under the current Penal Procedural Law than to hear them  under the new law under which the inquiry is already completed,"  states legal expert Carlos Rivera from the Institute for the  Defense of Law.    The Judicial Branch Inquiry Center presided over by Roberto  Alvarez believes the number of judges in Lima is enough to apply  the new Penal Procedural Law.    "The problems, however, will be transferred to the district  attorney," Rivera states. It has been learned that the  postponement in implementing the new Penal Procedural Law is due  to the prosecutors' inability to carry out the new procedural  duties.    "If the new law were applied all of a sudden all the cases  would be delayed because reorganization takes time," Rivera said.  <H5>  Attorney General's Office Will Need More Prosecutors </H5>   The question now is whether the public prosecutor offices  are  either prepared or if they have enough personnel to carry out  the inquiries.    Under the current system the Attorney General's Office must  present the charges in defense of the interests of society. In  order to comply with this objective, there exist almost 700  public prosecutors assigned according to the amount of lower and  upper courts (mainly penal courts) in the judicial branch.    Each penal court has one provincial prosecutor.    In the case of upper penal courts, there are appellate court  prosecutors, who in turn have assistant prosecutors.    On top are Supreme Court prosecutors, who are organized  according to Supreme Court sections. There are five sections  (two penal, two civilian, and one constitutional court);  therefore, there are five supreme prosecutors.  <H5>  Fiscal Attorney Influences? </H5>   Generally speaking, the Attorney General's Office never had  problems fulfilling its duty of raising formal charges because  it never conducted investigations. In the Peruvian tradition,  the majority of crimes handled by the Attorney General's Office  have previously been investigated by police precincts or  stations. Moreover, attorneys usually do not probe the  investigation or contradict what is reported by police.    But what will happen when the Attorney General's Office is  assigned to conduct the pre-trial inquest as it should be?    If we take into account that according to the aforementioned  report, 75 percent of penal cases are neglected and (if the  procedural law codes are not computerized and amended), it is  obvious that the Attorney General's Office will be unable to  meet the demand with its current personnel.    To clarify this statement we also must take into account the  time needed to conduct a pre-trial inquest with the current  penal judges and compare the working conditions of the  provincial attorney general's offices with that of the courts.    If we take into account that according to Apoyo the  indictment procedure currently conducted by the Attorney  General's Office takes an average of 80 days and the pre-trial  inquest conducted by penal court judges takes an average of 286  days, we will have an idea of the number of new provincial  attorney generals that must be appointed so they can fulfill  their new duties.  <H5>  Working Conditions in Attorney General's Office </H5>   It is the provincial attorney general's offices -- which are  associated with the first instance courts -- that will be in  charge of conducting future pre-trial inquests.    Each provincial attorney general's office has three  "technical experts" (who are generally either law students or  law school graduates) and an administrative worker who is in  charge of the dispatches.    If we compare the personnel assigned to a provincial  attorney  general's office with that of a penal court -- which has one  judge, four counselors, and two administrative secretaries --  the differences are obvious. It is not only a quantitative but  also qualitative difference because the majority of courts  secretaries are lawyers and assist the judges with their  professional expertise.    There is no need to explain that because of the current  number of attorney generals, the infrastructure, and the  personnel on hand, the penal courts will take far more than the  286 days they currently take for summary proceedings, and this  will weaken the penal justice situation even further.    This is such an obvious fact that the enforcement of the new  Penal Procedure Law has been postponed three times solely for  this reason.    Experts assert that to assume its new responsibilities, the  Attorney General's Office needs to increase the number of  attorneys, improve its infrastructure, and increase its  personnel. An Attorney General's office member said: "Each  provincial attorney general must have at least three attorneys."  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   Should the situation remain the same, that is, if the  current  Penal Procedure Law continues to be enforced and the courts are  not computerized, it is obvious that in Lima alone the number of  judges should double. If the ideal number of cases per judge is  250, this conclusion is obvious.    With the new Penal Procedure Law and computerized courts,  the  processes are expedited and judges will double their production.  A judicial branch Executive Council member said: "If this is  the case, we will be forced to reduce the number of judges."  The problem, however, does not disappear. It is simply  transferred to the attorneys.    As for the Attorney General's Office, by reviewing the  current figures, it can be concluded that the enforcement of the  new Penal Procedure Law will only be feasible if the number of  provincial attorneys is increased threefold. Moreover, each  attorney must have an assistant who must be a law school  graduate. The number of assistants needed may be reduced by  half if the attorneys' offices are computerized.</p>

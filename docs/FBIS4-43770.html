			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colette Braeckman: "The Lead of the Two </F> Frenchmen: Continued"]    [Text] The theory put forward yesterday by LE SOIR, based  on corroborated information, that two members of the French  military may have been involved in the attack on 6 April on the  aircraft carrying the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, has  brought numerous and lively reactions. In France, the  government issued a denial during the morning of publication  stating that this "allegation" is "absurd" and pointing out  that, at the time of the attack, there were just 25 French  military left in Kigali, all employed on very specific tasks.    In Brussels, the Foreign Ministry and the prime minister  stated that they had no information to support the theory. Mr.  Dehaene, leaving LE SOIR responsible for its information, stated  that "the theory put forward was not within the scope of the  enquiry being pursued by the military authorities." It is true  that, in the strictest sense, the enquiry being conducted by the  military authorities only concerns the circumstances in which  the 10 Belgian blue helmets died in Kigali. But colleagues at  the RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television], who  also contacted the military authorities, were told on Friday [17  June] that the theory of white mercenaries, including some  French, remained open with respect to the attack on 6 April.    The denials from the official authorities do not answer the  outstanding questions and, given the present status of our  information, the lead we mentioned yesterday remains credible  even if it is not of course certain. We are continuing to  receive information of the return to Kigali last February of 11  French soldiers who, until December, had been members of the  DAMI [Military Training Assistance Detachment] and who were  apparently recognized in civilian clothing in Kigali.    Shadowy areas also remain regarding the French military  presence in Rwanda. For example: We have learned, in another  context, that shortly after 6 April two French development  conscripts were killed in Kigali, together with the wife of one  of them. One of them, a member of the GIGN [National  Gendarmerie Intervention Group], Jean-Paul Mayertz, had arrived  in Kigali in December and was responsible for training  activities, with the Presidential Guard in particular.  Information given to their relatives indicates that these  French citizens were killed by the soldiers of the Rwandan Armed  Forces in the "lot" neighboring their residence. Their bodies  were recovered by the blue helmets, repatriated and buried as  discreetly as possible. To our knowledge, Paris has never  mentioned the death of these French soldiers.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> HOW DO WE STOP 'SNEAKER KILLINGS'?  </P> <P> Michael Jordan grew up middle-class, in a small town in North Carolina. He grew  up with parents who loved him, nurtured him. Parents who stayed married.  </P> <P> Even when he became an NBA superstar and began reaping millions of dollars  annually after signing with Nike, it never dawned on him that inner-city youths  would rob and murder each other over the shoes he endorsed.  </P> <P> But that's what's happening today in America's inner cities. And it happens not  just to wearers of Air Jordans, it happens to wearers of many types of  sneakers, jackets and Major League Baseball caps worn and endorsed by pro stars  and their teams.  </P> <P> It happens because sneakers are macho status symbols, and the shoe companies  spend more than $200 million a year on seductive advertising aimed at  impressionable kids.  </P> <P> It happens because the top-of-the-line shoes are so expensive -- Reebok's  "Pump" retails for $170, Nike Air Jordans for $115 -- that for some poor,  desperate, directionless inner-city kids, the only way to get them seems to be  through drug money or mugging.  </P> <P> It happens because gangs, on whatever whim, often identify themselves by a  certain brand of sneaker, jacket, cap. Rival gangs will kill you on sight for  wearing those clothes, even if you're a non-gang member totally unaware of  their significance.  </P> <P> It happens because we live in a warped society that pays lip service to our  concern for our fellow man, yet has done little to prevent the establishment of  a permanent underclass in inner cities and isolated rural pockets, islands of  misery where kids without love, adult guidance, money or hope are bombarded and  influenced by the same glitzy TV programs and commercials that feed every  viewer, regardless of purchasing power, a steady diet of flash and dash, status  and luxury. Not having the money to buy something doesn't lessen a person's  appetite for it. It just makes the craving stronger.  </P> <P> But these sneaker killings, for want of a better term, have little to do with  money, just status. Sneaker advertisers, ignoring the fact that more than 80  percent of sneakers purchased in this country are not used for sport, claim  that their commercials have to do with sports, not status. They say they are  appalled that kids kill each other over their product.  </P> <P> But some people who run sporting goods stores, especially in the inner city,  say that carrying certain brands attracts gangs. And that some of their best  customers make their purchases with drug money. And that any shoe company  spokesperson who claims not to know that drug money is fueling this $5.5  billion domestic industry (1990 projection for U.S. sales) has his head in the  sand.  </P> <P> How can the proprietor tell what's drug money and what isn't? If a kid comes in  with a 3-inch wad of bills, buys 30 pairs of sneakers in 10 minutes and pays  without waiting for change, you can be fairly certain he's not outfitting the  local Little League.  </P> <P> In its May 14 cover story, "Your Sneakers Or Your Life," Sports Illustrated  reported that Wally Grigo, who owns three sportswear shops in and around New  Haven, Conn., put a sign in his window last August that read: "If you deal  drugs, we don't want your business. Spend your money somewhere else." Grigo  told SI he figured putting up the sign has cost him $2,000 a week in drug money  sales.  </P> <P> Who's at fault? What can be done to stop the horror of a human life being  snuffed out for a pair of shoes? Failing that, what small steps can be taken to  lessen its frequency? This has been a hot topic of conversation among sports  writers in almost every press room I've visited the last two months.  </P> <P> At first, our discussions centered on the advertising superstar, Jordan. As  perhaps the most popular sports hero in our nation, a man who takes pride in  being a role model for youth, a man who makes millions of dollars a year from  Nike, should he take a moral stand and tell the shoe company he will only  endorse a much cheaper model of the shoe? Should he make a public service  announcement telling drug dealers: "Don't buy my shoes"? Should he stop  endorsing the product?  </P> <P> Jordan is greatly disturbed by the sneaker killings, and by being linked to  them, however insanely and indirectly, because he represents Nike. And, yes, he  could do one or all of the above things, and some people -- me included --  would lionize him.  </P> <P> But why should a black athlete like Jordan be held to a higher standard than a  white athlete? That's racist. You can make a case that John McEnroe's spoiled  brat behavior on the tennis court was a bad example for a generation of young  players. But Jordan is a shining example. Neither he nor any athlete-endorser  has anything to do with kids killing each other over sneakers, jackets or caps.  </P> <P> Besides, sometimes, there is no rhyme or reason to what shoes or sporting  equipment are "hot." SI interviewed one manager of a Chicago Foot Locker Store  whose hottest shoe was a $39 brand that he said had been around for 20 years.  Who can predict fashion fads?  </P></p>

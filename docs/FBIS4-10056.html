			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has announced a  reduction of bean and corn prices as of 1 May. Salinas headed  the national meeting of Rural Community Supply Councils. In the  Lopez Mateos Room at Los Pinos presidential residence, the  president said bean prices will be reduced 15 percent and corn  prices will be reduced from 80 to 65 centavos per kilogram at  rural stores, a move that will benefit over 20 million Mexicans.  The president thus addressed almost 300 community supply  representatives.    [Begin Salinas recording] The implementation of Program of  Direct Support to the Countryside means that the government's  subsidy will go directly to the peasants, without the  intervention of middlemen. [end recording]    For the first time 2 million peasants will receive direct  support for their land parcels. The president listened to the  problems outlined by three Community Supply Council  representatives. He responded to each of their requests,  assuring them that kernel corn will not be replaced and that  flour will only be complementary. He promised that the corn  supply will be sufficient and of good quality. The president  presented 10 registered deeds for civilian partnerships.</p>

Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said on Westdeutscher  Rundfunk [radio station] on Thursday [24 March] that he has  spoken to Foreign Minister Kinkel about negotiating a  "deportation agreement" with Ankara. In this agreement, the  Turkish government is to promise that deported Kurds will not  face death sentences for previous offenses committed in Turkey.  With such an agreement, which he thinks Ankara will keep, the  German law on foreigners could be enforced "much more  intensively," Kanther said.    Yekta Guengoer Oezden, president of the Turkish  Constitutional Court, told DPA in Ankara, that Turkish justice  guarantees "the right to defense, including the right to look  for appeal, no less than German law does." If cases of torture  occur "now and again," the "ignorant persons responsible" are  tried for undue use of authority and punished, Oezden said.  Onur Oeymen, Turkey's ambassador to Bonn, speaking on  Deutschlandfunk radio, confirmed his country's willingness to  fight terrorists with the means of a constitutional state.    In spite of these promises, the church charity Caritas and  Alliance 90/Greens warned against tightening deportation  practices. Following the decision by the federal and laender  governments to use all means of deportation for violent Kurds,  Caritas President Hellmut Puschmann called on the state to "be  moderate and renounce revenge." Greens politicians Angelika  Beer and Claudia Roth demanded that deportations be halted "as  long as there is no sign of rule of law and human rights in  Turkey." After the promise not to use any arms from Germany  against Kurds, everybody knows what Turkish promises are worth.  [passage omitted]</p>

Baptist.  </P> <P> After Simi Valley jumped to a 6-0 first-inning lead, Coach Mike Scyphers  cleared the bench, replacing every starter but Gordon and pitcher Jeff  Treadway.  </P> <P> Gordon finished the season with 15 home runs, tying Scott Sharts for the school  record but leaving him one shy of the Southern Section record of 16 set by  Channel Islands' Arnold Garcia in 1981.  </P> <P> Treadway (4-2), a freshman right-hander, earned the win. He struck out seven  and allowed three hits in five innings.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Granada Hills 7, Cleveland 5 -- The Highlanders overcame a three-run deficit to  earn a wild-card berth in the City Section 4-A Division playoffs.  </P> <P> Granada Hills' Jon Condos was three for three with two runs batted in, and  Robert Vasquez and Scott Berger each added two hits.

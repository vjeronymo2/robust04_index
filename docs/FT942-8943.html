			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Observer: Difficulties with a girl John Smith's death may have thrown the Labour party into confusion, but at least there is now a bit of time in which to craft an elegant solution to the leadership quandary. Pity Bill Clinton, who has to make a hastier decision. Into his diary for June 4 had been scheduled the US president's first ever meeting with Smith - in Portsmouth so that he could step straight on to the D-day flotilla. What, though, does Clinton do now? Acting leader Margaret Beckett seems to be viewed as a less than wholly suitable subject for Clinton's undivided attention - seeing that she won't get the job full-time. If he embarks on a session with the entire party leadership, on the other hand, he could be accused of interfering. Some Japanese apparently took offence last July when Clinton earnestly chatted up Morohiro Hosokawa, then only the leader of a small political party, at a time when Kiichi Miyazawa was still prime minister. It's a wonder he ever ventures out of the Oval Office at all.</p>

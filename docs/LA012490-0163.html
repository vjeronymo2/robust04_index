			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: JACKSON WOULD LIKE TO BE SENATOR OF NEW STATE  </P> <P> NOW HERE'S a scoop coming in Parade magazine this very Sunday -- a profile of  Jesse Jackson by Edward Klein. This was written about five weeks ago for  deadline, but Klein says the news is still viable and fresh. Jesse Jackson, it  seems, is searching for a way NOT to run for President in 1992. And he doesn't  want to be the next mayor of D.C. either. What Jesse wants is to become the  senator from the largely black state of "New Columbia" and he says, in the  future, he is going to make statehood for the District "the highest civil  rights issue in the country." A 51st state?  </P> <P> EL STORK! Actor Roy Scheider and his wife, Brenda, a former documentary  filmmaker, welcomed a 7 1/2 pound boy in a New York hospital last Saturday. His  name is Christian Verrier Scheider. Daddy is famous for his roles in "Jaws" and  "All That Jazz." He has just finished filming "Russia House." . . . Another  marvelous actor, John Hurt (he made "The Naked Civil Servant" and "Scandal" to  name just two of his movies) and his live-in love, Jo Dalton, marry this very  day at the Westminster Town Hall in London. After the ceremony, the Hurts will  go to honeymoon in a nearby London hospital, awaiting the arrival any second of  their first-born. This is called planned parenthood -- I guess.  </P> <P> BARBARA WALTERS is just back from Czechoslovakia, interviewing the new  president, Vaclav Havel. While in Prague, Barbara found many people saying to  her, "Well, Havel is a great story, but why don't you also interview your own  Ambassador Shirley Temple Black? She's the one everybody is interested in."  </P> <P> So Barbara turned right around and did also interview America's most famous  diplomat, Ambassador Black. She then had two stories which she will air over  ABC's "20/20" in two weeks on Feb. 2.  </P> <P> ON THURSDAY, Pete and Carrie Rozelle will go to the White House where President  Bush will give a presidential commendation to the former National Football  League commissioner for his work with the United Way of America. No one could  deserve this honor more than Pete.  </P> <P> The Rozelles are now living in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., where they are building  a new house. Pete is having the time of his life in "retirement." He is still a  consultant to the League.  </P> <P> DONALD TRUMP? On the cover of the March Playboy magazine, in his shirt sleeves,  posing with a sexy female? OK, so far, so right.  </P> <P> Inside, Trump speaks candidly about personal loyalty, politics and the decline  of America. "I like George Bush very much," he says to reporter Glenn Plaskin,  "but I disagree with him when he talks of a kinder, gentler America. I think if  this country gets any kinder or gentler, it's literally going to cease to  exist. . . . The Japanese double-screw the U.S., a real trick. First they take  all our money with their consumer goods, then they put it back in buying all of  Manhattan. So either way, we lose." There's a lot more!  </P></p>

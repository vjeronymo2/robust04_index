			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN ARRESTED IN BOMB THREAT CASE  </P> <P> A Reseda man has been arrested in connection with a bomb threat Tuesday that  forced the evacuation of several buildings and clogged morning traffic in Van  Nuys, police said.  </P> <P> Carlos Deveraux, 36, was arrested at his home at 6:40 p.m. Tuesday, 10 hours  after he allegedly called police and told them that he had left seven nuclear  warheads in a brown Datsun parked outside the Church on the Way in the 14300  block of Sherman Way, Detective Bob Muldrew said.  </P> <P> Police found no explosives in the car.  </P> <P> Muldrew said police traced the car, which was spray-painted with the number "7"  and the words "Hot" and "The End," to Deveraux, who attended the church  occasionally.  </P> <P> Deveraux confessed to police that he had called in the bomb threat, Muldrew  said. No motive was established.  </P> <P> "He just doesn't know what he's doing," Muldrew said.  </P> <P> Deveraux was scheduled to be arraigned this morning in Van Nuys Municipal  Court.  </P></p>

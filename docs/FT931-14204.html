			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Clinton and Bush play down Iraqi offer to cease fire: Baghdad yields to UN demands on flights IRAQ'S offer to the US and its allies of a ceasefire received a cool response yesterday both from advisers to President-elect Bill Clinton and from the outgoing Bush administration. The offer, seen as a test of Mr Clinton's intentions, seemed likely to exploit growing unease in the west over continued military action. But US officials insisted that the three main partners in the anti-Iraq coalition - the US, France and the UK - remained united. Mr George Stephanopoulos, Mr Clinton's spokesman, said the only way Iraq could enjoy a more peaceful relationship with the US was to change its behaviour and comply with United Nations resolutions passed after the Gulf war. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the outgoing White House spokesman, added that Iraq was already bound by a ceasefire under the terms of UN resolution 687, which brought the Gulf war to an end in 1991. 'If Iraq complies with that, then there should be no problem,' Mr Fitzwater said. Along with the ceasefire proposal, a principal cause of dispute between the UN and Baghdad was removed last night when the UN accepted Iraq's offer to let flights by UN weapons inspectors resume unconditionally. Mr Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's UN ambassador, said his country would allow UN weapons inspectors to fly directly from Bahrain to Baghdad. Mr Rolf Ekeus, head of the UN Commission set up to identify and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said this offer 'should be taken seriously' and guarantees had been given about safety of the aircraft. He said the flights would be resumed as soon as feasible. Sir David Hannay, the UK representative at the UN, speaking after Security Council members met to discuss the crisis for the first time since attacks against Iraq began on Wednesday, said Iraq's response on the inspection flights was satisfactory. Baghdad's ceasefire offer, to take place from 5am GMT today, was described as 'a gesture of goodwill' to the new US president and came after US and British aircraft had again attacked targets in the northern air exclusion zone. US F-14 and F-4G aircraft had fired at Iraqi anti-aircraft guns and air defence radars in the northern no-fly zone in incidents described by US officials as 'defensive attacks'. Washington had also announced that another aircraft carrier and three more warships were on their way to the eastern Mediterranean. The Iraqi Revolution Command Council said it would stop shooting if the allies followed suit. This would give the new US administration 'time to study the no-fly zones in the north and south', and to 'establish a constructive dialogue'. The Security Council talks took place amid signs of alarm about the intensity and persistence of coalition military operations. Statements in Moscow, seemed to conflict with earlier Russian support for the allied response. In London, Downing Street reacted cautiously to the ceasefire offer. Officials said Prime Minister John Major had spoken by telephone to Mr Clinton and they showed 'complete identity of view'. However, earlier evidence of growing disquiet prompted officials to hint that Mr Major had acted to restrain the US in calls to President Bush at the weekend. Granting a Commons debate, the prime minister assured MPs all decisions had been taken in close co-operation with coalition partners and in accordance with UN resolutions. France also indicated its unease about US attacks near Baghdad, but defended the legality of allied air strikes in the two air exclusion zones in which French Mirages took part.

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: New year gain for Wellcome DRUGS group Wellcome attracted support, partly in reaction to a clinical study favourable to Retrovir, the company's Aids treatment. The shares rose 12 to 979p Yesterday was the first day that investment funds which took responsibility for the Wellcome Trust's portfolio on January 1 were able to deal. The portfolio has been spread among blue chip stocks following the Trust's massive sale of Wellcome shares during the summer. There was talk among market traders and professionals that one of the funds had adjusted its share of the portfolio and that the movement of two large buy programmes through the market was responsible for turning the FT-SE 100 index around. Dealers said UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was consistently on the bid. Phillips &amp; Drew Fund management is one of the portfolio handlers appointed in October. Wellcome sources said it was too early for any significant position-taking and most of the money raised by the flotation had been invested in equities before Black Wednesday on September 16. Owners Abroad strong Market hints that a predator may be about to pounce on Owners Abroad, the package tours holiday group, before Owners' shareholders vote at this Friday's extraordinary general meeting, saw the company's shares outpace a very firm leisure sector. At the close, Owners Abroad were 11 higher at 107 1/2 p after some aggressive buying interest which boosted turnover in the stock to an unusually busy 3.8m shares. Owners has been surrounded by takeover bid stories since the middle of last year, with Airtours, another of the most powerful tour operators in the UK, favourites to launch an offer. The speculation diminished, however, when LTU, the German company which controls the Thomas Cook travel group, said it would take a 10.3 per cent stake in Owners. Although specialists expect Owners' shareholders to approve LTU's acquisition of shares, there could be a surprisingly high level of opposition to the move. Airtours is thought to have made a tentative approach to Owners Abroad last year. Airtours shares also made strong progress yesterday, helped by reports of strong summer holiday sales, closing 13 higher at 420p ex-dividend. Glaxo active Shares in pharmaceuticals group Glaxo reversed earlier weakness on news that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved the company's Zofran drug in oral form. The FDA gave permission for Glaxo to market the oral form of Zofran, which prevents nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. The injectable version has been available in the US since February 1991. The shares were lower in morning trade as US house Goldman Sachs said the recent rush of FDA approvals, which prompted a rise in share prices, provided a profit-taking opportunity in the sector. Goldman said several UK drug companies are on overvalued ratings and will see pressure in coming months from news on drug pricing in Europe, as well as a shift into 'better perceived investment opportunities elsewhere in the economy'. Glaxo closed 6 higher at 799p on active turnover of 3.2m shares. News that Budgens, the supermarkets group, had appointed Morgan Grenfell as its merchant bank, replacing Lloyds Merchant Bank, was the trigger for a burst of takeover speculation in the food retailer's shares. Dealers said there were suggestions around the market that Sir Ron Brierley may be about to put his near 27 per cent stake in Budgens up for sale and that a European predator was about to move in to buy the stake and launch a full takeover bid. Budgens shares rose strongly to close a net 5 higher at 44p; at the beginning of December they were changing hands at 33p. TSB was among the least impressive of the banks, the shares settling only 2 1/2 firmer at 155p after BIFU, the banking and insurance industry union, ordered a one-day strike for Friday in protest at job losses at the bank. Insurance brokers performed well, reflecting the strength of the dollar. Sedgwick added 9 at 177p and Willis Corroon 3 at 192p. The oil majors suffered from intermittent bouts of selling from New York. BP eased 2 1/2 to 246p and Shell 4 1/2 to 558p. Lasmo, however, responded to buy recommendations in the weekend press, racing up 9 to 167p. Dealers adopted a much more relaxed view of the price initiative instigated last week by J. Sainsbury. But a general view was that the big retailers would probably indulge in a traditional bout of selective price cuts which would have only limited impact on profits. Sainsbury shares rallied 10 to 574p on relatively thin turnover of 3m, while Tesco picked up 7 to 256p after a hefty 10m shares changed hands. Asda was a strong market and finally 3 1/2 higher at 59 1/2 p on 9.9m traded. Kwik Save was keenly bought and 5 up at 778p, with some retailing specialists confident that Thursday's annual meeting could bring good news on trading. Reports of buoyant holiday sales and the prospect of increased spending as consumers react to lower mortgage costs was put forward as boosting the whole of the leisure sector. First Leisure, the largest pure leisure company in the UK, advanced 13 to 351p with dealers said to be anticipating good results when the company announces preliminary figures a week tomorrow. Rank Organisation, set to report finals the following day, also made good progress, moving up 10 to 698p. P &amp; 0 climbed 15 1/2 to 520p after its ferries subsidiary said it was closing the service between Dover and Boulogne to concentrate on the shorter Dover-Calais route. Analysts said the move showed the group was addressing problems on the cross-Channel routes which would now be more competitive against the Channel tunnel. News and information organisation Reuters saw its shares perform well with the help of an upgrade by US house Merrill Lynch. Merrill changed its recommendation on the stock to a strong buy from a buy and raised its 1993 profit forecast. The stock was principally boosted by buying from the US and closed 22 higher at 1430p. ICI improved 11 to 1070p after the pharmaceuticals and chemicals giant said it had completed the internal split, or hive-down, of the group into two separate organisations on January 1, as scheduled. Hive-down is the first step towards the planned demerger of Zeneca, the biosciences part of ICI, and ICI Plc, which will retain the chemicals rump of the existing group. The ICI board will consider full demerger in February in the light of prevailing economic and market conditions. Long-standing takeover speculation continued to drive a number of the building industry stocks higher. Blue Circle moved forward 12 to 211p, Pilkington 3 to 104p and Tarmac 3 to 106p. The last-named was also boosted by news of asset sales totalling Pounds 13m. Redland received a strong lift from news of disposals worth some Pounds 100m and the shares gained 16 to 423p. Defence group British Aerospace was one of the strongest performers in the market. The shares jumped 10 to 175p after a Sunday newspaper prediction that the company would make profits of at least Pounds 100m in 1993. BAe was also included in a list of 10 companies tipped by London investment firms as likely targets for takeover bids in the coming year. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (225).

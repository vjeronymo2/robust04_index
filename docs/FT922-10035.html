			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Collecting: Colnaghi returns to its Gallic roots - A new venture by the famous fine art dealer NEXT WEEK, ten years after opening its New York operation, the London fine art dealer Colnaghi is opening premises in Paris in an effort to prise apart the strangely undeveloped French market in Old Master paintings. The company, starting off in a small ground floor and basement room next door to the Hotel Bristol, is in the middle of the Rue du Faubourg Saint Honore and could not be better placed. The street may have nothing like the concentration of picture dealers found near London's Old Bond Street but Colnaghi is next door to leading furniture dealers Didier Aaron and Jean-Marie Rossi, within a few yards of the offices of Sotheby's and Phillip's, and within walking distance of Christie's. Italian emigre Paul Colnaghi founded his firm 200 years ago  - a few hundred yards due east on the same street, as it happens - selling scientific instruments and books in a shop called the 'Cabinet de Physique Experimentale'. The French Revolution forced him to move to London. The director of the new gallery is Hungarian-born Christof Lazar, who worked as an investment and merchant banker before becoming the only non-Briton to join Colnaghi, nearly three years ago. Since then he has worked out of his flat next to the Bristol, testing the French market to see if it was suitable. When the Faubourg Saint Honore premises became vacant, Colnaghi seized the opportunity. 'The fact we are opening does not mean the market is good. It's an experiment to begin with. We are starting it in a modest way and will go on to set up as a French company if it proves worthwhile. I'm not so sure we would have looked for a place on somewhere like Quai Voltaire, for example. But we would have been mad not to take these premises,' Lazar said. In this minimum-cost operation, Lazar will have only one French employee working with him. He will have to consult the Colnaghi Library in New York and all restoration and framing will be carried out in the firm's workshops in New York and London. Lazar will look after a modest stock of 30 paintings in the ground floor room and a dozen or so drawings in the basement. Although French collectors buy mainly French works, Colnaghi's choice will mirror the range it sells elsewhere and comprises only about one third of French artists along with more difficult to sell Italian and religious subjects. Lazar says he intends to get into the French market by getting French clients to know Colnaghi better, while also exploring both the Latin American clientele that passes through Paris, and Europeans. Despite all its high-powered dealers in furniture and art objects, Paris has never had Old Master galleries as important as Colnaghi. Galerie Marcus, established in 1937 near the Drouot salerooms, has a large stock of charming but not quite top quality 17th to 18th century works, much appreciated by private collectors and museum curators, Other, formerly very active, family firms like North European specialists Leegenhouek on the Quai Voltaire and French 18th century dealers Galerie Cailleux, however, have been hit hard in their ability to buy at the high prices Old Masters command on the international market. Unlike London or New York, Paris has no organised auction season of Old Master paintings and dealers themselves are inconveniently scattered around town. But the city has potential. Eric Turquin, who has worked as an auction house expert in Old Master paintings in Paris, set up his own gallery in 1989. Bruno Meissner, the highly reputed Old Masters dealer from Zurich, opened a showroom in the city in autumn 1990, when Dutch-born Bob Haboldt, a former director of Colnaghi New York, also chose to set up an independent business on the Fauborg Saint Honore. 'I was looking for a central base in Europe with easy access to countries which have clients, rather than be isolated in London. To run a successful Old Masters business nowadays you need to be able to buy as well as sell and France remains one of the great sources for paintings. A lot of material in the UK is very well known, especially to the auctioneers, who generally get in there first. But here there are unknown works in people's sitting rooms, misattributed or not attributed at all,' Haboldt said. Lazar senses similar opportunities. 'We hope to find paintings privately and not just go through auction houses. A lot of great pictures have come from France and you still have people here who are unaware they have something of great value on their walls. And you can make more discoveries in Drouot salerooms than you ever could at Sotheby's or Christie's. In the meantime, we are getting warm support from competitors, who are very happy to see an old-established firm with an international reputation coming to Paris.'</p>

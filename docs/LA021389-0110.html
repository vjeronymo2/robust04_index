			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART / CATHY CURTIS;  </P> <P> JEAN COCTEAU CENTENARY FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> JEAN COCTEAU COLLECTION AT UC IRVINE REVEALS A LIVELY BUT DISTINCTLY MINOR  TALENT  </P> <P> "Fame is the consequence of a misunderstanding. It is like the crowd which  gathers around the scene of an accident.... A few people stop and wonder what  is happening. Others imitate them, question them. Then comes the crowd, which  no longer sees anything.... Since everyone invents the accident, no one knows  what has happened. Gradually the accident is distorted...."  </P> <P>  The 62-year-old Jean Cocteau made this observation in his diary on Feb. 3,  1952, when he was (as usual) feeling persecuted by his critics. Poet,  playwright, ballet librettist and stage designer, film maker, novelist,  essayist, poster and stained-glass designer, illustrator, painter -- Cocteau  was an aesthetic honeybee, buzzing between each of the arts to create a  rarefied nectar of his own.  </P> <P> A look at his visual art -- a portion of which is on view at the UC Irvine Fine  Arts Gallery (through Sunday) in a Cocteau Centenary show drawn from the  collection of Irvine's Severin Wunderman Museum -- reveals a lively but  distinctly minor talent. Despite the mighty trumpetings of the Wunderman  Museum, any cult fame that may cling to Cocteau purely on account of his art is  indeed "the consequence of a misunderstanding."  </P> <P> It seems perfectly in character that by far his best works were the caricatures  he dashed off as a young man. Cocteau's witty sensibility was equipped with a  radar for seeking out gifted kindred spirits, and his drawings reflect the  circles in which he traveled. But, as is so often true of such highly refined  sensibilities, he blossomed early and became impotently repetitious and  derivative with age.  </P> <P> One of the earliest (1909) of his quickie portraits in the exhibit is of Sarah  Bernhardt at 65. The 20-year-old Cocteau -- who would always prefer profile  views -- mercilessly notes the famous actress's double chin as well as her  famous pompadour of frizzed hair and the rings on each of her fingers.  </P> <P> Cocteau drew the violinist and composer Niccolo Paganini as an attenuated  skeleton; the French composer Georges Auric, with a huge chin, wearing a bowler  hat and toting an umbrella like an Englishman; the painter and stage designer  Leon Bakst as a big-beaked bird wearing eyeglasses.  </P> <P> In one sketch, the imposing bulk of Ballets Russes impresario Serge Diaghilev  dwarfs dancer Vaslav Nijinsky, devastatingly caricatured as a puppet by means  of three well-placed vertical lines.  </P> <P> A few quick lines give us pianist Artur Rubinstein's self-satisfied smirk,  proud nose and puffed-out chest. A more elaborate drawing shows composer Igor  Stravinsky with a zombie-like mask-face, his long fingers tensely holding his  place in a book. Cocteau's notes on the paper explain that he is visiting the  house of Coco Chanel (the couturiere) and she is singing badly in the next  room.  </P> <P> There are a few other works of interest.  </P> <P> One is the poster Cocteau designed for the 1911 Ballets Russes production of  "Le Spectre de la Rose," with the strong image of ballerina Tamara Karsavina's  full skirt billowing backward. Another is the intriguingly conceptual drawing,  "Le Sens du Futur" (the direction of the future) from 1929, which -- with its  image of an antique sculpture bust holding a pair of disembodied legs --  suggests the sense of despair that haunted Cocteau in the year his opium  addiction bottomed out and Diaghilev died, dissolving the Ballets Russes.  </P> <P> Cocteau's imaginative resources also lent themselves to the design of a  tapestry (realized in infinitesimal detail by a French atelier in 1948). The  subject is Judith carrying the head of Holophernes, a biblical theme that takes  on something of the hallucinatory quality of Cocteau's films.  </P> <P> As he wrote about the scene in his diary, "Like a Jewish ghost (Judith) passes  through the groups of guards, who are sleeping in the moonlight. On the upper  right her servant, like some sort of insect, casts a last glance into the room  where the beheading took place."  </P> <P> But despite his complex work for stage and film based on the myths and  literature of ancient Greece, his efforts at creating Neoclassical motifs in  paint and pastel from the 1950s tend to come across as facile, repetitive  doodles of pretty boys, derivative of Picasso's mythological lithographs but  lacking their sting and panache.  </P> <P> "Visage Grec Ancien" (face of an ancient Greek) is little more than a  large-scale version of Cocteau's standard idealized male facial type, done in  oil paint on canvas instead of pen on paper. In "Femme Endormie" (sleeping  woman), blocks of color create the contours of a face -- a tired, watered-down  interpretation of Cubist and Fauve techniques already decades old. The two  versions of "The Lovers" -- big, schematic heads absorbed in the activity of  French-kissing -- are simply embarrassing.  </P> <P> Cocteau leans heavily on Picasso in "Madame Favini and her Daughter," a  caricature in paint based on the bored women and fractious children Cocteau  encountered in the drawing rooms of the wealthy. Outfitted in a huge-collared  dress decorated with little doodles (decoratively gouged out of the paint), the  lady reclines dreamily while her offspring amuses herself with a Flit insect  exterminator. A humdrum seascape hanging on the wall satirizes the fictional  Mme. Favini's aesthetic taste.  </P> <P> Granted the charm of his small-scale work, Cocteau seems to have lacked the  creative independence -- as well as the technical gifts -- necessary to create  major works of art. His more ambitious attempts are overly precious and  superficial, like intimate jokes never meant to extend beyond his circle of  intimates.  </P> <P> The Severin Wunderman Museum, which is dedicated to Cocteau's work, takes its  name from the chairman of the board of Severin Montres Ltd., a manufacturer and  distributor of Gucci watches in whose offices the museum is located. In fact,  Wunderman has seen fit to reproduce (as promotional materials describe it)  "Cocteau's legendary Orpheus" -- a profile of the Greek god and a minimal  sketch of his lyre -- on the faces of a line of pricey watches and clocks.  </P> <P> But then again, perhaps that's the way Cocteau's supreme style-consciousness is  best marketed to the style-conscious '80s: as something expensive, vaguely  "cultural" and just begging for the kind of mindless gushing to which the  social-column set are prone.  </P> <P>  Work by Cocteau from the Severin Wunderman Museum will be shown at the UC  Irvine Fine Arts Gallery through Feb. 19 in conjunction with the Jean Cocteau  Centenary Festival. Gallery hours are noon to 5 p.m. Admission is free.  Information: (714) 856-6610.  </P> <P> </P></p>

Contingent Value Rights <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> CVRs are unsecured obligations providing for a possible cash payment at maturity based on the value of an equity security issued by an affiliate of the issuer of the CVRs (``related security''). The holder of a CVR would be entitled to a cash payment at maturity if the market price of the related security is lower than a predetermined target price. If the market price of the related security equals or exceeds the target price, the holder of the CVR would not be entitled to receive such a cash payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under proposed Rule 31.5.H, a CVR would be eligible for listing by the CBOE if: (1) The issuer satisfies the net worth and earnings requirements set forth in Exchange Rule 31.5.A; <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  (2) the issuer has assets in excess of $100 million; (3) there is a minimum public distribution of one million CVRs; (4) there are at least 400 public holders of the CVRs; (5) the aggregate market value of the CVRs is at least $4 million; and (6) the CVRs have an original term to maturity of at least one year. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7&blank;specifically, an issuer must have: (1) Total assets (including the value of patents, copyrights, and trademarks but excluding the value of goodwill) less total liabilities of at least $4 million; and (2) pre-tax income of at least $750,000 in its last fiscal year, or in two of its last three fiscal years and net income of at least $400,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because CVRs are linked to another security, the Exchange has proposed safeguards that are designed to meet the investor protection concerns raised by the trading of CVRs. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  First, pursuant to CBOE Rule 30.50(c), the Exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating to every customer prior to trading CVRs. Second, consistent with CBOE Rule 30.50(c), the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically approve a customer's account for trading CVRs prior to, or promptly after, the completion of the transaction. Third, prior to the commencement of trading of CVRs, the Exchange will distribute a circular to the membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations and account approval) when handling transactions in CVRs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Equity-Linked Term Notes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange is also proposing to add Rule 31.5.I to its rules to establish specific listing criteria for ELNs. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  ELNs are intermediate-term, hybrid instruments whose value will be linked to the performance of a highly-capitalized, actively traded common stock, non-convertible preferred stock, or sponsored American Depositary Receipt (``ADR''). <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10&blank;The CBOE notes that the Commission has previously approved the listing of ELNs by the NYSE and the Amex. The CBOE states that with two exceptions, as discussed herein, the CBOE's proposed standards are virtually identical to the NYSE's and Amex's listing standards for ELNs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32343 (May 20, 1993). 58 FR 30833 (May 27, 1933) (order originally approving the listing of ELNs by the Amex); 33328 (December 13, 1993), 58 FR 66041 (December 17, 1993) (order approving revised market capitalization and trading volume requirements for the listing of ELNs by the Amex); 33468 (January 13, 1994), 59 FR 3387 (January 21, 1994) (order originally approving the listing of ELNs by the NYSE); 33841 (March 31, 1994), 59 FR 16671 (April 7, 1994) (order approving revised market capitalization and trading volume requirements for the listing of ELNs by the NYSE); 34545 (August 18, 1994), 59 FR 43877 (August 25, 1994) (order approving the listing of ELNs by the NYSE linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34545''); and 34549 (August 18, 1994), 59 FR 43873 (August 25, 1994) (order approving the listing of ELNs by the Amex linked to securities issued by non-U.S. companies) (``Exchange Act Release No. 34549'') (collectively, ``Equity-Linked Note Approval Orders''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

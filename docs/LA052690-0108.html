			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER NAZI QUITS AS W. GERMAN PARTY LEADER, BLAMING EXTREMISTS  </P> <P> Franz Schoenhuber, the ex-Nazi Waffen SS soldier whose ultra-rightist  Republicans became the shooting star of West German politics, quit as party  leader Friday, complaining that extremists have taken over.  </P> <P> Mainstream politicians in Bonn said his decision marks the near-certain demise  of one of Europe's most controversial political parties, which went from a  mushrooming political force to a fringe group in disarray.  </P> <P> Otto Lambsdorff, head of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior coalition partners,  the Free Democrats, said Friday, "The remains . . . of this party will soon  scatter themselves into the wind."  </P> <P> The Republicans' main office in Munich said Schoenhuber's former deputy,  Johanna Grund, 56, would replace him until a new chairperson is elected.  </P> <P> Schoenhuber, 66, said that a "small clique of extremist functionaries" existed  at top party levels and that he is quitting because he feels unable to oppose  them.  </P> <P> In recent state elections, the Republicans mustered less than 2% of the vote.  They slipped badly in national polls -- far below the 5% needed to gain seats  in the federal Parliament in Dec. 2 elections.  </P> <P> Schoenhuber told reporters in Munich that he would try to create a new  leadership to challenge his successor, but Republican officials said efforts  were already under way among the leadership to oust him from the party.  </P></p>

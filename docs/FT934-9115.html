			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Argentina to sign N-treaty ARGENTINA's congress has finally ratified the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty banning nuclear weapons from Latin America, breaking with its previous conviction that the treaty discriminated against developing countries' nuclear programmes. The ratification, on Wednesday night, is part of Argentina's wider, pro-western foreign policy strategy. At US insistence, it scrapped its Condor II missile project in 1991, considered a proliferation threat, and has applied to join the Missile Technology Control Regime. Argentina and Brazil had attempted to develop independent nuclear weapon capabilities in the 1960s and 1970s, when both countries were ruled by military governments. However, technical and financial limitations aborted the programmes. They were formally scrapped with the return to civilian rule in the early 1980s. In November 1990 Argentina and Brazil agreed to bilateral procedures for accounting for nuclear materials and inspections of each other's installations, in addition to safeguards by the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency. They agreed to ratify Tlatelolco after its inspection clauses were modified to protect industrial secrets. The Foreign Ministry says Argentina also plans to sign the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty, which controls nuclear materials at world levels. Like Tlatelolco, successive civilian and military governments once considered the NPT a discriminatory imposition of rich countries. Argentina has two small nuclear power stations and a struggling civilian nuclear industry. The government plans to privatise the Atucha I and Embalse power stations as well as the Atucha II unit once construction is complete.</p>

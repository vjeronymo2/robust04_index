			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 27 April that the ROK Government  is seeking to sign a "ROK-Russian defense-industry technological  cooperation agreement" (provisional title), which details  bilateral cooperation necessary for the ROK to introduce defense  industry equipment and technology.    It was also learned that the Foreign and Defense Ministries  and other pertinent offices had been closely negotiating with  Russia so President Kim Yong-sam can sign this agreement when he  visits Russia in early June.    Therefore, ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, who will be  arriving in Russia on 28 April, will hold talks with the Russian  defense minister to extensively discuss the revision of the  "Memorandum of Understanding on Military Exchange" and the  signing of the defense industry technological cooperation  agreement.    A ROK foreign minister official said: "Russia's defense  industry is different from ours in terms of systems and  technology. Therefore, it is difficult for us to directly  introduce some Russian equipment and technology." He also said:  "The scientific and technological level of the Russian defense  industry is as high as that of the U.S. defense industry.  Therefore, the Russian defense industry will be very valuable  to us in the long run because it will contribute to developing  our defense industry and transferring its technology to private  industries in the ROK."    This official also said: "If the ROK and Russia promote  technological cooperation in earnest in the defense industry,  the ROK's practice of introducing military technology mainly  from the United States will change."    Meanwhile, the ROK Government is reportedly examining the  possibility of paying royalties for Russian technology by  exempting Russia from repaying some of the principal and  interest on our economic assistance loans, which Russia has so  far failed to repay.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / More user-friendly EC is the aim of Sutherland report THE European Community must strengthen the rights of the consumer, streamline its laws, and make its decision-making more open to the public if the single market is to be a success, according to a report requested by the European Commission. The long-awaited Sutherland report also calls for an ombudsman at EC level or in each member state, possible compulsory courses in EC law for judges, and an effort to allow individuals to seek redress in foreign courts in certain single market disputes. The Sutherland report - named after Mr Peter Sutherland, the former EC competition commissioner, who chaired the study - is a comprehensive investigation into how to make the single market fair, efficient and user-friendly when it comes into force on January 1, 1993. It will be presented to internal market ministers on November 10. It seeks to balance member states' fears about an allegedly overbearing Brussels bureaucracy and the need for effective policing of the single market to ensure that it works. Among the report's most important recommendations to avoid fragmentation of the single market is a 'deeper partnership' between the Commission and member states, mainly through officials working on an informal basis. Despite some fears in Brussels that this might lead to unsatisfactory trade-offs between countries, the committee believes that this balance is the best practical application of 'subsidiarity'. Other recommendations are: Consultation at 'the earliest possible stage' by the Commission before it proposes legislation. Systematic consolidation of EC law and creation of a legislative co-ordination unit inside the Commission to prevent unnecessary overlap. Provision by states and Brussels of informal advice on redress for breaches of EC law to those requesting it. The rejection, at this stage, of a central clearing house to collect data on infringements of the single market. A new communications strategy to sell the single market's benefits. The report notes that the EC has singularly failed in its efforts to promote the Maastricht treaty.</p>

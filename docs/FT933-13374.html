			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Licence granted for waste plant RECHEM International, the waste management group, yesterday received a licence to keep operating its plant at Pontypool, Gwent, under new environmental regulations, but was told to improve monitoring of toxic emissions. The Pollution Inspectorate gave the plant, including a proposed new incinerator, authorisation under the Integrated Pollution Control provisions of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, which are coming into force in stages. But following a recent Welsh Office report on levels of toxic PCB and dioxin chemicals around the plant, Rechem has been told to make 'wide- ranging' improvements, mainly in the next six months. These include more analysis of emissions from the stacks, environmental monitoring near the plant, and an assessment of on-site levels of PCBs and dioxins in the air and soil.</p>

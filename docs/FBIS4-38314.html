			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has emphasized  that the security situation in Jordan is very good, and said  there is not even one political prisoner.    In a news conference at the Interior Ministry today, the  interior minister added that the allegations that prisons are  full of detainees are baseless. Only those who committed  criminal actions are in prison, and no prisoner is detained  without a decision by the general prosecutor.    He said public liberties in Jordan are preserved in a  democratic atmosphere that is unique in the region.    Hammad said that detention measures, including those who  committed the crimes of explosions in public places, have been  carried out in accordance with the law and within the framework  of legal procedures.

			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUTH REICHL'S TOP 40 RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> EVERY TIME I FINISH WRITING A REVIEW OF A REALLY WONDERFUL RESTAURANT, I AM  OVERwhelmed by a pair of conflicting emotions. The first is enormous excitement  over a great discovery. The second is enormous sadness that I won't be going  there again.  </P> <P> Restaurant critics must move on. While you're dining at the latest discovery,  I'm eating at the next new place. There aren't enough nights in the week -- or  enough dollars in the expense account -- to allow me the luxury of going back  to eat in a restaurant simply for the fun of it.  </P> <P> That's why this assignment was such a pleasure. When I was asked to pick the  Top 40 restaurants in the region, I immediately wrote a list of places I was  eager to revisit. I came up with almost 100 restaurants, and during the past  four months I ate in all of them.  </P> <P> I had a terrific time. I also had some disappointing evenings. At dinner in one  of Los Angeles' most revered restaurants, the waiter arrived at the table only  to ask who got the chicken. This might not ordinarily offend me, but since the  chicken in question cost $28, I thought he should know. Other lapses in service  convinced me that, although the restaurant was good, it was not good enough.  Another high-priced place had wonderful service but food so dull that had I  been asked to spend my own money on the meal, I would have been incensed. I  thought you would be, too; I left it off the final list (which is in no  particular order).  </P> <P> Also missing are some of the amazing places that have opened during the past  few months. If the restaurant wasn't open when I began my research, it wasn't  eligible for the Top 40.  </P> <P> The Top 40 are special-occasion places. Most people can't afford to eat in them  very often; I can't either. If you want to know where to find me most days,  look at the recommendations that appear in the margins. These are the  restaurants I go to again and again. As far as I'm concerned, it is the  abundance of great, inexpensive ethnic restaurants that makes living in Los  Angeles so exciting.  </P> <P> Finally, if you find yourself convinced that I've missed a truly great  restaurant, please drop me a card. I'm always ready to eat -- even if it's only  my own words.  </P> <P> CITRUS  </P> <P> If you asked me where I want to eat, right this minute, I'd probably say  Citrus.  </P> <P> This is a restaurant with soul, because chef-owner Michel Richard truly loves  his work. No chef enters a kitchen with greater joy -- and few chefs send such  consistently satisfying food out of it.  </P> <P> Richard's technique is French, but his years in Los Angeles show. This is light  food with a sense of humor. Shrimp might come wrapped in strands of potato and  deep-fried. Scallops float in a bit of stock with a banner of pink pasta  floating across the top. Whitefish lounges on a bed of mashed potatoes wearing  a sauce of chicken and shallots. Richard's years as the city's premier pastry  chef show, too. Nobody makes more beautiful food.  </P> <P> Can't decide what to eat? Don't despair. Simply ask the chef to make a meal and  then sit back and wait for the fireworks.  </P> <P> Are there problems with the restaurant? Of course. You may be kept waiting at  the door. This casual room can become uncomfortably crowded, and the covered  patio tends to be too hot or too cold. The chairs could be more comfortable.  Still, it's hard to get grumpy when you can look up and watch Richard running  around in his glass-enclosed kitchen having such a wonderful time.  </P> <P>  6703 Melrose Ave.; (213) 857-0034. Entrees from $21 to $26.  </P> <P> VALENTINO  </P> <P> Many years ago, I went to lunch at Valentino and stayed for dinner. It's that  kind of restaurant -- a place for languorous meals, lots of wine and romance.  But afterward, when I told people how wonderful the restaurant was, they'd look  at me knowingly and say, "But Piero Selvaggio knows you." And of course he  does.  </P> <P> So I sent a secretary in for dinner and waited to see what would happen. Her  report? "I've never had a better meal -- or felt so well taken care of. Piero  came up and asked us if we would like him to make a meal for us. He talked  about what was in the kitchen, and together we devised a menu for the evening.  It was heavenly; we started with little deep-fried cheese-stuffed zucchini  blossoms, went on to deep-black squid risotto and then had loin of beef in  balsamic vinegar. I asked him to choose the wines as well -- and they were  fabulous. He made me feel like I was someone: I'm saving my pennies for the  next meal there."  </P> <P> And so am I. I go for the fried squid and ricotta fritters, the risotto (any  risotto), the sweetbreads and mushrooms in Cabernet. I go for the pasta. I go  for the wine (the wine list is L.A.'s biggest, and probably its best). In a  town of few elegant, upscale, good restaurants, Valentino stands out. The  restaurant was remodeled a couple of years ago, and now the city's best Italian  food has a room that is worthy of it.  </P> <P>  3115 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica; (213) 829-4313. Entrees from $17.50 to $26.  </P> <P> KATSU  </P> <P> When I first discovered sushi, eating it seemed like an amazingly mysterious  ritual. The initiation rites included memorizing the names of the fish in  Japanese, bribing the sushi chefs with big tips so they'd remember me on  subsequent visits and ostentatiously demonstrating that I knew that the fish  was supposed to be dipped into the soy sauce, not the rice. The other part of  the ritual was learning not to jump when the sushi chefs shouted vociferous  hellos.  </P> <P> But one sushi bar was different. It was a quiet, beautiful room where the walls  held the sort of art that makes you think (a Barofsky, a Mark Lere), and the  sushi was served on trendy, handmade plates. And it was a place that  demystified the process of eating sushi; behind the bar they spoke English, and  at the table the waiter simply handed you a list of what was available and you  checked off the fish you wanted to eat.  </P> <P> There was one other thing that impressed me about this particular sushi bar.  The sushi looked more beautiful than it did in other places, artfully arranged  on those spectacular plates. And it tasted better, too; you always knew that  everything you ate at Katsu would be wonderful.  </P> <P> After all these years, you still do.  </P> <P>  1972 N. Hillhurst Ave.; (213) 665-1891. Entrees from $7.50 to $16; sushi from  $2.75 to $10.  </P> <P> CITY  </P> <P> When I met Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger 10 years ago, they were cooking  in a kitchen so small that it could barely contain them both at the same time.  They didn't mind: They were so excited by cooking that they acted as if the  City Cafe was the most wonderful restaurant in the world.  </P> <P> Now they've got an empire -- City Cafe became the Border Grill, they opened  City restaurant and now there's a new Border Grill in Santa Monica -- but they  still work with the same exuberance. Cooking is their passion.  </P> <P> City is young, hip, spare, cool -- a huge barn of a room with the most  eclectic, eccentric menu of any Los Angeles institution. The chefs are  impeccably trained in French cooking, but they are equally interested in the  cuisines of other countries: Susan goes to India every year to cook in a small  village, and Mary Sue has cooked in Thailand. Together they spend time in  Mexico researching food.  </P> <P> Unlike other chefs, however, they feel no need to put their own stamp on the  dishes. Their Indian food -- great tandoori meats and breads, wonderful little  fried appetizers -- are unadulterated. Their Thai melon salad is like a taste  of Thailand. They make wonderful Korean ribs, great American hamburgers, a  delicious reinvented beef Stroganoff. Their menu also has Greek touches  (peppers with feta cheese), Japanese touches (sashimi) and an occasional  Italian accent (terrific gnocchi). The desserts, however, are pure Americana:  They even make their own version of Hostess cupcakes.  </P> <P>  180 S. La Brea Ave.; (213) 938-2155. Entrees from $16.50 to $23.  </P> <P> MANDARIN  </P> <P> Cecilia Chiang, who started the first Mandarin in San Francisco in 1961 and  opened the second in Beverly Hills in 1975, is a force of nature. During the  1949 revolution, she walked out of China with gold sewn into the hems of her  dresses. On a return trip a few years ago, she managed to drink 32 shots of  cognac at one banquet without showing the slightest effect. She is one of those  women who always looks gorgeous, says the right thing and seems to be having a  better time than anybody else in the room. It is no wonder that her restaurants  -- the first in California to serve Northern-style Chinese cooking -- for years  have been the best places to eat Chinese food outside of Chinatown.  </P> <P> But last year Mrs. Chiang sold the Beverly Hills Mandarin to her son. To  everyone's surprise, the restaurant actually improved. Philip Chiang injected  energy into the restaurant, updating the room so that it is still elegant but  now seems younger. He changed the menu, too, adding all sorts of wonderful  little tidbits -- steamed dumplings, fried-onion pancakes, crepes wrapped  around a chicken-and-vegetable mixture, glazed walnuts. You can nibble these  little dishes at your leisure, then go on to superb Peking duck, an unusual  braised lamb on a bed of spinach or whole steamed fish. And if you like, you  can drink well while you eat; this is one of the few Chinese restaurants around  that actually pays attention to the wine list.  </P> <P> 430 N. Camden Drive, Beverly Hills; 272-0267. Entrees from$6 to $34.  </P> <P> CELESTINO  </P> <P> Of all the little Italian restaurants in town, this is the one that most makes  me feel that I'm eating in Italy. Locanda Veneta is like a Hollywood dream of a  cozy trattoria. Angeli is a bit too hip, Pazzia a tad too fancy. But bright  little Celestino, with its table of desserts plunked in the middle of the room  and its waiters with their charming accents, makes you start looking for lira  to pay the valet.  </P> <P> The food doesn't do anything to dispel this illusion. I think the restaurant's  two strengths are the rustic dishes -- such as malloreddus with sausage, tomato  and pecorino cheese and a wonderful roasted rabbit in black olive sauce -- and  its way with fish. Spaghetti with bottarga (a sort of dried caviar) is exotic;  the restaurant's most famous dish is seafood cooked in a huge balloon of foil,  and they work wonders when they simply throw a piece of fish on the grill.  </P> <P> Desserts here are forgettable, but that's true to form: When was the last time  you got a great dessert (other than fruit and cheese) in a small Italian  trattoria?  </P> <P> 236 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills; (213) 859-8601. Entrees from $17 to $21.  </P> <P> CHAYA BRASSERIE  </P> <P> Chaya's so hip that I never expect the personnel to be nice to me. The  surprising thing is, they always are.  </P> <P> Why go to Chaya? Because it is among the prettiest rooms in town, an improbable  cross between a traditional Japanese inn, a French bistro and a New York  singles bar. And because of the buzz that settles just beneath those high  ceilings. At lunchtime, this is echt Hollywood -- the seats filled with agents  and actors looking around to see who's there to see them. The same people show  up for dinner, but they're harder to spot because at night they blend into a  crowd of foodies, businessmen and tourists.  </P> <P> And finally, you go because this is the city's most original blend of French,  Italian and Japanese food. You can start with sashimi or seaweed salad, go on  to escargots a la bourguignon, follow it up with fettuccine and have steak for  a finale. Wash it down with a bottle from a truly exciting wine list (it's not  big, but everything on it is good). And walk out the door with an understanding  of what new Pacific cooking is all about.  </P> <P>  8741 Alden Drive; (213) 859-8833. Entrees from $9.50 to $30.  </P> <P> REBECCA'S  </P> <P> This restaurant drives me crazy. I think it's the loudest room in town -- the  sound assaults you; it can actually be a relief to walk out the door. And  getting in the door isn't easy; you almost always find yourself standing around  waiting for a table or trying to squeeze into a place at the bar. I am usually  in a rage by the time I get a seat.  </P> <P> And then I calm down: The food is worth the wait. The kitchen does almost  everything right: It creates fresh seafood cocktails from just-opened shellfish  and fresh juice, serves the lime-sprinkled corn chips hot from the fryer, uses  great ingredients for the steak tostadas, the lobster enchiladas and chicken  chilapitas. The French fries are fabulous, and the flan is a dream. This is  Mexican food at its most uptown -- and it's absolutely terrific.  </P> <P> The architecture is something, too. Designed by Frank Gehry, it's California  goofy, with an alabaster private dining room floating over the bar and huge  crocodiles dangling from the ceiling. Between the food and the room, Rebecca's  is a diner's Disneyland, a roller-coaster ride that leaves you breathless and  happy.  </P> <P> 2025 Pacific Ave., Venice; (213) 306-6266. Entrees from $14 to $22.  </P> <P> SPAGO  </P> <P> The thing to remember about Spago is that it's just a neighborhood restaurant  for stars. While you wait (and you probably will wait), console yourself with  unabashed people watching as the famous are led past you to their tables; and  remind yourself that they are part of the reason you wanted to come here in the  first place.  </P> <P> Once you're finally seated, you'll feel fine. The food is consistently  delicious, the service is good and the place simply rocks with good vibrations.  Wolfgang Puck and Barbara Lazaroff manage to make you feel as if you are in the  midst of a very fun party.  </P> <P> What to eat? Personally, I think the famous designer pizzas are the  least-interesting things on the menu. But Spago does serve the world's best  chopped salad, incredibly good homemade salami and smoked salmon and a  delightful array of pastas. Among the entrees, the Chinese duck is good, the  lamb is wonderful and the roasted salmon with black pepper and Cabernet butter  is a treat. If there are enough of you, ask for a combination plate for  dessert. And don't be embarrassed to ask for a doggy bag; portions are not  small, and even the stars sometimes walk out with leftovers.  </P> <P> 1114 Horn Ave., West Hollywood; (213) 652-4025. Entrees from $19.50 to $26.50.  </P> <P> ST. ESTEPHE  </P> <P> There is not another restaurant in the world quite like St. Estephe. It began  as a very good little French restaurant under the aegis of classically trained  chef John Sedlar. One day, Sedlar decided to go back to his New Mexican roots,  exploring his own heritage of blue corn tortillas, tamales and chile peppers.  He studied the art of his native region as well, turning out plates as lovely  as sand paintings.  </P> <P> When the dishes are successful -- as in carne adobada-stuffed ravioli served in  a cream garlic chevre sauce, blue corn tortillas served with smoked salmon and  American caviar, and lamb with chile, grapefruit zest and yucca root -- this  food is a revelation. (When it is not, it seems downright silly. And some of  the dishes are so small you have trouble finding them on the plate.) Desserts  can be outstanding, too; don't miss Sedlar's version of crepes suzettes, which  uses blue corn crepes and pumpkin ice cream.  </P> <P> The restaurant, in a shopping center, once looked like a typical little French  place. A recent remodeling left it with the clean, easy lines of the Southwest.  If you sit on the adobe patio on a sunny day, it's almost possible to imagine  that you're in New Mexico and that the car revving up in the parking lot on the  other side of the wall is actually a coyote starting to sing.  </P> <P> 2640 N. Sepulveda Blvd., Manhattan Beach; (213) 545-1334. Entrees from $22 to  $29.  </P> <P> CHAMPAGNE  </P> <P> See those people at the table in the corner, eating dinner with their little  boy? It's probably proprietors Patrick and Sophie Healy sitting down to a meal  with their son, Benoit. They almost always seem to be here -- which is one of  the things that gives this restaurant a personal touch.  </P> <P> Patrick Healy is one of the best young chefs in town. Trained in France, he  went to work at L.A.'s Le St. Germain. Two and a half years ago, when he opened  his own restaurant, Healy decided to do things differently. Most chefs go out  and find investors; Healy put his own money where your mouth is. The result is  a kitchen that really cares. And you can taste it.  </P> <P> The menu is divided among rustic French dishes (great cassoulet), contemporary  California fare (crispy Norwegian salmon with leaf spinach and a black  peppercorn sauce) and spa cuisine (the best eggplant soup you've ever eaten --  and only 150 calories). Big eaters will want to try the spectacular prix fixe  menu. It's $68 a person -- and worth it.  </P> <P> When Champagne first opened, the service was shaky and the wine was list a  joke. But now the restaurant is aging well; both have grown up and gotten  respectable.  </P> <P> 10506 Little Santa Monica Blvd.; (213) 470-8446. Entrees from $14.75 to $24.50.  </P> <P> THE GRILL  </P> <P> Ever wonder why there aren't more older waiters in Los Angeles? I do -- every  time I walk into The Grill and find myself being served -- beautifully -- by  men who make waiting tables seem like a profession. They aren't hip, they don't  tell you their names and they don't seem like they're about to rush off for  auditions. They simply serve food with grace and dignity.  </P> <P> That's one of the nice things about The Grill. Consistently fine, no-nonsense  food is another. Eating here is not a great gourmet experience; there's nothing  fancy or frilly about what they serve. But you know that you will always find  great basic American fare: a spectacular Caesar salad, good shrimp Louis, fine  grilled meats and fish, huge baskets of sourdough bread and, at lunchtime, one  of the city's best burgers.  </P> <P> You also know you'll always find an interesting mix of people. It's a power  place: The guys huddled at the next table may be making a movie deal. It's a  celebrity joint, too: You'll almost always see a famous face. But it's also a  genuine family restaurant where you can bring your kid and not be embarrassed  if he starts playing peekaboo with the couple in the booth across the way.  </P> <P> 9560 Dayton Way, Beverly Hills; (213) 276-0615. Entrees from $14.50 to $27.50.  </P> <P> CHINOIS ON MAIN  </P> <P> I have a special relationship with Chinois: While it was being built, I spent  months on the site, writing about what it takes to open a restaurant. I hung  around so much that everybody forgot that I was there. I watched Barbara  Lazaroff charm inspectors, fight with workmen and come close to having a  nervous breakdown when the glass for the bar was cut the wrong way. And I  watched Wolfgang Puck experiment with the menu, creating a new kind of  Chinese-French-California hybrid cuisine.  </P> <P> Opening night was a hectic event: At 6 p.m. the painters were still painting,  the electricians were still working and the cooks were on the verge of  hysteria. At 7 there was still chaos. It seemed almost magical, but it all came  together, and when the first guests walked in, they entered a serene fantasy of  flowers and copper and chinoiserie. And they sat down to eat dishes like  sauteed foie gras on pineapple in cinnamon sauce. They were charmed by duck,  mushrooms and cilantro in Sichuan pancakes and amazed by "sashimi tempura." The  restaurant's opening was an event; the place had an energy about it. To date,  nobody has managed a successful imitation. Chinois is the restaurant that wrote  the book on East-West cuisine.  </P> <P> 2709 Main St., Santa Monica; (213) 392-9025. Entrees from $17.50 to $28.  </P> <P> TULIPE  </P> <P> I wish Tulipe were a little less loud. It would be nice if the tables had a  little more space between them, too. And if the lights were just low enough to  give the room some romance, this would be the perfect little French restaurant.  </P> <P> As it is, it's practically perfect. This is a wonderful modern bistro, serving  true French food at its robust best -- fully flavored, gutsy, fun to eat. It is  French food that, unlike much of what is served in town, has not been  California-ized into something pretty, small and delicate. This is also, it  must be added, French food that you can afford (a couple can easily get out the  door for $50).  </P> <P> My favorite dishes are the ones with the most intense flavors. A tart made of  pears and Roquefort cheese. An occasional special appetizer made of pig's  trotters and snails fashioned into a most elegant little dish (a friend said it  was the best thing she'd ever tasted -- before she found out what it was). A  whole lamb's shank. A pot-au-feu made of pigeon. Striped bass served in a  sliced-potato coat. And be sure not to miss the city's best apple tart.  </P> <P> There's one more wonderful thing about Tulipe: It has one of the nicest little  wine lists in town, filled with interesting, moderately priced wines from small  producers.  </P> <P> Oh, if only the lights were a little bit lower. . . .  </P> <P>  8360 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood; (213) 655-7400. Entrees from $14.50 to $22.  </P> <P> LOCANDA VENETA  </P> <P> My husband tried to bribe me into not writing about Locanda Veneta.  </P> <P> He argued that it was the perfect cozy little Italian restaurant with good food  and reasonable prices that everybody in Los Angeles was dying to discover.  </P> <P> He was right: The only way we've managed to get in since is by reserving a  table weeks in advance.  </P> <P> When we do go, we tend to order the same things. We start with a pile of fried  whitebait with onion marmalade, homemade white cheese with prosciutto or  insalata di radicchio. Then we have a simple pasta -- maybe just spaghetti with  tomato and basil sauce. Occasionally we'll splurge on the Venetian seafood soup  (chef Antonio Tommasi is from the Veneto) or a piece of grilled meat.  </P> <P> And then, when we think about dessert, we look at all the people waiting for  our table (the restaurant is really small) and decide to take pity on them and  leave. Invariably, as we pay the bill, we wonder why more people don't open  restaurants just like this one.  </P> <P> 8638 W. 3rd St. (213) 274-1893; Entrees from $13.95 to $18.  </P> <P> RUTH'S CHRIS STEAKHOUSE  </P> <P> If you're American (and not vegetarian), you probably get a craving for steak  every once in a while.  </P> <P> When I do, this is where I come.  </P> <P> Ruth's Chris (the name, if you need to know, came about when a woman named Ruth  bought the Chris Steak House in New Orleans, added her own name and franchised  the concept) looks the way a steak place should. Dark. Down-to-earth. Serious.  </P> <P> The portions look the way they should, too. They're huge. Especially the  porterhouse, which is big enough to serve 2, 3 or 4. That's the cut to have:  I'm convinced that steak that comes to the table still attached to its bones  tastes best. Besides, there is nothing quite as satisfying as gnawing on a bone  at the end of a meal. Potatoes come in seven varieties, and all of them are  good. So are the onion rings; grown men have been known to squabble over the  last one left on the plate.  </P> <P> The desserts here pay homage to New Orleans: If you are still able to eat when  you come to the end of your steak, order the bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  And then hum a few bars of the "Star Spangled Banner" as you stagger out the  door.  </P> <P>  224 S. Beverly Drive, Beverly Hills; (213) 859-8744. Entrees from $17 to $22.  </P> <P> THE IVY  </P> <P> "I hate the place," said a friend one day. "They're always mean to me. The  food's expensive. And it's not very good."  </P> <P> "Want to have lunch at The Ivy?" I asked the next day.  </P> <P> "What time?" she replied.  </P> <P> The Ivy is the restaurant that everybody loves to hate. My files are groaning  with letters from people complaining about how badly they've been treated and  promising never to again darken the restaurant's door. And I'll bet that every  one of the writers has gone back for more.  </P> <P> There is something seductive about The Ivy. It's cozy and pretty, with the air  of an inn in the south of France. It has a certain buzz, too. And in the end,  the food is really very good. What it serves are new American classics -- great  cracked-crab salad, big plates of pasta, lime-grilled chicken, crab cakes. It's  a simple menu but a satisfying one. And after you've watched your weight and  eaten something clean and fat-free for your main course, you can indulge in one  of the delightful desserts.  </P> <P> They might ask you to hurry up and drink your coffee (they've done it to me).  You'll be momentarily annoyed. But you'll be back.  </P> <P> 113 N. Robertson Blvd.; (213) 274-8303. Entrees from $19.75 to $27.75.  </P> <P> PATINA  </P> <P> Of all the restaurants in Los Angeles, Patina is the one that would be least  embarrassed if it woke up one morning and found itself in France. It is,  despite its white walls, modern sconces and cool contemporary airs, an  exceedingly proper restaurant.  </P> <P> You sense this immediately; the service is absolutely comme il faut. Is your  ice melting in your ice tea? The waiter will wordlessly replace it. Do you need  more bread? Here's the busboy at your elbow. The glasses are so thin they seem  to float into your hands, and the plates were made just for these tables. The  cutlery is heavy, the napkins are, too, and the single stem on your table is  absolutely elegant.  </P> <P> As is the food: Joachim Splichal and his wife, Christine, have created a  perfect setting for his state-of-the-art French cooking. Some of this food is  inspired: Try the brilliant lasagna made of polenta, salmon and parsley. Don't  miss the exquisite salade nicoise. The rare tuna with ponzu sauce is a  wonderful dish, and the creme brulee with corn is so good you wonder why you've  never eaten it before.  </P> <P> As good as Patina is, the food here occasionally lacks elan. This is a  restaurant to which I'd invariably send proper people who care deeply about  both food and service. But for those who want to be thrilled by a meal (and who  might not mind a little noise, a little wait), Citrus is the place.  </P> <P> 5955 Melrose Ave.; (213) 467-1108. Entrees from $19.50 to $23.50.  </P> <P> TRUMPS  </P> <P> When Trumps first opened, I thought it was Los Angeles gone mad -- all white,  all concrete, all noise, all flash. And the menu seemed like something of a  joke. Were they seriously intending to serve caviar on top of plantains and  black beans?  </P> <P> It soon became clear that Trumps would have the last laugh. The restaurant was  extremely serious about everything, except those concrete seats. It dumped  them, but not much else has changed. It is still modern, still white, still  objectionably noisy. And the plantains and caviar are still on the menu.  </P> <P> For good reason: They're delicious. So are all of Michael Roberts' seemingly  outrageous combinations. Roast duck with black beans and pickled pumpkin?  Superb. Chicken with candied lemon? An inspiration. Even the silly sounding  Brie and grape quesadilla with sweet-pea guacamole turns out to be solidly  delicious.  </P> <P> Beware of Trumps imitations -- too many chefs without Roberts' skill have taken  outrageousness to heart. It's a pity more don't follow another of his creative  (and more easily cloned) leads: serving a wonderful afternoon tea.  </P> <P> 8764 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood; (213) 855-1480. Entrees from $16 to $28.  </P> <P> MUSSO AND FRANK GRILL  </P> <P> Nobody could call the food at Musso's great -- but to me this is still a great  restaurant. Ask me if I want to eat there, and I'll always say yes.  </P> <P> I love the way it looks. The front room is filled with people huddled  comfortably in dark wooden booths. Along one wall runs a counter where men have  earnest conversations as they watch a cook fling huge chunks of meat onto a  charcoal grill. The back room is brighter and filled with people who look happy  to be there. And everywhere, waiters scurry about, serving great martinis and  pretty good prime rib (my usual choice) and sea bass and a lot of other things  that you probably don't want to eat (like Welsh rabbit or creamed spinach that  tastes mostly like nutmeg).  </P> <P> I love the way Musso's feels, too. It's the sort of place where people waiting  at the bar will turn and talk to one another. It hasn't changed much in 71  years; it has always been a restaurant where people feel comfortable. Is it any  wonder that this is the bar and grill that half the other restaurants in town  wish they could be?  </P> <P> 6667 Hollywood Blvd.; (213) 467-5123. Entrees from $6.55 to $31.45.  </P> <P> PAZZIA  </P> <P> I know that the fact that I'm including Pazzia and not Mauro Vincenti's other  place -- his big-deal downtown Rex -- is going to raise a lot of eyebrows. Rex  is undoubtedly the most beautiful restaurant in Los Angeles. It has the most  amazing tables, the most extraordinary silverware, the clearest crystal -- and,  as far as I'm concerned, one of the least-interesting menus in town. Once I get  past the first courses, I can never find anything I want to eat.  </P> <P> Pazzia is different: At Pazzia I always want to eat everything on the menu. I  never know whether to start with the pappa al pomodoro or that amazing salad of  pears, Cacciota and walnuts. There's wonderful risotto. Terrific pizzas. And  the pasta is always impeccable.  </P> <P> I like the main courses as well: Something as simple as the lamb chops with  thyme, artichoke and eggplant can make me perfectly happy. Give me some gelati  to end the meal and I'm a happy woman.  </P> <P> The place is pretty, too. It's not Rex -- but it's by far the most dignified  and modern of the small Italian restaurants in town. So I'm sorry: If you want  to go to Rex and spend hundreds of dollars, be my guest. I'll be far happier  spending far less at Pazzia.  </P> <P> 755 N. La Cienega Blvd.; (213) 657-9271. Entrees from $14 to $24.  </P> <P> L'ERMITAGE  </P> <P> Let's face it; when it comes to old-line fine French dining, Los Angeles is at  a disadvantage. We simply don't have anything to equal the great elegant French  restaurants of New York (Le Bernardin, Le Cirque and Lafayette come immediately  to mind). If you want to dine on that level, you can choose L'Orangerie or  L'Ermitage. L'Orangerie offers a gorgeous setting, but the last meal I had  there was so disappointing -- amateur service, high prices and food that was  little more than bistro cooking -- that I've narrowed the field to L'Ermitage.  </P> <P> This is the last bastion of really correct French cooking in L.A. The kitchen  has the personnel to do things right, and the service is both fond and  solicitous. The room is so dark, muted and pleasant that it's a bit like dining  beneath the sea.  </P> <P> And the food is good; chef Michel Blanchet is a great technician. His food may  lack the excitement and innovation of places like Patina, Citrus and Champagne,  but you come here knowing exactly what you will find -- dishes such as truffle  soup in the style of Paul Bocuse, a rather fussy saddle of rabbit stuffed with  spinach and truly remarkable home-cured salmon. It makes you feel that French  food has remained unchanged for centuries. But as the waiter rolls up with the  huge glass cheese cart and slices off a ripe piece of Brie, it might suddenly  occur to you that this is not such a bad thing.  </P> <P>  730 N. La Cienega Blvd.; (213) 652-5840. Entrees from $27 to $32.  </P> <P> KITAYAMA  </P> <P> This is a restaurant built by the Japanese for the Japanese. At lunchtime it is  filled with what must be the Japanese equivalent of ladies who lunch -- tables  of women who all seem to be eating the same thing. At night it is filled with  Japanese businessmen eating the rarefied and wonderful multicourse kaiseki  dinners.  </P> <P> But unlike many restaurants that the Japanese have created for themselves here  in California, this is one where you feel totally welcome. It's a lovely,  soothing, peaceful place where the waitresses wear kimonos and make you feel  incredibly cared for. And the food is exquisite. The shumai alone --  ruffle-edge pyramids stuffed with the most astonishingly delicate crab meat  filling -- are worth the trip. And the lunch of marinated black cod, which also  comes with a bit of sashimi, pickles, steamed spinach and eggplant, a bowl of  rice and miso soup, is probably the most delicious lunch in Orange County; at  $7.50 it is certainly the most amazing value.  </P> <P> In the evening, reject the rather pedestrian American menu and ask for the  translation of the Japanese list. Better still, splurge and call ahead to order  a kaiseki dinner.  </P> <P>  101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach; (714) 725-0777. Entrees from $12 to $22.  </P> <P> 72 MARKET ST.  </P> <P> One reason why people come to 72 Market St. is to stare at the celebrities. And  with Tony Bill, Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli as owners, there are plenty of  those. Some nights you'll even catch Moore at the piano in the back dining  room.  </P> <P> Another reason is that it is a swell-looking restaurant -- architecturally  innovative and filled with good art by the likes of Robert Graham and Laddie  John Dill.  </P> <P> But the main reason is the food. Leonard Schwartz has turned out to be  something of a culinary prophet, the first serious chef to spot the  all-American trend and put meatloaf on his menu, along with chili and mashed  potatoes. This is serious, delicious, intelligently conceived food. The  shellfish from the oyster bar is fresh and fine. The salads are terrific.  Entrees -- grilled veal chop with porcini and broiled polenta, charred tuna  with olives, capers and lemon -- are simple and satisfying. The desserts are  big, rich and American. During the day, it's a great place for a hamburger.  </P> <P> Over the years, 72 Market St. has turned into one of those well-run,  consistently reliable restaurants that everybody is eager to get into.  Sometimes we all remember that the owners are celebrities, but most of the time  we forget.  </P> <P> 72 Market St., Venice; (213) 392-8720. Entrees from $12 to $32.  </P> <P> MICHAEL'S  </P> <P> Michael McCarty breezed on to the Los Angeles restaurant scene in 1979 like a  brash whirlwind, stirring everything up. "I want to blow your socks off," said  this then-25-year-old wonder, proceeding to do just that. His was a new kind of  restaurant that ushered in the modern age of American cooking. Michael's was  hip, modern, expensive and good. The food was French, but it was made with  American products and cooked by young American chefs. It was an overnight  success.  </P> <P> Eleven years later, Michael's is no longer young, brash or innovative. (It's  not as expensive either; prices were recently lowered by a third.) But it's  still a reliable place to go for elegant food and good service in an atmosphere  that has improved with age. The modern art collection gets better and better,  and as the garden has grown, it has become Los Angeles' loveliest outdoor  eating area.  </P> <P> My favorite meal at Michael's is brunch -- the blueberry pancakes or the  barbecue beef sandwich. At other times of the day, I'll eat pasta with seafood  and Chardonnay cream sauce (a signature dish) for old times' sake. The specials  are always the most interesting offerings, salads are a close second, and  dishes such as sweetbreads with lemon, capers and parsley butter or grilled  chicken with French fries are beautifully cooked. Come thirsty: The wine list  is one of the finest in town.  </P> <P> 1147 3rd St., Santa Monica; (213) 451-0843. Entrees from $18 to $32.  </P> <P> CAMPANILE  </P> <P> I could happily eat Campanile's earthy food every night. I'd start, perhaps,  with the poached mozzarella. Or maybe I'd have the world's most delicious  nicoise salad. And then I'd follow it with flattened chicken. Or fish soup. Or  the boneless prime rib with white beans and greens -- a great piece of red  meat. While I ate, I'd be scarfing down the bread (it comes from the La Brea  Bakery, also brought to you by owners Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton).  </P> <P> And then it would be time for dessert, and I'd be eager to try everything  because Campanile has raised dessert to a new art. Silverton's desserts are  food, not fluff, more flavorful than sweet and utterly delicious.  </P> <P> The room's great, too: The office building once owned by Charlie Chaplin and  his first wife has been turned into a neo-romantic fantasy that combines all  the best elements of old and new. There's a fountain in the courtyard, there  are vaulted arches, there are balconies; at the same time, there's an open  kitchen and modern art.  </P> <P> There's only one problem with this little fantasy: I'd have to spend all my  time waiting. Everybody complains about this problem. Personally I think this  is food worth waiting for, but if you demand a table instantly, plan to eat  early or late.  </P> <P> 624 S. La Brea Ave.; (213) 938-1447. Entrees from $18 to $27.  </P> <P> LA TOQUE  </P> <P> "When I own my own restaurant," Ken Frank said at the ripe old age of 23, "I'll  start making a lot of money." He was then the head chef at Michael's.  </P> <P> A few months later, he opened his own restaurant -- and found out how wrong  he'd been. Ten years later, he has yet to make his fortune, but bad luck and  hard work have honed the talent of this formerly brash young man and turned his  restaurant into one of the town's most pleasant places to eat.  </P> <P> Ken Frank is probably our most regularly underrated chef. And his restaurant --  one of the few places that is romantic, quiet and serves state-of-the-art food  -- is too often overlooked. The food at La Toque -- French food with California  accents and a little soupcon of Asia (Frank was an early worshiper at the sushi  shrine) -- is innovative and delicious; for a real measure of his craft, try  one of his degustation dinners at $55 per person. If you want to spend less,  you can have a wonderful salad and a plate of pasta. People think of this as a  fancy -- and expensive -- restaurant, but if you're careful you can eat well  and reasonably.  </P> <P> 8171 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood; (213) 656-7515. Entrees from $16 to $26.  </P> <P> MATSUHISA  </P> <P> The Zagat guide rates Matsuhisa as having the best food in Los Angeles. That's  one of the reasons I don't trust the guide. As much as I like Matsuhisa, I  wouldn't put it that high on the list. (It also rates Magdalena's as having the  next best food in Los Angeles; I took a few trips to Bellflower, and I did not  agree. But that's another story.)  </P> <P> Matsuhisa is an unadorned little place with just a few tables, a sushi bar and  an ever-present line of people waiting for tidbits from Nobu Matsuhisa, a brave  chef who has broken the rigid sushi code and actually started playing with the  form. He uses garlic; he uses chiles; he uses truffles. The results of his  experimentation can be fascinating. His great triumphs include a dish in which  squid is scored to look like shell pasta, quickly cooked and served in a garlic  and asparagus sauce. Toro, fatty tuna, is grilled like a steak in one  spectacular presentation. Chilean sea bass is showered with sliced truffles in  another.  </P> <P> The problem is that the restaurant encourages omakase dinners, in which the  chef sends what he will to your table. Regulars seem to do well with this, but  the last time I tried it I got the same sauce twice, some pretty dull dishes --  and an enormous bill to boot.  </P> <P> 129 N. La Cienega Blvd., Beverly Hills; (213) 659-9639. Entrees from $16 to  $20.  </P> <P> PASCAL  </P> <P> When I first walked into Pascal, my heart sank. Stuck off in the corner of a  shopping mall, it doesn't look like an impressive restaurant. And the menu,  with its old-fashioned offerings (standbys like onion soup and chicken  Provencal) was hardly encouraging. Then I noticed a French couple off in one  corner having a serious discussion over an even more serious cheese plate. I  noticed that the people at the next table were French, too. And I noticed that  the salad they were eating looked pretty spectacular.  </P> <P> Then chef Pascal Olhats walked out of the kitchen, and I knew this was the real  thing. His eyes scanned the room, looking for problems. He walked from table to  table, making suggestions, receiving compliments, offering advice. This is, in  short, that good little French restaurant we're all always hoping to find.  </P> <P> The food, with its emphasis on fresh herbs, fresh vegetables and olive oil,  leans toward Provence; it is fragrant and remarkably light. Meals begin with a  basket of crudites and go on to dishes such as crisp-skinned, free-range  chicken on a bed of diced tomatoes or sea bass in a coating of herbs. And while  you eat the sweet, thick lemon tart, you'll remember all your favorite places  in the south of France.  </P> <P>  1000 Bristol St., Newport Beach; (714) 752-0107. Entrees from $15.95 to  $21.50.  </P> <P> TALESAI  </P> <P> Right before I moved to Los Angeles, I spent a month in Thailand eating the  best food of my life. It seemed almost impossible to get a bad meal there; I'd  munch my way down the streets and through the markets, eating sticks of grilled  meat and wonderful bowls of herb-laden noodles and curries so hot they set my  mouth on fire. I ate sticky black rice with coconut and mangoes and raw crabs  and fish that were grilled right on the beach. The only times I ever ate badly  were when I walked into fancy restaurants.  </P> <P> That's why Talesai is such a surprise. It's Los Angeles' fanciest Thai  restaurant; it's also one of its best.  </P> <P> The setting is charming, and the food is delicate and surprising. Try the  Talesai special, a mixture of shrimp, peanuts and minced pork cooked in coconut  milk that you scoop up with crisp rice crackers. Or naked shrimp, silky little  morsels that wear nothing more than a clear sauce whose major notes are lime,  chile and fish sauce. There's a great ginger duckling, the city's best pad Thai  and cool coconut ice cream to end the meal.  </P> <P>  9043 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood; (213) 275-9724. Entrees from $6.95 to  $15.95.  </P> <P> FENNEL  </P> <P> It seemed like the silliest gimmick: Four chefs with restaurants in France  decided to open a restaurant together in California. They made a deal with Air  France making it economically feasible to come flying into town, a few weeks  here, a few weeks there. It seemed like it would be total chaos.  </P> <P> It's not; it is, instead, a restaurant that is constantly in touch with its  roots. Chef Jean-Pierre Bosc is the glue that holds it together, the one who is  always there. When the owners -- Michel Rostang, Yan Jacquot, Andre Genin and  Michel Chabran -- show up, they bring a jolt of energy into the kitchen. And a  lot of fresh ideas.  </P> <P> The result is that in addition to the regular offerings -- dishes such as the  wonderful rotisserie chicken served in two courses and the spectacular hot  chocolate tart with pistachio sauce -- there is a constant parade of new  dishes. If you want to know what's going on in France and can't afford the air  fare, this is a good substitute.  </P> <P> There are two drawbacks. The room itself is not totally charming: It is cool  (both physically and visually), slightly cluttered and hardly a serene setting  for a wonderful meal. And the prices on the wine list are ridiculous.  </P> <P> 1535 Ocean Ave., Santa Monica; (213) 394-2079. Entrees from $20 to $24.  </P> <P> ROCKENWAGNER  </P> <P> The first time I walked into this tiny restaurant, it was 3 weeks old and I was  the only person in the place. That, it appeared, was an improvement. "Last  night," the waiter confided, "not a single person came to dinner."  </P> <P> Things have changed. These days, you need to reserve far ahead to get one of  the 50 seats in Hans and Mary Rockenwagner's restaurant. And no wonder -- it's  one of the few places that serves really fine modern French food at an  affordable price.  </P> <P> The best of the menu are Hans' signature dishes such as crab souffle with  sliced papaya or a salad of baby lettuces and sauteed sweetbreads topped with  an icy tomato sorbet. My favorite entree draws upon his German heritage, his  French training and his California experience -- roast pork tenderloin rolled  in cracked black pepper, topped with warm goat cheese and served with homemade  spaetzle.  </P> <P> But it is more than food that draws people to Rockenwagner. The restaurant is  so small, the owners so young and appealing, that you end up feeling as if you  are truly their guest. As you scoop up the last morsel of a wonderful hot apple  tart, you can't help being glad that Rockenwagner survived its rocky  beginnings.  </P> <P>  1023 W. Washington Blvd., Venice; (213) 399-6504. Entrees from $16.50 to $22.  </P> <P> TRATTORIA ANGELI  </P> <P> When the original Angeli opened on Melrose Avenue, it was a great day for Los  Angeles eaters. It was small, loud, modern, plain. But it served the sort of  simple Italian food you'd actually find in a similar setting in Italy :  fragrant pizzas with crisp crusts and real ingredients on the top, pasta  without a lot of sauce, simply roasted chickens. At lunchtime, there were  wonderful sandwiches, made with the restaurant's own bread, of roast pork loin  or fresh ricotta cheese. It was all delicious and inexpensive, and it was so  wildly successful that within months it had dozens of imitators.  </P> <P> When Angeli opened a second restaurant, it did more than imitate itself -- it  improved upon the original. The Trattoria is bigger, with a far more ambitious  menu. (And, it should be mentioned, an incredible wine list.) In addition to  the pizzas, pastas and antipasti, there are grilled fish, great fish soup,  impressive desserts. It's still loud, still young, still filled with energy.  But although its cutting-edge modern decor may make Angeli look like here, the  food makes it taste like there. 11651 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angeles;  (213) 478-1191. Entrees from $10.50 to $16.50.  </P> <P> PARKWAY GRILL  </P> <P> Would I put Parkway Grill on the list if it weren't in Pasadena? Probably not.  It's just another Spago clone, with an open kitchen, wood-burning oven, pizzas,  grills and so forth. They even make their own version of Wolfgang Puck's famous  "Jewish pizza" (smoked salmon and cream cheese.)  </P> <P> But it is in Pasadena, a town that once had one of the area's most ambitious  restaurants -- La Couronne -- and didn't support it; a town that seems most  eager to spend its dining dollars elsewhere; a town that has any number of  pleasant places -- Old Town Bakery and Roxxi to name just two -- but doesn't  seem eager to support any real culinary innovation. In this atmosphere, the  success of Parkway Grill is slightly surprising.  </P> <P> For it is a thoroughly modern restaurant plunked down in a large old brick  building. The menu is as eclectic as they come, mingling delicious pizzas,  crisp Chinese duck, blue corn tostadas, Thai tagliatelle . . . no food trend is  absent. To make matters even more interesting, the restaurant has a program  that brings some of the country's most innovative chefs (Mark Miller, Jasper  White, Anne Rosenzweig) flying in for visits. So if I'm eating in Pasadena,  this is probably where you'll find me.  </P> <P>  510 S. Arroyo Parkway, Pasadena; (818) 795-1001. Entrees from $8.50 to $22  </P> <P> GINZA SUSHIKO  </P> <P> When I first walked into this sushi bar, hidden in an unprepossessing strip  mall in the mid-Wilshire district, I didn't know I was about to order the most  expensive meal I had ever eaten in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> How could I? Nothing about the place was particularly ostentatious. It looked,  in fact, like almost every other sushi bar I've been in. With one exception.  This was not a sushi bar with a glass case filled with fish for diners to point  at. The chef stood behind his counter, following his own whims, taking fish out  of a hidden refrigerator, slicing it and placing little morsels before me.  </P> <P> But what fish it turned out to be! Perfect slices of pink abalone. The richest  tuna I'd ever tasted. An orange and purple clam that looked like a painting by  Georgia O'Keeffe. Sea urchins that were bigger, fatter than any I'd ever  encountered. The meal went on and on, ending with two giant strawberries. And a  bill for $100.  </P> <P> This may seem expensive. But to the Japanese businessmen who make up the  majority of the clientele, Ginza Sushiko is a bargain. Were they eating at the  Tokyo branch of the restaurant, the bill would be at least twice as much.  </P> <P> 3959 Wilshire Blvd., A-11, Los Angeles; (213) 487-2251. Sushi from $4 to $10  per piece.  </P> <P> FINO  </P> <P> Worth the trip? Probably not. But if I lived in Torrance, I'd haunt the place,  for Fino is certainly the most interesting restaurant to open in the South Bay  in quite some time.  </P> <P> It feels wonderful, with all the energy of a small bistro in the south of  France. It smells even more wonderful, primarily of the roasted garlic and  olive oil that are plunked on your table, along with a dish of olives and a  loaf of bread, when you sit down. And there's a real warmth about it, which  might emanate from all the wine and beer that is consumed on the premises (both  the beer list and the wine list are gems).  </P> <P> Certainly the food in this cozy little boite all sounds spectacular; the menu  offers a list of rustic Mediterranean favorites, stretching from Spanish tapas  to Provencale tapenades and Italian pesto. But much of the cooking is too  intense; the chef seems to think that if a little of something is good, more is  better. When a stew has wine and orange peel in it, neither is subtle; when a  pasta is made with olives, they are overwhelming. Still, it hardly matters.  This is the sort of place where you drink your wine, eat a large order of tapas  and think about how much fun life can be.  </P> <P> 24530 Hawthorne Blvd., Torrance; (213) 373-1952. Entrees from $7.95 to $19.95.  </P> <P> FRESCO  </P> <P> When I feel in need of comfort, I think of Fresco in Glendale. It's one of  those restaurants that always manages to make me feel cared for.  </P> <P> There's even something comforting about the scale of the place: Everything is a  little too small. The effect is to make you feel that you're in a restaurant in  some small town (well, actually, you are). And co-owner Lino Autiero is one of  those people who must have been born in a tuxedo; he's the perfect maitre d',  who acts as if his sole desire in life is to make you feel good. More warm  bread? Yes, please -- it's fabulous. How about some wine? But of course. You  don't see anything you want on the menu? The chef would be happy to cook  something special.  </P> <P> The fact that the chef can cook something special is what makes all this work.  Lino's partner is chef Antonio Orlando, who loves to make fancy Italian food  such as corn crepes with duck in port sauce and cannelloni stuffed with lobster  and spinach. These may be impressive, but I prefer his simpler dishes; there's  nothing quite as comforting as fried calamari followed by a plate of whole  wheat pasta with cheese and black pepper.  </P> <P> 514 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale; (818) 247-5541. Entrees from $13 to $20.  </P> <P> HARBOR VILLAGE  </P> <P> At 11 a.m. you might get a seat, but by noon you'll find yourself surrounded by  hordes of people, waiting clamorously for a table. Considering the size of  Harbor Village (huge), that's quite a testimonial to the quality of the food.  Take a seat in the ornate dining room, and you'll instantly understand: The  carts that roll endlessly past contain the most inventive selection of dim sum  this side of Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Harbor Village, a branch of a Hong Kong restaurant, is also the perfect choice  for a blowout Chinese banquet. At night, the enormous dining room shrinks when  ingenious sliding panels slice it into a multitude of private dining rooms. On  almost any evening, you can peek into one of these little rooms and see tables  filled with privileged people eating truly exotic delicacies.  </P> <P> For regular evening diners, however, the restaurant can be problematic. You  might end up with fabulous food -- great steamed fish, special salads, simple  plates of vegetables, Peking duck. Or you could be unlucky and wait a long time  for food that turns out to be merely mediocre. (To be safe, don't order fried  food at night, and stick to simple dishes.) Even on the off nights, however,  there's something so wonderfully foreign about the place that you end up  feeling as if you've been on a quick trip to Asia.  </P> <P>  111 N. Atlantic Blvd., Monterey Park; (818) 300-8833. Entrees from $5 to $25.  </P> <P> SORRENTO GRILLE  </P> <P> Laguna Beach on a sunny day can be so seductively lovely that you are inclined  to plunk yourself down on the sandy beach in the middle of town and just sit  there, gazing out to sea. If you get hungry, you don't have far to go; the  Sorrento Grille is just a lazy walk inland, and it serves the perfect sort of  food for this setting.  </P> <P> Freshness is the hallmark here: The produce in this casually elegant restaurant  comes from the superlative Chino ranch, the chicken is free-range, the bread is  homemade. The theme is basically Italian, but the chefs feel free to cook  anything that strikes their fancy. You can watch them tossing a really  springlike pasta primavera in the open kitchen -- but you can also see them  slicing a slow-cooked beef brisket that would please any red-blooded  meat-eater. Soups and salads are especially good here; pizzas are not.  </P> <P> Finding the Sorrento Grille in Orange County is a special pleasure. Orange  County, after all, is the place that only yesterday prided itself on offering  footstools and roses to the ladies in its best restaurants and enormous bills  to the gentlemen. Things have changed: These days, flowers and footstools are  hard to find. Good food, however, is not.  </P> <P>  370 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach; (714) 494-8686. Entrees from $11.50 to $20.  </P> <P> IL GIARDINO  </P> <P> When I first moved to Los Angeles, I couldn't believe that so many rich people  were clamoring to get into a place where the rug was Astroturf, the prices  high, the waiters hardly able to speak English, the chairs uncomfortable and  the tables too small. Then I tasted the clean, straightforward Italian food,  and I understood.  </P> <P> There is something seductive about the sheer simplicity of Il Giardino. When  you arrive, there's a big bowl of raw vegetables sitting on the table and a  bowl of oil and vinegar to dip them into. The risotto is superb, as are the  simpler pastas (when you get into the more baroque offerings, the quality goes  down). The best entrees are the grilled bronzino -- served with roast potatoes  and greens -- and the herb-scented broiled sliced steak.  </P> <P> Power is the other seduction of Il Giardino; it's all around, and it's  ostentatiously low-key. As one studio executive explained to me early on, "It's  where famous people go when they don't want to be seen."  </P> <P>  9235 W. 3rd St., Beverly Hills; (213) 275-5444. Entrees from $10 to $25.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BEST BREAKFAST  </P> <P> THE COFFEE SHOP AT THE BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL  </P> <P> Come on in to the perfect pink counter shop. Sit down; watch Gary as he grills  greaseless bacon and pours perfect pancakes. Drizzle real maple syrup over the  pancakes, have some eggs and wash it all down with a glass of orange juice that  was squeezed just seconds ago. If there's a better way to start the day, I  haven't found it. 9641 Sunset Blvd., Beverly Hills; (213) 276-2251.  </P> <P> BEST CHICKEN  </P> <P> VERSAILLES  </P> <P> Everybody knows that the garlic chicken at Versailles is fantastic. And who am  I to disagree? The black beans and rice are pretty swell, too. But there's one  pressing question: With a new restaurant about to open on La Cienega Boulevard,  will the big time ruin Versailles? 10319 Venice Blvd., Culver City; (213)  558-3168.  </P> <P> BEST LUNCH DEAL  </P> <P> CAFE BLANC  </P> <P> This is what you get: homemade soup; a large, fresh salad; a plate filled with  mashed potatoes and crisp chicken in mustard sauce. This is the price: $4.95.  Spend a little more and you can have Chilean sea bass topped with orange rind  and pink peppercorns. A line starts forming around noon. (Dinner prices are  much higher.) 3706 Beverly Blvd.; (213) 380-2829.  </P> <P> BEST HOT DOG  </P> <P> THE WURST PLACE  </P> <P> There are two schools of thought on hot dogs. The non-food approach demands  that the dogs be nothing more than good greasy fun and makes eating at Pink's  perfectly legitimate. The other school requires that the hotdogs have some sort  of nutritional value. If you fall into the latter category, you can't do better  than the Wurst. 17874 Kinross Ave.; (213) 824-9597.  </P> <P> BEST STOREFRONT THAI  </P> <P> JITLADA  </P> <P> Maybe it's just because I've been coming here so long. Maybe it's because it's  so convenient for me. Although there are hundreds of more authentic Thai  restaurants in Southern California, I have an abiding affection for Jitlada. I  know that when I tell them I want really hot food, they'll believe me. 5233  Sunset Blvd.; (213) 667-9809.  </P> <P> BEST TACO  </P> <P> YUCA'S HUT  </P> <P> It's just a little stand in the middle of a parking lot, but it's such a  friendly place, and the food's so terrific, that it's become a community  hangout. People sit at rickety tables eating great carne asada tacos, letting  the grease from the cochinita pibil run down their cheeks and pouring fiery hot  sauce onto great bean burritos. 2056 Hillhurst Ave.; (213) 662-1214.  </P> <P> BEST BURGER  </P> <P> MEATY MEAT BURGERS  </P> <P> There's lots of controversy about who makes the best burgers. The truth is that  if you're willing to spend big bucks, any number of places make great ones.  (The Grill, West Beach Cafe, City and Morton's come immediately to mind.) But  if you're looking for the people's burger -- fatty, peppery meat, lots of  lettuce and tomatoes, all the works and not much money -- this is the place.  (The fries are pretty good, too: They may be limp, but they're greaseless and  have a fine potato flavor.) 5855 W. Pico Blvd. (corner of Fairfax Avenue);  </P> <P> (213) 933-2640.  </P> <P> BEST POT STICKERS  </P> <P> MANDARIN DELI  </P> <P> These pot stickers are fat crescents, soft on one side, crunchy on the other  and filled with an airy mixture of meat. They're wonderful. (So are the boiled  fish dumplings, the noodle soups and the garlic-drenched seaweed salad.) 727 N.  Broadway, (213) 623-6054; 356 E. 2nd St., (213) 617-0231; 701 W. Garvey Ave.,  Monterey Park, (818) 570-9795; 9351 Reseda Blvd., Northridge, (818) 993-0122.  </P> <P> BEST SAUSAGE  </P> <P> JODY MARONI SAUSAGE  </P> <P> Even if Jody didn't make terrific sausage, it would be worth coming out to the  Venice boardwalk just to watch him run through his spiel. He shouts, he  cajoles, he pleads, he exhorts; he wants you to try his sausage. Go ahead;  you'll be glad you did. Venice Boardwalk; (213) 730-0941.  </P> <P> BEST AIRPORT FOOD  </P> <P> HOST CAFETERIA AMERICAN AIRLINES TERMINAL  </P> <P> Your plane's late. You face one more miserable meal in this cafeteria where  everything is overpriced and awful. Don't despair: For the increasing flow of  Japanese travelers, Host now sells a big bowl of udon -- noodle soup. It's  good, and it's only $5.95.  </P> <P> BEST SRI LANKAN FOOD  </P> <P> SIRI LANKA CURRY HOUSE  </P> <P> There are dozens of good Indian restaurants serving northern tandoori dishes  and curries as well as a growing number of places offering vegetarian food of  the south. But this is the only place I know serving the fragrant food from the  island at India's southern tip. I love the lacy egg-topped pancakes called  appam. 1308 N. Highland Ave.; (213) 466-8238.  </P> <P> BEST LEBANESE FOOD  </P> <P> MAROUCH  </P> <P> Before you've finished a meal in this bare-bones restaurant, your table will be  covered with little bowls containing wonderful concoctions to scoop up with  pita: smoky eggplant dip, fat beans, bowls of tangy sour cream. Go on to roast  chicken with garlic sauce, wrapped up in big sheets of lavash. And be amazed by  how little it all costs. 4905 Santa Monica Blvd.; (213) 662-9325.  </P> <P> BEST SHRIMP  </P> <P> OCEAN STAR  </P> <P> The "swimming shrimp" are fished, live, out of the tank, steamed and served  with a bowl of soy sauce and chilies. Other tanks hold live lobsters and  scallops. (There are plenty of non-fish foods worth eating here, too, such as a  Cantonese beef stew with turnips.) 112 N. Chandler Ave., Monterey Park; (818)  300-8446.  </P> <P> BEST PUB  </P> <P> MITSUKI  </P> <P> Pity the poor people waiting for a table; customers sit here for hours,  drinking and munching their way through the large menu. The sushi's good, and  there are grilled offerings (eggplant, mushrooms, various meat and fish) and  big bowls of warming soups. The perfect place after a very hard day. 201 N.  Western Ave.; (213) 871-0703.  </P> <P> BEST SANDWICH  </P> <P> PHILIPPE'S  </P> <P> Maybe Philippe didn't really invent the French Dip back in 1918 -- but his  restaurant still makes a mean one (I like beef best, but the lamb's good, too).  Sawdust on the floor, communal tables, 10-cent coffee and great doughnuts --  why aren't there more restaurants like this one? 1001 N. Alameda St.; (213)  628-3781.  </P></p>

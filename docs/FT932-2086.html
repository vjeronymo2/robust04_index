			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Smith may get second reform chance EVEN IF Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, loses his fight at this year's Labour Party conference to establish a new relationship between the party and the unions he may have another chance next year, party officials say. Labour's organisation committee will recommend to the party's national executive next week that the most contentious issue between Mr Smith and the unions - the establishment of a new system for selecting parliamentary candidates - be postponed until the work of the Boundaries Commission is complete next year. That means that even if Mr Smith's support for removing the unions from the selection procedure and introducing a system of 'one-member-one-vote' fails at the conference this September, the issue can still be won next year without causing havoc with selections procedures. There is a strong chance that the executive will accept the organisation committee recommendation. Some opponents of the Smith reform plan see the move as an attempt by his supporters to create an opportunity to change the rules next year. But the Smith camp insists it is not interested in delay and can still win the vote on the introduction of one-member-one-vote for the selection of parliamentary candidates at this year's conference. With most of the unions committed by their conference decisions to retain the block vote, however, a Smith victory probably depends on a few big unions abstaining.</p>

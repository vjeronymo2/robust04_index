			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Call to back workers' rights in trade deals Respect for basic human rights at work should be included in future international trade agreements, Mr John Monks, the British Trades Union Congress general secretary, told the AFL-CIO American union organisation in Miami yesterday, Robert Taylor, Labour Correspondent, writes from London. 'We must press the case with governments for a clause linking the extension of trade advantages to respect for employment rights,' he told the AFL-CIO's executive council. 'In a time of heavy unemployment and insecurity such a clause in the Gatt would be a powerful defence against protectionism.' Mr Monks said he hoped the issue would be taken up at next month's jobs summit conference in Detroit called by President Bill Clinton and at April's Gatt meeting in Marrakesh. He claimed there was a need to include a commitment to 'inalienable' rights in trade agreements. They would cover the right 'to form and join a union, to work free of compulsion in conditions where life and limb are safeguarded against the most dangerous hazards and to have redress when subjected to discrimination on grounds of sex, race or political or religious belief'. Earlier this month the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation raised the possibility of introducing social clauses into trade agreements. Trade union bodies such as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions are also campaigning for them. Social clause supporters believe international competition must not be allowed to result in declining labour standards. But strong opposition is coming from Pacific rim countries in South-East Asia.</p>

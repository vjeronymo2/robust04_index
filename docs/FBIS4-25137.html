			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Evening talk" column by Yang Chu (5017 2612): "Opposing </F> Imposition of Sanctions; Dispatch of Troops Unlikely"]    [Text] "Being Unofficial"    The five permanent members of the UN Security  Council--China,  Britain, the United States, France, and Russia--began to discuss  the Korean issue today.    Since the DPRK is accused of not cooperating with the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] by refusing to accept  inspections of its nuclear facilities, the United States has  called for the imposition of economic sanctions on the DPRK.    It is said that China is opposed to the immediate  convocation  of a full meeting of the 15 members of the UN Security Council,  therefore, a session of the five permanent members will be held  first and will be "unofficial."  <H5>  Being Marathon </H5>   It is also said that the unofficial meeting of the five  major  powers could continue for several weeks.    Several weeks are enough time for many things to occur  outside the meeting. In other words, before the five major  powers come to a conclusion regarding whether or not they will  impose sanctions, activities external to the meeting intended to  alleviate the tension and find a way out may have already borne  fruit, the economic sanctions proposal may not need to be  officially proposed, and China may not need to choose between  vetoing or abstaining from vetoing a decision.  <H5>  International Meeting? </H5>   Regarding Russia's proposal to hold an international  conference to discuss the Korean nuclear crisis, DPRK Foreign  Minister Kim Yong-nam, who is currently visiting Kiev, Ukraine,  said: "We are interested in it and studying it." He did not  say no.    As for Beijing, foreign dispatches reported that Chinese  Foreign Ministry officials say they will seriously consider  Russia's proposal to call an international meeting. But the  government's XINHUA News Agency has yet to release such a report.    China had favored a quadripartite trilateral [as published]  meeting of the DPRK, ROK, the United States, and the IAEA to  resolve the Korean crisis.  <H5>  Quadripartite Trilateral Meeting </H5>   Yesterday, Chen Jian, Chinese deputy representative to the  UN  Security Council, said in the United Nations: "We think the  possibility of resolving the problem through dialogue between  the parties directly concerned still exists."    His remarks still mean that China favors a quadripartite  trilateral meeting to resolve the problem. They did not  contradict "seriously considering" Russia's proposal and this  cannot be interpreted as a change in the original stance.    "Seriously considering" leaves a little more room for  maneuver and, when necessary, one more choice.  <H5>  Choe Kwang's China Visit </H5>   Another noteworthy news item today is that the DPRK Chief of  General Staff Choe Kwang is leading a DPRK military delegation  on a visit to Beijing. At a banquet in their honor, General  Zhang Wannian, the Chinese Chief of General Staff, mentioned the  traditional friendship established in blood between the Chinese  and Korean peoples and between their armies .    Earlier, the DPRK announced that if economic sanctions were  imposed, this meant war. People were therefore prompted about  whether Choe Kwang's China visit had something to do with  preparations for war? They were reminded of the movement to  resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and of the Chinese  volunteers who bravely and heroically crossed the Yalu River in  the early 1950's.  <H5>  Two Will Not's </H5>   Will such a thing happen?    No.    We can come to this conclusion now from two things.    First, China will not agree to economic sanctions against  the  DPRK in the UN Security Council. Second, China will not  dispatch troops to become involved itself in a "Korean war"--a  "Korean war which will most probably not occur.</p>

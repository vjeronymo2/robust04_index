			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yekaterina Zapodinskaya: "The Criminal Aimed at </F> a Businessman, Not a Deputy: Investigation of State Duma  Deputy's Murder"]    [Text] A funeral will be held in Khimki today for  35-year-old Andrey Aizderdzis, a State Duma deputy and former  chairman of the board of the International Business Corporation  (MDK) and MDK-Bank. He was killed on the evening of 26 April  near the entrance to his apartment building by a shot from a  pump-action rifle. The investigation is working on many  possibilities; KOMMERSANT has learned of nine of them.  <H5>  A Quarrel With the Mayor </H5>   At the Khimki procuracy, which has opened a criminal case on  the murder, our KOMMERSANT correspondent was told that the  investigation is working on all possible versions, first among  which is the so-called "political" one. It is possible that the  victim was selected from an alphabetical list of deputies, where  Aizderdzis is near the top.    The second version takes into consideration the enmity  between the deputy and the mayor of Khimki, of which the entire  town was aware. According to MDK General Director Aleksey  Ponomarev, "Andrey Daynisovich did not have any enemies except  Mayor Yuriy Korablin and his inner circle." One of the causes of  the conflict had been Mr. Korablin's refusal to issue a  certificate of ownership for the mansion in Old Khimki which  houses the International Business Corporation and MDK-Bank. They  had bought the decrepit structure from the consumer services  administration, and after reconstruction it became one of the  most beautiful mansions in town. It turned out later, however,  that such a deal was illegal, since state property cannot be  alienated without a bid or an auction. Therefore, at the mayor's  initiative, it was annulled in the arbitration court.    The mutual dislike between the head of the town  administration and the bank management increased after the  beating of Sergey Chernykh, director of Khimki cable television,  who is considered the "mayor's man." On the day of elections to  the State Duma, bodily injury was inflicted on Mr. Chernykh for  refusing to air a video film on Andrey Aizderdzis' meetings with  famous people--Nikolay Ryzhkov and Nikita Mikhalkov. According  to Mr. Chernykh, he was roughed up by two MDK guards at  Aizderdzis' order. He was not able to prove this allegation to  the investigation, however, and the criminal case initiated  against the State Duma deputy was closed. The management of  MDK-Bank called the beating "a provocation, and not the first  one, on the part of the mayor."    In the bankers' opinion, it was the mayoralty that had  initiated the audit of MDK-Bank and the corporation, conducted  by the city's tax inspectorate and tax police. The bank was told  to pay into the budget 100 million rubles [R], the  corporation--R1.2 billion. The bank paid up, but the MDK called  the inspectors' actions "lawlessness," withdrew the money from  its account, and de facto ceased to exist.    Soon after the audit Andrey Aizderdzis sent a letter to  Russia's Tax Police Department. In it the banker reported that  the chief of the Khimki tax police, Dmitriy Karasev, had  "blackmailed" him, demanding that he voluntarily transfer to the  budget R250 million and threatening to otherwise slap the MDK  and the bank with R4 billion in sanctions. This conversation  with Mr. Karasev was recorded on tape. Aizderdzis also said in  his letter that in the spring of 1993 MDK handed over to  Aleksandr Gayderov, deputy head of the city administration, R3  million to purchase a car for Mr. Karasev, who was also paid  R100,000-150,000 monthly as a "bonus to supplement his salary."  In his letter the banker said that he was prepared to "produce  witnesses" for the Tax Police Department to support this  information.  <H5>  Mayoralty Inclined To Believe "Gangster" Version </H5>   All staff members of the local administration with whom the  KOMMERSANT correspondent had a chance to talk believe that it is  to MDK-Bank's benefit to lead the investigation away from the  true causes of the murder. Which are allegedly to be found in  its commercial activities, as well as in its former connection  with the Zelenograd-Khimki organized crime group led by Viktor  Burlachko (until his arrest for extortion in the summer of  1992). According to unofficial data, the Burlachko group for  while served as MDK's "cover," but after the arrest of its  leader, Andrey Aizderdzis "did not find common language" with  "Burlak's" successor Dmitriy Romanov. In 1993 the banker  allegedly even helped to "hand over" to the militia Romanov, who  was on the wanted list. According to information from the same  source, the murder was "revenge for Romanov."    MDK-Bank Chairman of the Board Anatoliy Vasilyev (a former  procurator) said that as early as December 1993 two unknown  persons had threatened him and demanded that he immediately  resign his position. Aizderdzis could have chosen to dismiss  Vasilyev, but had not done so because he valued the latter as a  competent jurist. Then on 25 December, when the banker stepped  out of his house to shake out a carpet, two burly men who  "looked like gangsters" approached him. One of them grabbed  Vasilyev by the ear and said: "You make waves, and even  bodyguards will not help your kid and your family."    The banker turned to the oblast procuracy and told them that  the threats were directed not so much against him as aimed at  getting at Aizderdzis. "My prophesy came true," Mr. Vasilyev  told a KOMMERSANT correspondent a few days ago. According to  him, what made the tragedy possible was that the investigators  who were in charge of the criminal case on the subject of the  threats against him had led the case into a dead end.    The version of gangster revenge was refuted by MDK General  Director Aleksey Ponomarev. According to him, in 1991 Burlachko  did indeed visit MDK, but currently the corporation would hardly  be of interest to criminal structures, since it does not have  "either retail kiosks or cash."  <H5>  Aizderdzis' Newspaper Insulted Crime Bosses </H5>   One more version of the investigation is also connected with  the criminal world. The victim was not only a politician and a  banker but also a publisher. He published a newspaper of a  patriotic orientation, "Who Is Who," whose editor in chief was  well-known literary figure Stanislav Rybas. In this year's  seventh issue the newspaper published a list of 266 leaders of  the criminal world, with names (mostly of Caucasian origin),  nicknames, and a crime record of the crime bosses. Someone on  this list may "hold a grudge" against the publisher, since these  "authorities" have a tremendous dislike for having their "lay"  name linked with their criminal world nicknames. Actually, in  the militia's opinion, this list is incomplete and imprecise,  besides which it had already been published in a self-published  brochure (which, on the other hand, may not have been known to  the crime bosses). So it would have been more logical to settle  the score not with Aizderdzis but with the editor, who,  according to MDK-Bank staff, had not coordinated this  publication with Aizderdzis.  <H5>  Conflict With Partner </H5>   The day after the murder Anatoliy Kuznetsov, the founder of  MDK and former chairman of the board of MDK-Bank, was summoned  to the Khimki UVD [Internal Affairs Administration]. As Mr.  Kuznetsov told the KOMMERSANT correspondent, he and Aizderdzis  had been friends and partners but parted ways in 1992. Now  Kuznetsov calls his former partner a "pathologically dishonest  man," whose traits included "aggressiveness, looking for  enemies, and creating an environment loyal to him personally."  Kuznetsov, however, has his own corporation now, and, in his own  words, long ago dropped all financial claims against Aizderdzis.  Kuznetsov believes that the cause of the tragedy were the "new  commercial wheeling-dealings" of his former friend.  <H5>  "Commercial" Versions of the Murder </H5>   According to MDK General Director Ponomarev, the deceased  lately was not engaged in commerce altogether. Investigators  have their doubts about this. Among others, a version is being  checked out that the banker was done in by a debtor pushed into  a corner by persistent demands for payment. And, according to  MDK-Bank's management, there are quite a few people who owe it  money (more than R500 million in unrepaid loans). Neither does  the investigation preclude the possibility that one of the  companies that had been part of MDK itself got into debt. A  company mentioned in particular in this connection is Telecon,  which is part of the corporation and which had promised for half  a year already to repay R0.5 billion to the Roskontrakt company.    The investigators are also checking whether Aizderdzis'  demise is linked in any way with the murder of entrepreneur  Tayvo Laos. On 18 April 1994 the latter was stabbed five time  with a knife by unknown assailants in the Ukraine hotel.  According to unofficial data, Mr. Laos worked in an Estonian law  firm and in addition did some trading in nonferrous metals  (exporting them from Russia to the Baltics). It is possible that  Aizderdzis and Laos knew one another, since the MDK also engaged  in metal trading--only ferrous and only inside Russia, however,  according to Mr. Ponomarev.    Yesterday operatives received information that five  pump-action Winchester rifles (the type of a weapon used by the  murderer) had been brought in from abroad by a friend of the  victim. Aizderdzis gave four of them as a gift to partners and  friends (including the aforementioned Aleksey Ponomarev,  Aleksandr Gayderov, and Anatoliy Kuznetsov), and kept one for  himself. The investigation is trying to find out where the fifth  rifle is and whether it was the one used by the criminal to kill  the deputy.    [begin box]    Andrey Daynisovich Aizderdzis, born 1958.  Graduated from vocational high school. Lived in a small  three-room apartment in the town of Khimki in suburban Moscow.  Married, with a son and a daughter. Before starting the  International Business Corporation worked as a construction site  supervisor. By his own admission, he had been "drinking heavily"  for a long time, but even before going into commerce had  "changed," and stopped using alcohol altogether.    Held the position of chairman of the board of MDK-Bank and  MDK chairman of the board, but stepped down after being elected  to the State Duma. He did not resign, however, as MDK founder,  and also remained chairman of the board of the Foundation for  Mutual Aid and Support of the Population. Through this  foundation MDK-Bank financed the city newspaper VPERED.    He did not carry a weapon. During the election campaign Mr.  Aizderdzis was accompanied by members of the MDK security  service; after the elections he refused to have bodyguards.  According to his brother Aleksandr, there had been no threats  against the deputy. [end box]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages in italics in Creole] </F>   [Excerpts] The Coordinating Committee [for National  Mobilization, CCMN] is at a deadlock. The Conference of  Presidents at the Chamber of Deputies has resisted the pressures  of this committee. We are deaf to threats, stated Mr. Frantz  Robert Monde. Those men have no program, no plan for the future,  he proclaimed. The following is a report by Daly Valet.    [Begin recording] [Valet] On Wednesday, 6 April, the  ultimatum of the CCMN expired. There was surprise as the  committee did not go into action as they had threatened to do in  the event that the parliamentarians did not ratify their plan  for an ad hoc government. Anyway, we must say this matter was  debated by the Conference of Presidents at the Chamber of  Deputies on the morning of 6 April. The results and decisions  are the following: the Conference is prepared not to receive  the delegation of the mobilization committee even if they go to  the parliament. If we are to trust Monde's explanations, the  bloc presidents will make their positions known in a letter they  will send to the CCMN on 8 April.    [Monde] These men decided not to meet with this delegation  and to write them back instead. This letter will be  ready....[pauses] We are discussing it; this letter will be sent  to them on 8 April. Anyway, the press will have a copy of it.    [Valet] The president of the Chamber of Deputies stated  that he does not allow himself to be intimidated by pressure and  that pressure will not make him obey. The president explained  that the deputies remain committed to the parliamentary plan  they passed in the Chamber of Deputies at the beginning of  March. Monde added they had not rejected the CCMN's ad hoc  government plan, but a small group of people cannot think that  they can take power to defend their personal interests.  Besides, wonders Frantz Robert Monde, what is the plan of those  people who want to take power? What have they decided to do for  the people who are living in poverty? [passage omitted]    According to the president of the Chamber of Deputies,  the country's political crisis looks complicated to several  parliamentarians especially the latest statements by former de  facto President Joseph Nerette who claims still to be president  of the Republic. On that score, Monde asserted that events have  passed Nerette by. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

In an interview in Tripoli, Fahimah and al-Miqrahi told  AL-HAYAH that they are tired of the restrictions imposed on  their movement. They stressed their wish to live a normal life,  "instead of being stared at wherever we go and instead of our  news dominating all world news bulletins."    Al-Miqrahi said: "Our only crime is that we hold Libyan  nationality.... We are victims of the West's desire to  politicize the case and try Libya for a crime it did not commit  in the context of settling scores in other issues."    It appeared from the interview that al-Amin Fahimah and  al-Miqrahi were in a bad mental state, but they tried to look  composed. Al-Miqrahi pointed out that he was not in Malta  during the period in which the accusation was leveled at Libya,  and that he never met the owner of the timing device (timer)  factory.    Al-Miqrahi added that he and al-Amin Fahimah placed their  full confidence in lawyer Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl the moment he was  assigned to defend them, and that they support any decision he  takes. He pointed out that they were not subjected to any  pressures to hand themselves over, that the decision is theirs,  and that they are willing to appear before "any court that  enjoys the elements of fairness, not one that convicts people  before the trial begins."    He said that "the accusations have affected all my  relatives,  especially my children, who used to convey to me questions from  their colleagues about this incident. I had to move them to  another school...and change their family name to their mother's  in order to alleviate their suffering."    Having stressed that he does not fear for himself, he said  that he now wants "the days to pass quickly so that I can get  the innocent verdict." He stressed that "I will never sell  myself to any quarter in the world, whatever the reward." And  "I have never been an officer in the Libyan intelligence  service."    He added that "I am willing to hand myself over if the case  is going to end at that point and if the sanctions imposed on  Libya are going to be lifted." He added: "However, from my  protracted discussions with the lawyer, they (the Western  states) do not want to bring an end to this case, because its  continuation is likely to lead to the continuation of the  sanctions imposed on Libya."    He said that the Libyan testifying against them, namely  'Abd-al-Hamid Ja'akah, "maybe acted under pressure or for other  unavoidable motives." He stressed that "the statements  attributed to Ja'akah are absolutely baseless and completely  fabricated." He declined to talk about Ja'akah's mental state  or go into the details of his personal life.    As for al-Amin Fahimah, he expressed his belief that  'Abd-al-Hamid Ja'akah "will withdraw his lies the moment he sees  me..., because I helped him a lot in several issues. And I  believe that the case will end the moment Ja'akah admits the  truth."    The two suspects' lawyer, Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, who attended  the interview, believes that "the great suffering" al-Amin  Khalifah and al-Miqrahi are experiencing is capable of "driving  those afflicted by it toward madness or introversion."</p>

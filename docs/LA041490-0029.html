			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'VIDEOS' AND DANGER  </P> <P> Concerning columnist Howard Rosenberg's criticism of "America's Funniest Home  Videos" as a danger to children (March 24 and April 9):  </P> <P> As a research assistant in epidemiology at UCLA I've been involved with a study  on mild brain injuries in children. For nearly a year I visited emergency rooms  looking for such cases, typically resulting from play activities -- the stuff  of "funny home videos."  </P> <P> I wouldn't be surprised if many of the children in the clips shown on TV ended  up in an emergency room with the symptoms of a mild brain injury or concussion.  I know because I've reviewed hundreds of ER charts.  </P> <P> Rosenberg did well to point out that each clip ends at the point of impact.  What happens afterward?  </P> <P> JULIA TASLIMI, Center for Injury Prevention, UCLA  </P></p>

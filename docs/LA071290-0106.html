			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> The Lakers want Akeem Olajuwon. If Patrick Ewing or David Robinson isn't the  best center in basketball, then Olajuwon is. And he isn't enamored of Houston.  But the Rockets, who have been made offers by other teams, apparently would  settle for nothing less from the Lakers than a big package including James  Worthy. . . .  </P> <P> With Olajuwon at center and Magic Johnson at guard, would it really matter that  much who played the other positions? . . .  </P> <P> I enjoyed "Rescue 911" on CBS Tuesday night, but the fill-in programming before  and after left me cold. . . .  </P> <P> One reason for the American League's recent dominance in the All-Star game is  that it has had a bigger talent pool than the National since expanding to 14  teams in 1977. . . .  </P> <P> Jose Canseco packs more excitement into a strikeout than any batter since  Reggie Jackson. . . .  </P> <P> Forget the raindrops. It was the lights that didn't seem right at Wrigley  Field. . . .  </P> <P> That game face must be pasted onto Tony LaRussa. . . .  </P> <P> St. Louis' gain will be California's loss if Joe Torre leaves the Angel  broadcasting booth to become Cardinal manager. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Scott, who has grown stale in Houston, would be a terrific pickup for some  pennant contender. . . .  </P> <P> Look for more than a couple of NFL rookies to hold out now that linebacker  Keith McCants, the fourth player taken in the draft, has signed a five-year,  $7.4-million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And just imagine how much  money McCants would have gotten if he hadn't lifted weights like a 258-pound  weakling at the NFL combine's camp. . . .  </P> <P> The New York Jets are being second-guessed for picking Rob Moore in the  supplemental draft and giving up a first-round choice next year. The wide  receiver from Syracuse is not a great runner with the ball after he catches it  and doesn't return kicks. . . .  </P> <P> Among those expected to go high in the 1991 draft are Miami defensive tackle  Russell Maryland, LSU running back Harvey Williams, Colorado running back Eric  Bieniemy, Florida linebacker Huey Richardson and Michigan defensive back Tripp  Welbourne. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Wade Boggs and Robin Williams. . . .  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas center David Butler, who had been contacted by eight teams --  including the Lakers -- after not being drafted, has reported to the Seattle  SuperSonics' rookie camp. . . .  </P> <P> Mike Ornstein, who spent 14 years in the Raider organization before leaving  last year, has been named director of club marketing by NFL Properties.  Ornstein is best known to national television audiences as the guy who pushed  CBS' Irv Cross out of the way on the sidelines during Super Bowl XVIII in  Tampa. . . .  </P> <P> The Clippers, who have had nearly as many publicists as coaches, are looking  for another following the departure of Bill Kreifeldt. . . .  </P> <P> I'm rooting for a nice lady named Nancy Lopez to win her first U.S. Women's  Open. . . .  </P> <P> Maybe people don't remember All-Star baseball game results as well as I thought  they did. Twice on TV, Jack Armstrong, the National League starting pitcher,  said the NL had lost three consecutive times before Tuesday night. It was only  two, but nobody bothered to correct him. . . .  </P> <P> You would think Trader Phil Esposito was still on the job, the way General  Manager Neil Smith of the New York Rangers has been making deals lately. . . .  </P> <P> News item: Mario Lemieux undergoes "successful" surgery on his back. Reaction:  That extends the streak of successful surgeries performed on athletes to  12,345. . . .  </P> <P> Has Maradona scored yet? . . .  </P> <P> The Jim Murray Handicap, to be run for the first time Friday night at Hollywood  Park, will replace one of the track's traditional graded stakes next year and  become a fixture of the summer meeting. . . .  </P> <P> The three Friday night cards in Inglewood have averaged 23,000 in attendance,  nearly double the 12,000 average for eight Friday afternoon cards. . . .  </P> <P> Highest weight assigned by Hollywood Park racing secretary Eual Wyatt all  meeting is the 128 pounds that Bayakoa, a 5-year-old mare, will carry in the  Vanity Handicap Sunday. The 1989 Kentucky Derby winner, Sunday Silence, was  assigned two pounds less in the Gold Cup. . . .  </P> <P> The U.S. Olympic team now has an official pain relief sponsor. . . .  </P> <P> Estel Johnson, who died Sunday at 77, was head track and field coach at  Jefferson High School during the glory days of the sport in the Los Angeles  school system. One reason the Coliseum Relays used to draw huge crowds was that  it was held in conjunction with the City meet. And no matter how prestigious  the open events, the kids' eight-man mile relay always stole the show. "And  here come the Jefferson Democrats!" the public address announcer would scream.  </P></p>

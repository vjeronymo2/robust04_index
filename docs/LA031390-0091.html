			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKHEED MACHINISTS WALK OUT IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY  </P> <P> Nearly 1,000 machinists union members at Lockheed Corp.'s aircraft service  subsidiary walked off their jobs Monday at four maintenance facilities in San  Bernardino County.  </P> <P> Members in Local Lodge 821 of the International Assn. of Machinists and  Aerospace Workers voted to strike after rejecting a proposal by Lockheed  Aircraft Service Corp.  </P> <P> Workers began picketing Monday morning outside the company's Upland, Chino and  two Ontario facilities. A total of 2,500 employees perform regular maintenance  and modification work at the four sites for the Air Force and Navy.  </P> <P> Lockheed spokesman John Daily said the facilities were continuing to operate  with salaried and supervisory employees.  </P> <P> Union representative Bob Gregory said the company's offer was inferior to the 3  1/2-year pact accepted last week by 18,000 machinists at Lockheed manufacturing  plants in Burbank, Sunnyvale, Calif., and Marietta, Ga.  </P> <P> As an example, Gregory said highly skilled workers at the Burbank plant were  given a 4% wage increase and a $2,500 signing bonus. The San Bernardino  members, he said, were offered a 3% increase and no signing bonus.  </P> <P> "We are dealing with a different lodge and with different issues," company  spokesman Daily said, adding that company policy kept him from discussing its  labor proposal.  </P> <P> Company and union officials said there were no plans for further negotiations.  </P></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Management: Adding up the cost of a give-away budget - Tony Allen warns finance directors that Norman Lamont may have plans up his sleeve that would damage their cash flow / Tax checklist Finance directors may have more to fear than look forward to in Norman Lamont's second Budget, now less than a fortnight away. Despite the expectations of tax cuts for all, March 10 may not be a red-letter day for everyone. Here is a checklist of the main items for finance directors to keep an eye on as they set - or re-set - their own budgets. INCOME TAX CHANGES Income tax is bound to be reduced - either by higher thresholds or lower rates - and while this is good news for taxpayers, it is not so good for their employers. A cut in income tax means a reduction in the amount the employer withholds from wages. At present, companies can hold on to the tax for up to three months before paying it to the Inland Revenue, although the average period is one-and-a-half months. Any reduction in the amount withheld will reduce the cash flow of companies: for each Pounds 1m a year of wages, the cost might be Pounds 500 in additional interest costs. The same principle holds true for any cut in National Insurance contributions. The basic rate of income tax can be important for companies in other ways. Those which borrow from non-banks are potentially liable to deduct income tax from interest payments. If the rate of tax falls, so will the amount of income tax that the borrower has to withhold - another hit on the cash flow. One positive effect could be for growing businesses, as a lower rate of income tax will set an equally lower rate of small companies' corporation tax. This would not benefit them until 1993 at the earliest, given the minimum nine-month delay in paying corporation tax. The small companies' rate now applies to the majority of companies in the UK. ADVANCE CORPORATION TAX Companies are required to pay ACT at the rate of income tax on all dividends. The ACT can be offset against the company's corporation tax, but with significant limitations. It has been estimated that these cost the UK corporate sector Pounds 400m a year. Representations on the way that ACT operates have been made for many years, but with little result. Any reduction in the rate of income tax will reduce the amount of ACT payable on future dividends, which must be good news. However, it will also reduce the amount of the offset in future years unless the rate of corporation tax is also reduced, of which so far there has been little indication. In other words, companies that are already suffering from having surplus ACT will be less able to relieve the surplus in the future. Since the accounting rules require surplus ACT to be treated as an additional tax charge, a reduction in the basic income tax rate will perversely cause an increase in many companies' tax charge in their accounts. INVESTMENT ALLOWANCES There has been much speculation on whether the Lawson Budget packages of the early 1980s - which cut the level of tax relief on capital investment - might be reversed. The old, first-year allowances, which gave full tax relief in the year of spend, were said at best to be irrelevant to investment decisions, and at worst to distort them. Now the Confederation of British Industry and others are asking that higher levels of allowances are reintroduced. This could be done in a number of ways. First-year allowances could be introduced on a higher level of annual relief (currently 25 per cent, on a reducing balance basis) on capital equipment. Alternatively, Lamont could set different rates for different types of investment, as is the case already in the US, Germany and Japan. It is unlikely that he will consider the lower level of allowances on buildings in the present climate. A straight-line basis gives equal relief over, say, four years with a 25 per cent rate. The reducing balance basis only gives 70 per cent relief over the same period. Introducing the straight-line basis would be a very easy change to make and would eliminate the UK's archaic system of calculating allowances and give higher relief at a stroke. The changes would only help those who are tax payers, or have been in the last three years. Moreover, there is also no new evidence that the decline in investment over the last couple of years is anything to do with the rate of allowances. The finance director will not get any early benefit from changes in allowances, since they will take effect only over a number of years and accounting rules on deferred taxation may require compensating deferred tax charges. While cash flow may be a little better next year, the company's reported profits may show no benefit. Finally, additional allowances can take a long time to produce any benefit. If additional reliefs are introduced from April 1 this year for a company that has an accounts date of March 31, the resulting reduction in tax will not help its cash flow until 1994. Even the most pessimistic commentators seem to accept that there should be some improvement in the economy by then. MONTHLY ACCOUNTING FOR VAT. In an attempt to forestall the national cash flow implications of the changes to VAT accounting in Europe in 1993, Customs &amp; Excise announced last November that the largest UK payers of VAT would be required to pay over their VAT more quickly, on a monthly basis (from the current quarterly basis) from this October. This will advance by an average of 45 days the VAT payments that these companies currently make. Some of those most affected are appealing to the courts that Customs is exceeding its statutory authority. One large group has estimated that the additional internal administration costs of meeting the proposal may be Pounds 1m. To forestall these problems, Lamont may feel that he should give the proposals more authority, and include them in his Budget. The author is a partners at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte</p>

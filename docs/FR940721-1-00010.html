R&hyph;2303A would be amended to exclude the Fort Huachuca/Libby AAF/Sierra Vista Municipal Airport from the restricted area and provide airspace for visual flight rules (VFR) access to the airport when R&hyph;2303A is in use. The proposal would lower the floor and ceiling and revise the lateral dimensions of R&hyph;2303B in order to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicle training profiles. R&hyph;2303B would be further subdivided by redesignating the southeast corner of the existing area as a separate restricted area, R&hyph;2303C. Additionally this notice proposes to reduce the published hours of operation for R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B. As proposed, the time of designation for the new area, R&hyph;2303C, would be intermittent by a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). These changes are proposed to accommodate increased training requirements and to return unneeded special use airspace to the National Airspace System (NAS). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before August 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Manager, Air Traffic Division, AWP&hyph;500 Docket No. 93&hyph;AWP&hyph;8, Federal Aviation Administration, P.

Comments that provide the factual basis supporting the views and suggestions presented are particularly helpful in developing reasoned regulatory decisions on the proposal. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, aeronautical, economic, and energy-related aspects of the proposal. Communications should identify the airspace docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address listed above. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments on this notice must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AWP&hyph;8.'' The postcard will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter. Send comments on environmental and land use aspects to: Commander, U.S. Army Garrison, Attn: Mr. John Murray ATZS-EHB, Fort Huachuca, AZ 85613&hyph;6000. All communications received on or before the specified closing date for comments will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposal contained in this notice may be changed in light of comments received. All comments submitted will be available for examination in the Rules Docket both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerned with this rulemaking will be filed in the docket.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRM's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Public Affairs, Attention: Public Inquiry Center, APA&hyph;220, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by calling (202) 267&hyph;3485. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11&hyph;2A, which describes the application procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA is considering an amendment to part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 73) to amend R&hyph;2303A to exclude from the restricted area the airspace from the surface to 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL), within a 3-nautical-mile radius of the Fort Huachuca/Libby AAF/Sierra Vista Municipal Airport. The airspace from the surface to 1,500 feet AGL within 1-nautical-mile either side of U.S. Highway 90 would also be excluded. This would provide VFR access to the airport when R&hyph;2303A is in use. R&hyph;2303B would be amended by relocating the northern boundary 3 miles south of its existing position. This would better accommodate hang gliding activity that takes place just outside of the northwest corner of existing R&hyph;2303B. R&hyph;2303B would also be subdivided to designate the southeastern section as a separate restricted area, R&hyph;2303C. This notice also proposes to lower the floor of R&hyph;2303B from 15,000 feet MSL to 8,000 feet MSL in order to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicle training profiles. The ceiling of R&hyph;2303B would be lowered from FL 450 to FL 300. This new subarea would extend from 8,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) to FL 300. The U.S. Army has determined that there is no longer a requirement for restricted airspace above FL 300, therefore, that airspace would be returned to the NAS. Lastly, the times of designation for R&hyph;2303A and R&hyph;2303B would be reduced from ``Monday-Saturday, 0700&hyph;1600 local time; other times by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance,'' to ``Monday-Friday, 0700&hyph;1600 local time; other times by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance.'' Activation of R&hyph;2303C would be intermittent by NOTAM at least 24 hours in advance. Designation of R&hyph;2303C is proposed to accommodate hang gliding activities that occur just outside of the southeastern corner of existing R&hyph;2303B. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Section 73.23 of part 73 of the Federal Aviation Regulations was republished in FAA Order 7400.8B dated March 9, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An environmental review of the proposal will be conducted by the U.S. Army and the FAA prior to an FAA final decision on the proposal. The results of the review will be addressed in any subsequent rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 73  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Airspace, Navigation (air).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 73 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

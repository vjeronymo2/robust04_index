			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. SCHOOLS MOVE TO STEM SPORTS-RELATED VIOLENCE  </P> <P> Principals of six schools in the Fullerton Union High School District on  Thursday adopted a policy that allows schools to suspend coaches or players who  are ejected from sports events, involved in altercations or leave the sidelines  or bench during an altercation.  </P> <P> The policy represents the toughest action yet in Southern California against  increasing violence at prep sports events.  </P> <P> "It got to the point where I was afraid to open Saturday morning's paper and  read about the next incident," said La Habra High School Principal Tom Triggs,  who proposed the policy. "I kept hearing, 'Something has to be done.' Well,  we've done something. It's in writing so every coach and player knows what is  expected."  </P> <P> Under the policy:  </P> <P> * Coaches or athletes who are ejected from a sports event will be suspended for  the next game.  </P> <P> * Any athlete who leaves the bench or sidelines during an altercation will be  suspended for the next game.  </P> <P> * Any athlete who assaults or strikes another athlete, coach or official will  be suspended from all prep athletics for one calendar year.  </P> <P> The policy was announced by representatives of the Freeway League, which  includes Buena Park, Fullerton, La Habra, Sonora, Sunny Hills and Troy high  schools.  </P> <P> Under current policy for the California Interscholastic Federation's Southern  Section, major incidents of violence are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by  section administrators. Thursday's action was in response to eight major,  violent incidents that have been reported in the Southern Section this school  year.  </P> <P> The incidents included an attack on two football officials by three Palmdale  players during a game at College of Canyons in Valencia; an attack on two  basketball referees by three Victor Valley players during a game at Moreno  Valley High School; an assault on a basketball referee by a fan at a Sunny  Hills-Fullerton game in Fullerton; and a fight between basketball players from  Servite High in Anaheim and St. Paul High in Santa Fe Springs after a game at  Servite.  </P> <P> Five of the eight incidents have been in Orange County, including a fight  between basketball players from Villa Park High and El Modena High in Orange.  After that incident, Walt Otto, Villa Park principal, said he would consider  playing next year's games between the schools in an empty gymnasium.  </P> <P> The Freeway League also plans to schedule a series of workshops for activity  directors, boosters, students and student advisers to review the rules and  regulations and to outline the responsibility of administrators for the  behavior of students at athletic events.  </P> <P> "Our next challenge is to come up with some type of policy for student sections  at the games," Triggs said.  </P> <P> George Giokaris, principal at Sunny Hills High in Fullerton, announced the  Freeway League's policy at the Southern Section's general council meeting. The  announcement drew applause from principals representing the section's 66  leagues.  </P> <P> Tom Jacobson, president of the section's executive committee and principal at  Corona del Mar High, said he hoped the section would follow the lead of the  Freeway League.  </P> <P> "Possibly some sectionwide decisions for all of us will come out of this,"  Jacobson said. "At the very least, I hope other leagues would take this  leadership from the Freeway League."  </P> <P> John Moore, girls athletic director at Trabuco Hills High in Mission Viejo and  a prominent basketball official at the high school and college level, also  applauded the new policy.  </P> <P> "The principals are sending a message to the athletes in writing," Moore said.  "It's good to see something like this come from the principals. This way, it's  not a coach's rule but the principal's rule, and that will carry more weight."  </P> <P> Julian Weaver, representative of the San Andreas League in northern San  Bernardino County and principal at Victor Valley High, said his league soon  will announce a similar policy. Weaver suspended three basketball players for  the season for attacking a referee in December at the Moreno Valley Tournament.  </P> <P> "We need a policy for high school athletes who seem to be emulating the actions  of professional and college athletes," Weaver said. "The current trend is  disturbing and we all need to do something about it."  </P> <P> Freeway League principals also adopted a rule that eliminates the coaching box  for its basketball coaches. Under current national rules for prep sports,  coaches are allowed to stand during the game in a three-foot-wide area known as  a coaching box.  </P> <P> Under the new Freeway League policy, coaches must remain seated at all times,  except during timeouts or when a player is injured.  </P> <P> "We recognize the volatile nature of the game of basketball and thought it  would be best if the coaches remain on the bench," Giokaris said.  </P> <P> Three years ago, the Southern Section adopted a "seat-belt" policy in which  coaches were required to remain seated, but the policy was dropped after one  season.  </P></p>

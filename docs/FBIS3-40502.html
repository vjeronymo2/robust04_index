In the present study, the configuration of the  experimental inlet is taken in computation as closely as  possible. The flowfield of the inlet including the throat cavity  region is discretized and solved simultaneously with the  external flow regions. The numerical results demonstrate the  flow behavior around the throat cavity for typical cases of mass  flow-plug and wall bleed. Comparison with the experimental  results for static pressure distributions and flow  characteristics shows reasonable agreement and also points up  the limitations of the two-dimensional analysis.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   The supersonic intake is an important configurational  element  which must handle either most or all of the compression  processes in air-breathing engines for supersonic aircraft. Many  of these supersonic intakes have bleed holes in the walls for  the purpose of preventing boundary layer separation and  improving intake start performance, and throat cavities to  stabilize the final shock wave. For this reason, the flow inside  the intake becomes very complex, and precisely predicting flow  sites is critical to the development of supersonic intakes.    Meanwhile, with improvements in computer performance and  advances in calculation techniques, there have been phenomenal  advances in mathematical computation technology, and the range  of applications broadens year after year. In the field of  compression flows, in particular, it has become possible to do  high-precision, stable calculations for high-Mach flow sites,  thanks to the development of the TVD scheme. As a result, it has  become relatively easy to analyze the flows inside supersonic  and scram-jet intakes, with an increasing number of such  analyses being done with each passing year.    In this research, we analyzed the flows inside supersonic  intakes having a cavity in the throat section, using the TVD  scheme and solving numerically with the Navier-Stokes equations.  We were thus able to simulate the flow conditions in the  vicinity of the cavity under various conditions. We also  compared the results of these calculations with the results of  wind tunnel tests done on models of the same  intakes.[.sup]1[/]  <H5>  2. Basic Formulas, Numerical Calculation Methods </H5> <H5>  2.1 Intake Model </H5>   In Figure 1 is presented a simplified view of the supersonic  intake used in the wind tunnel tests selected for our  computation subjects. This intake is called a mixed-compression  intake which uses both external and internal compression. It  performs external compression with four shock waves which are  produced from the ramp, and then performs internal compression  by three more shock waves from the cowl. The flow passes through  the final shock wave of the throat, is decelerated to subsonic  speed, and is pressure-restored by a diffuser. In a  mixed-compression intake it is necessary to hold the shock  wave(s) inside the channel. This means that we may expect large  separation to occur with it being impossible to avoid  interference between the shock wave(s) and the boundary layer.  For this reason, bleed holes are positioned in the ramp wall  just in front of the throat to suppress separation of the  boundary layer. The cavity that is made in the upper wall at the  throat is called a throat cavity and functions to hold the final  shock wave stably in the throat. From this cavity there is a  flow path which extends through to the outside of the intake.  Part of the flow inside the cavity passes through this path and  flows out of the intake. A flow plug that is provided at the  diffuser exit moves back and forth to control the flow volume  and thereby adjust the exhaust pressure, and is operated so as  to achieve the optimum start-up condition.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-19A>           Figure 1. Simplified Diagram of Supersonic Intake Test </FIG>    <H5>  2.2 Basic Formulas and Algorithms </H5>   The basic formulas used are the two-dimensional compressible  Navier-Stokes formula in which an ordinary coordinate system  (_x_, _ee_) is employed. The formula used for the viscosity  factor has been thin-layer approximated. This formula can be  expressed as follows.      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-19B>           Equation </FIG>    [Text]where       [Text]are determined as follows.       [Text]    where p is the pressure determined from state  equations for an ideal gas, U and V are  contravariant velocities, _g_ is the specific heat,  Pr is the Prandtl number, Re is the  Reynolds number, a is the speed of sound, and  J is a conversion Jacobian. When doing the  calculations, formula (1) is time-integrated with the  cross-braced ADI method,[.sup]2[/] and steady solutions are  obtained. The TVD scheme of Harten-Yee[.sup]3[/] is used in  discretizing the convection factors on the right side at this  time, so as to enhance the stability and shock-wave acquisition  capabilities at high Mach numbers. In discretizing the viscosity  factors, the central differences are used. The Baldwin-Lomax  algebraic model is used for the turbulence model.[.sup]4[/]  The cavity and external flow regions are not divided into blocks  or the like so that they can be calculated separately, but  handled by expanding them into a single calculation region. For  this reason, we wind up having grid points in the solid regions  of cowl and ramp wall also, but these grid points are restricted  so that the state volume does not change even when time  integration is performed. With this equation, it is not  necessary to determine the boundary values algebraically because  the calculation regions are connected, so the precision of the  calculation does not suffer. This is also effective for  supercomputer calculations.  <H5>  2.3 Calculation Grid </H5>   In Figure 2 is depicted the grid used in the calculations.  The grid numbers are 530 x 250 including grid points in the cowl  and other solid regions, and are generated algebraically. The  calculation region extends to the external regions as well as  the regions inside the intake. A channel extends from the inside  of the throat cavity to the external region, and part of the  flow inside the cavity is bled naturally to the outside. The  flow plug provided at the diffuser exit does not handle the same  shapes as are used in test models. Instead, the plug is  simplified by providing a second throat and the calculation is  done.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-20A>           Figure 2. Calculation grid (530 x 250) </FIG>    <H5>  3. Results of Numerical Calculations </H5>   In this analysis, the uniform-flow Mach number was set at  3.0, which is the design Mach number for this intake. The  Reynolds number was then matched with the test conditions, and  the calculations were performed under conditions of 2 x  10[.sup]6[/]. The conditions of the flow plug at the exit of  the diffuser are represented as Ae/At, using the throat area At  and the diffuser exit area Ae, and calculations were done for  three cases, with the value of Ae/At being 1.13, 0.94, and 0.86,  respectively.    In Figure 3 are represented the results of computations at  Ae/At = 1.13. At (a) the overall flow conditions in the intake  are depicted in terms of a Mach number distribution. At (b) we  have an enlargement of the throat vicinity. Four shock waves are  generated from the ramp wall and head for the cowl tip. Then  from the cowl we have three shock waves which extend as far as  the throat cavity to produce the shock wave pattern as designed.  The weak swell that is seen at the ramp wall just in front of  the throat cavity is due to bleeding. We can see a slightly  strong swell developing from above the cavity, and thus know  that the flow is circulating inside the cavity. Part of this  circulating flow passes through the duct which goes to the  outside of the intake and is thus bled off to the outside. A  strong compression wave and swell are visible at the back end of  the cavity. At (c) is seen a Schlieren photograph taken in the  vicinity of the throat in the tests. In this photograph we can  see the shock wave(s) coming from the cowl and the way in which  they reach as far as above the cavity, as well as the  compression wave and swell from the back end of the cavity. Thus  we see how well the results of the numerical calculations  simulate the flow conditions inside the intake. At (d) we  compare the wall pressure distributions obtained by the  calculations and the pressure distributions from the tests. The  pressure distribution above the ramp wall agrees well with the  pressure rise from the four shock waves as far as the throat  cavity. Also, the pressure first declines over the cavity, and  then rises again due to the shock wave which is generated from  the back end of the cavity. However, under these conditions, no  final shock wave exists, and the flow does not become subsonic  even beyond the end of the throat, so the optimal conditions are  not attained.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-21A>           Figure 3. Calculation Results (Ae/At = 1.13) </FIG>      In Figure 4 are plotted the results of calculations at Ae/At  = 0.94. First of all, from (a), when we look at the condition of  the flow on the upstream side from the throat, there is no  change from the computed results under the conditions previously  indicated. This is because the entire flow upstream from the  throat is supersonic, and because the effects of the flow plug  change are not propagated this far. Meanwhile, a terminal shock  wave appears a little behind the throat cavity. This was not  seen in the previous case(s). This shock wave appears to  interfere with the compression wave from the back of the throat  cavity and curve in an arc. In the Schlieren photograph at (c)  we see a curved terminal shock wave a little toward the throat  cavity. However, as may be seen from the computational results,  this shock wave itself does not curve, but it appears to curve  due to the interference between the terminal shock wave and the  shock wave from behind the throat cavity. Compared to the  previous case(s), the influence of the presence of this shock  wave is great. Based on the wall pressure distributions plotted  in (d), the pressure rise that occurs near the throat is far  higher than in the previous case(s) when no terminal shock wave  existed.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-22A>           Figure 4. Computation Results </FIG>      In Figure 5 is represented the flow at Ae/At = 0.86 where  the  flow plug is further constrained. In this condition also the  flow upstream from the throat is entirely supersonic, and  exhibits no change from the other cases. Basically the condition  of the flow in the vicinity of the throat is the same as the  Ae/At = 0.94 case, but the position of the terminal shock wave  is slightly aft in this case. The interference with the  compression wave near the cavity has disappeared, and a single  terminal shock is formed. From the Schlieren photograph at (c)  we can see that this shock wave appears farther forward than in  the previous case(s), and the shape thereof is not really curved  but is close to a straight line. Thus we see that the  calculations agree well with the results obtained from the  tests. We see a further pressure rise in the pressure  distributions in (d). However, when we compare these pressure  distributions against the test values, the computation results  always predict higher values. The reason for this is that, in  the tests, the intake is a duct with a rectangular  cross-section, and is incapable of exhibiting a completely  two-dimensional flow. Accordingly, we must consider the  possibility of the effects of eddies which are produced in  corners where separation is believed to exist which is  equivalent to the separation seen above the ramp and cowl  wall(s), even at the side walls. These eddies reduce the intake  efficiency, and adequate pressure rise is not achieved.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-23A>           Figure 5. Computation Results </FIG>      In Figure 6 is represented the relationship between captured  flow volume (Gco) and total pressure recovery rate  (Pr). The captured flow volume is roughly constant up  to the point where the flow plug is closed to a certain point,  and the total pressure recovery rate increases as the flow plug  is closed.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-24A>           Figure 6. Intake Characteristics </FIG>       The captured flow volume decreases from certain conditions  because the terminal shock wave reaches a point above the throat  cavity, the flow downstream from the shock wave is pushed inside  the cavity, and this flows out to the outside. The test results  are also noted in this graph. When we compare these to the  computed results, we see that there is qualitative agreement in  the trends, but the computed values for both the total pressure  recovery rate and captured flow volume are higher. We can say  nothing for sure about the reason for this, but a disparity  appears in the pressure distributions due to  three-dimensionality, and the cavity bleed hole is  three-dimensional. Hence the possibility that this also is due  to three-dimensionality is great.  <H5>  4. Summary </H5>   We simulated the flow inside a mixed compression type  supersonic intake having a cavity in the throat section, using  the TVD scheme to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. In the  analysis, we handled the intakes of complex shape in single  computational regions. This enabled us to perform highly  efficient calculations. In making comparisons with test results,  we found that the numerical calculations represent well the  changes in flow conditions due to opening and closing the flow  plug, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the numerical  calculations. On the down side, these analyses also demonstrated  the limitations of two-dimensional analysis. In the actual  intakes, we think that there is considerable influence from the  boundary layer at the side walls, but we were unable to take  this into consideration with the two-dimensional analysis. For  this reason, in the static pressure distributions, the  computation results always predict higher values than the test  results downstream of the throat where the presence of large  separation is predicted. Accordingly, if more precise  intra-intake flows need to be predicted, it will probably be  necessary to go to three-dimensional analysis.

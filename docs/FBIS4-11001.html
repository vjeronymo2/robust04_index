			<p>BFN     [Text] The Movement of Young Patriots [MOJEP] calls on the  healthy forces of the country to stand in the way of the  stateless persons. Those who staged the coup wanted to create a  situation favorable to drug trafficking, according to statements  by a MOJEP official.    [Begin unidentified MOJEP official recording, in Creole]  Press declaration by MOJEP: We in the coordinating body of  MOJEP call on the Haitian people to (?understand) why the  Haitian Army and parliament staged the coup d'etat. (?The reason  why) all phony political leaders, senators, and deputies of the  State Department have plotted against democracy in order to  crush the people is to maintain thieves, drug dealers, and  zenglendos [pejorative for those who carry out tasks for the  Macoutes] within the Army and crooked dealers in the parliament.  This is due to the fact that the State Department knows that if  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns to power, it will not  be able to lead properly the drug trafficking in the country.  In that sense, MOJEP calls on all militants, people's  organizations, and staunch political parties that side with the  people to throw their support behind President Aristide's battle  so democracy can be established in the country.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter De Ionno] </F>   [Text] The "Blue Berets" of the National Peacekeeping Force  [NPKF] are to be deployed in township battle zones this week.  On Tuesday [11 April], 1,300 members of Battalion 2 of the NPKF  will leave the De Brug training camp near Bloemfontein for the  East Rand, where they will take over from the SADF's [South  African Defense Force] Group 41. Another 2,000 peacekeepers  will be deployed from the base after further training. Other  NPKF troops, being evaluated after their initial training at  Koeberg near Cape Town, are expected to be sent to Natal in the  last week of this month.    One of the three senior offices dismissed from the NPKF  earlier this week, Captain Johan Loots, said he would begin  legal steps tomorrow to challenge his sacking. The NPKF  dismissed the officer for allegedly arranging an unauthorised  media visit to the De Brug camp and dealing with the media  without approval. Captain Loots, a media liaison officer  seconded from the SAP [South African Police], said he had been  made a scapegoat "because the NPKF has had negative publicity".  "I always acted within the code of conduct," he said.    NPKF liaison officer Major Muff Anderson said certain media  statements had "created antagonism between the troops and the  TEC [Transitional Executive Council] ". Colonel Duma Mdutyana,  NPKF chief of staff, and Lieutenant-Colonel George Sibanyoni,  former commander of Battalion 1, were also relieved of their  duties on April 5 after NPKF commander Major-General Gabriel  Ramushwana was informed of court cases pending against them.    Colonel Mdutyana is facing a charge of drunken driving in an  NPKF vehicle in Johannesburg on March 20. Colonel Sibanyoni was  charged with culpable homicide after the NPKF vehicle he was  driving was involved in a fatal accident in Mamelodi on the  weekend of March 11-13.</p>

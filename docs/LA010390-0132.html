			<p><P> January 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STORMS PERIL TANKER, COULD RELEASE 60 MILLION GALLONS  </P> <P> Storms building up in the Atlantic threaten to break a crippled Iranian  supertanker in two and release nearly 60 million gallons of crude oil into the  sea off the Moroccan coast, official sources said today.  </P> <P> The threatened disaster would be six times larger than the Exxon Valdez spill  in Alaska last March and the sixth biggest ever in the world.  </P> <P> The Amoco Cadiz, responsible for the fifth largest, dumped about 65 million  gallons off France in 1978.  </P> <P> The weather here is expected to worsen in the next 24 hours, building a sea  swell that would make floating booms useless in efforts to save Moroccan  vacation beaches and fishing grounds from serious pollution.  </P> <P> About 20 million gallons of oil have already poured from the listing  284,632-ton Kharg-5 tanker, holed by fire and explosions 15 days ago, and  crippled with jammed steering.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by F. Metaoui: "Security: The Foreign Women's </F> Tragedy"]    [Text] The International Committee To Support Algerian  Intellectuals (CISIA) set up in Berlin, Germany, intends to  start, next March, an awareness campaign on the serious  situation existing in Algeria.    The committee was set up a few days after Smail Yefsah's  assassination, last October; in addition to its normal  activities, it has been concerned for some time by the flow of  foreign families residing in Algeria who return to their native  country.    According to Mr. Sadek Kebir, a member of the German CISIA,  the situation is dramatic. "Recently, we were contacted by  foreign women married to Algerians and who lived in our country  for a long time, among the working class. Since armed groups  started attacking foreigners, they left Algeria, against their  will. All of a sudden, they find themselves in Germany, in the  Netherlands, in Poland, or in Russia, where they have  practically no family," Mr. Kebir observed; he believes that  these women discover that their countries are totally different,  and therefore have problems adjusting. "The entire world is  looking at us."    "We must study the situation of these foreign women. If  someone is to be murdered because of who he is, we might perhaps  understand that, but attacking innocent individuals because they  don't look like Algerians, shooting at them, that is racism or  even fascism," he said, adding that these women are sounding the  alarm bell. "If we let that happen, neither the world nor  history will forgive us," he said gravely.    For Sadek Kebir, it becomes imperative to appeal to the  people to make them understand that these foreigners "must enjoy  every protection." In support of his position, he pointed out  that in Germany, as everywhere else in Europe, the Algerian  people enjoy a good reputation for their sense of hospitality.  "Distrust of foreigners must disappear."    "The women who contacted us said that they want to live in  Algeria but are afraid of terrorism," Mr. Kebir stated, adding  that the FLN [National Liberation Front] regime did a lot of  damage in that it consistently denied Algerian citizenship to  foreigners who applied for it.    "The women who called on us came back with their children.  Before leaving with their mothers, these children attended  Algerian state schools. What are we going to do with these  children who, until proven otherwise, are Algerians?" Faced with  these many problems, the CISIA is creating a European  association to support these families in distress, help them get  through these bad times, and show "our full solidarity."    "For us, the essential is to publicize the problem and  inform  public opinion."    In addition, Mr. Kebir stated that applications for  political  asylum in Germany are not as numerous as is generally thought.  "People must know that applications for asylum are not processed  at state level. German law gives German institutions full  latitude to decide on such demands. It is a mere problem of  legality, not high-level politics," he said, indicating that the  CISIA is attempting by all means to inform the Germans as to the  situation that prevails in the country.    "We would like to make them aware of the violence. If  Algeria  must face this phenomenon today, the entire Maghreb will be  affected tomorrow, although the Europeans have begun to grasp  what is at stake since the Yugoslav conflict broke out."    Mr. Kebir denies the fact that Germany is used as a rear  base  by Islamist fundamentalists. "Although it is true that the FIS  [Islamic Salvation Front] is known in this country, nevertheless  Germany has self-respecting institutions. The State is far from  supporting any form of activism," he indicated. In closing we  should note that the CISIA will soon have representatives in  Amsterdam, Holland.</p>

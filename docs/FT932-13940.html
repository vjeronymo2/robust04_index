			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Dutch insurer invests Pounds 240m in Scottish Equitable AEGON, the Dutch-based insurance group, has invested Pounds 240m in Scottish Equitable Life Assurance Society in a move which will give it effective control of the policyholder-owned company and provide it with badly-needed capital. Scottish Equitable is the largest company to 'demutualise' through an acquisition. Industry analysts have predicted demutualisation will accelerate as policyholder-owned companies seek capital for expansion. Scottish Equitable said it sought a partner because it could not sustain growth without more capital. As a mutual, its only capital is the reserves of its policyholders. The transaction gives Aegon, one of Europe's largest insurance companies, access to one of the UK's top life insurance and pensions franchises. 'It's creeping demutualisation,' said Mr Bob Yates, analyst with stockbrokers Fox-Pitt Kelton. The deal involves an unusual structure which will allow Scottish Equitable to maintain some of the characteristics of a mutual company, one of the key stumbling blocks for other companies considering similar moves. The two companies will set up a new company to be named Scottish Equitable Plc and Scottish Equitable will transfer all its existing business to it. The deal is dependent on the approval of with-profits policyholders, insurance regulators and the UK courts. Premium payments and investment returns of all current and future with-profits policies will be insulated in a pool, and profits from this pool will be owned solely by policyholders. This pool will receive Pounds 200m from Aegon and some of this will be distributed as a one-off bonus, estimated at 40 per cent of one year's bonus payment, to policyholders. Other unit-linked business - the fastest growing portion of Scottish Equitable's business - will be contained in a separate pool whose profits will be 60 per cent owned by the with-profits policyholders and 40 per cent owned by Aegon. Aegon will inject Pounds 40m in capital to this business. Aegon can increase its share of profits to 50.1 per cent with additional injections of capital by 1999. The interests of the with-profits policyholders are protected through a voting trust which will appoint directors to the new company. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Letter: 'Wise man' letter a serious contribution to public debate Sir, I was surprised by your economics correspondent's account of my open letter to the Treasury Panel (' 'Wise man' attacks wisdom of fellow economists', March 6). I would not dream of embarking on public criticism of my fellow panellists' intellectual capabilities, for which I have in any case a high regard. The point of my letter was to suggest their professional interests have been misdirected. In particular, I believe they have been mistaken in failing to integrate money and banking into their analysis and forecasting of Britain's economy. Your readers may be interested to know that I proposed during the panel's discussions that a section on 'monetary developments' be included in the report. I received no support for this proposal from any of the other panellists. I regard the future behaviour of the British economy as strongly influenced by the rate of (broad) money growth. Specifically, if broad money growth between now and end-1994 is 30 per cent I would expect the level of economic activity and prices in 1995 to be very different than if it were 5 per cent. But one member of the panel - Mr Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs - said explicitly in his submission that he was sceptical that faster monetary growth (due, say, to a change in funding policy) would have any significant impact on the economy. As far as I can tell, none of the panel thought that changes in the rate of monetary growth could cause subsequent changes in economic activity. I am, of course, open to correction and would like to think that I have misunderstood my fellow panellists' views on this matter. May I suggest two questions for them to clarify their views? They might perhaps answer in your columns. Is the equivalence of the demand for and supply of money balances an important aspect of macroeconomic equilibrium? If so, what definition of the quantity of money is relevant to the determination of that equilibrium? I would also like to express surprise at the various comments on my open letter made by some of the panellists. These included references to 'immoderation', 'excitability', 'unhelpfulness', even 'craziness' and the possibility of libel proceedings. As a matter of fact, none of the panellists had been sent the letter when they ventured these remarks, as it was still at the printers or in the post over the weekend in question. I intended the letter to be a serious contribution to a public debate which is of vital importance to the future of our country. I had hoped it would be taken in this spirit.

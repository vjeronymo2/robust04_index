The new edition of The Which? Guide to Divorce published last week and The Divorce Handbook out on 10 September, both deal with the bread and butter issues of the effect of divorce on finances, ways of cutting down on legal costs and the effect of law changes on the custody of children. Both have separate chapters on divorce in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Which? Guide to Divorce by Helen Garlick, Consumers' Association and Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 10.99. The Divorce Handbook by Fiona Shackleton and Olivia Timbs, Farrer &amp; Co, Pounds 6.99.</p>

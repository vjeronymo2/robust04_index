			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Yamaha Motor reverses 39% in first half YAMAHA Motor, a leading Japanese motorcycle maker, posted a sharp downturn in interim earnings due to heavy foreign exchange losses following the appreciation of the yen against the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono. The company said non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the first half to September fell 39.7 per cent to Y1.5bn (Dollars 13.9m) due to a Y12bn currency loss. Half-year sales eased 0.5 per cent to Y223.6bn, while after-tax profits plunged 37 per cent to Y780m. Domestic sales fell 6.2 per cent to Y86.5bn while exports gained 3.8 per cent to Y137.1bn thanks to brisk demand from China. Sales of mainline motorcycles fell 0.7 per cent to Y107.8bn. For the full year to March, Yamaha expects unconsolidated pre-tax profits to fall 29.6 per cent to Y3.5bn on a 4.5 per cent decline in sales to Y450bn.</p>

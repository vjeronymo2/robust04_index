The 30,000-mt reserve was released to at-sea processing operations on September 4, and an additional 24,000 mt of the initial shoreside allocation was made available for at-sea processing on October 1. In 1992, factory trawlers again harvested 117,000 mt, motherships received 36,000 mt and 56,000 mt was delivered to shoreside processing plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more detailed discussion of the history of this fishery through 1992 is contained in the March 18, 1993  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 14543) and in the Council's EA/RIR for this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1993  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1993, the first 112,000 mt of the 142,000 mt harvest guideline was available for open competition (``olympic fishery''), with the remaining 30,000 mt held in reserve for shoreside processing. This assumed that vessels delivering shoreside would harvest about 12,000 mt during the olympic fishery, for a total of 42,000 mt for the year. When it became apparent that shoreside deliveries were substantially lower than expected during the olympic fishery, an emergency rule was issued that prohibited processing at sea when 100,000 mt was taken by the at-sea processing sector. Therefore, 42,000 mt was reserved for vessels delivering shoreside in 1993. The regulations also included a provision for releasing any unneeded portion of the shoreside allocation on September 1, to ensure the harvest guideline would be fully utilized. However, shore-based processors used their entire allocation and no additional whiting were made available for processing at sea in 1993. The at-sea processing sector harvested 99,103 mt in 1993 (84,588 mt by catcher/processors and 14,515 mt by vessels that delivered to motherships). Shore-based landings were about 41,859 mt in 1993. In total, 140,962 mt of whiting were caught in 1993, over 99 percent of the 142,000 mt harvest guideline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fleet composition in the 1994 whiting fishery may be quite different than in 1992 and 1993. A license limitation (``limited entry'') program was implemented under Amendment 6 to the FMP, and became effective on January 1, 1994. The limited entry program requires trawl vessels targeting on groundfish to have a limited entry permit. Limited entry permits were issued to vessels that landed a minimum amount of groundfish during the window period (July 11, 1984_August 1, 1988). Permits also were issued to vessels purchased or under construction or conversion during the window period that later had a certain level of participation in the fishery. The permits may be bought and sold. Therefore, the traditional vessels that were active in the whiting fishery during the window period initially received permits while entrants after 1988 (which includes the catcher/processor fleet) are not able to operate in the fishery unless they buy or lease permits sufficient for these vessels to operate. In 1993, 16 catcher/processors operated in the whiting fishery. As of January 20, 1994, it appears that one catcher/processor may initially receive a limited entry permit while several others might acquire enough limited entry permits to operate as a catcher/processor (rather than a mothership) in the 1994 whiting fishery. However, the catcher/processor fleet is expected to be much smaller than in 1992 and 1993_the whiting market is weak and too few permits are likely to be available for purchase to accommodate the entire whiting catcher/processor fleet. The final composition of the whiting fleet for 1994 and beyond will not be known until the fishery is underway, but it is clear that future participation by the catcher/processor fleet will be constrained by implementation of the limited entry program in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

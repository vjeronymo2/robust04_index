			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL THAT COUNTS IS AN HONEST COUNT;  </P> <P> ABSENTEE BALLOT SNAFU IN ORANGE COUNTY CLOUDS ATTORNEY GENERAL RESULT.  </P> <P> The absentee ballot has joined big money and television as a formidable weapon  in California politics. The secretary of state's office estimates that 20% of  voting in the recent election, an all-time high, was done by mail. It wasn't by  accident. Both major parties, especially the Republicans through a statewide  campaign, mobilized absentee voters.  </P> <P> But what has happened this time in Orange County, long a bastion of Republican  strength, illustrates that the system of verifying absentee ballot signatures  is too loosely supervised and too open to manipulation, especially in a close  election.  </P> <P> A superior court judge last weekend took the unusual step of halting the  absentee count, pending a hearing scheduled for Friday. Democrat Arlo Smith,  locked in a bitterly contested and close race for state attorney general with  Republican Dan Lungren, challenged the tabulating methods of the registrar of  voters on the grounds that nobody was checking the authenticity of signatures  on absentee ballot applications.  </P> <P> The secretary of state's office permits registrars either to verify ballot  signatures against original affidavits of registration or against the  applications for ballots. Orange County's method of checking against original  registration is typical of big counties. But the Smith camp has charged that  GOP workers may have submitted applications illegally by forging signatures for  real voters.  </P> <P> If that had happened, a registrar's office like Orange County's, which does not  check signatures on applications, would never catch meddling partisans. If the  system is to have integrity, campaign workers should not be the equivalent of  travel agents for voters. Absentee voters should submit their own applications.  </P> <P> Another problem, evident in Los Angeles County, must be resolved as the  absentee ballot sweepstakes grow. There the number of absentee ballots received  was huge -- actually exceeding the total vote in some states. But nearly 13,000  were invalidated -- even though some bore local postmarks as early as Nov. 1 or  2. It seems that the state Election Code says the delivery time, not the  postmark, is what matters for a vote to count. Change the law so that the  postmark, not the date received, counts.  </P> <P> As more people vote by absentee ballot, and as campaigns gear up to attract  those voters, the Legislature must ensure that: 1) Absentee voters submit their  own applications; 2) ballots submitted on time are not discounted because the  mail carrier is running late.  </P></p>

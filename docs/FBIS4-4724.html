			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman on DPRK's Position on UNSC `Presidential </F> Statement'" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Since the United States  has opted the one-sided way to put pressure on the DPRK,  reversing all its commitments with the DPRK, we cannot but  normalize our peaceful nuclear activities frozen unilaterally  for DPRK-USA talks, said a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign  Ministry in a statement released Monday.    Noting that the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] on  March 31 published its "presidential statement" imposing an  unreasonable demand upon the DPRK, the spokesman said:    It is obviously contrary to the purpose and principle of the  UN Charter that the UN Security Council whose mission it is to  guarantee world peace and security discussed our issue on the  basis of the unreasonable and prejudiced "conclusion" of the  Board of Governors of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy  Agency] that the "scope of noncompliance with the safeguards  agreement has expanded".    If the UN Security Council is truly to discharge its  mission,  it should take issue with the United States which is gravely  threatening peace and security of the Korean peninsula with  huge nuclear weapons, laying obstacles to the solution of the  nuclear issue, and the South Korean authorities, its henchmen.    It must not go unnoticed that the UN Security Council  unreasonably took issue with the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear  activities, while turning a blind eye to the countries which are  hell bent on a dangerous nuclear gambling under the patronage of  the United States.    This shows that the UN Security Council is playing into the  hands of the United States in executing the latter's hostile  policy of stifling the DPRK, applying double standards.    This time the UN Security Council sympathized with the  United  States' hostile policy against the DPRK by including the  question of compliance with the safeguards agreement in the  "presidential statement", disregarding the essence of our  "nuclear issue" on purpose.    The effect of the safeguards agreement has virtually been at  a standstill from the moment when the DPRK temporarily suspended  the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) for talks between the DPRK and  the United States.    The call for compliance with the safeguards agreement and  additional inspection, therefore, does not make sense at all for  the DPRK now in a publicly recognized special status.    We have consistently maintained the steadfast policy of  independence and correct lines in external relations and never  changed our once clarified position.    The UNSC should first take a measure to set right the  unreasonable act of the IAEA Secretariat in expanding the scope  of partiality against us, kowtowing to big countries, before  demanding an additional inspection of us.    The IAEA Secretariat must make a due apology for its acts in  further widening the scope of partiality, openly joining force  with the United States in its intrigues against the DPRK.    We will surely call the IAEA Secretariat to account for  expanding partiality against us stage by stage, instead of  making an apology.    Now, the United States is becoming all the more undisguised  in its moves to step up a campaign for international pressure on  our republic by setting in-motion the Board of Governors of the  IAEA and the UNSC.    Since the United States has opted the one-sided way to put  pressure on us, reversing all its commitments with us, we could  not but normalize our peaceful nuclear activities unilaterally  frozen for the DPRK-USA talks.    The United States and the South Korean authorities are  intending to escalate the campaign for pressure on us with the  UNSC "presidential statement" as the starting-point, but it can  never work with us.    The more desperately the United States and its followers try  to stifle the socialist system of our own style, the more  immensely the might of the singlehearted unity of our party,  people and People's Army will increase.    It is our unshakable will and policy to answer strength with  strength, dialogue with dialogue.    The United States' hostile policy of stifling the DPRK is  sure to end in failure.    Consistent is our stand to seek a peaceful solution of the  nuclear issue.</p>

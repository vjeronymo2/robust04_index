			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [APA report: "Verdict for Kuessel Overruled"] </F>   [Text] Vienna -- The Supreme Court of Justice partly set  aside the verdict on the neo-Nazi leader Gottfried Kuessel  yesterday. The founder of the "Extraparliamentary Opposition  Loyal to the People" was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for  illegal National Socialist activities.    The judges ruled that the directions to the jury regarding  individual charges were insufficient. A new trial is now  necessary, and a new verdict must be passed.</p>

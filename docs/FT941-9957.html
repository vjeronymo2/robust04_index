			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland's US arm in black Bank of Ireland has finally staunched the financial haemorrhage at its US subsidiary. New Hampshire-based Bank of Ireland First Holdings has cost the group over Dollars 700m (Pounds 470m) since 1988 when the clearing bank first ventured into the US market. BOIFH yesterday reported its first-ever pre-tax profit of Dollars 8m for the 1993 year, achieved on income of Dollars 200m. In 1992 a loss of Dollars 77m on income of Dollars 228m was reported, while losses in 1991 amounted to Dollars 123m. Loan loss provisions were reduced from Dollars 64.6m to Dollars 23.7m, while non-performing assets have been cut from Dollars 136m to Dollars 31m. Mr Pat Molloy, chief executive, said that the US subsidiary was now 'well-positioned' to take advantage of a gradual economic recovery in the New Hampshire region, and is expected to make 'a significant contribution to group profitability in 1994-95'.</p>

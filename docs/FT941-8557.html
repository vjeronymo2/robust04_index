			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Asian Aerospace (9): Growth that must be measured  -Michael Donne on the need for a region-wide air traffic development plan Air traffic to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region is expected to double from its present level to reach nearly 200m passengers a year by the end of this decade, and double again to nearly 400m by 2010, representing average annual growth of around 8.5 per cent, against the expected figure of some 5.9 per cent for the rest of the world. As a result, pressures for big improvements in aviation infrastructure - airports (including runways, terminals and access), local air traffic control, en route long-range navigation aids, and improved voice and data communications between air and ground - are already intensifying. The International Air Transport Association has warned that failure to provide adequate infrastructure could have a detrimental effect on the entire region's economic and social development which is largely dependent on flourishing air transport and tourist industries. The anticipated growth will mean not only more passengers moving through airports, with all that entails for more and larger facilities, and improved surface access, but also a big rise in the number of aircraft movements both on the ground and along the air routes as flight frequencies increase, even allowing for the use of bigger aircraft with increased seating densities. While the growth in passenger traffic and aircraft numbers inexorably continues, Iata is consistently targeting governments throughout the region to ensure that they are fully aware of the problems ahead. The increase in individual airlines' fleet sizes will be enormous. Forecasts by the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, the world's biggest builder of jets, show that up to 2010, out of a world total requirement of some 12,000 new jetliners, worth about Dollars 815bn - of which 75 per cent will be needed for growth and 25 per cent to replace ageing or environmentally unacceptable aircraft - more than 3,000 aircraft, worth about Dollars 245bn, will be needed in the broad Asia-Pacific region, which will constitute about half the world's jetliner market outside the US itself. Boeing says: 'Asia's robust air travel market is driven by - and in turn drives - the region's economy. In 1992, Asia generated about a quarter of the world's gross domestic product. That will increase to nearly 30 per cent by 2010. Over the past two decades, economic growth in Asia has more than doubled, averaging 5.2 per cent a year, compared with a 3 per cent growth rate for the rest of the world.' Excluding the US, the rest of the world's top 10 airliner-buying countries in the period to 2010 will include five Asian nations, with the others being Canada and in western Europe, according to Boeing. Japan is expected to buy more than 600 jet airliners, worth about Dollars 60bn (in 1993 dollars), to meet an annual traffic growth rate of 9.2 per cent. China should also be on the acquisition path for some 800 aircraft worth Dollars 40bn, to meet a 14.7 per cent growth rate. Other big buyers will be South Korea (Dollars 22bn), Australia (Dollars 19bn) and Singapore (Dollars 18bn). Traffic growth rates in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia will also be high, indicating substantial fleet requirements. Because of the long distances involved in air links between many countries in the region, and with the rest of the world, much of the present ordering is concentrated on the new generation of wide-bodied medium and long-range jetliners. About half of the Boeing 747 long-range jets ordered outside the UK to date is accounted for by Asian airlines, while such airlines are also prominent in the order books for the new Airbus A-330 medium-range jet and the long-range A-340. Coping with the growth on the ground is already a headache. Iata points out that Bombay, Seoul and Tokyo-Narita airports, for example, have severe passenger handling problems, while Bangkok, Hong Kong, Sydney, Osaka and Narita suffer from runway and apron constraints. Construction and expansion are planned or under way at all these locations - the new Kansai airport on an artificial island in Osaka Bay, the new Chek Lap Kok at Lantau island in Hong Kong, and for Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, for example, with new airports on the way for Bangkok, Bombay and Seoul, and new runways and terminals planned for Narita and Sydney. But Iata has warned that because of intervening traffic growth, some of these new facilities are likely to be congested almost as soon as they are operational. At the same time, there will be significant increases in local traffic within the region as many countries expand their aviation activities - many new local airports are already under construction or being planned in China, for example, where its fleet will be dominated by short-to-medium range jets. These developments in turn are already generating the need for the introduction throughout the region of new, up-to-date systems of air traffic control in congested air spaces around big airports, as well as for the latest satellite-based Fans (future air navigation systems). The latter in various forms are now in an advanced stage of development by the world commercial aviation community for both local air traffic control and long-range air navigation. The International Civil Aviation Organisation  -the aviation technical agency of the UN, Iata itself, Inmarsat (the international satellite organisation), national governments, civil aviation authorities, airlines, the avionics industry and national telecommunications authorities are involved in a concerted operation to perfect the technical and regulatory aspects of such satellite-based systems. The introduction of such systems is inevitable - successful trials have already been conducted - and the overall concept has been described as a revolution in civil aviation as far-reaching as the original introduction of the jet engine. But Iata also stresses that all the new, expanded and improved facilities - airports, air traffic control and air navigation - must be introduced in a coherent and orderly fashion. 'Unless multinational planning becomes a feature of the Asia-Pacific region, then aviation growth and wealth creation will be restricted while congestion and delays will grow to at least European proportions,' says Iata. Mr John Meredith, its senior director of corporate communications, who has been running the international air transport action group aimed at achieving global improvements in aviation infrastructure facilities, believes that the best way of achieving this coherent approach is through the medium of a major conference of all the Asia-Pacific transport ministers. Until a region-wide aviation development plan is conceived, infrastructural expansion throughout the Asia-Pacific will continue to be piecemeal, patchy and possibly even inadequate to meet the expected growth in air traffic over the next century.</p>

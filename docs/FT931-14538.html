			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: Meistersinger at the Met - Opera The plot of Wagner's bourgeois comedy may hinge on the matter of singing, but this, as much as any of his works, is also an opera for orchestra. The orchestra's is the first dramatic voice we hear, telling us about Eva's and Walther's sidelong glances in church; then in the third act comes Wagner's most virtuoso study in opera without voices, for the mime episode of Beckmesser's sneaking into Sachs's workshop. Elsewhere too - in the kerfuffle at the end of the second act, or at the entry of the masters in the third - scenic events seem to be there as vehicles for orchestral luxury. James Levine, who of course conducts the Met's new production, is not one to avoid his opportunities, and his patronage once again, as for the Ring here, of the team of Otto Schenk (producer) and Gunther Schneider-Siemssen (sets) is not the action of a man keen to set some alternative fire alight on the stage. But he unfolds the orchestral splendour in a curious way. The overture is staggeringly dull, with a smooth string-led sound wherever possible and everything entombed in a perfectly even march tempo. Total absence of thrill. Total absence of heedlessness. And when, as so often, Mr Levine chooses to lavish care on a scene as a study in passacaglia or a sequence of motivic variations, the exercise is as self-contained and as unprovoking as if one were reading it in a treatise. The prelude to the third act, taken so slowly, by far exaggerates the premonitions of Parsifal; the playfulness of the apprentices as all lumpish - and thereby sadly consonant with their appearance and stage behaviour. Only the finale starts to come to life with a large, long breath, but then the achievement is mostly the impressive chorus's. The cast is generally less secure. When Francisco Araiza gets to the prize song, one at last understands why he might want to be singing Walther: the sound is rapturous and the style good, both together well conveying the impression of a young nobleman. But he needs to save himself earlier in order to get there, and a feeling of strain hovers around. Karita Mattila as Eva also has her problems. She settles marvellously into here scene with Sachs, but before that her singing is inclined to skid off the rails - perhaps partly because she flails her arms about 'girlishly'. The quality of acting which Mr Schenk encourages or condones - no gesture too obvious, no cliche unusable, no reaction excessive - altogether passes belief. Into this nightmare of staginess, with Mr Schneider-Siemssen's ponderous three dimensional construction out of a cheap fairy-tale book (a railway tunnel through which all can make their entrances in the last scene, with a Disneyland castle in the blue haze behind), comes Donald McIntyre as Sachs. He doesn't exactly sing the role, except for odd phrases of a sudden squared strength and firmness. But what he does do - musing through phrases with a head voice that goes right into falsetto, and slips to a pin drop whisper in the vast space; ruggedly tackling other sequences as if this were Schoenbergian sprechgesang - is astonishing. It's all the more so since he's on stage with a Pogner, Jan-Hendrik Rootering, who could clearly provide the most gloriously and gravely sung performance as Sachs. Mr Rootering offers far and away the surest musical satisfaction of the evening, and keeps his majestic figure aloof from the idiocies of the staging. But Mr McIntyre gives something more. In his honesty, and in his self-exposure, he seems to be alone on the stage. Or rather, he seems to be not on the stage at all, but telling us about some person and some story of far greater significance than we can see. The understanding, the quiteness and the generosity he brings to the part make the opera's treatment of Beckmesser seem particularly cruel, and Hermann Prey's impersonation of the town clerk lacks the spitefulness that might have made the cruelty appear deserved. Lars Magnusson as David, once over some awkwardness, is a ray of light: young, fresh, daring of voice, and an engagingly easy stage personality. The incoherence of the whole makes his and David's cheery informality especially sympathetic. Die Meistersinger Metropolitan, New York</p>

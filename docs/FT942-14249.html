			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Forcing the pace of change - Anderson Group / James Buxton examines five companies which are leading Scotland's export drive Anderson Group, the mining equipment manufacturer, has shrugged off the severe blow to its business caused by the rundown of the British coal industry by making a greater success of the export markets which have always featured strongly in its operations. The company, a subsidiary of Charter, formerly Charter Consolidated, claims to have about 50 per cent of the world mining equipment market which is open to western competitors. Last year it won a large order for equipment from China and Mr Alasdair MacLauchlan, chief executive, says Anderson is 'by far the market leader in China'. Anderson's exports have doubled in the past two years. The company, based at Motherwell near Glasgow used to be called Anderson Strathclyde and in 1982 employed 4,400 people worldwide, of which about 3,000 were in the UK. Successive restructurings to improve efficiency and match the rundown in the British coal mining industry have taken the payroll down to 900, of whom 600 are in the UK, 90 per cent of them at the only surviving manufacturing facility at Motherwell. Turnover last year was about Pounds 65m, of which Pounds 42m came from the UK, with 60 per cent coming from exports. Anderson's overseas subsidiaries account for the remaining Pounds 23m of sales, mainly from maintenance and overhaul contracts. The company contributes to Charter's mining equipment division which in 1992/93 made operating profits of Pounds 3.8m on sales of Pounds 118m. Anderson's traditional markets are in Australia, China, France, India, Poland, South Africa and the US. It has established new markets in central and south America, western and south-east Asia, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The company has subsidiaries in Australia, South Africa and the US which are responsible for their own after-sales service and marketing. 'We are making relatively high-tech equipment which is going into a very aggressive environment,' says Mr MacLauchlan. 'The technology has changed in the past 10 years. The equipment is more reliable, more hard working and more powerful. The ability to steer and control it has improved and we use gamma radiation to locate the coal seam.'' The improvements in the equipment reflect what the industry wants,' he says.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / HK property men give land price warning Hong Kong property developers yesterday got together to secure prices at a land auction that were sharply lower than market expectations, in retaliation against government efforts to bring down soaring prices for housing. One analyst described the government auction, which saw bidders rushing around the hall to round up those proposing higher bids, as 'the most blatant display of property developers' cartel in anyone's recent memory'. The inability of many families to afford their own homes prompted Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to launch a task force in March, which has been instructed to come up with means of cooling prices. The government took a small step in this direction last month by slightly increasing the supply of residential land it will sell off this year. It is understood a consortium of up to 12 bought the biggest plot, with 10 teaming up for the smaller one. Those joining forces included some of the colony's biggest developers. The first site, of 20,780 square metres in the New Territories' Fanling area, went for HKDollars 2.04bn (Pounds 171m) against market expectations of HKDollars 3bn to HKDollars 4bn, while the smaller Yuen Long plot, of about 5,889 square metres, went under the hammer for HKDollars 510m. It was expected to reach as much as HKDollars 800m. These prices do not appear to signal the start of a big slide in prices. Three external factors stood to depress the final prices secured: the government's pledge, which has already pruned asking prices on finished flats, a clutch of other quality sites coming on line at the same time, and further sites in the pipeline. Both the plots sold off yesterday are slightly inconvenient for transport, and both towns are an hour's commuting from the central business district. According to Mr Michael Green, director of SG Warburg in Hong Kong, the Fanling site splits into 12 plots, so each developer will be able to assume his own portion while spreading any risk. But he added: 'It is a reality that the developers formed a consortium. It clearly is a message to the government not to interfere with the free market mechanism.' Property prices have been on an upward track since 1990; the price of small flats has risen by some 200 per cent in the past three years. New apartments yielding little more space than the average suburban two-up-two-down were sold last month for between HKDollars 10m and HKDollars 15m.</p>

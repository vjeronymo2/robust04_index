			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Beckett will lead party into the Euro-campaign The loss of such an effective and respected leader less than a month before polling day can hardly fail to damage Labour's European election campaign. It will dash the party's hopes of remaining out of the spotlight while the media focuses on the Conservative party tearing itself apart over a subject that splits it from top to bottom. Much attention will now inevitably focus on Mrs Margaret Beckett's performance as acting leader and the activities of the other personalities most likely to play a prominent part in the forthcoming leadership race. The main danger for Labour is that the minds of many of its leading figures will be on their leadership prospects and not on securing the best possible election result for their party. The fact that a strong Labour performance could work in favour of Mrs Beckett, assuming she entertains leadership ambitions of her own, will ensure that she tries to maintain such discipline. Labour's strategy was always going to be to play safe and quietly reap the anti-Major protest vote in areas of the country that are relatively little affected by the Liberal Democrat surge. Mr Smith's death, though shattering for morale in the short term at least, will do nothing to change that plan. And his abrupt removal from the scene will not necessarily render the party incapable of executing such an unambitious battle plan competently - even under an interim leader who is respected rather than admired and who will be virtually unknown to many voters. But will all the most prominent players pull together? The party did all it could last night to insist that it would be as close as possible to business as usual, after a period for paying its last respects. One prominent MP said: 'After the funeral, John would have wanted us to fight as hard as we can.' After winning 45 out of 81 British seats in the European parliament in the last elections in 1989, the party's ambitions this time around are relatively modest. It would settle for an outcome similar to this month's local elections, when it won a slight improvement to an unusually strong position. Even before Mr Smith's death, the party probably had the potential for no more than about six gains - 87 seats will be at stake this time. Constituencies in north-west England, the east Midlands and London are at the top of its target list, although the waters have been muddied in some cases by the impact of boundary changes.</p>

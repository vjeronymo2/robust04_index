			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Proportion of graduates finding jobs hits 20-year low THE SMALLEST proportion of graduates for 20 years had found employment by the end of last year, official figures indicate today. Of those students whose destination was known, only 51 per cent (44.7 per cent of the total) had entered some form of employment by the end of 1992. The figures are compiled from returns from all colleges and universities, including those which were polytechnics until last year. Total graduate unemployment at the end of last year was 12.9 per cent - up from 11.5 per cent in 1990-91 and only 5.5 per cent in 1988-89. More women (33,255) found jobs than men (32,881), although they accounted for only 47.8 per cent of graduates. A far higher proportion of women than men entered teacher training (6.2 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent), meaning that total female graduate unemployment was only 10.6 per cent compared with male unemployment of 15.1 per cent. The Equal Opportunities Commission said this confirmed a trend which had been identified in several surveys, showing that male employment had been hardest hit by the recession. The fall in graduates moving directly into jobs was partly offset by increased popularity for further research and training courses. Fears of a teacher shortage, widely broadcast by teacher training bodies, were allayed by a 17.7 per cent rise in entry to teacher training courses, which followed a 30 per cent rise the year before. The number of graduates finding a job rose by 5.6 per cent, but this was overshadowed by an increase of 9.7 per cent in the total number of students taking their first degree. Graduate unemployment is higher for the 'new' universities, which were polytechnics until last year, at 16.9 per cent, compared with 10.6 per cent for the 'old' universities. However, even the old universities are experiencing unemployment at double the rate of 1988 (5.3 per cent). The employment rate for graduates from higher-education colleges fell last year for the fourth successive year. First Destination Statistics of 1992 Graduates.

The coal production grew 1.4 times during the period of the  third seven-year plan (1987-1993).    The state has systematically increased investment in the  coal  industrial sector, attaching primary importance to its  development. Big coal mines have been rebuilt on an expansion  basis in Anju, Sunchon, northern and other coal-rich districts  and many new promising ones built.    Scores of coal mines including the large-scale Soho and  December 16 coal mines went into operation over the past 10  years. The Yipsok, Yongrim, Taehyang and other coal mines were  built at the Anju district coal mining complex whose annual coal  production capacity has now reached 15 million tons.    Projects for replacing mining equipment with large-sized,  modern and high-speed ones have been completed at coal mines to  increase the coal production capacity.    Coal production was 1.5 million tons in 1946, the year  following the liberation of the country, and it increased to  27.5 million tons in 1970 and 85 million tons at the end of the  1980s.    The coal industrial domain now is concentrating big efforts  on arranging new coal fields by giving precedence to prospecting  while increasing the ongoing production. According to survey  data, the nation's coal deposits amount to tens of billions of  tons. Several billion tons of coal deposits have been  discovered in Saeppyol county of North Hamgyong Province, Paekam  county of Yanggang Province and other places in recent years.</p>

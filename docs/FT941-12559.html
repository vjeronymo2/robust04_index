			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: US not fit enough for recovery Sir, You are quite right to call for a tightening by the Federal Reserve ('Why the Fed should tighten', January 26). The Federal Reserve has nearly duplicated the degree of excess that occurred during the early Carter years. And similar bottlenecks are developing with respect to food supplies, inadequate energy capacity, and extraordinarily low manufacturing inventory levels. US price levels could not withstand a world recovery. Edward Guay, managing director and chief economist, CIGNA International Investment Management, Hartford, CT 06152-2115, US</p>

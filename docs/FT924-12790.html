			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (8): Why there may be a game plan after all - Profile of Lazard THERE DOES not appear to be anything as portentous as a Grand Strategy at Lazard. Other investment banks talk of building global networks and extending into new businesses which offer 'synergies' with what they already do. These banks are driven by the same remorseless logic with which they try to infect their clients: that a small handful of global firms will come to dominate all international industries, leaving smaller or domestic rivals out in the cold. By comparison, the Lazard grouping (Lazard Freres in Paris and New York and Lazard Brothers in London) appears at times not be following a powerful game plan. It was criticised in the mid-1980s for not participating in the orgy of mergers in London designed to create full-service investment banks - only to emerge as one of the success stories of that super-heated decade in the mergers and acquisitions business. Now, with conventional wisdom preaching concentration on core businesses, Lazard has been busy spinning into new areas. It was one of the first London banks to begin trading the debt of lesser developed countries, for instance  -now one of the biggest profit-earners for the investment banking world. Mr Michel David-Weill, the French chairman of Lazard Freres and, until a year ago, of Lazard Brothers, says the Lazard houses are constantly on the look out for new businesses. 'During the high days of junk bonds, we weren't in them. Now we are in them, as an issuer in the US. Counter-cyclically, there are types of financing we can do.' There seem to be three principles controlling the expansion of Lazard. First, new businesses have to offer a good profit margin (or, as the smooth Mr David-Weill prefers to put it, it has to be something where Lazard can 'add something' rather than just be one of the crowd). Second, they must be low users of capital. Committing large amounts of capital to a business could result in loss of independence, 'since you need to change to institutional owners,' says Mr David-Weill. The private Lazard partnership structure - with a 50 per cent holding by Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times - has been developed to prevent any such loss occurring. Third, they should not use many people. Large teams of staff create an overhead which becomes a burden if particular business lines turn down. As it is, Lazard has not had to reduce staff numbers in the current downturn, says Mr David-Weill. 'Nobody in the world is without cost pressures,' he says. 'We try very hard to moderate the trend upwards. Can we cut drastically? At this time in view of our work we can cope.' In spite of this broadly pragmatic approach, however, there is still more than a hint of a global game plan at work in the brain of the 59-year-old Mr David-Weill. That became clear at the end of the 1980s, as he moved to bring the three Lazard houses closer together to take advantage of the increasing volume of cross-border merger and acquisition business. Until then, all three had remained powerful domestic advisory firms, with little co-operation between them. Yet potentially, with its strong US base, Lazard was in a position to do what no European corporate finance had managed before - break into the transatlantic corporate M&amp;A as an adviser in both continents. 'I'm one who believes that nothing is vital,' says Mr David-Weill. 'You can do well in just one market. That being said, it is a clear advantage to have a position in the US.' With particular partners from each of the houses either permanently stationed in - or frequent visitors to - each of the others, cross-border deals handled by the firm have picked up. Rivals in the UK now frequently talk of Lazard as a model when talking about their own ambitions to develop internationally. Sharing profits between the different parts of the group has not proved a problem, says Mr David-Weill. 'It's fairly simple. It's not even a matter of great discussion. The place where the deal is done gets two-thirds, the other house gets one third.' Where all three houses are involved, the leading house will get about half the fee, with the others a quarter each, he adds. The question overhanging Lazard now is whether it has developed fast enough from its domestic bases to meet the challenge of the internationally minded (mainly US) investment banks that have invaded the European M&amp;A market in recent years. Its recent expansion into Germany and Italy has been slow and cautious. This year's tussle for control of Perrier, the French mineral water group, between the Agnelli family and BSN, the French food group, displayed both the strengths and the weaknesses of the bank's position as a close adviser to some of the continent's biggest business groupings. Mr David-Weill is himself close to both Mr Gianni Agnelli and to Mr Antoine Riboud, chief executive of BSN, and sits on the boards of each group. Lazard also owns 2 per cent of Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank that advises the Agnellis. Faced with this conflict, Lazard opted to advise BSN. It is the sort of uncomfortable position which merchant bankers dread, though Mr David-Weill now tries to smooth over the tensions. 'There was a view that we were on very bad terms with our friends,' he says. It really shows exactly the opposite. We can be very useful in very many ways.' Such conflicts, though, create opportunities for competitors. The challenge for Lazard will to grow into enough markets for such spats to become less significant for its business as a whole.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: History based on a defensive cartel ICI was founded in 1926 as a defensive cartel with a mission to supply the British Empire. Its history since then has been inextricably linked with the decline of that empire and shifting tides in global industrial competition. ICI was created by a merger of Britain's four leading chemicals companies - Brunner, Mond and Company, Nobel Industries, the United Alkali Company and the British Dyestuffs Corporation. Brunner, Mond and Company was founded by Ludwig Mond, who fled anti-semitic persecution in Germany to create Britain's biggest alkali business. Nobel Industries was the creation of the Swede Alfred Nobel, whose invention of dynamite blasted a path for the Suez Canal. The other two companies were very much junior partners, being given only part-time representation on the ICI board. ICI's founders had all been alarmed by the merger in 1925 of several German chemical companies into IG Farben, the world's biggest cartel, which threatened to compete directly with them for exports. The newly formed British group quickly contacted IG Farben, and Dupont, the US chemicals giant. Sir Harry McGowan, ICI's first and dominating president, described the creation of the British cartel as 'only the first step in a comprehensive scheme . . .to rationalise the chemical manufacture of the world.' ICI initially invested heavily in a fertiliser plant at Billingham, on Teesside, based on ammonia synthesis. But the Depression caused a worldwide slump in agriculture and there was not enough demand to support the huge plant at Billingham. ICI and IG Farben established production quotas for nitrogen, the main ingredient in fertiliser, and in 1935 they carved up the world market between them - ICI supplying the British Empire, Spain, Portugal and the Dutch East Indies, with IG taking the rest of Europe and South America. The deal was not enough to save Billingham, which eventually closed, but it illustrated perfectly the outlook of the founders of ICI, who always preferred to avoid competition. McGowan wrote in 1941 that he did not accept 'the theory . . .that competition is essential to efficiency.' In 1935 ICI research scientists made the company's most famous discovery - the strong plastic polyethylene. They did so by defying a company ban on pressurising ethylene, after previous experiments had led to explosions. Work on developing the strong plastic was interrupted by the Second World War. Rearmament and the war led ICI into becoming a major supplier of chemicals and munitions. The British government paid for the construction of new plants, which ICI managed on a fee basis. The end of the war exposed ICI to a much harsher economic climate. An anti-trust action brought by the US government eventually ended hundreds of agreements on competition between ICI and Du Pont. Although ICI opened a huge new chemicals plant at Wilton, on Teesside, in 1952 most of its plant was obsolete and it suffered during the fifties from the loss of captive markets in former British colonies. Old-fashioned management attitudes and labour relations meant the group was poorly placed to benefit from the opportunities thrown up by a growing and 'de-cartelised' world market. The 1960s saw ICI investing heavily in new plant, both in the UK and overseas. Improved labour relations also increased productivity, although it still lagged behind international competitors in this respect. This heavy investment strategy improved export earnings and efficiency, but it also ran the risk of over-capacity. The 1970s were to prove an erratic period for ICI's profits performance, although the group benefited from cheap North Sea gas. It focused its attention on the US, in spite of Britain having joined the Common Market is 1972. ICI's modern identity is indelibly associated with Sir John Harvey-Jones, who became chairman in 1982 after the group shocked the City by cutting its dividend at the trough of the last recession. He moved rapidly to reduce the group's dependence on bulk chemicals and polyethylene, concentrating on higher-margin products such as drugs and speciality chemicals Since Sir John's retirement in 1987 his successor, Sir Denys Henderson, has continued the same strategy - although inevitably ICI has recently been preoccupied by coping with the recession and resisting the attentions of Lord Hanson.</p>

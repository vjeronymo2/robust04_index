			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Preshift examinations of areas where pumpers are scheduled to work or travel shall not be required prior to the pumper entering the areas if the pumper is a certified person and the pumper conducts an examination for hazardous conditions and for noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition, tests for methane and oxygen deficiency and determines if the air is moving in its proper direction in the area where the pumper works or travels. The examination of the area must be completed before the pumper performs any other work. A record of all hazardous conditions found by the pumper shall be made and retained in accordance with &sect;75.363 by or at the end of the shift on which the condition was found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The person conducting the preshift examination shall examine for hazardous conditions and noncompliance with mandatory safety or health standards that could result in a hazardous condition, test for methane and oxygen deficiency, and determine if the air is moving in its proper direction at the following locations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Roadways, travelways and track haulageways where persons are to work or travel during the oncoming shift and are scheduled prior to the beginning of the preshift examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Working sections and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed, if anyone is scheduled to work on the section or in the area during the oncoming shift. Also sections that are not scheduled to operate but are capable of producing coal by simply energizing the equipment on the section. The examination shall include working places, approaches to worked-out areas and ventilation controls on these sections or in these areas. The examination shall also include a test of the roof, face and rib conditions on these sections or in these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Approaches to worked-out areas along intake air courses and at the entries used to carry air into worked-out areas. The examination of the approaches to the worked-out areas shall be made in the intake air course immediately inby and outby each entry used to carry air into the worked-out area. The examination of the entries used to carry air into the worked-out areas shall be at a point immediately inby the intersection of each entry with the intake air course when the air in the intake air course passes by the worked-out area prior to being used to ventilate working sections where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6) (i) Entries and rooms developed after November 15, 1992, and developed more than 2 crosscuts off an intake air course without permanent ventilation controls where intake air passes through or by these entries or rooms to reach a working section where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Entries and rooms developed after November 15, 1992, and driven more than 20 feet off an intake air course without a crosscut and without permanent ventilation controls where intake air passes through or by these entries or rooms to reach a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working section where anyone is scheduled to work during the oncoming shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (8) High spots along intake air courses where methane is likely to accumulate, if equipment may be operated in the area during the shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Underground electrical installations referred to in &sect;75.340(a), except water pumps, and areas where compressors subject to &sect;75.344 are installed if the installation or compressor is or will be energized during the shift.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Other areas where work or travel during the oncoming shift is scheduled prior to the beginning of the preshift examination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) The person conducting the preshift examination shall determine the volume of air entering each of the following areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) In the last open crosscut of each set of entries or rooms on each working section and areas where mechanized mining equipment is being installed or removed if persons are scheduled to work or travel in the section or area or other areas where coal can be produced by simply energizing equipment. The last open crosscut is the crosscut in the line of pillars containing the permanent stoppings that separate the intake air courses and the return air courses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

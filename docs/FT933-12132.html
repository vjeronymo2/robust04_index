			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Observer: Sheehy's lore Hiring the boss of one of the world's biggest narcotic organisations to report on the pay and conditions of Britain's police officers always sounded a rather risky idea. But even a hardened industrialist like BAT Industries' chairman Sir Patrick Sheehy seems to have been bruised by the ferocity of the reaction to his committee's report on police reform. Indeed, the hot response is a warning to elder business statesmen who fancy rounding off their distinguished careers with a bit of public service. It is one thing for private-sector types to be hired to knock a nationalised industry into privatised shape. But heading a public inquiry can be harder, and less satisfying, than a takeover triumph. True, there have been success stories. Sir Roy Griffiths, a former deputy chairman of J Sainsbury, did a good job following through his 1983 inquiry into the management of the National Health Service. Lloyds Bank chairman Sir Robin Ibbs and Marks and Spencer's ex-chairman Lord Rayner won honourable mentions in dispatches for their work on improving government efficiency. On the other hand, alas, Local Government Commission chief Sir John Banham and Sir James Blyth, chairman of the prime minister's advisory panel on the citizen's charter, may find it harder to win their public sector battle honours. As Sheehy has found, the job doesn't stop with producing recommendations however cogent as well as radical. They also have to be sold to people not on the inquiry chairman's payroll.</p>

A statement they  issued at the end of the meeting indicated that, contrary to the  territorial administration minister's statements on 2 January,  voters registers have not yet been sent either to the National  Electoral Commission or the local electoral commissions. The  seven parties, AD [expansion unknown], the Action Committee for  Renewal, (?PFE) [expansion unknown], Party for Action and  Development, PRI [expansion unknown], Social Democratic Party,  and the Togolese Union for Democracy, say it is too early to  hold the forthcoming parliamentary elections on 23 January and 6  February.</p>

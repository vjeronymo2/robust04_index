The cross-trade transaction does not involve assets of any employee benefit plan established or maintained by BFM or any of its Affiliates (Batterymarch Plan). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading program must have total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained by a single employer or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets of such plans if the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.

BFM is a business trust organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and registered as an investment adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. BFM currently manages on a discretionary basis approximately $7 billion in assets, of which approximately $4 billion consists of assets of Plan Accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. BFM represents that there are certain circumstances when it is required to liquidate all or a portion of the equity securities in an Account for which it acts as an investment manager. BFM proposes to cross-trade equity securities between the Accounts in situations where the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account is made either directly by the Independent Account Representative or by operation of a pre-established contractual obligation established by the Independent Account Representative. In the case of a Plan Account, the Independent Account Representative must be an authorized Independent Fiduciary. In all cross-trade situations, the decision as to the particular equity securities to be sold at the time of the transaction will be made either by the Independent Account Representative or by operation of the Optimization Program utilized by BFM. In the case of all Accounts, the Independent Account Representative will be a person which is unrelated to BFM and its Affiliates. Cross-trade transactions will not involve assets of any Batterymarch Plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. BFM states that a cross-trade opportunity, pursuant to the requested exemption, will arise only if the need to sell equity securities from a Selling Account occurs as a result of one of the following ``trigger events''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

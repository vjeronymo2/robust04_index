			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Letter: Zero rating would unlock cash and cut out red tape Sir, The government could unravel a veritable Gordian knot of red tape (The Growing Business: 'Untying the tangle of red tape', December 15) by extending the principle of zero rating value added tax on imports from EC member states - due to be introduced on January 1 - to credit transactions between registered traders in the UK. This would not only unlock the many millions of pounds currently churning back and forth in the system (since the only time that Customs and Excise collects and keeps the money is at the final point of sale to a non-registered trader) but would also radically reduce the potential fines, penalties and imprisonment currently inherent in the system, even for simple, unpremeditated error. Who knows, the money thus unlocked could even help to stimulate Britain's sluggish economy.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Joe Quinn, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] A Palestinian's claim that he was responsible for  the Lockerbie bombing was today greeted with scepticism by  British relatives of the 270 victims. Yusuf Sha'ban, 29, made  the outburst in a Beirut courtroom where he is standing trial  accused of assassinating a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut in  January. "I personally blew up the Lockerbie plane," Sha'ban, a  follower of terrorist chief Abu Nidal, told the court today.  "I've told the investigating magistrate about it before, but my  confession wasn't documented. I say it again now," said  Sha'ban, of Abu Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council.    If Sha'ban's claim is to be taken literally, it would appear  to question the Western case that the bombing was carried out by  two Libyans who have yet to surrender for trial in Scotland or  the United States. But British relatives' spokesman Dr. Jim  Swire said today that neither he nor others involved in the  tragedy had heard of Sha'ban before.    "His claim should be regarded with grave suspicion," said  Dr.  Swire, whose daughter Flora was one of the 270 people killed  when a terrorist bomb brought down the PanAm jumbo jet over  Lockerbie.    "It could be that he is seeking to attract what terrorists  might regard as kudos for the Abu Nidal organisation, for all I  know."    Until a trial took place of the two Libyans, it was  impossible to say who was involved, said Dr. Swire. "In the  absence of that trial, all claims deserve to be looked at -- but  they should equally be treated with grave suspicion."    And the Foreign Office in London said: "As we have said many  times in the past, we believe there is a case to be answered in  a court in Scotland or the United States by the two Libyans. If  anyone has further information which implicates anyone else,  this could be brought to the attention of the Lord Advocate in  Scotland or the U.S. authorities."    In Scotland, a spokesman for the Crown Office said the Lord  Advocate had seen no evidence relating to "the alleged  involvement" of Sha'ban.    "If anyone has any evidence relating to the case, they  should  make it available to the Dumfries and Galloway constabulary,"  the spokesman added.</p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Stewart &amp; Wight ahead to Pounds 372,000 Stewart &amp; Wight, property investor, raised its pre-tax profit from Pounds 352,000 to Pounds 372,000 in the year ended March 31 1993. Rental income improved to Pounds 419,000 (Pounds 400,000). In general, tenants have continued to keep up their rental commitments. However, it was expected that income from the Bishopsgate property would be reduced considerably because of a number of the tenancies expiring this year. Earnings per share came to 324.43p (299.04p) and the dividend is increased to 135p (120p).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- On 10 April 1994,  on the occasion of the convening in Bucharest of the annual  assembly of the Jewish communities in Bucharest, Doru Dumitru  Palade, minister of research and technology, presented the  "Declaration of the Government of Romania Regarding the  Commemoration of the World Day of the Holocaust," which states,  among other things, the following:    "We are evoking, with this opportunity, the painful memory  of  the hundreds of thousands of Jews, many of whom were of Romanian  language and culture, and who, living in the territories  temporarily snatched away from Romania through the Vienna  Diktate, were arrested massively and later on deported to  extermination camps with the approval and the active connivance  of the occupation Horthyst authorities. Even more painful for  the Romanian people is the remembrance of the innocent victims  of the legionnaire terror, the remembrance of the pogrom in  Iasi, a tragical moment, unprecedented in the history of our  people, as well as the remembrance of the mass deportations made  by the military and the Nazi field gendermerie from Bessarabia  and Dniester, atrocities which Romania did not have at that time  the means and capacity to oppose. Although Romania," the  statement further shows, "never surrendered citizens of Jewish  nationality to the Nazi extermination machine, nor did it  organise or tolerate others to effect mass deportations from and  exterminations in its national territory, the memory of the  attitude of a tolerance fringing on complicity of the then  Romanian authorities towards the anti-semitic atrocities, the  remembrance of the vexing racial laws which Romania, following a  foreign example, but alien to the Romanian traditions and  feelings, had to pass in those times, are still burdening, more  than half a century after, the conscience of the Romanian  people. Unfortunately, like in many European countries, we  cannot nowadays speak of anti-Semitism, racism, intolerance and  xenophobia only in the past tense; resurgent traces of this  bloody insanity are still emerging now and then. We must admit  with regret that even in this country there are attempts of  rehabilitating the legionnaire movement, against a background of  an incomplete description of the World War Two period.    The Government of Romania is firmly disapproving of such  manifestations, that have nothing in common with the spirit and  traditions of the Romanian people.    The Government of Romania is hereby expressing, on this  occasion, the hope that in the Europe nearing the end of the  second millennium the efforts directed to the observance of the  fundamental human rights, to the final elimination of any forms  of racism, anti-semitism, and xenophobia, will prevail.</p>

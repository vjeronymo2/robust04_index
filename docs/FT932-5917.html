			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Arts: Balanchine celebrated - Clement Crisp hails the New York City Ballet season George Balanchine died in April 1983. Ten years on, his New York City Ballet is mounting a Balanchine Celebration which will show no less than 73 of his creations in an eight-week season. The scale of the enterprise, no less than the importance of the ballets on view, is tremendous. Many of these works are the bed-rock of the company; a few - because Balanchine replaced or discarded pieces without qualm - have been rescued from the memories of early casts after the passage of years. Balanchine's oeuvre consisted of more than 400 dance-works; this season is both a retrospective and an affirmation of identity by his heirs. A decision was made that the festival's repertory should be shown chronologically. The effect is stimulating. The ballets may be viewed as a chain of artistic experience (and marvellous craftsmanship) which links past and present. The range, the vitality, the unfailing felicity of Balanchine's output - genius as technical expertise; inspiration as practicality - can still take one's breath away, and at every performance still do. In six performances during four days I saw 16 works made between 1946 and 1955. In them Balanchine did everything with steps, from clothing music in plotless dance (Concerto Barocco) to telling stories (La Sonnambula); from tickling the palate with the happiest bravura (Minkus pas de trois) to evoking the darkly numinous in Ivesiana and reshaping myth in Orpheus. In his recension of Swan Lake he renewed the past; in Four Temperaments he made the classic dance new for our time. And in everything he hymned the power of classicism to ennoble human ability. The significance of this season for the New York public is clear. As with the recent Matisse show, they are given an illuminating survey of a great master's work. Balanchine is unassailably the dominant choreographer of this century. His working life in America - an exact half-century - made classic ballet an American art, and he gave the danse d'ecole its truest and most influential form for our time, developed logically from the Imperial Russian traditions in which he had been reared. Marius Petipa's career in St. Petersburg was the culmination and summation of 19th century ballet. Balanchine's work in New York is a no less grand and definitive achievement for us. Invited to America in 1933 by Lincoln Kirstein, and sustained in everything thereafter by Kirstein's massive gifts and his determination that classic ballet should have an American identity, Balanchine naturalised the academic dance through a school, a company, and a repertory that dominates the history of ballet. And Balanchine still astonishes us - not just by the power of his genius, but with the prodigality and ease of his inventiveness. (Like Saint-Saens, he created without apparent effort - 'as easily as an apple-tree produces apples'). A former member of his company told me how, in two months during the winter of 1957/8, Balanchine was working on four ballets at the same time, moving from studio to studio during the day, choreographing Agon (a masterpiece of ballet in our century), Square Dance, Gounod Symphony and Stars and Stripes, works as different in manner as they are in score (from Stravinsky to Sousa, by way of Gounod, Vivaldi and Corelli). All are still in performance. The 16 ballets I saw showed Balanchine at the time he was building a repertory to sustain his dancers and his audience as his company acquired a permanent home at the City Centre in 1948. There were two happy restorations. Bourree Fantasque is a loving response to Chabrier music, apt in wit as in sentiment, and it was marvellously danced by Darci Kistler and Damian Woetzel, Kyra Nichols and Erlends Zieminch. Haieff Divertimento (named for its composer, Alexei Haieff) was a delicate piece that was long thought lost. Carefully re-studied, it returns to the stage as a touching view of youthful emotion, and is as gently delightful as it was in 1950 when NYCB brought it to London on the company's first and memorably exciting visit. Major works - Concerto Barocco, Scotch Symphony, Ivesiana, Western Symphony, the second act of Nutcracker - were well done, while Four Temperaments remains, after 46 years, a work so prescient, so bold, that it is still vastly more modern than the European flash-dance of today. Certain ballets were unwisely cast. Orpheus lacked any focus because of the inexperience of Nilas Martins in its title role; La Sonnambula and La Valse suffered from unsuitable central performance, though in the former, Peter Boal caught exactly the sudden fever of emotion that will destroy its poet hero. A group of delicious small pieces - Balanchine's lollipops - were fetchingly done. The Minkus pas de trois (the old trio from Paquita which Balanchine made more difficult, pour encourager les autres) found Damian Woetzel happy to dazzle us with diamond-cut beats and turns. The Sylvia pas de deux, the iridescent Valse Fantaisie, its dancers skimming like dragonflies, looked as delightful as ever. There were, though, two artists who dominated these performances: Kyra Nichols and Darci Kistler. Kistler's stage identity is youthfully radiant, grand. In Nutcracker she produced lustrous dancing, touched with majesty. In Swan Lake her Odette was superb in scale; in Concerto Barocco she inhabited the music, while in Bourree Fantasque's first movement she and Damian Woetzel flirted wittily with the dance and with each other. Kyra Nichols is a classic ballerina of rarest distinction. She dances with an absolute ease, entire denial of self, a musicality and an authority that seem wholly natural and wholly convincing. Her roles acquire thereby a simplicity that seems inevitable. Her style is generous, choreographic beauty revealed through a dedication to the movement itself. Watching her, you wonder why other ballerinas cannot be as true; and you know that Kyra Nichols' genius lies in just this miraculous truth. Magisterial her art certainly is, but also innocent, because so pure. She danced Scotch Symphony with such sweetness, and such gentle dignity, that I longed to see her as Bournonville's sylphide. In Swan Lake, which is Balanchine's fantasy on themes by Ivanov, her account of Odette was marvellous in its grandeur of scale as in its tragic dignity. And I do not know another dancer today whose pas de bourree - that cascade of little steps that the old ballerinas said should look like a string of perfectly matched pearls - is so exquisite or so expressive. From the company there came dancing strong, assured, and, for the most part, exhilarating in dynamics as in sense of purpose. This celebration is very important: through it, New York City Ballet examines and re-affirms its glorious Balanchinian identity. And we rejoice. The Balanchine Celebration continues at the State Theatre, New York, until June 27. Leading benefactors are the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for Lincoln Center, and The Brown Foundation Inc</p>

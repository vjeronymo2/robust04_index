			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- A list of almost 150  people imprisoned in Vietnam for their religious convictions or  for expressing disagreement with the Vietnamese Government has  been sent to Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by the  chairman of the Czech Section of the Vietnamese Renewal Party,  Pham Viet Hung.    CTK was today given an open letter addressed to Zieleniec,  together with a copy of the document issued by the Puebla  Institute, a U.S.-based human rights organization which is  aiming for the establishment of democracy in Vietnam. The  organization says the list is not complete, and that in actual  fact there are many more prisoners.    In the open letter, the Renewal Party's Czech section  expresses disappointment that recent articles in the Czech press  about Czech leaders' visits to the Vietnamese Socialist Republic  did not mention human rights breaches in Vietnam.    In connection with Zieleniec's forthcoming visit to the  country, Pham Viet Hung says that millions of people in Vietnam  long for freedom and democracy, and asks Zieleniec to bear this  fact in mind during his meetings with Vietnamese government  representatives.    The letter also says that the Czech Republic has an  unusually  good reputation in the area of human rights, and that for  countries such as Vietnam, still ruled over by a communist  regime, it provides an example on their non-violent path to  democracy.    Czech Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Vit Kurfurst said that  the  ministry was aware that problems existed with regard to the  observance of human rights in Vietnam. He added that this was a  problem which needed to be talked about with the Vietnamese  government and which should be pointed out. In no event,  however, should it hinder the mutual development of economic and  trade relations, Kurfurst said.</p>

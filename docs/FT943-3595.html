			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: CS cancels Creditanstalt stake bid CS Holding, the international financial services group built around Credit Suisse, has withdrawn its offer to acquire a large minority stake in Creditanstalt, Austria's second largest bank. CS said it had become increasingly difficult to discuss the merits of its proposal objectively in Austria. 'Other aspects, predominantly of a political nature, have prevailed,' it said. Austria is in the midst of a national election campaign, and the future of Creditanstalt has become a divisive issue between the Conservative and Social Democratic parties, the governing coalition partners. CS's withdrawal comes only a week after the Austrian government engaged JP Morgan, the New York investment bank, to review bids for part of its 70 per cent voting stake in Creditanstalt. JP Morgan is a main rival of First Boston, a subsidiary of CS, in global investment banking markets. Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the Austrian finance minister who had initially been a strong supporter of the CS bid, has recently appeared to distance himself from it, falling in line with other Social Democratic party leaders who say that Austrian influence in Creditanstalt must be maintained. Mr Lacina said he regretted the withdrawal of CS. The Swiss group's offer would have provided a sensible international solution for Creditanstalt. But CS's move was understandable in the light of the opposition of Austrian Conservative party forces, he said. This opposition crystalised in June when Mr Rainer Gut, the CS chairman, said CS would like ultimately to own 100 per cent of Creditanstalt. The CS withdrawal leaves the future of Creditanstalt uncertain. A large consortium formed mainly from Austrian Conservative party business circles to counter CS's bid last spring could well fall apart now the threat of a foreign takeover has disappeared. If so, the finance minister would be left with no concrete bids to consider. Allianz, the German insurance group, has indicated an interest but would probably face similar opposition to that faced by CS if it made a formal offer. The government has been committed to sell its remaining stake in Creditanstalt for several years. In the early 1990s, the bank's poor performance dampened interest from potential strategic partners and institutional investors. Last year, Mr Lacina rejected a merger bid from the Raiffaisen group of rural banking co-operatives as ill-founded, and refused an offer from an investment banking syndicate to place the shares widely in international equity markets.</p>

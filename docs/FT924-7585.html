			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Effect of the recent fall in the value of the pound THE RECENT fall in the value of the pound in the international currency markets will have 'increased substantially' the sterling value of Britain's overseas assets, the Bank of England says. The rise follows a sharp fall in the average for the first half of this year from the average for the whole of last year. Preliminary figures suggest a decline of Pounds 9.9bn to Pounds 6.2bn. The changes reflect share- price and currency fluctuations, says a report in the Bank's Quarterly Bulletin. The report also says preliminary capital-flow data for the first half suggest that net outflows increased from last year. The bank warns, however, that the figures are 'highly provisional and are inconsistent with a current-account deficit recorded over the same period'. Earnings resulting from the interest, profits and dividends on overseas assets improved in the first half, with a net inflow of Pounds 900m compared with Pounds 300m in the whole of last year.</p>

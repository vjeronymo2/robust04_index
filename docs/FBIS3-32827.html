			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar said yesterday  the Foreign Ministry's top priority is obtaining a Honduran  nonpermanent membership on the UN Security Council.    "We have been working on this for a long time. It takes  several years to work on such a candidacy. Honduras is going to  obtain that post at a world level for the first time," he said.  He said the election will take place at the next UN General  Assembly scheduled for September in New York. We are now trying  to garner our votes, he said. There are more than 160 states in  the United Nations, and therefore we have to hold good  negotiations with friendly countries.    Concerning the election of the next OAS secretary general,  he  said Honduras will keep its promise to support Costa Rica in the  first round, and "there will be an ample debate among the Latin  American countries for the second round."    Regarding the candidacy of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria  for that post, the Honduran foreign minister said there are  different opinions as to the person who should direct the  Inter-American organization.    He said it is very important for Honduras to be a member of  the Security Council, because this would practically entail  making decisions on world issues. There are permanent and  nonpermanent members on the Security Council. The great powers  are the permanent members, the others the developing nations.    "For the first time, there is going to be a Honduran  representative on the Security Council. The only countries that  have had this privilege in the past are Panama, during the  government of Omar Torrijos, and Nicaragua, during the time of  the revolution," he said. The foreign minister said, however,  no decision has been reached yet on the candidate.</p>

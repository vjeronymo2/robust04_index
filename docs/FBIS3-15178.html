			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Georgiy Shmelev and </F> Denis Perkin]    [Text] Moscow, 2 Mar -- The statement by Andrey Kozyrev,  Russia's foreign minister, and the leader of Bosnian Serbs  Radovan Karadzic after the talks on Tuesday [1 March] with  regard to the unblocking of the airport in Tuzla "is a very  important political step, apart from the fact that this is an  extremely significant contribution to improving the humanitarian  situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina." This was stated at a  briefing for Russian journalists held at the Russian Federation  Foreign Ministry by Vitaliy Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign  minister. According to the high-ranking Russian diplomat, this  political step is important because in the course of political  developments Tuzla has lately turned into a second symbol of  unresolved problems in Bosnia-Herzegovina, next to Sarajevo. As  long ago as several months or possibly even a year, the opening  of the airport in Tuzla was declared to be one of the principal  goals of the European Union; the issue was also mentioned in  NATO resolutions several times. We have been feeling a certain  aggravation of the situation around the Tuzla airport recently,  V. Churkin said.    We have, he said, been engaged on this issue for a long time  and had discussed the subject with the Serbs. At the time they  had said to us that they were greatly concerned over the fact  that Tuzla airport would be used by the Muslim side for military  deliveries. They said that appropriate monitoring of the  procedure was essential. Some time ago Russia put forward the  idea that the presence there of Russian observers, along with  other observers, was needed to remove this concern. For a long  time we told all those interested in this matter about this  readiness on our part, the Russian deputy foreign minister  noted, and it should be said that this readiness on Russia's  part was immediately welcomed. "I am speaking especially of  this," V. Churkin emphasized, "because somehow it emerges that  after yesterday's statement some people have suddenly been  attempting to present matters as though the Russians had almost  deceived someone when they issued this statement and suddenly  prepared this decision." In actual fact there was a  multilateral UN meeting on 25 February at which this issue was  also discussed in quite some detail and at which it was stated  that the opening of Tuzla airport might be pushed through as  early as 7 March. That is why, the high-ranking Russian  diplomat considers, noone should be surprised in the slightest  that such an agreement was finally reached precisely during the  high-level meeting in Moscow between the Russian foreign  minister and the leader of the Bosnian Serbs.    Vitaliy Churkin continued that now it is up to the Muslim  side. The discussion of the problem with the Bosnian Serbs was  held on the basis of a document that was offered to Serbs and  Muslims by Yasushi Akashi, the representative of the UN  secretary- general for the former Yugoslavia. It provides for  the international monitoring and the presence of Muslim and  Serbian contact groups on the territory of the airport in Tuzla  to have a truly clear picture that this airport is used for  humanitarian and not for some other purpose. Vitaliy Churkin  noted that in this connection "I am at the moment, frankly  speaking, a little bit surprised that the Muslim leadership is  speaking out against it. The Muslim leadership is also speaking  out against the presence of Russian observers and against the  presence of a contact Serbian group in this airport. It is  difficult for me to understand why all that is happening." The  deputy foreign minister of the Russian Federation said that "we  do not need this; we are going to feed, help, and ensure the  humanitarian aid not for the Russian population. In the first  instance this will be the Muslim population, and I repeat, Serbs  and Croats, as well, if they live in this area. I cannot  understand at all why somebody should express any doubts about  it."    Vitaliy Churkin said he was sure that this turn of events  had  not been a surprise either for the government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina or for the Muslim side. He expressed the  hope that in the next few days all the details of the operation  to open the airport will have been settled so that the airport  can start to function and humanitarian aid be delivered to the  population of this area of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to the deputy foreign minister "a representative  of  the Emergencies Ministry is now in Zagreb after being in  Belgrade yesterday, because, as you know, that organization is  still engaged in the delivery of humanitarian goods by land."    In this connection he drew attention to the fact that the  Russians involved in this operation will be not military people  and not from the Defense Ministry but precisely from the  Ministry of Civil Defense, Emergencies, and Elimination of the  Consequences of Natural Disasters, which was formerly the state  committee for emergencies. They are well trained people.  According to him the Russian side intends to act strictly  within the framework of the scheme and the operation being  prepared by Mr. Akashi and the leaderships of the former  Yugoslavia itself and Bosnia-Herzegovina.    As for the agreement on the creation of a Croatian-Muslim  federation, it should be said that a preliminary agreement has  been prepared on the creation of a confederation between this  Croatian-Muslim federation and Serbia. "This has not come as  news to us," V. Churkin emphasized. "I must express my  satisfaction at the character of the contacts and consultations  that we have had with the American side and in particular with  my American counterpart, envoy Redman, because right from the  outset he informed me in detail of his plans." "It seems to  me," he said, "that Chuck Redman is engaged in studying some  interesting possibilities which might, if they turned out right,  certainly help the achievement of a Bosnian settlement. I have  not yet had an opportunity to study the documents in detail, but  it is a matter of settling a number of aspects of  Muslim-Croatian relations. If this agreement is correctly  incorporated within the general context of a settlement in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, it could full well prove useful. However  this probably requires still closer interaction on our part with  the Americans and also with the other countries that are  displaying a keen interest in the problems of achieving a  Bosnian settlement."</p>

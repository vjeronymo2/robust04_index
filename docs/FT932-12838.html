			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / World Trade News: Power companies hail the fruits of lobbying - The EC/US trade deal UNTIL last week, there was no better way to get executives of US power generating equipment companies on to their soapboxes than to ask them about the difficulties of selling their products in the European market. General Electric, the biggest US producer, regularly complained that it had not sold a steam turbine in Europe since the Marshall Plan. Earlier this month, Mr John Yasinsky, group president at Westinghouse Electric, the other big US supplier, said in an interview: 'Across the board there are European countries that are closed to us. In the US, European competitors are competing head-to-head with us on products that we are not allowed to sell in Europe.' Now, after years of lobbying by the two, a transatlantic phone call between Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative has changed the outlook. The partial EC-US deal on public procurement reached last week waives Article 29 of the EC utilities directive, introduced on January 1, for the US manufacturers of heavy electrical equipment. Two parts of Article 29 had most irritated the US companies. One was the 3 per cent rule, which stipulated that public utilities must prefer a European bid where it is no more than 3 per cent dearer than the best bid from overseas. The other was the local content rule which said customers could reject a bid with less than 50 per cent of European content. The waiver confirms Mr Yasinsky's view that the issue of access to Europe would be more important for President Bill Clinton's administration than for the preceding Bush and Reagan administrations. Mr Kantor's feisty style has gone down well at Westinghouse. At GE, the latest development is greeted with pleasure and relief. 'We're delighted,' says Mr Eugene Zeltmann, manager for trade and industry associations at GE Power Systems. 'An awful lot of effort has gone into this, and it should bring more transparency and openness to the market.' 'Clearly, it's a step forward,' says Mr Frank Bakos, vice president and general manager of Westinghouse's power generation business unit. The problem for the US suppliers was that Article 29 re-established at Community level the discrimination that they claim to have suffered for years at national level. The size of power station orders, and the need to keep local suppliers busy in a market suffering from overcapacity, has inevitably made contract awards an intensely political affair. On top of that, the European utilities industry remains rooted in the public sector, with nowhere near the level of independent power production seen in the US. Hence the importance of any regulations affecting public procurement. The successes achieved by the US companies in Europe have largely come through their strategic alliances and licensing deals. GE has long considered such alliances indispensable, particularly in less open markets. But the focus of the alliances in Europe has been the newer technology of gas turbines, where the US companies have more to offer potential partners than in the more mature steam turbine technology. The gas turbine co-operation between GE and the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom has been an important reason for both companies' recent successes in Europe, while the wide-ranging tie-up between Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce last year gave the UK aero-engine and industrial power group access to heavy duty gas turbines. Both GE and Westinghouse, in partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan, have sold gas turbines directly in the UK, although continental Europe is much tougher even for sales via an alliance, let alone direct sales. For GE, therefore, the main focus of its lobbying in the public procurement debate has been on steam turbine sales, says Mr Zeltmann, so the deal might not make any difference to the strategic alliances. Instead, it gives the company an opportunity to sell its steam turbines in Europe, and the company will be bidding to test the new environment. This could heighten yet further the contract battles in Europe for a product where there is little to choose between the big US and European players, where competition and pricing is already fierce, and where growth prospects in the European Community are relatively slow. For Mr Bakos, the access problem is more institutional than product-specific. 'The real issue is how the ultimate process of awarding contracts is treated,' he says. 'Will it be handled openly or fairly, or will it go underground?'</p>

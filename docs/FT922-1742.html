			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Nerves begin to surface - The latest flotations THE unexpected news that GPA, the aircraft leasing company, was pulling its global flotation this week gave many private investors a fright. Should they still be keen to buy shares in the companies that are coming to the market? Almost a dozen flotations are planned by the end of the year, the first such rush since the 1987 crash. The issues scheduled for this month are from Country Casuals, the ladies wear retailer, Kenwood Appliances, the kitchen appliance maker, the Daily Telegraph newspaper, Anglian Window, which makes double-glazing, and Taunton Cider. Two large flotations are due in July, from MFI, the furniture retailer and Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, which hopes to raise Pounds 2bn-Pounds 4bn. These issues are very different from the privatisation stocks which most UK shareholders own. Most are aimed at institutions, with Country Casuals as a stock market placing. The privatisations had a simple application process and were priced attractively as part of the government drive to promote wider share ownership among the British public. But this is not the case with the planned flotations. David Jones, chairman of Sharelink, the execution-only sharedealing service, which was set up with backing from BT for its privatisation issue, says: 'Many of the new issues are not being structured in a way that makes it easy for private investors to get involved.' The companies will have to get the best price possible without overpricing the issue so that the market falls after dealing begins. Take advice from a stockbroker before deciding whether to buy. The small print on the two biggest offers imminent, from Wellcome and MFI, goes as follows: Wellcome. The Wellcome Foundation, which owns more than 73 per cent of Wellcome, is reducing its holding. Wellcome was originally floated in 1986 at Pounds 1.20 a share and these now trade at around Pounds 9.45. The shares may be offered at a discount to the market price. Investors who buy through the public offer will not have to pay stamp duty or commission; they can register now and apply for shares from July 6. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Shares can be put into a personal equity plan within 42 days of the issue - any longer and they will have to be sold and bought back. Reyker Securities, the Share Centre and Sharelink are offering to 'pep' the shares at low cost. Reyker charges a fee of Pounds 40 for a Pounds 6,000 general Pep and a 1 per cent annual mangement fee from the 1993 tax year. Charges at the Share Centre are a flat fee of Pounds 50 and at Sharelink, a 0.75 per cent annual administration fee subject to a Pounds 20 minimum. Wellcome has prepared a guide to the share offer obtainable from the Share Information Office on 081 944 1242. Its prospectus is due to be published on 25 June. MFI. The furniture retailer's name gives it an inherent advantage in its appeal to private investors. In 1987, it was the subject of the largest management buyout then seen after a merger with Asda, the food retailer, which owns 25 per cent of the company. The minimum application in this case is Pounds 2,250. The price of shares will be announced on July 2, with dealing starting on July 17. Once again, stamp duty and commission do not have to be paid on purchase of the shares, which can be 'pepped.'</p>

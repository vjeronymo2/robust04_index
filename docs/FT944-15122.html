			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Brescia steel aid approved The European Commission has approved an Italian government aid package to help steelmakers in the Brescia region restructure. The Commission said in a statement the Ecu410m (Pounds 323m) plan would add 5m tonnes in capacity cuts to the 11m already achieved as part of an EU-wide rescue package for the European steel industry. The EU has demanded 19m tonnes of capacity cuts by November 8 for the overall package to go ahead. The Commission said the Italian plan involved L600bn in aid to help close down steel mills in the Brescia region and L190m to help re-employ redundant workers. The Italian plan is a revamped version of a package earlier deemed by the EU to breach its aid rules.</p>

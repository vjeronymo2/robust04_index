			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW SCHOOL NAMED FOR MOFFETT  </P> <P> A school under construction in the unincorporated area of Lennox was named  Moffett Elementary School this week by the Lennox Board of Education to honor  Kenneth L. Moffett, who has been superintendent of schools in Lennox for 11 of  the last 13 years.  </P> <P> "Normally you're dead and gone" when they name a school after you, Moffett said  Thursday. "I was embarrassed at first and then very pleased."  </P> <P> The 55,000-square-foot school on Larch Avenue is expected to be completed next  spring. It will replace Larch Elementary School, which will be demolished next  year to make way for the Century Freeway. Construction costs, estimated at $8  million to $10 million, will be paid by Caltrans, district officials said.  </P> <P> The new school is being built partially underground to control temperatures and  insulate it against noise from nearby Los Angeles International Airport. It  will feature movable walls, an outdoor amphitheater and a rooftop parking lot.  </P></p>

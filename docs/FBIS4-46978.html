Klympush, Minister of Transport, by V. </F> Mayevskyy; place and date not given: "Transport Will Bring Us  Out"]    [Text] When I received the assignment to interview  Klympush, the minister of transport, as I walked to the ministry  on Krasnoarmeysk Street and entered the reception area, as I  read the name and patronymic of the minister on the door to his  office, I was bothered by a persistent thought--where have I  heard that name before? I am not too involved with transport  issues at the editorial office, that is, I did not know Orest  Dmitriyevich as a minister, but somewhere I had come across that  name. It was not through personal acquaintance, since we have  never met. It was only in the course of the conversation that my  question was answered in a very unexpected manner, as you shall  see below.    [Mayevskyy] First of all, it would be good to know just what  the Ministry of Transport of Ukraine unifies.    [Klympush] We bring together the six main elements, formerly  always owned by the state--railroads, aviation, motor, maritime,  and river transport and motor highways. But, besides, let us  say, the Southwestern Railway, many industrial ministries and  agencies own their own railway tracks, and there are also  private transport enterprises besides railways, with a clear  government monopoly. Let us say Rechflot [River Fleet] was  auctioned off, but after all, the waterways remain under  government jurisdiction--we establish the state standards and  determine tariffs.    [Mayevskyy] Pardon me, but there automatically arises the  question as to whether all of these forms of transport are  independent and capable of managing without the ministry.    [Klympush] They could manage without us, but the country,  the  state, could not. The client, the passenger, cannot manage  either. After all, in their oblast the transport enterprises are  most frequently monopolists, and they can demand any prices that  are totally unfounded and manifest arbitrary behavior in other  spheres of operation. We, however, must determine the rules,  establish order, standards, restrictions, and requirements with  respect to shipments.    Transport in Ukraine today is a vast and complex system,  which, on the one hand, determines the statehood of Ukraine, and  on the other hand carries out domestic shipping and maintains  foreign ties necessary in our society. I have conducted an  insistent and unambiguous policy for two years now, which suits  contemporary world concepts of a ministry. It must be an organ  of state regulation, which certainly does not set as its goal  the literal management of economic problems of an enterprise.  The ministry embodies the policy of the state owner, and it  historically developed so that there was also a need to engage  in purely managerial matters. At the present time there are not  only state enterprises, and it is necessary to work with all  types of property. That is the principal difference as compared  with past years.    [Mayevskyy] But if an enterprise is operating well, it is  also better for the state.    [Klympush] Yes. But the task of the ministry is to create  favorable conditions for the operation of all enterprises. Not  to be the substitute, a drover, an overseer, or be restrictive,  but most importantly, it must not to be a supplier for them.    Naturally, the better an enterprise operates, the better it  is for it and the state. We are interested in the formation of  the budget and taxes, and we strive to determine where they  should be increased or decreased, proceeding specifically from  state interests. The ministry, however, cannot engage in routine  economic management.    [Mayevskyy] Supply, however, is also a very powerful  management lever, which allows you to influence enterprises.    [Klympush] Supply is no longer handled through the ministry;  that phase has ended. At present there is no supply problem;  there is only the problem of money. If an enterprise is  profitable, if its expenditures are covered, then there are no  problems. But the matter is that passenger transportation  represents a branch that rarely yields profits from  transportation itself. For industry transportation expenditures  are always supplementary expenditures, and the smaller they are,  the more efficient the operation and the cheaper production is.    Passenger transportation always means subsidies; that is the  way it is everywhere in the world. It is therefore the task of  the ministry to defend and promote that part of the budget to be  spent on transport before state organs, the planners, and the  Supreme Council, to indicate its rational direction, determine  the paths of development, and substantiate expenditures.    Returning to supply, it is desirable for the country itself  to manufacture everything needed for transport. It is our task  to make certain all of that is in production, so that transport  workers could acquire it. Secondly, we must create financial  conditions for freight and passenger transport. After all, at  present the tariffs are such that few can pay them. Right now,  for instance, the shipment of a tonne of broken stone by railway  is more expensive than its production. The same applies to  concrete and much else. We are assisting building material  enterprises with shipments, creating the most favorable  conditions for transport activity and finding sources to cover  the expenditures.    In aviation at the present time there are already over 30  firms engaged in transport operations. We do not need the  economic operation of Zhulyan, we want to transfer that airport  to Kiev. But we do issue the operating license and the  certificate, determine the degree of competence of personnel,  and whether equipment meets established standards, and we also  license various types of activity. After all, the process of  transportation is a process presenting increased danger. Every  transporter would like to see himself as far away from the  ministry as possible. But people seek protection from us along  with state justice. We must create equal conditions for everyone.    During my tenure I have never issued a single order for  Rechflot. We worked out tariffs and fees for transiting canals,  which, by the way, do not go to us at all. Rechflot, however,  earns income from its vessels. While the Danube Steamship  Company is responsible for the state of the Danube navigable  channel and the ministry works with it. We prepare operating  rules in accordance with world requirements and establish safety  standards.    [Mayevskyy] City transport systems are under your  jurisdiction. As you can understand, people have a special  interest in them.    [Klympush] As strange as it may sound, city transport has,  of  course, lowered its standards, but far from the way everything  else has gone down in our case. We are attempting to support all  of that with whatever strength we have. In speaking about  transport in general, it is necessary, first of all, to remember  that prices for diesel fuel have increased here by a factor of  200,000. Please note--not by a factor of two or 20, but by a  factor of 200,000! This is what causes the large expenditures  and unbearable prices. Subways, by the way, with a clear  understanding of their importance by the city administrations of  Kiev and Kharkov as well as by the government, have received an  adequate budget, and are operating at a normal level. Motor  transport, 20 percent of which was formerly renewed every year,  is suffering. No new buses have now been purchased for four  years. The current fare of 100 coupons covers 3-4 percent of the  actual transportation cost. The rest must be compensated by  someone. At the same time, 28 categories of people in our case  eat free of charge. I am in favor of pensioners having benefits.  But it turns out that they do not have these benefits in the  countryside. Instead of tokens, people should be compensated for  transportation with money, a certain sum. That would be fair.    [Mayevskyy] Have you been working in transportation for a  long time?    [Klympush] All of my life. I am 53 years old. I graduated  from the Road Transport Institute in Kiev with distinction, and  did postgraduate work but left on my own to work in production.  After acquiring experience in production, I returned to  post-graduate studies and defended a dissertation. Then I  progressed from an engineer to a director elected by the people  at the Scientific Research Institute of Transport.  Simultaneously I was also director of the scientific-research  association that ensured technical progress and elaborated  transport systems. I was ready for work and understood transport  as a comprehensive system.    [Mayevskyy] How about your private life?    [Klympush] I am married. My wife is a speech therapist and  works at the pedagogical institute; my daughter is a student. I  have not had a vacation in two years. I frequently work  Saturdays and Sundays. At one time I enjoyed mountain skiing and  urged creation of a combined Ukrainian team--after all, I was  born below Goverla.    [Mayevskyy] My God! I though I knew you from somewhere. You  were a well-known mountain skier, and I still remember your  name. It was bothering me.    [Klympush] On 8 March I visited my home during the election  campaign. Recalling my youth, I made some runs on the mountain.  That gave me a lot of pleasure.    [Mayevskyy] You were elected a people's deputy. Will that  mean more work for you?    [Klympush] Yes. There are many problems. Transition to new  methods took place with us, but it is necessary to organize  transport under conditions of a market economy. Right now we  have an economy in a state of transition. It is important to  resolve the problem of ownership in transport in a clear-cut  manner. In aviation and the river fleet, we are proceeding with  auctions. But railways and highways must remain state-owned.  With regard to the highways, it is necessary to designate some  that may be auctioned and some that have strict government usage.    In many areas we must decentralize, relinquish the right to  determine costs and tariffs in the oblast to the local level,  but programs for development of the means of transportation,  adjustment of production, and production of railway cars and  electric and diesel locomotives, as well as shipbuilding should  be handled by the ministry.    The production of the means of transportation, in our view,  is a link that may be used to pull the entire chain. Aircraft,  motor vehicles, and vessels represent the highest technical  level in the entire industry. Their financing would help in the  area of electronics, metallurgy, output of mechanical rubber  products, machine building, as well as the raw material  branches--everyone would have constant orders to fill. At the  same time, the products may be sold both domestically and  abroad. We work together with many ministries. Questions of  standardization, certification, licensing of the means of  transportation and transport activity--these are new areas of  work representing main elements in the activity of the ministry.  We are working on airports, railway stations, and bus stations.  We are developing high-speed main lines so that a train could  travel to Odessa, Kharkov, and Lvov in two to three hours, and  to Simferopol in five hours. We requested that oblast  administrations not occupy land areas where high-speed main  lines may be built. The Aviation Code worked out by us and the  law on road traffic have already been prepared, and railway  transport regulations and the law on transport have also been  submitted. All of these are standardization documents necessary  in society. We are working together with the world community and  have concluded more than 55 international and intergovernmental  agreements on the interaction of various types of transport and  coordination of rules. We are conducting a state policy in the  area of transportation. In the long term we will be involved in  the building of the trans-European railway, with construction  from the western border to Kiev--some 770 kilometers of  high-quality tracks, with all of the required infrastructure  along both sides. Three million people work in our branch, and  we are trying to do everything possible for them.    [Mayevskyy] I wish you much success and thank you for the  interview.</p>

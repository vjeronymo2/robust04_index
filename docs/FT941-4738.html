			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Trade News: US seeks 'fairer' export control - A look at proposals to lift cold war-based curbs on trade From its inception, the administration of President Bill Clinton has made business its business - in particular high -technology business - and competitiveness has been given the highest priority. Despite budget stringency, millions of dollars are flowing into public-private technology partnerships, Mr Clinton's people fought their labour and liberal allies to clinch the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay Round and officials roam the world hawking contracts for US companies. There has, however, been one big disappointment for business. With the end of the cold war, exporters had high hopes that Mr Clinton would lighten one of their heaviest burdens: export controls on dual-use and high-technology products. Last month Mr Clinton announced proposals for a much-delayed Export Administration Act, the law governing export controls, and called for far-reaching licensing liberalisation. The aim has shifted from denying products to communist nations to controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Mr Clinton's proposal calls for strengthening the role of the US Commerce Department in the approval process. It seeks a rigorous evaluation of controls, including their economic impact, before they are imposed; the lifting of old controls that are clearly ineffectual; and simplification of the licensing process, which would result in an answer to the most controversial applications within 90 days. It would introduce the concept of 'unfair impact', allowing industry to petition for removal of controls based on whether similar products might be available from other suppliers abroad, on competitive disadvantage or ineffectiveness of the control. Business reaction to these proposals have ranged from unimpressed to hostile. Many computer companies say that no unilateral controls are necessary because computers have been found to do nothing to aid weapons proliferation. Mr Howard Lewis, vice-president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said that without a total overhaul licensing could cost the US Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20.5bn) a year in exports by the mid-1990s. But the president's plan 'would create a system of unilateral controls loosely co-ordinated with other countries. It would not establish clear authority and accountability for running the system. And it would not do enough to tell US companies clearly what, and to whom, not to export', he said. Mr Peter McCloskey, president of the Electronic Industries Association, said the proposed EAA was 'woefully inadequate'. 'Rapidly changing product life cycles necessitate an export control system that can react quickly and focus only on those technologies that are critical for the development of weapons of mass destruction,' he said. Industry has taken its case to Congress where favoured legislation, sponsored by Delaware Senator William Roth and Minnesota Congressman James Oberstar, is to be written by a House banking committee today. This bill would do away with all national security controls imposed unilaterally on the grounds that critical technologies can best be curbed by co-operation between supplier countries. It would strengthen international export controls by extending preferential treatment to countries which agree to abide by common standards of licensing and enforcement. It wants business input in multilateral negotiations to establish stricter controls on a smaller list of strategic commodities. 'Excessively long control lists only spur resistance from allies and ultimately hinder the effectiveness of control regimes,' said the Coalition for Fundamental Reform of the Export Control System. While business is pushing for a multilateral solution, the US and its allies in the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls are meeting in Paris this week to wind up the organisation's affairs. CoCom is to go out of business on March 31, and with no great common enemy to unite them, the allies are far from agreeing a successor organisation. Russia is to join the new group, which will focus on controls of dual-use goods and conventional arms to outlaw regimes such as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. In the absence of agreement, the US has been expected to propose continuation of the current control lists. Meanwhile, Congress must either hope that one day an effective multilateral regime will be in place, muddle along with sporadic unilateral controls which disadvantage US industry or lift all export licensing requirements except for those products most egregiously dangerous.</p>

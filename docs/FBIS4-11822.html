			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 1 Apr (INA) -- [National Assembly Speaker]  Sa'di Mahdi Salih has reasserted his satisfaction with the  outcome of his meeting with the president of the French National  Assembly in Paris early this week. He said the meeting was an  advanced step down the road of normalizing relations between  Iraq and France.    In an interview with AL-THAWRAH published today, Salih said  the meeting revealed a serious French desire and concern on the  part of the French Government to normalize relations with Iraq  and to move on toward a new stage in which France will greatly  contribute, through the Security Council, toward lifting the  Iraq embargo.    He said the atmosphere that prevailed during the meetings of  the Interparliamentary Union, concluded recently in the French  capital, highlighted a noticeable change in the international  arena and a frank call for lifting the Iraq embargo, especially  the oil embargo.    Commenting on the agreement of the Arab sides to a Moroccan  proposal to hold an ordinary session for the Arab Parliamentary  Union to clear the Arab atmosphere, Salih said: Definitely, the  question of the Iraq embargo will command the attention of  everybody, because the removal of its causes opens the door for  a unified Arab position.    On a visit by a Jordanian parliament delegation to Iraq  tomorrow, Sa'di Mahdi Salih said the delegation, led by 'Abd  Musa al-Nahar, deputy speaker of the House of Representatives,  will hold talks with several officials within the context of  brotherly relations between the two countries. The delegation  will also attend part of the new session of the Iraqi National  Assembly.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTAINMENT: DELUXE SCRABBLE SCORES WITH NONTRADITIONALISTS  </P> <P> Virgin Mastertronics' "The Deluxe Computer Edition of Scrabble" trades away  much of the familiar appeal of the classic board game for some intriguing bells  and whistles. Serious players looking to exercise their skills and stretch  their vocabularies probably will embrace the new features.  </P> <P> But traditionalists will long for the competition, surprise and camaraderie  possible only between human players.  </P> <P> In its most basic form, this computer version of Scrabble -- actually a totally  redesigned update of an earlier electronic version of the game -- closely  resembles the actual board game. After fellow players -- human or computer --  and difficultly levels are chosen, random letters are assigned to each player.  </P> <P> Words are formed and placed on the board in the same way you would with actual  tiles. A very welcome calculating feature keeps track of the point values for  all levels of scoring.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, however, the computer version doesn't do a very good job of  hiding tiles. Whether playing the computer or another human, it is all but  impossible not to know what your opponent has in his/her/its rack. Using the  hide feature doesn't help much either.  </P> <P> We also found a lot to be desired with the huge (2.5 megabytes) dictionary  program that comes with the game: golfer and offer for two. The game makers  promised the entire "Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary," but our trusty  1979 paperback edition turned out to be a bit more complete than the 1990  electronic one.  </P> <P> "Deluxe Computer Scrabble" has enough pluses to make it as a good solitaire  game, but it is definitely not a substitute for an evening with the original  board game and a couple of good friends.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Notice of Intent (Notice) to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement and hold public scoping meetings in Spokane, Richland, and Seattle, Washington, Hood River and Portland, Oregon, was published by the Department in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 28, 1994. The Notice invited oral and written comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of the Environmental Impact Statement, including environmental issues and alternatives, and invited pubic participation in the NEPA process. Overall, scoping comments were received that assisted in identifying major issues for subsequent in-depth analysis in the Draft Statement. As a result of the scoping process, an Environmental Impact Statement Implementation Plan was developed to define the scope and provide further guidance for preparing the Environmental Impact Statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft Statement considers the proposed action and the no-action alternative, which includes a scenario that reasonably could be expected to result as a consequence of the no-action alternative. Impacts to the affected environment, geologic resources, seismology, water resources and hydrology, physical environment, radiation, sound level and noise, ecology including threatened and endangered species (plant and animal), and socioeconomic resources (including environmental justice) from construction of the proposed new tanks have been analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft Statement provides an analysis of information prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed construction and operation of six new tanks, an initial tank retrieval system and cross-site transfer system, and associated facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comment Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Draft Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Copies of the Draft Statement are being distributed to organizations, environmental groups, and individuals known to be interested in or affected by the proposed project.

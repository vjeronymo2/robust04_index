			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 23 and 24 June  publish reports on objections voiced by some coalition deputies  against Milan Janicina, minister for the administration and  privatization of national property, and reactions to calls for  Janicina's resignation from his post.    Bratislava SME in Slovak on 23 June on page 2 carries a  600-word "asa"-signed report entitled "Deputies of the Coalition  Party of the Democratic Left Want To Call on Milan Janicina To  Resign." The report states: "Yesterday's meeting of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic Privatization Committee  dealt with the problem of whether Milan Janicina should be  called upon to resign from the post of minister for the  administration and privatization of national property. Members  of this committee have received additional documentation  pertaining to the `House of Culture Atrium-Ruzinov' affair, in  which Milan Janicina was involved as commercial lawyer and,  according to some indications, placed [his client's] commercial  interests above the interests of the state. Deputies for the  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] (Zselenak, Plesnik), the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (Tomecek), and the Slovak  National Party (Kona) proposed that the committee pass a  resolution recommending that Milan Janicina resign from his  post, in view of the `strength of the arguments.' This course  of action was opposed by deputies for the government coalition  and the Hungarian coalition (Durana, Pollak, Pribula, Komlosy).  They argued that, at the very least, one must wait for the  ruling of the court, which is now dealing with the case, and ask  the Bar Association for its standpoint. At the same time, they  were pointing out that, if Milan Janicina committed any mistake,  this happened long before he became minister." According to the  report, the committee finally decided to suspend the debate on  the minister's case until 28 June.    On the same day, on page 1, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries  a 200-word interview with SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik by  Jana Pankovcinova entitled "Milan Ftacnik Does Not Rule Out That  the Question of Replacing Minister Janicina Will Be Raised." In  the interview, the place and date of which are not given,  Ftacnik is asked to respond to rumors that "the Coalition  Council has dealt with the person of Privatization Minister  Milan Janicina" and that "the prevailing view is that he should  be replaced in this post by SDL Deputy J. Plesnik." While  Ftacnik concedes that privatization issues have been discussed  by the Coalition Council, he asserts that "no coalition partner  has officially raised the issue" of replacing Janicina. As  Ftacnik adds, however, "I cannot rule out that this issue may  still be raised."    Bratislava SME in Slovak on 24 June on pages 1 and 2 carries  a 300-word "vec"-signed report entitled "Minister Janicina:  Csino Is a Pretext; They Want To Recall Me Because I Refuse To  Accommodate Bolshevik Managements." Responding to the calls of  some members of the parliamentary privatization committee for  his resignation, Janicina tells an unidentified SME  correspondent: "Although committee members speak about the  strength of arguments, in reality I do not know even one of  their arguments." Janicina stresses that his only role in the  "Atrium" affair was that of a commercial lawyer who gave legal  assistance to his client, Mr. Viliam Csino, and helped him  overrule the court's original verdict on the privatization of  the "Atrium" building in Bratislava-Ruzinov. The minister  wonders why he should be attacked for having been a "good  defense council" and attributes the efforts to recall him to his  "refusal to accommodate Bolshevik managements."    Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 24 June on page 2 carries a  500-word TA SR report entitled "Milan Janicina Will Not Resign  from His Post." The report notes that, at a meeting on 23 June,  the Executive Committee of the National Democratic Party [NDS],  of which Janicina is a member, expressed "support" for the  minister and "deplored public attacks on him from a coalition  partner." The NDS Executive Committee considers the attacks on  Janicina "incompetent" and "contradicting the ethics of  coalition cooperation," the report says. The PRAVDA report also  quotes Minister Janicina as having told the TA SR that he will  not resign. According to PRAVDA, in the interview for the TA  SR, Janicina challenged the authority of the parliamentary  privatization committee to judge the legal aspects of the  privatization of the Atrium building and reiterated that he was  not representing the interests of the state in the case but,  rather, those of a private client: "If someone claims that I  placed the commercial interest [of my client] above the  interests of the state, he is either an idiot or he  demagogically twists the truth," Janicina is quoted as having  said.    The dispute between SDL members of the parliamentary  privatization committee and Minister Janicina is also the  subject of a 700-word Alica Strbava commentary entitled "Juraj  Plesnik's Moral Mimicry," in Bratislava SME in Slovak on 24 June  on page 4. In Strbava's opinion, the true cause of the dispute  must be sought in the different privatization ideas of the  SDL-controlled Ministry of Economy and the NDS-controlled  Ministry of Privatization. Strbava says: "It is a public secret  that the Union of Industry is very favorably disposed toward the  SDL, as is evidenced by the appointment of Peter Magvasi, a  member of the Union of Industry, to the post of minister of  economy. However, the Union of Industry was also favorably  disposed toward former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. According  to information from behind the scenes, Meciar had promised to  the Union's representatives--that is, to the directors of the  most important Slovak industrial companies (the Union of  Industry comprises some 450 companies)--10 to 12 percent of the  companies' shares, allegedly under very favorable terms. The  present privatization minister, Milan Janicina, does not even  want to hear about the fulfillment of this promise, which,  naturally, does not play into the hands of the SDL."</p>

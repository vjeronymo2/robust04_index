			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Staff Commander Jiri Nekvasil by </F> Petr Bakovsky; place and date not given: "Our Army Has Never  Developed Bacteriological Weapons"]    [Text] In connection with the Army, various affairs, small  or great, have been discussed recently. General Major Jiri  Nekvasil, General Staff commander, answered our questions about  topical issues regarding the Army.    [Bakovsky] Has our Army ever developed bacteriological  weapons?    [Nekvasil] Our Army has never developed bacteriological  weapons. Our Army has never had carriers of bacteriological  weapons, and I do not understand the hysteria that has been  launched regarding this matter in certain mass media. In 1992,  we declared in the United Nations that we were not violating any  treaties on bacteriological weapons. Foreign specialists who  conducted control checks here were informed about everything,  and they even appreciated the order we have here. It is  difficult to understand because we had viruses here for several  years, and we wanted to normalize the situation. We knew that  we were not violating any international conventions. We did not  need them for diagnostic and preventive reasons, so we wanted to  get rid of them. After the check was made in all military  hospitals, we do not have anything anywhere.    [Bakovsky] How does the professionalization of our Army  proceed?    [Nekvasil] Professionalization does not mean counting the  ratio of officers to conscripts. I believe the main goal of  professionalization is to install professionals in positions for  which it does not pay off to train soldiers who are serving for  only 12 months. They are mainly troop commanders, specialists  in the artillery troops, and tank commanders. In this way, a  new category of soldiers should be established. We want to  start with this system in the Fast Deployment Brigade, where we  want to have only professionals in the future.    [Bakovsky] What is the current progress in establishing the  Fast Deployment Brigade?    [Nekvasil] This establishment should be completed on 30 June  1994. The situation progressed last year, when we trained our  people, commanders mostly. Our principle is to accept the  people who want to join the brigade and apply to do so. The  main slogan of the brigade--"Our place is where others cannot  keep up"--makes service in this unit more attractive. It should  be an elite unit that will fulfill tasks on our territory, as  well as peacekeeping tasks outside of our territory.    We want to transfer the experience we gained during the  training of the brigade to another two brigades--that is, the  brigade in Kromeriz, which is now being transformed, and the  mechanized brigade in Susice. When we compared our training  methods, which we plan to use in the Rapid Deployment Brigade,  with the training of Dutch soldiers, it became obvious that we  were going in the right direction and that, after six months in  service, our soldiers proved to be comparable with those  professionals.    [Bakovsky] What will be the situation in the Air Force after  the MiG-23 planes are put out of service? Will the Army have  enough planes to bridge the period until the purchase of new  ones?    [Nekvasil] We have 28 SU-22 planes that are almost new, and  their type is not that old. We will try to keep them. They  have a long life span and are relatively modern. They have  laser-controlled aiming devices. We also have SU-25 planes that  are expected to last beyond 2005. They are interceptor-bombers  and combat planes. As far as interceptors are concerned, for  the time being we will have to stick to recent modifications of  the MiG-23 ML planes as long as possible. We have enough MiG-21  MF planes. At present, we do not need supersonic planes. The  guidance system and weapon systems are the most important things.    It is a difficult thing to reduce the Air Force. Our Air  Force must become a good-quality Air Force, above all. We  cannot let the pilots fly only 50 hours. This was enough in  1991 and 1992, when the Army was in a difficult period. If we  want to have a well-trained Army, our pilots must fly 90, 100,  or even more hours.    I do not support the idea that our Air Force should only be  able to fly. Our Air Force must also be able to fulfill any  defensive tasks that are given to it.    If we have such an Air Force, we need fewer planes, but well  equipped with good guiding systems and weapon systems. With the  current ammunition, you need four planes to fulfill a task that  could be fulfilled by one plane equipped with such a system.  This became evident in the Persian Gulf war. The Air Force  should be reduced and its quality improved. We should also have  fewer types of planes. We have too many of them. After such a  reduction, the Air Force will become more capable of combat.    [Bakovsky] The Military Air Force will use five permanent  airports. What will be the situation during a possible military  threat to the state?    [Nekvasil] We will have the airports in Kbely, Pardubice,  Namest, Caslav, and Prerov. We are not going to abandon other  airports completely. The offer we received for renting the  airports contains certain conditions that will allow us to use  them during mobilization. In a few countries, the air forces  use civilian airports. By reducing the number of airports, we  want to accumulate funds for the purchase of equipment, so that  pilots, technicians, and service personnel might work in  conditions corresponding to European standards. This also  applies to guards.    [Bakovsky] What is the situation in missile testing? Where  will it be conducted?    [Nekvasil] After so long, for the first time we will conduct  the testing in Poland. This will include Air Force, Air  Defense, and short-range missiles, specifically the Neva system.    [Bakovsky] Did the deployment of our troops change after the  division of the Republic?    [Nekvasil] Since 1990, troops have been uniformly deployed  over the entire territory. The main goal was to uniformly  deploy troops over the territory and to allow the soldiers to  serve closer to their places of residence. In that way, the  soldiers are less anonymous. The attitude of the public toward  the Army has begun to improve. For the time being,  transformation has not been completed, and some soldiers from  Moravia have to serve in Bohemia. Their number is constantly  declining, however. In 1995, the deployment of the troops will  allow the soldiers to serve within 100 km of their homes.</p>

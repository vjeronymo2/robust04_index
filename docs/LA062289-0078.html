			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUBSCRIBERS VIEW BETTER CABLE SERVICE  </P> <P> The picture for cable television service on the Westside -- which has been  notorious for its disruptions, poor customer relations and outdated equipment  -- is getting brighter.  </P> <P> The Westside's two primary cable operators -- Century Cable in the north and  American Cablesystems in the south -- are spending millions of dollars to  upgrade their systems.  </P> <P> Falcon Cable, which provides service in Malibu and Topanga and a small corner  of Pacific Palisades, has also upgraded its system recently.  </P> <P> Industry spokesmen say this means customers' telephone calls will be answered  quicker, home service calls will be made more promptly and subscribers will get  more viewing choices.  </P> <P> That's good news for subscribers of Century Cable, which has been heavily  criticized by both subscribers and city officials throughout the Westside ever  since the company took over cable franchises in 1987 in Santa Monica, Beverly  Hills, West Hollywood and parts of Los Angeles from Pacific Palisades to the  Hollywood Hills.  </P> <P> Century Southwest Cable Television, a subsidiary of Century Communications  Corp. in New Canaan, Conn., took over the Westside cable systems as part of a  five-company consortium that bought Group W Cable for $2.1 billion from  Westinghouse Electric Corp.  </P> <P> Century is in the second year of a six-year, $50-million program to upgrade the  systems. Although the improvements will not be completed until 1993, the number  of complaints is dwindling.  </P> <P> "Their problems relative to customer service and technical service have reduced  greatly," said Ian Tanza, West Hollywood's cable/arts administrator.  </P> <P> "Complaints are way down," said Fred Cunningham, who oversees cable matters for  Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "I have never been happier than I am today," said William J. Rosendahl, vice  president of corporate affairs for Century.  </P> <P> Century has been a repeated target of vandals who have damaged equipment or  disrupted signals -- often during broadcasts of major sports or entertainment  events. Until recently, service was so bad that it was widely believed the  vandals were disgruntled customers, but Rosendahl said he is convinced that  could not be the case.  </P> <P> "I can't believe someone would commit a criminal act over poor service," he  said. "It must be some sick, deranged individual."  </P> <P> Rosendahl blames many of the company's problems on the antiquated equipment it  inherited. The technology was so outdated that customers could easily steal the  service by illegally connecting to cable lines on telephone poles with coaxial  cables sold at hardware stores.  </P> <P> Modernization of the system makes the signals difficult to steal. Some former  pirates complained to Century when they could no longer get cable service free,  Rosendahl said.  </P> <P> Century also drew many complaints when it attempted to serve more than 76,000  Westside customers from a single office in Santa Monica. Last November, Century  opened a second office in West Hollywood to serve that city and Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> "It's still far from perfect, but their service has improved dramatically,"  said West Hollywood Councilman Paul Koretz, an outspoken critic of Century. "It  used to be that people would wait 45 minutes on hold, then when someone picked  up, you were disconnected."  </P> <P> To most subscribers, the most noticeable modernization involves the  installation of converter boxes in the homes of subscribers. The new  converters, an option available at extra cost, allow Century to offer  pay-per-view events such as championship fights and recently released movies.  </P> <P> Basic service -- which usually includes all channels that can be received with  a regular television antenna plus cable channels such as ESPN, MTV, CNN and  WTBS -- can be received without a converter box.  </P> <P> Century has completed its converter-box installations in West Hollywood, but  installations are in progress in Beverly Hills and much of West Los Angeles and  have yet to begin in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> It has not been a trouble-free process.. Many Century customers in West  Hollywood complained because the boxes disable remote controls on televisions  and videotape recorders, and prevent viewers from watching one channel while  recording another.  </P> <P> Those problems have been remedied, Rosendahl said, by providing customers with  remote controls for the boxes and installing switches that make it possible to  view one channel and record off another.  </P> <P> In Beverly Hills, Century was fined a total of $29,250 last year -- $250 a day  for 117 days in which it did not respond to service calls or promptly answer  the telephone as required by the franchise agreement.  </P> <P> But Fred Cunningham, who oversees the franchise for the city, said there has  been a definite improvement in service.  </P> <P> "They have been meeting customer service requirements of responding to calls  within 24 hours and answering the phone within two minutes," Cunningham said.  </P> <P> Cunningham said that Century learned a lesson from its West Hollywood  experience and has begun a public relations program to prepare subscribers for  the installation of the new coverter boxes in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, Century is continuing negotiations to extend its franchise.  Technically, the company is operating under a revocation order issued in 1986,  when the city refused to allow the transfer of the franchise from Westinghouse  to Century.  </P> <P> Lynne C. Barrette, the assistant city manager who oversees cable operations in  Santa Monica, said the city attorney is rewriting the city's cable ordinance.  She said she expects the City Council to review both the new ordinance and  Century's request for an extension in about six months.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles areas served by Century -- Pacific Palisades, Brentwood,  Westwood, Bel-Air and the Hollywood Hills -- Susan Herman, who oversees cable  franchises for the city, is not yet ready to praise the company.  </P> <P> "Pleased is too strong a word," Herman said. "We have concerns about  responsiveness to customers."  </P> <P> However, she added, "they have increased the number of telephone lines so  people don't have to wait as long. They have more service representatives,  extended their hours of operation and expanded the existing number of channels.  They appear to be in compliance with the franchise agreement. They are making  efforts."  </P> <P> Herman was more generous in assessing American Cablesystems franchises in  Venice, West Los Angeles, Westchester and Playa del Rey.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty well-managed system," she said. "The performance of American is  very much improved from CommuniCom," the former cable operator in West Los  Angeles, which was widely criticized for its service.  </P> <P> American Cablesystems, which also operates the system in Culver City and the  unincorporated county areas of Ladera Heights and View Park, will be renamed  Continental Cablevision on July 1. Boston-based Continental Cable, the  third-largest cable system in the country, purchased the Westside systems in  1987.  </P> <P> John F. Gibbs, Continental's vice president for corporate and legal affairs,  said the company recently spent $30 million to upgrade its systems in the  Westside.  </P> <P> Gibbs said that while the company purchased cable systems that were near each  other, the systems have been decentralized.  </P> <P> "We have clustered systems together, but we maintain local, almost neighborhood  autonomy," said Gibbs.  </P> <P> Dale Jones, chief administrative officer for Culver City, said complaints have  dropped to about one a month. James Thornton, who oversees cable for the  county, said complaints are almost nonexistent for his areas.  </P> <P> A major complaint of many cable subscribers in all areas, however, is the  increasing cost of cable, a matter over which local officials have no control.  </P> <P> Studies indicate that cable rates have increased 32% nationally since Congress  lifted virtually all regulations on cable operators in 1984. Herman said rates  for basic service in the city of Los Angeles have increased 40% since 1987.  </P> <P> Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Judiciary  subcommittee on antitrust, monopolies and business rights, has introduced bills  that would allow city governments to regulate rates, require that cable  programmers make their programs available to competing technologies such as  satellites and prohibit a cable company from controlling more than 25% of the  cable subscribers in the country.  </P> <P> Last week, Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Commerce  Committee, called for the Federal Communications Commission to review the Cable  Communications Policy Act of 1984, which deregulated the industry.  </P> <P> Dingell said he wants to determine whether unregulated competition, which was  supposed to protect the public interest, is in fact protecting consumers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE

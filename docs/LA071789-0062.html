			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET MINERS' STRIKE GROWS; 100,000 JOIN IN  </P> <P> A weeklong strike by Soviet coal miners demanding better supplies of food,  safer working conditions, more housing and an environmental cleanup around  their mines in western Siberia grew to about 100,000 workers on Sunday and  threatened to turn into a general strike there.  </P> <P> Almost all of the mines in the Kuznetsky Basin, the Soviet Union's  second-largest coal producing region, are now closed, officials said, and the  strike has spread quickly from Mezhdurechensk to nine other towns in the  region, becoming a major political and economic challenge to the country's  leadership.  </P> <P> Describing the region, known as the Kuzbass, as a "raging basin" with "only a  few small islands of tranquillity," the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said  that more than 80,000 workers have joined the strike. The trade union newspaper  Trud put the number in a later report at 100,000, and Radio Moscow reported an  even higher figure.  </P> <P> Although some of the original strikers have resumed work, coal shipments out of  the area have been halted and dozens of other enterprises closed by local trade  union leaders in an effort to force a showdown with the central government.  </P> <P> Efforts by government and Communist Party officials to calm the situation and  restore production have so far failed. Thousands of miners are occupying the  central squares in the towns hit by the strike, Soviet newspapers reported  Sunday, although order is being maintained by patrols of workers as well as  police.  </P> <P> "You can imagine the impact -- all the pits and mines are on strike and most of  the other major enterprises have joined them," Valery Legachev, a member of the  strike committee in Prokopyevsk, one of the striking towns, said Sunday. "The  place is shut down."  </P> <P> Mikhail I. Shchadov, the coal minister, spoke to tens of thousands of miners in  an evening rally in Prokopyevsk on Saturday, but afterward the strike grew as  miners demanded that more senior officials come to negotiate with them.  </P> <P> "The situation is changing from hour to hour, and mines that were peaceful  yesterday stopped working unexpectedly today," the newspaper Soviet Russia  reported Sunday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political, Economic Problem  </P> <P> As it continues to grow, the strike poses both a political and an economic  challenge to the government and the Communist Party leadership under President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> The demands of the strikers are largely that the leadership honor the promises  that Gorbachev has made -- promises not only of better living conditions but  also of greater democracy and of worker control over the enterprises where they  are employed.  </P> <P> At the same time, the work stoppage, one of the largest in the Soviet Union in  recent years, threatens to shut down major segments of the country's industry  -- notably iron smelters, steel mills, thermal power plants and all the  factories that depend upon them for materials or energy -- by depriving them of  fuel.  </P> <P> Already, more than 1 million tons of coal production have been lost, according  to Pravda. The monetary value, about $31 million, is of less importance, the  paper said, than the effect of the lost production on other industries. The  government is battling for economic growth in order to underwrite its reform  program, and these losses could have a severe impact.  </P> <P> The central demand of the strikers is for local administration of the mines --  with strong worker participation -- under new industrial and labor laws adopted  in recent years as part of Gorbachev's broader economic reforms, known as  perestroika.  </P> <P> This would give miners the right, under government-set guidelines and overall  economic plans, to manage the mines, set production goals and use their  revenues in accordance with local priorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Break With Policy  </P> <P> But it would also be a major break -- and in a key industry -- from the Soviet  Union's centrally planned and managed economy, whose Moscow-based  administrators remain firmly entrenched four years into Gorbachev's reforms.  </P> <P> A. Yevsyukov, chairman of the regional miners' strike committee, told Pravda  that "the strikers' demands come down essentially to granting miners'  collectives the real right to control their enterprises' destiny and to dispose  of the coal produced by their hard labor."  </P> <P> Yevsyukov said that the miners want to use the coal they produce above the  governmental quotas to conclude barter deals for consumer goods and, if it is  exported, to use foreign currency earned for the social needs of the city and  region.  </P> <P> In Prokopyevsk, Legachev also said that the key issue is local worker control  of the mines. The workers would set their own production schedules to meet  government orders but would be free to sell above-plan production and use the  money, including highly prized foreign exchange, as they wished.  </P> <P> Other demands include more environmental protection, lower prices at canteens  and stores operated by the mines for their workers, better housing and  recreational facilities, improved working conditions and higher salaries for  medical workers. They also want elections for new local governments.  </P> <P> Among the key environmental issues raised has been a sharp reduction in  open-pit mining, which has devasted the local landscape, the faster reclamation  of this land and its development for agriculture. The miners are also demanding  that the government drop plans to build a slurry line to carry coal from the  area, contending that the region is already short of water.  </P> <P> But efforts by a dissident group, the Democratic Union, to give a further  political cast to the strike failed, according to Trud, when the group's  organizers were shouted down at strike rallies. According to Trud, the miners  declared their loyalty to the Communist Party and their support of socialism --  as well as their determination to make the system more responsive and  effective.  </P> <P> In Kiselevsk, 17 non-mining enterprises struck in support of the miners,  according to Legachev, and the strike seems to be spreading to other industries  elsewhere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Newspaper Voices Support  </P> <P> The strike drew unexpected support on this aspect from the conservative  newspaper Soviet Russia. "The further the Kuzbass strike goes, the clearer the  step forward becomes," the newspaper said Sunday. "Until recently, perestroika  has been a 'revolution from above,' but now it is getting strong support from  below."  </P> <P> The demand of the miners for economic independence was, in fact, promised to  them in Gorbachev's most basic reforms, the newspaper said, asking with a hint  of mischief, "Is this not the essence and goal of perestroika?"  </P> <P> Alexander Melnikov, the first secretary of the Communist Party's regional  committee, also described the miners' strike as part of the process of  perestroika, involving "the popular masses in the solution of acute problems."  </P> <P> But Melnikov argued that the form of the protests -- the work stoppages and the  resulting economic losses -- will inevitably damage economic expansion and thus  mean a setback for perestroika.  </P> <P> In its analysis, Soviet Russia countered that the workers had been raising  these problems for years and that the governmental leaders had ignored them.  </P> <P> "Those who did not heed them, who were afraid of or unwilling to start a  dialogue with them on equal terms, who were slow in putting into life a program  of transformations as outlined by the party or in resolving specific problems  and meeting people's demands, are much more to blame for what has happened,"  the newspaper said.  </P> <P> "These are the forces that drove the Kuzbass workers to a strike and whom we  call, and with good reason, the anti-perestroika forces."  </P> <P> ETHNIC UNREST  </P> <P> Clashes in a Black Sea resort city killed 11 people.

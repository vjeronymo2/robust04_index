			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> UNION TARGETS SWEATSHOP OPERATORS;  </P> <P> GARMENT INDUSTRY: IT OPENS A DOWNTOWN DROP-IN CENTER TO ASSIST WORKERS -- EVEN  NON-MEMBERS -- TO FILE GRIEVANCES AS PART OF LONG-RANGE RECRUITING EFFORT.  </P> <P> Having never been able to organize more than a few thousand of the estimated  90,000 workers in Los Angeles' downtown garment district, the International  Ladies Garment Workers Union on Thursday opened a downtown "drop-in" center  that will assist workers -- regardless of whether they are members -- in filing  unpaid-wage and overtime claims against sweatshop operators.  </P> <P> The effort is part of an embryonic campaign to recruit immigrant workers that  is taking place throughout organized labor, most noticeably in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> To recruit immigrants, labor is finding that it must break down widespread  cynicism and fear by first offering a broad variety of social services to  prospective members and then -- months or years later -- try to use that base  to build organizing drives in plants.  </P> <P> The new center, located in third-floor space rented by the union in a building  at 110 E. 15th St., will be run by three union staff members who will counsel  workers on a variety of social problems, said Steve Nutter, the union's  regional director.  </P> <P> "It's a terrible mess out there," Nutter told a press conference inside the  center, standing under a large banner proclaiming the center's theme, Consiendo  con Dignidad -- sewing with dignity.  </P> <P> In blessing the opening of the center, Father Luis Olivares, pastor of Our Lady  Queen of Angels Roman Catholic Church, praised the role of unions and said they  are always necessary, regardless of how benevolent an employer may claim to be.  </P> <P> The union and state labor investigators contend that the $6-billion-a-year Los  Angeles apparel industry requires workers -- some of them children -- to toil  long hours in unsafe conditions for less than the minimum wage.  </P> <P> Theoretically, such conditions make workers ripe for unionization. But  hostility from employers, a high failure rate among businesses and the  transient and vulnerable nature of many employees have undermined organizing  drives.  </P> <P> It was with these types of problems in mind that the AFL-CIO last year created  the California Immigrant Worker Assn. to offer so-called "associate" union  membership to immigrants, regardless of where they worked or whether their  shops were actually organized. The association has signed up several thousand  Los Angeles members in what it acknowledges is a glacially slow effort to set  the stage for organizing drives at individual businesses.  </P> <P> In setting up its garment district center, the Garment Workers Union became the  first formal "division" of the Immigrant Worker Assn. Workers who drop by the  center for advice will eventually be asked to become associate union members.  </P> <P> The new center is part of what the union calls one of its most ambitious  nationwide organizing drives in decades. Similar efforts are being made in  Brooklyn, San Francisco, Chicago and El Paso, all with a call to "declare war  on sweatshop conditions."  </P> <P> The drive began last month on the 79th anniversary of the 1911 fire at the  Triangle Shirtwaist Co. in Greenwich Village that killed 146 workers and is  regarded as a historical spark in the movement for improved industrial safety.  </P> <P> Besides trying to boost national membership of the union -- which has plummeted  to 150,000 from 300,000 in the last 10 years -- the organizing drive will  attempt to publicize proposals for tougher enforcement of sweatshops.  </P> <P> State legislation introduced by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) last  month would make manufacturers jointly liable for any labor abuses committed by  the hundreds of smaller businesses that sew their clothing. Among other things,  it would protect workers against so-called "stich-and-ditch" sewing contractors  who underpay their workers or go out of business without paying at all.  </P> <P> The legislation is expected to encounter strong opposition from manufacturers,  who say they cannot police the labor practices of the independents who sew for  them.  </P> <P> Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias Del Pueblo, a family-assistance group  that has operated from a 7th Street storefront since 1987 to aid garment  workers, said she welcomes the presence of the drop-in center.  </P> <P> "It's a new turn on the union's part," she said. "In a sense it's stepping  back, trying to do some groundwork that they have to do if they ever hope to  gain the confidence of the workers. You have to work with garment workers on  all of their problems -- eviction, child care -- not just work problems,  because so many of them are living in poverty. We have some clients who work 55  hours and get paid $50."  </P></p>

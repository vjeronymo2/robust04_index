			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / MoD and Treasury battle on cuts A tussle was under way yesterday between the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury over forthcoming cuts in military spending, as unrest mounted on both sides of the Commons. The MoD is understood to have completed its Front Line First proposals, designed to shave at least Pounds 750m a year from the defence budget, mainly by trimming expenditure on support services. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, said in April he was seeking savings from support spending, and might use the spare funds to beef up the forces' frontline capability. However, the Treasury is now understood to be challenging this. Mr Rifkind is expected to confirm several procurement decisions around the time of the announcement of the decision - expected in mid-July - to soften the political impact of the spending cuts and up to 25,000 job losses. At Westminster, Mr Julian Brazier, chairman of the Tory backbench defence committee, was one of a number of Conservatives who attacked plans to cut support services. He said: 'I understand there are likely to be cuts in the medical capability of the forces, which we would need if we ever went to war, and they are also talking about further cuts in spares and ammunition, which we found we didn't have enough of in the Gulf.' At the same time, Labour stepped up its campaign to preserve the Rosyth naval base in Fife, amid fears that it will be closed with the loss of more than 4,000 jobs. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor - whose constituency contains the naval base - urged Mr Rifkind to make a statement on Rosyth's future before publication of the report next month.</p>

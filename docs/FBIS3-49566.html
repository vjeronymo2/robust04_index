			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ewa Spychalska, National Trade Union Accord </F> (OPZZ) chairperson, by correspondent Teresa Kwasniewska; place  and date not given]    [Text] [Kwasniewska] Rumor has it that the government is  currently lagging behind the National Trade Union Accord [OPZZ]  -- at least that is what Prime Minister Pawlak has alleged....    [Spychalska] We can no longer hold back and wait for the  government. There are certain issues which need to be sorted  out now, without delay. We all know that the situation is  difficult; the previous government did not conceal that, either.  After all, as we prepared for the projected economic  transformations, we were all hoping (along with representatives  of the state's executive powers) that that state of affairs  could be reversed reasonably quickly. However, there still have  been no proposal to set up a group of competent people to  analyze what should be changed and how it should be done.  Meanwhile, people are getting impatient and disappointed.  After all, this is not what they chose the new authorities for  -- but no obvious changes are forthcoming, and it does not look  as if they were forthcoming in any foreseeable future.    [Kwasniewska] But you seem to have little power or influence  to change the course of events, do you not? After all, price  rises are being introduced regardless of whether you approve of  them or not.    [Spychalska] Some price rises are the effect of the last  budget, and that was drafted and approved by the old Sejm.  Others are the consequence of the switch to the free market  economy. After all, no one wants or expects to see a return to  the old system of central steering of the economy.    [Kwasniewska] What about the social contract which you were  proposing?    [Spychalska] That concept was announced by Premier Pawlak,  but to date the government has not come up with any proposals  for such a social contract. That is why we are suggesting our  own theses and proposals.    [Kwasniewska] Has there been much interest in your proposals  on the government's part?    [Spychalska] The government showed so much interest in them  that we were forced to make our proposals available to it while  they were still being drafted and perfected by the relevant  working party. That was because it turned out that the  government had no specific concept of how to work out such a  contract in the first place....    [Kwasniewska] What elements should be included in the social  contract you have in mind?    [Spychalska] Generally speaking, such a contract should map  out the principles of our social and economic policy that should  see us through the next four years. It should also give a more  detailed outline of that policy for the approaching year. Even  more specifically, it should include proposals on how to  galvanize the economy, which directions of foreign economic  cooperation should be adopted, how to create opportunities for  expanding the market, and which products to concentrate on.  Also, how to halt the spread of unemployment, and how to find  the best methods to create new jobs. The social contract should  specify the extent of proposed investment outlays, the  principles of our policy regarding state enterprises, and also  the principles of our proposed pay and price policies. It is  high time to begin talking about bringing our wages and our  incomes into line with the free market rules. The abolition of  the enterprises tax on above-normative pay ["popiwek"] does not  solve any problems here. To date, there have been no talks with  the government on the question of the value of labor in the  finished product. And such talks should definitely take place  soon.    [Kwasniewska] When do you think is such a social contract  most likely to be signed?    [Spychalska] It would only make sense to sign it before the  state budget is approved. That in turn should be ready for  submission to a Sejm debate by the end of March or beginning of  April. Thus, there is still plenty of time to negotiate its  terms in talks with the government.    [Kwasniewska] But do you not preclude the possibility of  testing the government's -- your own government's -- strength in  a confrontation of forces?    [Spychalska] Regardless of whether or not there are own  trade union representatives in the government, the government is  a social consensus government, since it was appointed as a  result of a democratic election. Apart from that, the  government will always be just a side to negotiate with as far  as the trade unions are concerned. And it is certain that we  will often stand up against this government.    [Kwasniewska] The needs of the population increasingly  exceed the government's ability to meet them....    [Spychalska] We know about that. However, it is the  government's brief to expand its ability to meet the needs of  the population. It is high time indeed for the government to  activate the mechanisms which can increase state budget revenues  and not merely go on curtailing budget expenditure.    [Kwasniewska] Will Solidarity take part in your negotiations  with the government?    [Spychalska] We have had no response to the public  invitation which we extended to Solidarity to engage in joint  work with us. However, we will yet again approach our colleagues  from other trade unions. After all, the stronger and better  represented the union side, the better guarantees we will have  to obtain some satisfactory results -- such as the decent  minimum wages in the "Social Welfare Guarantees Charter."    [Kwasniewska] The "popiwek" tax is scheduled to be abolished  on 31 March, but the men at the helm of our economy are still  nursing many anxieties about it....    [Spychalska] Their fears are unjustified. As a result of  restructuring, today many enterprises are able to reduce  employment in the interest of paying higher wages to their  remaining work force, who are thus more efficiently employed.  However, they often give up this chance during the transition  period, in the situation where the government is unable to  guarantee work for everyone. They keep many of their employees  on, thus giving them a chance to continue earning money and  avert the specter of becoming dependent on unemployment benefit.  Such gestures are very noble. But this state of affairs cannot  last very long.    Nor does the government have to worry that the entire profit  will be absorbed by the wages. Today every employed person  knows that unless a proportion of the company profit is invested  in development and modernization, there will be no job for him  -- or for anyone else in the company -- to count on in the long  run.    [Kwasniewska] Will the OPZZ not encourage people to strike?    [Spychalska] If we manage to negotiate an agreement with the  government that will offer us sufficient hope that the situation  will improve, we will obviously be obliged to promote attitudes  of calm among the population, to talk to people, and to persuade  them that it is well worth remaining patient. If the public has  even the slightest evidence of some tangible improvement in  their situation, we can ask them for still more patience. On  the other hand, I see no chance of calming the public if nothing  is seen to be improving....</p>

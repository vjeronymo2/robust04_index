			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Two-way pull on Airways BRITAIN'S flag carrier airline British Airways was one of the most actively dealt stocks yesterday as negative sentiment continued to exact its toll on the shares following last week's 'dirty tricks' settlement with Virgin Airways. Turnover rose to 4.7m and, at the day's worst, the shares were down 10 1/2 at 260p on fear of further negative revelations over the affair. This was compounded by concern that BA may have to surrender more lucrative slots to Virgin following a meeting last night with the UK transport minister. Fears of an escalation of the conflict with Iraq also weakened the market's enthusiasm. However, a feeling that the earlier falls had been overdone later emerged, boosted by reports that BA would soon announce a revised partnership deal with USAir, the sixth largest carrier. This steadied nerves and, together with bargain hunting during the afternoon, helped the stock to lift off the bottom and close 5 1/2 down at 265p. Thames deals Thames Water underperformed a generally unhappy water sector after reports that the group's directors had sold around 1.2m bonus shares into the market. The Thames directors were said to have sold the stock at 480p and it was later placed in the market around 482p. The block accounted for most of the turnover in Thames Water yesterday, which totalled some 3m shares. The Thames stock was thought to have been taken with a minimum of fuss. But there were suggestions that the water sector had seen a good deal of switching involving the four water stocks in the FT-SE 100. Anglian lost 7 to 476p, North West 6 1/2 to 469p and Severn Trent 6 to 455p. Thames settled 9 off at 484p. Unilever pleases Reports of strong earnings at Unilever at the first of a series of planned meetings with analysts helped to bolster confidence in the shares, which have underperformed both the food manufacturing sector and the general market over the past three months. The shares advanced 11 to 1079p, although in thin turnover of 697,000. The presentations, held to inform market specialists about Unilever's fourth-quarter trading pos-ition, are due to continue over the next few days, with analysts predicting further strengthening on the group's upbeat message. Earnings growth in the US, where operating profits declined last quarter, was reported to have recovered well, while reassurances were given over market worries about Unilever's exposure to the weakening German economy. There was also talk of Unilever strengthening its position in a number of key sectors, with the group privately saying that earnings growth was above 15 per cent on the same period last year. By coincidence, the Anglo-Dutch group yesterday announced a tie-up with BSN, the French food company, to market frozen yoghurt on the Continent. Unilever shares have underperformed the All-Share by around 8 per cent over the last quarter and the food manufacturing sector has lagged behind the All-Share by 1 per cent. BCI meetings Meetings between Blue Circle Industries and several London stockbroking firms provided the trigger for minor increases in profits estimates by building analysts. Also, worries about a possible cut in the building materials group's dividend, due to be announced in mid-April, when it reports preliminary figures, were generally dispelled. Specialists said Cazenove, BCI's own broker, had met the company and edged its current profits forecast higher, from around Pounds 78m to Pounds 84m, although this was not confirmed. The upgrade was described as largely cosmetic and made because the proceeds of the recent disposal by the group of its ATCO lawnmower business will be taken above the line on the profit and loss account. 'The rise in the shares reflects prospects for 1993 and the dividend,' said one analyst. BCI shares closed 12 higher at 208p after heavy turnover of 4.9m. The shares fell away to 124p last October, the lowest level since August 1986, but have subsequently moved sharply higher, partly because of takeover speculation. Composite insurers provided two firm features in General Accident, boosted by a Hoare Govett recommendation and 14 higher at 574p, and Commercial Union, where UBS was believed to be recommending a switch from Prudential into CU. A move by glass manufacturer Pilkington to increase its float glass prices by 8 per cent drew a positive response from the market, where Pilkington shares were hoisted 4 to 111p. Turnover was a good 3.2m shares. The price rise is the third by Pilkington since the winter of 1991. The previous two failed to stick. The news immediately impacted on Heywood Williams, the glass distributor, whose shares raced up 12 to 204p on hopes of improved merchanting margins. Housebuilder Tay Homes shocked the market by announcing a profits warning, the shares losing 17 at 151p, after 146p. Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo Holdings rose 12 1/2 to 728p after recent falls and a rebound on Friday in US drug shares. The stock shrugged off reports from the Netherlands that Glaxo's new migraine treatment might be linked with heart attacks as well as harmless chest pains. Second-line pharmaceutical stocks, featured as a buy opportunity last week by one analyst, also performed well. Amersham gained 5 to 679p and London International improved 5 to 269p xd. The sector was hit in the new year as a number of investors moved away from stocks perceived as recession proof. Recently merged television company Yorkshire/Tyne Tees jumped 14 to 136p ahead of today's full-year results. The company is expected to announce profits of about Pounds 20m. There was very vague talk that Carlton Communications might link up with London Weekend Television. Carlton, which has been recommended by analysts for fundamental reasons, gained 10 at 813p. LWT preference shares put on 5 at 300p. Belief that Resort Hotels will hold its dividend tomorrow, together with a broker's buy note, helped the shares improve 3 to 42p. Bass remained friendless, with the pall of sell notes from Kleinwort Benson and NatWest Securities continuing to cover the stock. There are also worries over the annual meeting statement due this week. The shares closed 11 cheaper at 588p. Vague bid talk was heard in Cadbury-Schweppes after last week's Hanson rumours, but the shares failed to react, closing a penny firmer at 460p. Hopes of good interims this week from Park Food lifted the shares 6 to 221p. Dixons was weak in early trading after weekend press reports over the quality of its earnings, but the shares later rallied to close 1 1/2 ahead at 227p xd. The market appeared to discount suggestions that aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce would cut the dividend in March when it reports full 1992 year figures. The shares rose 5 to 112p in trade of 3.1m. Confirmation that Charter Consolidated is planning to sell its 38.4 per cent stake in Johnson Matthey lifted the former and depressed the latter. Shares in Charter rose 15 to 663p, while those of Johnson Matthey gave up 19 to 494p. Several possible buyers were named, including German car group Volkswagen, but the favourite appeared to be American Barrick, the Canadian gold producer. Chemicals group Courtaulds slid 11 to 558p on muted market talk of a profits downgrade. Industrial gases specialist BOC Group improved 3 to 746p, with Hoare Govett highlighting the stock in its weekly sector review. The group also announced the appointment of a new deputy chairman.

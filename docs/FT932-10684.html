			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Bank of Scotland increases provisions BANK OF SCOTLAND yesterday disclosed an 11 per cent fall in pre-tax profits after a series of mishaps in the second half of the year contributed to a 45 per cent rise in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. In spite of a 24 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 487.9m for the year to February 28, pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 125.3m, against Pounds 140.7m in 1992. The bank had experienced 'another very difficult year'. Among problems that led to a provision of Pounds 371.7m, against Pounds 256.8m, were six individual provisions of more than Pounds 5m and losses at its motor finance arm Forthright Finance, which led to the bank injecting capital to strengthen a subsidiary. The bank emphasised it had achieved record operating profits, and reduced its already low ratio of costs-to-income to 51.5 per cent, against 54 per cent. It expected to reduce the ratio below 50 per cent. Bad debts provisions were higher in the second half at Pounds 233.7m compared with Pounds 138m in the first. The bank said the increase reflected 'the downturn moving north into Scotland, and a further fall in asset values in the south'. The bank's measure of core capital strength - the ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets - fell to 5.8 per cent from 6.5 per cent. It said it expected to at least maintain that level of tier 1 capital over the coming year. Countrywide Banking Corporation, the New Zealand operation of which Bank of Scotland became sole owner last year recorded a Pounds 1.4m loss after high bad debt provisions. The worst problem was at Bank of Wales, which incurred a Pounds 15.3m loss after it found the 19-year-old provisioning formula at Forthright Finance was inadequate. The bank injected Pounds 16m of equity and Pounds 8m of loan stock into the subsidiary. There was a 23 per cent increase in operating profits before provisions in clearing bank operations to Pounds 331.1m, against Pounds 269.2m. However, profit after provisions fell by 23 per cent to Pounds 75.2m, against Pounds 97.2m. The bank recommended a final dividend of 2.8p per ordinary share, making a total of 4.57p for the year, an increase of 5.1 per cent on the 4.35p for 1992. Lex, Page 18; Details, Page 20</p>

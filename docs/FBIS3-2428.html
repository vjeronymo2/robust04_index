China is facing  a new opportunity now, and China should seize it. He is fully  confident about the future of China.    She said: "My father has a strong desire to go to Hong Kong  after it returns to China in 1997. He said: 'In 1997, I will be  93 years old and probably unable to walk. But I will go to Hong  Kong even if I am in a wheelchair. I will be very happy even if  I stay in Hong Kong for only a minute'."    In response to a Japanese reporter's question about Deng  Xiaoping's everyday life, she said: "The secret of my father's  longevity is living a regular life."

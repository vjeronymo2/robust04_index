			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Send More Troops"] </F>   [Text] We report today that the Government and the service  chiefs are locked in deep disagreement about whether to  reinforce the British military presence in Bosnia. Unless at  least another infantry battalion group is committed from  Britain, the Army is acutely concerned first, that an important  peace-keeping opportunity under the supervision of a British  general may founder; and, second, that the British troops spread  so precariously across Bosnia will be alarmingly exposed if more  shooting breaks out, unless they are better balanced and  supported. The Government, conversely, is chronically wary of  an increased military commitment that would be far easier to  make than to withdraw from; and ministers fear that neither the  Conservative Party nor the country feels much enthusiasm for  sending more troops into the Balkan quagmire. In consequence,  the Government and some of the most senior members of the armed  forces are more sharply divided on an operational issue than at  any time for many years.    Bosnia is unusual in that it has united many of the old  Thatcherites with a wide sweep of liberal opinion -- and  especially media opinion -- in urging British military  intervention. We have always found it bizarre that some people  in this country are so eager for Britain to assume a wholly  disproportionate share of the moral and military responsibility  for resolving a Balkan imbroglio when all our European partners  save France contribute so little. We opposed major Western  military intervention unless the Americans took part. We were  dubious even about the dispatch of the British force now  deployed, precisely because the current embarrassments seemed so  likely. Once British troops were on the ground, once we had a  substantial stake in Bosnia, the pressures to increase that  stake were inevitable and inexorable. More than that, when we  were asked to send a British general to command the UN forces in  Bosnia, we did not offer a time-server to make a gesture: in  Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose we dispatched one of the most activist  officers in the Army.    Now Gen Rose argues that he cannot do the job he was sent to  perform without more troops -- and not just any troops, but  high-quality British or French troops. Many of the UN  contingents on the ground are almost useless for practical  purposes. Without more men, Gen Rose cannot effectively  implement and extend the fragile ceasefire that exists; and if  the tired British soldiers dispersed in company pockets from  Sarajevo to the coast come under threat, they are highly  vulnerable. Gen Rose's views and wishes have the support of  most of the defence chiefs in Britain. The brutal questions  are, they believe: will we support our own man on the spot?  And are we serious about wanting him to do the job to which he  was committed?    It is evident that the Americans are not going to get the  Government off the hook by committing their own forces.  Washington demands forcefully whether the United States is  expected to believe that, in the post-Cold War environment,  10,000 soldiers on the ground in Bosnia is really the best that  Europe can do. The French have agreed to send an additional  infantry battalion. With deep reluctance, we believe the  Government should accept the Army's view that an additional  battalion should be sent, for a strictly limited term of three  months. Britain cannot and should not accept responsibility for  solving the problems of Bosnia. But, given the commitments we  have already made, and the fragile chance of peace that has  opened up, Gen Rose deserves the support he seeks. If the  Government believed that it would prove too hot in the kitchen,  it should never have set foot there. This newspaper would have  supported such a decision. But now that we are there, whether  we like it or not, pusillanimity will do Mr Major's government  no credit in the face of the clearest professional military  advice.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELPING THE HOMELESS  </P> <P> How pleased I was to read Norman Cousin's Op-Ed article ("The City That Would  Give Shelter," Jan. 10). As one who has devoted the past 15 years with the  homeless on Skid Row, I too have been troubled by the lack of imagination,  ingenuity and initiative our community has demonstrated in its efforts to help  those of our citizens who are forced to call the street their home.  </P> <P> Recently, tangible support for the men, women and children of the streets from  key executives and professionals within several of Los Angeles' most prominent  corporations has renewed my faith in our community. Joining forces with John  Singleton of Security Pacific Corp., these "movers and shakers" have set out to  raise millions of dollars to build a state-of-the-art facility here in Los  Angeles to stand as a national model in the treatment and restoration of the  chronically homeless.  </P> <P> These men and women, volunteer members of the URM Second Century Campaign, are  generating "the collective will" to begin solving what has been regarded as a  seemingly unsolvable problem. Together, they are out to establish Los Angeles  as a passionate, prideful and national leader in addressing what President Bush  has called "our national shame."  </P> <P> Cousins and other concerned leaders like him will certainly be pleased, but  more importantly should know that they, too, can join with us in this great  endeavor.  </P> <P> GEORGE CAYWOOD  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Union Rescue Mission  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

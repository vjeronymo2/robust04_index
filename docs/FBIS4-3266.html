			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, 19 April (XINHUA) -- China plans to carry  out large-scale exploitation of the rich coal resources in  southwest China's Guizhou Province in order to make it a stable  energy supplier for the whole of south China and to relieve the  pressure for transporting coal from north to south.    This is regarded as a major strategic readjustment of the  country's energy supply distribution.    Coal still plays an important role in providing energy for  China's heavy and chemical industries nationwide.    But almost three-quarters of the country's coal are produced  by provinces and regions in northern China and the country has  to ship large quantities of coal to the prosperous south and  east China every year to meet its huge demand for energy.    This has seriously strained the country's transport  capacity,  while work in some factories in south and east China continues  to be held up for lack of energy.    Large-scale exploitation of the rich coal resources in  Guizhou seems to be the most realistic and effective way out,  experts said.    Proven coal reserves in Guizhou, the well-known "sea of coal  in southern China", hold the fifth position in the country,  exceeding those of all the other provinces in southern China  added together.    Improved transport facilities in Guizhou, especially the  completion of several railway arteries linking the province with  neighboring regions, has guaranteed smooth flow of coal.    Application of advanced technology in coal mining and  comprehensive utilization of coal resources have promised even  brighter prospects for this rising star.    For example, the anthracite with ash content lower than 10  percent, in which Guizhou is extremely rich, used to be regarded  as inappropriate for industrial use in China.    But new technology has proved that it not only can be used  to  generate electricity but also is an ideal fuel for the chemical  industry.    Guizhou's coal enjoys another advantage: It causes less  pollution to the environment because of low sulphur content.    Exploitation of coal resources in Guizhou will not only  greatly alleviate shortage of coal supplies in southern China,  thus reducing pressures on transport, but also lay a firm  foundation for the take-off of Guizhou's economy.    China listed Guizhou as one of the major coal production  centers since the 1960s and has earmarked altogether 3.2 billion  yuan to the construction of modern mines during the past three  decades.    Expansion and renovation of some small or medium-sized mines  started during recent years, aiming to improve the coal  production capacity of the province to 60 million tons by the  year 2,000.    But inspecting officials from the State Planning Commission  and the Ministry of Coal Industry hold the opinion that its  developing strategy is still too conservative and the province's  great potential has far from been fully tapped.    At present, the Guizhou provincial government is actively  drawing up a blueprint with central government departments and  hopes that both domestic and overseas investors will join in the  exploitation of its rich resources.</p>

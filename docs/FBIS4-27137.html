			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  predicted Tuesday [31 May] that trade talks between Japan and  the United States will make headway if the two economic  superpowers strive to seek a common basis over the future course  of their trade relations.    "I am sure things will move in a favorable direction," the  premier said at the Japan National Press Club, referring to the  prospects for the bilateral "framework" trade talks to be  resumed Wednesday after a three-month stalemate.    Hata, who became premier in April, said he and U.S.  President Bill Clinton agree their countries can better  understand each other through in-depth talks.    Tokyo and Washington announced last week they have reached a  compromise to reopen the protracted trade talks to set up a new  framework for bilateral trade.    The trade negotiations, which are aimed at widening U.S.  access to Japanese markets, ruptured in February after Tokyo  rejected U.S. proposals to use numerical targets in gauging  progress in Japanese imports.    In resuming the framework talks, the two countries agreed to  use two or more "objective criteria" in measuring progress in  opening Japanese markets and paring down Japan's massive trade  surplus.    On North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program,  the 58-year-old Hata said Tokyo is not sure whether the  communist state already possesses nuclear warheads.    He also expressed hope Pyongyang will "truly open up its  heart to the international community" and dispel allegations  that it is developing a nuclear weapons capability.    As Japan's colonial rule over the Korean peninsula caused  unbearable suffering and sorrow for the people living in both  North and South Korea, the premier said, Tokyo is ready to  cooperate with Pyongyang in promoting public welfare in the  country.    If North Korea keeps on refusing full international checks  at  its nuclear sites, it will result in a catastrophic situation,  he warned.    While saying Japan will act in step with the United Nations  in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, Hata reiterated it  will do so within the bounds of the Constitution that bans the  use of force in settling international disputes.</p>

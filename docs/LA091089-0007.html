			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNS  </P> <P> What so many anti-gun fanatics fail to realize is why the 2nd Amendment was  added to the Constitution. It was not added so that citizens could own weapons  for hunting, target shooting, collecting or even for protecting their lives,  their families or their property from criminals. It was added for one reason:  so that the people could protect themselves from the government.  </P> <P> This is such an incredibly easy fact to document and fits so well with the  liberal philosophy of civil rights and fighting for the little people against  the mighty forces of the government that it is virtually inconceivable that  today it is the liberal that is at the forefront of the anti-gun movement.  </P> <P> MICHAEL STRATTON, Brea  </P></p>

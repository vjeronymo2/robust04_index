			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Protest" signed by Timisoara Mayor Viorel Oancea] </F>   [Text] In connection with the invitation to Their  Majesties King Mihai I and Queen Ana to spend the Holy Easter  Holidays together with Timisoara citizens, we wish to make  public our protest at the Government's attitude, which lacks all  respect for the martyr-town Timisoara and its legally  established authorities.    Striking again at the dignity of the legally elected local  authorities and violating once again the laws of this country's  Parliament -- above all the law on local administration,  according to which the local authority is invested with autonomy  in decision-making and local representation of the state  institutions -- the Romanian Government, by dragging out the  issue and setting almost absurd conditions for granting an entry  visa to His Majesty King Mihai I as a private person, has not  only expressed a position full of contempt for the monarchic  institutions but also violated one of the main rights of every  citizen, namely the right to visit his own country. The major  reason for of this unqualifiable attitude is the current  leadership's legitimacy complex.    This is new proof that Timisoara, the symbol of democracy  and  of a civilized attitude toward the world and its development,  represents for those in power a source of fear, an area that  generates anxiety compared with the sweet comfort of their own  position.    Dear Timisoara citizens, they have not forgiven us for the  fact that the wave that overthrew the entire order to which the  current leaders are still devoted started here.    We do not wish to damage the status of this town, and so we  defy this attitude of the government that is detrimental to  Timisoara's reputation!    Expressing my deepest regret at the government's attitude  and  convinced that their Majesties Mihai I and Queen Ana will not  extend their sorrow at this reaction of frightful reserve to us,  I nurture the hope that the time will come when the bells of the  Metropolitan Cathedral in Timisoara will chime to welcome its  founder, Mihai I of Romania.    God bless us all!    Viorel Oancea, mayor of Timisoara</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department is revising this provision to incorporate section 13951(c)(4) of the Leland Act which requires the State agency to submit rebuttal evidence to the ALJ, to the extent such evidence exists, not later than 30 days after the Secretary submits responsive evidence. The Department is retaining the provision in the NPRM which allows either party to amend the appeal or answer at any time prior to the other party filing a motion for a hearing. An amendment following such a motion would require approval by the ALJ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department wishes to clarify that the motion for a hearing would not be filed with the appeal or the answer to the appeal. Rather, as discussed in &sect;283.15(b), a motion for a hearing is filed by either party after the completion of all scheduled prehearing actions (such as discovery) that were agreed upon during the prehearing conference, scheduling conference or as otherwise established by the ALJ. The filing of a motion for a hearing advises the ALJ and the other parties to the appeal that the party has completed all prehearing activities and is ready to proceed with the hearing. Because the timing for the filing of the motion for a hearing is dependent upon the completion of all previously agreed upon prehearing activities, it is not possible to provide an absolute timeline as to when a motion for a hearing would be filed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 283.10: Consent Decision <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section of the NPRM contains the provision allowing the parties to the appeal to mutually agree to end the appeal process prior to the ALJ issuing an initial decision. The consent decision would not be subject to review by the Judicial Officer or by the Federal Court. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department received one comment on this provision. The commenter suggested that this section be modified to state clearly that the parties may enter into a stipulation as to facts and that this would not preclude further review of the legal issues. The commenter was concerned that legal issues would not be considered if the underlying basis for the legal issues were facts which were not in dispute. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has considered this comment and has decided not to adopt it since the concerns of the commenter are addressed in &sect;283.11, the pre-hearing conference (and similarly in &sect;283.29_scheduling conference). As provided for in &sect;283.11(c), one purpose of the ALJ conducting a prehearing conference is to allow the parties to consider the possibility of obtaining stipulations as to facts in order to expedite and aid in the disposition of the appeal. The Department wishes to clarify that the purpose of the consent decree is to allow the parties to mutually agree to conclude the appeal process prior to the ALJ issuing an initial decision on the merits of the appeal. It is similar to settlement of a civil action in court. The consent decree is not subject to further review by the Judicial Officer or the Federal court. The appeals process contains prehearing procedures to allow the parties to enter into a stipulation as to facts which would not preclude further review of the legal issues. Furthermore, the Department believes that stipulations as to facts may be appropriate at any point to further expedite the appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 283.11: Prehearing Conference and Procedure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section of the NPRM contains the procedures for and the requirements of the prehearing conference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reporting: In &sect;283.11(d) of the NPRM, the Department proposed that the prehearing conference would not be stenographically reported unless ordered by the ALJ. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department received one comment on this proposal. The commenter noted that given the multiplicity of issues to be addressed at the prehearing conference, any party should be entitled to obtain a stenographic transcript of a prehearing conference at its own expense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has considered this comment and has revised &sect;283.11(d) to clarify that any party may petition the ALJ to allow for a stenographic transcript of a prehearing conference at the petitioner's own expense. A copy of the prehearing transcript must be made available to the ALJ and the other parties to the appeal at no cost to the other parties. In response to this comment, the Department has also revised &sect;283.15(o) to clarify that the cost of preparing the hearing transcript and providing one copy of the transcript to the ALJ and the other parties to the appeal shall be borne by the party requesting the hearing. The Department further notes that where these costs are incurred by the State, such costs are eligible for reimbursement in accordance with part 277 of the Food Stamp Program regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 283.12: Discovery <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section of the NPRM contains the procedures which the parties to the QC appeal are to follow in pursuing discovery. The ALJ would establish the scope of and schedule for the completion of discovery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department received one comment concerning the organization of &sect;283.12. The commenter noted that this section was confusing and that organizational changes would clarify and simplify this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

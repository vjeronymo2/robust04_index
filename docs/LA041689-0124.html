			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> CATCHING CAPITALS' FEVER IS DEPRESSING  </P> <P> How many replays are we going to have to see? How many times are we going to  have to watch Ron Hextall flip the bloody puck into the air and follow it  sliding down the ice into the Capitals' empty net? How many times are we going  to have to listen to some bonehead gleefully exclaim that in the whole history  of the NHL playoffs -- all 10,000 games' worth -- this was THE FIRST GOAL EVER  BY A GOALIE!!  </P> <P> I got up early Wednesday morning, turned on the TV and, no matter where I went,  I couldn't get away from the replay. I saw it on 4, 5, 7, 9, 20, 50, CNN, TNT  and ESPN. I saw it on the Weather Channel, superimposed on a precipitation  chart. On MTV, they interrupted (thankfully) a Metallica video to show it. On  "Bravo", there were narrations in Swedish and Spanish. On "Nickelodeon", they  went straight from the replay into a shot of Mr. Ed laughing. If they could  show it on all-news radio, we'd get it every half hour.  </P> <P> Enough already.  </P> <P> (What the hell was Hextall doing with such a curved stick, anyway? Shouldn't  they have measured that curve? What's that, the Kim Basinger model? That should  have been a penalty.)  </P> <P> I'm depressed.  </P> <P> It's beyond anger. I feel a dark, damp, gloomy sadness hanging over me -- sort  of like being in Seattle. Or being Scott Hoch's caddie.  </P> <P> What's red, white and blue and plays golf in April?  </P> <P> The Washington Capitals.  </P> <P> They do it to me every spring; they never fail. First, the forsythia blast out,  then the tulips, then the Capitals. I feel like Charlie Brown just as Lucy  yanks the football away. Why do I continually fall for this?  </P> <P> Hextall!  </P> <P> Of all people, why did it have to be Hextall?  </P> <P> Did you see him exulting after the goal? Tell me you didn't want to pop him in  the labonza. Bang, zoom, Hextall!  </P> <P> Three different people telephoned me in the third period, between the time  Pelle Eklund scored to give Philly a 6-5 lead, and it ended.  </P> <P> "Are you watching this? Are you watching?"  </P> <P> Of course I was watching. At least I watched until Hextall scored. Then, I  stuck my head in the oven.  </P> <P> It's a disease. It has to be a disease. It doesn't matter who they bring in  here. You can be the greatest player in the world, you could be Gretzky, but as  soon as you put on the Capitals' uniform, you lose in the playoffs. Caps Fever:  Catch It, and Gag.  </P> <P> I moped all day Wednesday. Even the things that normally cheer me up, like  wondering how many doughnuts Don Koharski ate for dinner, didn't help.  </P> <P> How could they lose that game? One thing I definitely don't want to hear is how  Hextall "came up large in the goal." I've heard this same phrase applied to  Billy Smith, John Vanbiesbrouck, Kelly Hrudey and Sean Burke. (I visualize Gump  Worsley coming back the size of a Thanksgiving Day float and shutting out the  Capitals 18 straight times.) With them, it was true. But the Capitals got five  goals off Hextall. Five should be enough to win. This is hockey; five'll win  baseball games, for gosh sake. Hextall came up small. Peeters, however, came up  leaky.  </P> <P> I was all set for the Penguins. I was primed to see Mario Lemieux and Paul  Coffey. I'd learned how spell Ubriaco, which until last week I thought was the  second word in the German anthem. (They're not saying, "Boo," they're chanting,  "Igloo.") Not that I'd bought nonrefundable plane tickets to Pittsburgh, mind  you. I wasn't stupid, I realized these were the Capitals I was planning around,  the accidental tourists of the NHL.  </P> <P> I suppose if the Capitals lose Thursday night in Philadelphia, it'll be the end  of the Bryan Murray Era. That's too bad, because I like Murray. Everyone seems  to. Maybe they could hire a coach like Murray. Maybe his brother, Terry. At  least a coach named Murray:  </P> <P> Eddie.  </P> <P> Bill.  </P> <P> Brian Doyle.  </P> <P> Ann. (Spread your tiny wings and blah-blah-blah. She should actually be the  front-runner; she's Canadian.)  </P> <P> Arthur.  </P> <P> Walter. Nah, he'd hold out; the Capitals would have to trade him.  </P> <P> Fred MacMurray. Murray, the cop from "The Odd Couple." Murry from Murry's  Steaks. F. Murray Abraham. Murray Slaughter.  </P> <P> Not one of those young, screaming maniacs, though. Why does everyone think that  all the Capitals need is an ornery mule who'll kick their behinds? Fine, get  Francis. (Not Emile, hosehead, the one who worked with Donald O'Connor.)  </P> <P> I don't know what more to say to my friends on the Capitals. I've done my best.  I've tried every trick in the book to motivate you. The first time I called you  choking dogs, it worked; you won. But the next time, you lost -- choking like  dogs, I might add. When I reversed that and called your opponents choking dogs,  you still lost. Why do you always lose in the playoffs? Why can't you ever get  out of your division? What is it, a visa deal? The last person who was as tied  down was Gulliver.  </P> <P> But you can't hurt me anymore, not after this Hextall Fiasco. I'm washing my  hands of you. You're on your own.  </P></p>

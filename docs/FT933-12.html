			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (34): Silk worms and silicon - There is more to Bangalore than electronics THE south Indian city of Bangalore has established itself as the country's electronics capital, earning the nickname 'Silicon Plateau' from members of its business community. But Bangalore's success in attracting new business ventures, particularly in the software field, is taking its toll on the city's infrastructure. Unless the state government's plans to improve the city's infrastructure see the light of day, further development in the region could be curtailed. Bangalore, capital of the south Indian state of Karnataka, owes its success in the electronics field to a combination of political, industrial and geographical factors. Back in the 1950s, the Indian government decided to base several of the big public sector industries in Bangalore, creating new jobs and establishing Bangalore as an important industrial centre. Those public sector companies included Bharat Earth Movers, Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics, Hindustan Machine Tools and Indian Telephones Industries - names which still play an important role in the state and the country as a whole, employing thousands of people. They also provided a strong magnet for ancillary companies, drawing in small-scale industries which could work as sub-contractors to the big industries. Initially, Bangalore was able to provide a cheap and plentiful supply of power. However, the situation has changed and, as in many parts of India, demand far outstrips supply today. While heavy industries now suffer from a shortage of power, businesses which are less power-intensive, for example in the software and related businesses, have continued to flourish. For such businesses, Bangalore claims to have a number of advantages. For a start, its climate is a lure for many Indians: with an altitude of just over 900 metres and relatively light rainfall, Bangalore is affectionately described by its inhabitants as having 'an air-conditioned climate'. It is green with parks and leafy boulevards - unlike other big industrial or business centres, such as Bombay. 'Young, upwardly mobile, educated people want to come here and if you are bidding for talented staff, that is an important consideration,' points out Mr Anal Jain, vice president of marketing at Tata Information Systems Limited (TISL), the joint venture business between IBM and India's Tata group. There is also a large pool of talent which foreign companies in the electronics and computer sector are keen to tap. The Indian Institute of Science is based in Bangalore and the state of Karnataka as a whole has 18,000 college places for engineering. Mr Richard Gall, managing director of Texas Instruments (India), says: 'Bangalore is known as a technology centre: in the mid 1980s, US companies in information technology saw that demand for software engineering talent was far outstripping the supply in the US, so it was natural that when TI started to address this problem we looked at the technical heart of India.' Such talent comes at knock-down prices for many foreign companies. Mr Jain at TISL points out that companies can hire graduate engineers from a good school for about Dollars 2,000 a year, or maybe Dollars 3,000 if the engineer has an MBA. Such staff would be employed in software, marketing or on the support side. 'Wage rates are going up quite rapidly here, but that is still a lot cheaper than in the US,' says Mr Jain. Foreign investors say they are attracted by the state's relatively good record in terms of labour relations, as well as the Karnataka government's very positive attitude towards investors, particularly in the light industry sector. 'The government is very pro-foreign investment - Bangalore today is a Who's Who of US business,' says Mr John Hamilton, managing director of Cargill Seeds India, the Bangalore-based India operations of Cargill, the US seed company. Cargill may have been welcomed by the state government, but it had a less rapturous response from certain factions of the farming community: some farmers have attacked Cargill property, protesting that the US group will deprive farmers of their livelihood if it patents the seeds it develops. However, the protests do not appear to be deterring other investors. 'We're always open to industrial investment, but we encourage them to go 30km outside Bangalore to reduce the strain on our resources,' says Mr JC Lynn, the state's chief secretary who was brought in last December by Mr M. Veerappa Moily, the chief minister of Karnataka, as part of a shake-up of the administration. Mr Moily represents the Congress (I) party, and replaced Mr S. Bangarappa as chief minister when the latter was ousted because of his corrupt practices. Karnataka has made considerable efforts to diversify its agricultural and industrial base. Sugar-cane and rice paddy are grown where irrigation allows, and the state is rich in teak, rosewood and sandalwood. Eucalyptus has been developed as a fast-growing source of pulp for the forestry sector, while sericulture and dairy processing have been introduced to provide more stable sources of income for farmers in the region. Today, sericulture employs about 200,000 people in Karnataka and the state accounts for nearly half of India's silk production. In industry, however, the rapid growth and development have brought new problems to the region - in particular, shortages of power, water and transportation. In tune with the Indian government's economic liberalisation programme, the Karnataka state government is looking at ways in which the private sector can play a role in developing the state's infrastructure given that Bangalore's current population of about 4.5m is expected to increase to between 6.5 and 7m by the year 2000. There are tentative plans to alleviate Bangalore's traffic problems by setting up a mass rapid transportation system, while meeting the city's demand for power by building new power plants. 'Power supply is a big problem, so our policy has been to encourage small electronics industries rather than heavy industry,' says Mr Lynn. Karnataka's power supply is predominantly hydro-electric. Over the next five years, Mr Lynn hopes that the state will add a further 3,000-4,000MW to its existing capacity of 2,700MW with the help of new coal and hydro-electricity power projects - improvements which would encourage the growth of the heavy industrial sector and undoubtedly benefit many of the region's inhabitants.</p>

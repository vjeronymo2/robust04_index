			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Separate State Demanded by Hindus of </F> Kashmir"]    [Text] Dr. Ajay Chrungoo, official spokesman of Panun  Kashmir, which is organizing a two-day World Kashmiri Pandit  Conference to be held at New Delhi on 27 and 28 December, today  demanded a separate homeland for Kashmiri Hindus. He accused the  government of ignoring the concerns of this minority community,  which had been forced out of its home by Pakistan's activities.    In a press conference he said the government willingly  talked  with the all-party Hurriyat Conference, and with everyone else,  while consciously failing to take note of that component, namely  the Kashmiri Hindus, who were the actual victims of the ethnic  cleansing in the valley.    The Panun Kashmir spokesman also assailed Amnesty  International and Asia Watch, two human rights organizations,  for highlighting human rights violations and ethnic cleansing in  Bosnia and other places around the World, but not presenting the  true picture of Kashmir. He said the two human rights  organizations undermined certain basic features of Indian  democracy by doing nothing to protect the human rights of the  Kashmiri Pandits, who were the victims of the Islamic  fundamentalist groups operating in the valley. Pakistan was  pushing weapons and ideology into Kashmir for the destruction of  peaceful coexistence and harmony, and India had failed to  protect the constitutional rights of the Kashmiri Hindus, when  they were forced out of their homes by infiltrators. He also  said the human rights organizations were preoccupied with  excesses committed by the state apparatus. The spokesman said:  "Amnesty International and Asia Watch highlight only one aspect  and ignore the other, and Amnesty representatives on a visit  here some time ago would not give us an appointment to hear our  case. Despite provocations, the community has not taken up arms  and continues to plead for protection and understanding. We are  seeing the extinction of a race that has been living in Kashmir  for 5,000 years. Ours is a historical identity. Inspite of all  of this, our families are fragmented, and nobody cares for us.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Thursday [17 March] evening, Prime Minister  Adolfas Slezevicius met with foreign mass media journalists  accredited in Lithuania.    Nearly a year ago -- on 31 March -- the Seimas [parliament]  approved the program of the sixth Lithuanian Government headed  by A. Slezevicius. The prime minister noted that his cabinet  was the first among the six governments to prepare its program  and curb inflation which was 1,162 and 189 percent in 1992 and  1993, respectively. The government will seek that the inflation  rate does not exceed 50 percent in 1994 (4.8 and 2.9 percent in  January and February). According to A. Slezevicius, the sixth  government was the most resolute in liberalizing prices: About  80 percent of all prices are regulated by the market. The  government controls only prices for energy, transportation, and  communications.    However, the key unresolved problems for the current  government are mutual debts and settlements of enterprises and  organizations, as well as the inefficient collection of taxes  and work of the economic police, prevention of contraband, land  reform and credits, the construction of the oil terminal and the  pumped-storage electric power station in Kruonis, and the  drafting of the national transportation program. The prime  minister claimed that even though the criminal situation has  stabilized, it still remains complicated. Incidentally, the  crime rate has dropped by 17 percent over the first two months  of this year against the same period of last year, and it is the  lowest among all neighboring states.</p>

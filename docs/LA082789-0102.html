			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH, MITTERRAND DISCUSS LEBANON, POLAND TROUBLES  </P> <P> President Bush, concerned about developments in Lebanon, discussed the crisis  with French President Francois Mitterrand by telephone Saturday, the White  House announced.  </P> <P> The spiritual leader of Lebanese pro-Iranian militants has warned that a French  naval force off Lebanon will be attacked if it intervenes in the fighting, and  the lives of some American hostages have been threatened.  </P> <P> "President Bush discussed his general concern about the general situation in  Lebanon," the White House said in a statement issued in Maine, where Bush is  spending a three-week vacation.  </P> <P> "The two presidents commented on the U.N. cease-fire in Lebanon and agreed to  keep the U.N. spotlight on the problem," the White House said.  </P> <P> Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah has accused France, which has assembled a  fleet of five ships in the eastern Mediterranean, of taking sides in the  Lebanese conflict.  </P> <P> France, however, insists that the ships, including the 24,000-ton carrier Foch,  are there to provide aid and remain nearby in the event that an estimated 7,000  French nationals have to be evacuated.  </P> <P> Bush has said he is satisfied that the presence of the French ships is a  justified precaution, even though it has prompted threats against the lives of  some American hostages.  </P> <P> According to Muslim political sources, Algeria has dispatched a three-man  diplomatic team to Beirut on the Lebanese crisis.  </P> <P> Bush had spoken with Algerian officials about Lebanon and the nine Americans  being held hostage there.  </P> <P> The Algerian team arrived in Beirut on Thursday and held talks with Muslim  leaders, including acting Premier Salim Hoss, who heads a Syrian-backed  Cabinet, the sources said.  </P> <P> Algeria played a key role in defusing the recent crisis involving American  hostages and has had a leading role in the Arab drive for peace in Lebanon.  </P> <P> Although the White House statement did not mention hostages specifically, it  did mention that Bush "reiterated U.S. support for efforts by the Arab League"  to resolve Lebanon's troubles.  </P> <P> The statement also said Bush and Mitterrand discussed developments in Poland,  where the first non-Communist government in more than 40 years has taken power.  </P> <P> Bush was quoted as telling the French leader: "We want to help Poland in a  coordinated way. They need an effective reform program that takes on the  economic realities they face."  </P></p>

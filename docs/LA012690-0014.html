			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE  </P> <P> In her column "Do Children Lie? Not About This" (Op-Ed Page, Jan. 19), Carol  Travis begins with: "It comes down to this: the McMartin jury did not believe  the children."  </P> <P> I disagree.  </P> <P> I believe the jury realized the case was being rushed through by vigilantes,  and asked themselves -- Why? Is something amiss?  </P> <P> Anyone watching the press interview of the jury after the trial should feel a  great relief that such an unbiased jury was there to sort through the mess. I  thank each of them for their candor and attention to the law. We should all  thank them -- who knows when we might need such a faithful group?  </P> <P> EDWARD T. BAGLEY  </P> <P> La Puente  </P></p>

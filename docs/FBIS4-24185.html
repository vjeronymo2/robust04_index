			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 24 Jun (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, Nigeria's  main opposition figure, today initiated an action at the Supreme  Court challenging his arrest and demanding his release, the  GUARDIAN EXPRESS daily newspaper reports. In a statement read  on his behalf by Gani Fawehinhmi, a renowned Lagos lawyer, the  Muslim multimillionaire who was arrested in the night of 23 June  and transferred to the federal capital, Abuja, asked the Supreme  Court to rule that he be released. He described his arrest as a  gross violation of his rights to personal freedom as laid down  by the 1979 Constitution and the African Charter on Human Rights  and the Rights of Peoples. Moshood Abiola, who declared himself  "president of Nigeria and commander in chief of the Armed  Forces" on 11 June, also maintains that his arrest and detention  interfere with his right to participate in the country's  political life, the evening newspaper reported. The hearing has  been set for 26 June.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuriy Selivanov under the "Dniester" rubric: </F> "Colonel Bergman's Personal War. Fourteenth Army Military  Commandant Undertakes To Impose Order"]    [Text] There is hardly a day without Tiraspol's being  rocked by yet another scandal involving Colonel Mikhail Bergman,  local commandant of the 14th Russian Army. The indefatigable  colonel recently exposed the Dniester leaders, charging them  with illegal possession of firearms allegedly stolen from 14th  Army depots. On this basis, the military commandant urged the  Russian Federation authorities to strip the Tiraspol leaders of  their Russian citizenship which they are shamelessly abusing, he  said.    In the latest incident, all Tiraspol was shocked at the  story  involving the 14th Army commandant's office seizing the property  of their fellow serviceman, General Kurchin, who decided to move  together with his family to Russia and packed his bags into two  rail containers. Bergman's subordinates moved in and seized the  containers, carted them downtown, and dumped the contents on the  ground for all to see, as if to say: There, dear people, look  how the Dniester public property embezzlers make their fortunes.    The mass media of the Dniester Moldovan Republic have been  hyping information about a letter Bergman allegedly sent to  Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev personally.  In it, having roasted Gen. Lebed, the 14th Army military  commandant paints the situation in the Dniester Moldovan  Republic in exceedingly dramatic light and suggests that Mr.  Grachev charge himself with imposing order, which he promises to  do inside the briefest space of time. Mr. Bergman has neither  confirmed nor denied the existence of such a letter.    Informed observers are inclined to link the colonel's  extraordinary behavior with his special service record.  Virtually all of his service has been in Tiraspol, where he  knows everyone and everything. One can only envy his vast  connections in the most different social sections, and few doubt  that the colonel uses the 14th Army commandant's office alone  for support. Whereas for Gen. Lebed the local skirmishes are no  more than a stage in his biography, for Col. Bergman they seem  to be his whole life. His current heightened activity in the  field of combating Dniester corruption coincides in time exactly  with Tiraspol's decision to institute criminal libel proceedings  against him and its request to the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry to transfer Mikhail Bergman to serve in some other  region.</p>

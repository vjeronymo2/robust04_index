			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PANEL FEARS 'MAJOR COMPUTER DISASTER'  </P> <P> Modern thieves can steal more with a computer than with a gun, and America's  "luck" in avoiding a major computer disaster way soon run out unless security  is tightened, an expert panel warned today.  </P> <P> A National Research Council committee concluded the United States has grown to  rely on computers for everything from banking to health care without ensuring  that such information is secure from accident or deliberate attack.  </P> <P> Furthermore, failures of computer system security, safety and reliability  appear to be increasing in number and severity, the panel said.  </P> <P> Among the examples cited were: the much-publicized 1988 incident in which a  reproducing computer program, called a worm, snarled as many as 6,000 computer  systems; a nearly successful attempt to use thousands of phony automatic teller  machine cards with identification numbers pirated from a computer, and a bid to  defraud the Pennsylvania Lottery of $15.2 million by using a data base of  unclaimed ticket numbers to produce a fake winning ticket.  </P> <P> Poor quality control also can make computer systems untrustworthy, the panel  said. It cited an error in computer software controlling a radiation therapy  machine that resulted in at least three patient deaths, and the scrambling of  patient records at one hospital by a rogue program, or virus, that was  accidentally introduced into its computer system.  </P> <P> "To date, we have been remarkably lucky. . . . As far as we can tell, there has  been no successful systematic attempt to subvert any of our critical computing  systems. Unfortunately, there is reason to believe that our luck will soon run  out," the 16-member panel said.  </P> <P> "The modern thief can steal more with a computer than with a gun. Tomorrow's  terrorist may be able to do more damage with a keyboard than with a bomb."  </P> <P> Finding that no existing public or private organization is "positioned  adequately to address the nation's needs" in computer security, the experts  called for creation of an Information Security Foundation funded by member  subscriptions and fees for security evaluation and other services.  </P> <P> Neither of the two agencies traditionally assigned with overseeing technology  -- the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Security  Agency -- appears prepared to tackle such a task, the panel said in its  303-page report entitled "Computers at Risk."  </P> <P> In addition, "the market does not work well enough to raise the security of  computer systems at a rate fast enough to match the apparent growth in threats  to systems," said the panel, headed by David Clark of Massachusetts Institute  of Technology in Cambridge.  </P></p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / BAe may sell business jets to Raytheon BRITISH Aerospace is in advanced negotiations to sell its corporate jet activities to Raytheon, the US company that makes Beechcraft small and business aircraft. Although BAe yesterday described the talks as 'speculation', the UK aerospace group has already attempted to sell control of its business jet operations to Raytheon last year. After the original deal collapsed last September, BAe announced it intended to hold on to its business jet division whose headquarters were transferred from the UK to Little Rock, Arkansas, a leading centre for executive jets. However, Mr Dick Evans, BAe's chief executive, also said last year the company no longer regarded its business aircraft operations as a core activity. It has also continued seeking a buyer for its business jet division and negotiations with Raytheon and its Beechcraft subsidiary are understood to have been gathering steam in recent weeks. BAe's business aircraft activities are estimated to be worth around Pounds 200m to Pounds 250m, according to City of London analysts. A sale would provide BAe with valuable cash at a time of extensive restructuring. The sale of the business aircraft activities would also reflect the general trend of consolidation in the corporate aircraft sector which has seen a number of deals in the last 12 months including the take over of Cessna by Textron of the US and of Learjet by Bombardier of Canada. BAe's corporate jet business would also provide Raytheon's Beechcraft subsidiary with a good fit since Beechcraft is in the lower end of the market and BAe's operations would enable it to expand its business in the medium-range corporate jet market. BAe manufactures the 125/800 and the 125/1000 medium-size business jets. This has been a successful activity for the UK company for the past 30 years. But the 125 family of aircraft now requires heavy investment to renew its product line and BAe no longer considers this a strategic option in its recovery programme. Instead, BAe is refocusing its aerospace operations around its military aircraft activities and its 20 per cent stake in the European Airbus airliner programme.</p>

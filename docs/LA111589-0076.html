			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CABBIE PICKS UP ONE, DELIVERS TWO  </P> <P> A woman who had just gone into labor Monday morning hailed a cab near MacArthur  Park and gasped a one-word plea: "Hospital!"  </P> <P> Maria Gonzales, 36, of Los Angeles then handed the cabbie a hospital  registration card with the address for County-USC Medical Center, and the taxi  sped off.  </P> <P> By the time the cab reached the corner of 1st Street and Broadway downtown,  however, driver Philip Gleason, 54, realized the baby was not going to wait.  </P> <P> "I knew we'd never make it," he said. "I heard her moaning and groaning and . .  . I knew he was coming up soon."  </P> <P> He opened the door on Gonzales' side and positioned her legs so that they  stretched out the door. Then he waved down a Los Angeles police officer. A  California Highway Patrol officer also stopped to help.  </P> <P> The baby boy came out fast.  </P> <P> "He only took about two minutes," Gleason said.  </P> <P> Gonzales and the infant were transported to County-USC Medical Center where  "they are both doing fine," said Adelaida De La Cerda, a hospital spokeswoman.  </P> <P> As the baby made his untimely debut, the taxi meter kept running.  </P> <P> Gleason said the $14.30 fare was on him.

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Survey of Sweden (9): Formidable twin challenge ahead - Prime Minister Carl Bildt talks to Hugh Carnegy The opinion polls are against him, but Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister, appears to relish the formidable twin challenge facing him next year of winning a general election and turning around public hostility to Sweden's application to join the European Union. As youthful and energetic as ever after two tough years in office, the 44-year-old leader of the Moderate Party (politically, the Moderates are conservatives) insists it is possible to overcome the lowly image the EU has taken on and repulse the offensive of the Social Democratic opposition in spite of having presided over a painful recession that has driven unemployment to levels unimaginable in Sweden a few years ago. If he succeeds, Mr Bildt will have achieved his two principal political goals: to lead Sweden politically, economically and irrevocably into the heart of Europe and to complete the country's transformation from state domination to an open, market-driven economy. Mr Bildt's normally cheerful good temper has sometimes frayed as the negotiations with the EU on an accession agreement approach a climax. Even Sweden's greatest advocate of European integration bridles at examples of 'Brussels' interference in the way of life of ordinary Swedes' - such as the EU's ban on 'snus', the orally-taken wet snuff that is so popular among Swedes. But he has soldiered on with his regular Monday campaign around the country, trying to persuade a sceptical electorate that joining the EU is 'an overriding national issue'. 'I feel a mood of great interest, especially among young people,' he said in an interview. 'But they don't yet feel all their questions have been answered.' When the promised referendum on EU membership will be held is not yet clear. So increasingly the more compelling public issue is next September's general election, which current opinion polls suggest the Social Democrats will win. But Mr Bildt firmly rejects the Social Democratic claim that the political pendulum in Sweden is swinging away from his brand of liberal conservatism. 'They have said that for the past 15 years and they are wrong,' he retorts. 'They are the ones who are adjusting in our direction. They now talk about the market economy in a way they would not have dared a couple of years ago. 'The overall direction of policy that we see in western Europe is very much in the direction of further liberalisation; further deregulation of markets; of opening up.' He warms to the theme. 'In Sweden, I am, of course, radical and the Social Democrats are the conservatives, bordering on reactionary. They are the barons of the old order. 'They are resisting change much in the same way that in the mid-19th century, which was a period in Sweden of very rapid liberalisation, you also had the barons of the old order resisting change.' He points out that in the 100 years to 1970, Sweden experienced growth unmatched in the world, but that this ground to a halt in the next two decades, a period in which the vaunted 'Swedish model' of industrial welfarism reached its apogee. 'There was something fundamentally wrong with the policies that were pursued during the 1970s and 1980s. I, of course, associate that with the dramatic rise we had in the tax burden, with regulation and the role of public expenditure in the economy. If that was part of the model it was a model that clearly failed. 'We had enormous increases in transfer payments without increases in production. We became the sickest society in Europe in terms of absentee rates. We have seen during the past years productivity improving dramatically - in the private sector primarily but now in the public sector as well. We are becoming competitive now and with the changes under way there should be an entirely new entrepreneurial climate in Sweden.' The change in direction has been accompanied, however, by unemployment approaching 14 per cent, an expensive banking crisis, a crash in house prices, cuts in social benefits, a huge budget deficit and rapidly escalating levels of government borrowing which combine to give the Social Democrats considerable ammunition. But Mr Bildt has so far skilfully managed his minority coalition with the Liberal, Centre and Christian Democratic parties, keeping the government united without a single cabinet change since it took office in late 1991. Now, he says, the pay-off is beginning to show through. 'When we started off I said our aim was to get growth rates back to those in comparable European countries by the mid-1990s - we haven't been there for 25 years - and to create the conditions for having growth rates well above the European average by the latter part of the century. That is perfectly feasible if we continue our policies.' The question is whether the electorate will vote for more of the Bildt prescription, which has proved so painful for so many. 'The mood of the country is a realistic one,' he says, adding that his government is less unpopular now than the previous Social Democratic administration was at an equivalent stage. 'The difference is, we will have a situation where the economy is seen to be improving. So I am always saying that I will be surprised if we don't have a non-socialist majority after the elections. The margins are very tight - much tighter than most people realise.'</p>

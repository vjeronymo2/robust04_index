			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets: The ghosts of depression - Serious Money WORLD stock markets have not had a very happy summer. The continuing decline in the Tokyo market has rekindled fears of a 'meltdown' in the Japanese financial sector. European shares have been depressed by the Bundesbank's determination to keep interest rates high. Some commentators are muttering that the 1930s are repeating themselves, with the big trading nations obsessed with their own problems and failing to take the concerted action needed to shake the world economy out of lethargy. One fund manager who takes a gloomy view is Nils Taube, of Global Asset Management, who says: 'I am more depressed than I was earlier this year. I am getting very suspicious of meltdowns in individual areas. We have already had the problems in Japan and we have pretty nearly had a meltdown in Italy. 'Deflationary forces are well in place', he adds. 'If you measure it in D-mark terms, there has been a real shrinkage in world money supply.' Taube is not too impressed by the authorities' ability to solve these problems. 'When you had closed economies, it was easy to manipulate a domestic market', he says. 'Now, with open economies, it takes concerted international action. Take the US, where reducing interest rates has proved to be like pouring water on to sand.' Mark Holowesko, director of research at Templeton International, is worried about the impact of declines in the Japanese real estate market. 'The Japanese real estate market was the biggest financial bubble in the history of the world. At its peak, the market was probably valued at between Dollars 16 trillion and Dollars 18 trillion. If it falls in half, that's a loss of Dollars 8 trillion to Dollars 9 trillion, more than the value of every stock market in the world.' Generally, however, Templeton has a stock-picking investment approach and Holowesko says: 'We have an over-exposure to the capital goods sector rather than consumer stocks. The consumer is not in good shape round the world but the capital goods sector should benefit from massive infrastructure spending, particularly in Asia. We particularly like US capital goods stocks because American capital goods companies still dominate worldwide markets and currently have the benefit of a low cost of capital.' Indeed, Templeton does not see the US market as overvalued. 'Price-earnings ratios may look high but earnings have been distorted by huge write-offs. On more normal earnings numbers, the price-earnings ratio is around 15 to 16, which is not cheap but is not too expensive either.' Holowesko says Templeton has been increasing its exposure to the UK market. 'Most UK investors take too short term a view of British companies', he says, focusing on the ability to pay dividends and neglecting the long term potential. Nick Knight of Nomura thinks that the Japanese market can establish its floor at around 15,000 on the Nikkei index. 'The market is beginning to throw up value and the Bank of Japan and other authorities will start to move heaven and earth to support the economy', he says. 'Clearly the US market has done better than most people's expectations, having withstood the collapse of the Japanese equity market. The problem is how it can move higher, and there is significant downside risk. An economic recovery would vindicate investors' earnings expectations but force the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates to appease the bond market; the alternative is that the US slips back into recession, which ruins earnings forecasts.' In the UK, Knight says the problem has been sterling's position within the Exchange Rate Mechanism, which has caused the corporate sector considerable headaches. He fears that interest rates may rise. As for Europe, Knight feels it is 'boring at best. The only hope is a bounceback from oversold positions while we are being strangled by tight German monetary policy.' Ken Inglis, head of investment at Allied Dunbar, also has worries about Japan. 'Japanese banks will need a lot of trading out of their current difficulties. There is a concern that they will repatriate foreign assets and one wouldn't want to be long of US treasury bonds if that happened.' On Japanese equities, he sees no early signs of relief, believing that any rally in prices will bring forth plenty of sellers. In Europe, share prices are 'hostage to the tensions between Frankfurt and Bonn' as the Bundesbank cracks down on inflation. Inglis says there is a need to watch the difference between the Bundesbank's rhetoric and its actions. Paul Manduca, chairman of fund management group Touche Remnant is more optimistic. 'In general, we think there is considerable value in world share prices. We don't think there is a chance of a global meltdown. That only happens when people get over-enthusiastic and become overstretched. 'Our only caveat is about the US, where we think share prices are tending to be overvalued, although that position could continue for some time. The UK market obviously needs the sniff of an interest rate cut to get it moving. But eventually traders will start looking at next year when German interest rates are going to come down.'</p>

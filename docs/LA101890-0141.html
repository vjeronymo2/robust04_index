			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REFILLING HANSEN DAM LAKE GETS FLOOD OF SUPPORT;  </P> <P> RECREATION: THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS HOPES TO RETURN THE AREA TO WHAT IT WAS  BEFORE THE LATE 1970S -- ONE OF LOS ANGELES' LARGEST PARKS.  </P> <P> The waters of Holiday Lake at Hansen Dam Recreation Area were once so inviting  that Teddy Treadwell and her family bought a boat, took up fishing and even  moved to the east San Fernando Valley to be near their favorite park.  </P> <P> But their lakeside lifestyle was ruined in the late 1970s when the 140-acre  lake, the centerpiece of a thriving regional park, was choked by years of silt  accumulation and neglect, reducing it to a muddy pond. When the water vanished,  so did the throngs of visitors and the park degenerated into a homeless  encampment. This week, however, East Valley residents expressed hope that the  park can stage a comeback, voicing overwhelming support for a plan by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers to build lakes and undertake a sweeping revitalization  that would transform the area back into one of the largest parks in the city of  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Along with a 10-acre lake that would be used exclusively for swimming, the plan  calls for renovation of the sprawling 1,400-acre Lake View Terrace site with  hiking and horseback riding trails, a wildlife preserve, playing fields and the  eventual development of two 15- and 70-acre lakes connected by a stream.  </P> <P> "We've been waiting for this park and lake to come back for years. It's been  the most important issue for many of us up here," said Treadwell, 65, of Shadow  Hills. "We are thrilled to get anything at this point. It was devastating for  us when the lake was shut down."  </P> <P> After years of clamoring from East Valley residents, who viewed the loss of the  popular recreation site as a slap to the community, Rep. Howard Berman  (D-Panorama City) pressured the Army two years ago to draft a long-term plan to  revitalize the area.  </P> <P> In the meantime, about $875,000 in state and federal money has been set aside  to build the swimming lake, scheduled for completion in early 1993.  </P> <P> Also, in Los Angeles County, Proposition B, a $816-million park bond measure,  would allocate $15 million specifically for Hansen Dam renovation if voters  approve the measure.  </P> <P> Park proponents are also praying for rain.  </P> <P> "If the drought continues, we have no idea where we will get the water to fill  the lake," said Frank Catania, director of planning and development for the  city Recreation and Parks Department. "We are hoping for a big rain in the next  three years."  </P> <P> Although the Army owns the site, built in the 1940s to control rain runoff and  collect silt washed down from the San Gabriel Mountains, it leases the land to  the city parks department.  </P> <P> Jackie Tatum, assistant general manager of the parks department, said the city  is committed to maintaining the renovated park, which would be built in phases  depending on the availability of local, state and federal money.  </P> <P> The Board of Recreation and Park Commissions and the Army are expected to  complete and approve the Hansen Dam Master Plan within three months.  </P> <P> To prevent the devastating silt buildup that choked the lake a decade ago,  officials plan to relocate the new lake on higher ground and run a contract  with a private company to continuously dredge the area.  </P> <P> A series of brush fires and winter storms in the late 1970s clogged the lake  with millions of tons of sand and debris. Dredging operators were brought in  too late to save it. In 1982, all that remained of Holiday Lake was a swampy  puddle. A protracted legal dispute between the Army and dredging operators  prevented plans for restoration of the lake until recently.  </P> <P> With the promised resurgence of the lake, residents hope the park will attract  thousands of families again and represent a renaissance in the East Valley,  which has been troubled by growing crime and gang problems.  </P> <P> "I think it's about time we start investing in this community," said Napoleon  O'Neal, 74, who has lived in Pacoima for 40 years. "We don't have anything up  here for all the new people that are moving in. We need that lake so the new  kids can swim and fish like mine used to."  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Widen the net Sir, Few would argue with Mr Martyn Jones's case (Letters, February 14) for increasing the penalties faced by fraudsters who attempt to deceive auditors. However, it is not unknown in the history of financial scandals for auditors themselves to turn a blind eye to fraud by company directors, from whom they often show insufficient independence. Perhaps proposed criminal penalties should also apply to auditors who knowingly conceal fraudulent transactions. Nigel Wilkins, 8 Petersham House, Harrington Road, London SW7 3HD</p>

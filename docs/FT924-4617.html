			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (15): Promoting the message GREAT CAMPAIGNS IN ACTION by Alan Toop Kogan Page, Pounds 28, 208 pages WHAT MAKES more and more blue chip companies spend a growing proportion of their marketing budgets on sales promotion? When Heinz runs a scheme offering customers prizes of 100 cars and Nescafe in France offers free sample sachets of a new coffee to 10m households (achieving an impressive 7. per cent acceptance rate) and even Sainsburys takes part in BA's Air Miles bonanza, sales promotion has become serious business. Indeed, a good deal of the creative excitement which used to be associated with advertising has switched to sales promotion, which makes it surprising that literature and case material on the subject are still scarce. Twenty-five years ago, as Alan Toop, one of the few serious commentators, points out in this authoritative study: 'Most sales promotions were in support of fast moving consumer goods: toiletries, soaps, detergents, packaged goods, petrol and oil, beers, wines and spirits and tobacco . . . Today the list includes cars, household appliances, furniture and furnishings, clothing, airlines, railways, hotels, even banking and insurance.' More multinationals are running promotions in individual European markets. Can it be long before pan-European promotional campaigns make their mark? This is one of the issues Toop examines with insight. At the same time his selection and dissection of campaigns in action shows how many leading companies selling across national frontiers increasingly use sales promotion as part of their marketing mix. What determines the use of these techniques, often to complement rather than replace media advertising? The short answer is sampling in the case of a new brand, or to stimulate repeat purchasing or strengthen retail distribution and display. Sales promotion techniques are claimed in some cases to cost less than other marketing tools, hence a large switch of expenditure towards promotion over the years. Opportunities resulting from the growth of mass retailing in Europe and pressures for short-term results are also contributing to the demand for quick sales boosts. The likely benefits of a well-planned promotion can be seen from one of the many European case studies discussed by Toop. In Germany, Goodyear has a chain of tyre and car service centres, but more motorists needed to be induced to try the service. A 'Goodyear is looking for Winners' promotion increased turnover in participating outlets by an average of some 25 per cent during the promotion; the winning centre recruited 457 new clients; and awareness of the service rose from 12.5 per cent to 30.5 per cent. We are not told the cost of the promotion, but the results here, as for many of the campaigns described, indicate why companies such as Unilever, Coca-Cola, Range Rover and many others now use these techniques.</p>

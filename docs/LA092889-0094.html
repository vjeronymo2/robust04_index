			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATION CLOSURES, UNDERSTAFFING CRITICIZED;  </P> <P> OXNARD FIREFIGHTERS WARN OF PERIL  </P> <P> Oxnard firefighters, pointing to occasional closures of fire stations over the  summer, warned the City Council that cutting services to save money had  endangered citizens.  </P> <P> They also criticized Tuesday the city's failure to meet their labor contract  demands. The 87 members of the firefighters union have worked without a  contract for about three months.  </P> <P> "We're doing a dangerous job understaffed in the best conditions," said Robert  Thorp, an Oxnard firefighter for seven years. "It's a matter of priorities and  we feel the priorities should lie in public safety."  </P> <P> The council adopted a 1989-90 budget in June that included service level  reductions totaling $1.9 million. As part of the cutbacks, vacancies in the  fire stations and other city offices are not immediately filled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Manpower Shortages  </P> <P> Since July 1, there have been 48 days when manpower shortages took one squad  out of commission, 16 days when two squads were unavailable, and 14 days when  two squads and a station were closed, Firefighter Tom Sugawara said.  </P> <P> Such a closure may increase response time by up to five minutes, time that is  crucial in emergencies, Sugawara said.  </P> <P> However, the council has no choice, said Councilwoman Ann Johs. The council  disclosed last week that estimated 1988-89 revenues are about $1.7 million less  than expected. At the same time, expenditures are about $850,000 more than  anticipated.  </P> <P> "I feel bad in this decline of revenues that we can't give them the raise they  want, much less the staffing," Johs said.  </P> <P> Firefighters said they were angry over stalled contract negotiations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Haggling Over Details  </P> <P> Firefighters and the city are haggling over small details, said union attorney  Stephen H. Silver.  </P> <P> The city has offered to increase salaries by 3% in November and an additional  2.5% in April. The union wants a 6% increase in January. The difference in city  expenditures, Silver said, amounts to about $5,000.  </P> <P> More than 25 union members protested Saturday at a dedication ceremony for  Oxnard State Beach Park.  </P> <P> Almost 30 showed up at the City Council meeting, waving signs that said:  "Oxnard's Budget Balancing Means Fire Station Closures" and "Do You Really  Care?"  </P> <P> Silver said the next step is to go door-to-door in Oxnard, passing out leaflets  to make citizens aware of the issue.  </P> <P> At present, he said, there are no plans for a walkout.  </P></p>

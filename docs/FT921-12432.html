			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Sea Containers called on to 'stop dithering' WITH THE passing of the three-month standstill agreement between Sea Containers and The Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, Mr Norman Corlett, chairman of the latter company, has written to shareholders, exhorting Sea Containers 'to stop dithering and make clear its position'. He said that it was now some 19 months since SeaCon, the cargo equipment and ferry company which currently owns 41 per cent of Steam Packet, first launched its bid. He added that there had been only limited progress on the extension of trading links and that neither party considered there was a 'reasonable prospect of reaching agreement on the major issues in the foreseeable future'. Mr Corlett called on SeaCon to make a bid which reflected fully the value of Steam Packet. In 1990 it offered 115p per share compared with last Friday's close of 200p.</p>

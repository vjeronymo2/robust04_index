			<p>BFN     [Text] The Israeli delegation to the talks with the  Palestinians has arrived in Cairo. The delegation is composed  of Major General 'Uzi Dayan, Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami',  Brig. Gen. Tzvi Stauber, and the Foreign Ministry's legal  adviser Yo'el Singer.    Military sources told our correspondent Karmela Menashe that  the major obstacles in the discussions with the Palestinians  have been removed and Israel can now meet the original timetable.    Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, one of the Fatah leaders in the Gaza  Strip, told Qol Yisra'el this morning that the violent incidents  in the Gaza Strip were unconnected to the progress made in the  peace negotiations. In his opinion, once the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] withdraws and the Palestinian police force  assumes responsibility for maintaining public order, the police  will impose their authority on the entire Palestinian  population, including the members of Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement].</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Entertainment yet to emulate Christmas puddings: Emma Tucker on which items are bucking the deflationary trend THE recent wave of price cuts initiated by Britain's biggest and boldest retailers is good news for consumers whose pay packages have grown only slightly since last year. But although a Christmas pudding at Gateway is a third cheaper than a week ago, not all of the things consumers buy are bowing to the economy's deflationary pressures. Anyone who recently had their legs waxed, or ate in a restaurant, will testify to that. In the year to September, prices of restaurant meals rose by 5 per cent, considerably faster than the actual inflation rate of 1.8 per cent. Personal services - hairdressing, beauty treatments, medical, dental and nursing fees  -were also 5 per cent dearer in September than they were a year ago. Apart from one or two quirks - egg prices rose by 16 per cent in the year to September - the most intransigent prices are in the services sector. Inflation for entertainment and other recreation, for example, was 7 per cent in the year to September, while motoring expenditure prices rose 6.1 per cent over the same period. This compares with impressive performances in the traded goods sector where low increases have encouraged fairly buoyant sales. The good news is that inflation in the services sector is likely to fall into line with traded goods inflation during the year ahead. Indeed, the latest data indicates that this is already happening. Mr Ian Shepherdson, economist at Midland Global Markets, argues that providers of services have realised that by raising their prices they are 'missing out' on the recovery. Only by adopting the price-cutting tactics of their retailing counterparts will they be able to boost business. Leisure services inflation has dropped from 4 per cent in the spring to 3.3 per cent in September, while inflation for personal goods and services is gradually coming down. This trend should be assisted by the continued downward pressure on labour market costs, which in turn squeezes personal incomes and encourages consumers to be ever more discerning about how much they are prepared to pay for things. 'The search for good value will become ever more intense and widespread,' says Mr Shepherdson. But even if service-sector inflation drops into line with traded goods, there will still be areas that do not succumb to the deflationary momentum. The government itself will be putting upwards pressure on prices when it imposes value added tax on domestic fuel next April. Its decision to restrict tax relief on mortgage interest will also inflate the retail prices index as will other government-influenced price rises, such as excise duties on alcohol and cigarettes, postal services and utilities. So in a year from now, barring external shocks, washing-up liquid should cost little more than now, a dental check-up should be roughly the same price, but fuel bills, petrol, cigarettes and whisky will resolutely defy the trend.</p>

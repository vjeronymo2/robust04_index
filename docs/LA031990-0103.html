BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GERBER UNIT TO CONSOLIDATE  </P> <P> Gerber Products Co. announced today that it will establish an after-tax reserve  of $8.3 million, or 22 cents a share, to consolidate its Gerber Childrenswear  business.  </P> <P> The consolidation will involve eliminating certain non-strategic product lines  and reducing excess manufacturing capacity, said Al Piergallini, Gerber's  chairman, president and chief executive officer.  </P> <P> "When the restructuring of the Gerber Childrenswear segment is complete, we  will have a company with lower sales but one that is significantly more capable  of contributing to shareholder value through better operating results in both  the short and long term," he said.  </P></p>

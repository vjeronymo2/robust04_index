			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> 2 MEN ACCUSED OF CAR-BUYING SCAM  </P> <P> Two people have been arrested on suspicion of buying as many as 15 cars using  other people's financial information, police said Monday.  </P> <P> Raymond Marmolejo, 35, of Fontana and Lance Rodney Oldenberg, 51, of Upland  were arrested last week by Buena Park police.  </P> <P> Oldenberg worked for a company known both as Inland Financial and Fleetwood  Financial in Upland, which offered to fix bad credit histories for a fee,  police said. Instead, the two men allegedly used information gathered to buy  cars without the clients' knowledge.  </P> <P> When payments were not made on a car bought at Campbell Nissan in Buena Park,  the bank contacted the supposed buyer and got the response, "What car?" Police  Sgt. Terry Branum said. Eleven other cars similarly purchased, Branum said,  came from dealers in Buena Park, six from Campbell Nissan. The remaining four  came from dealers in Hollywood and West Covina. Most were Mercedes-Benzes and  BMWs, and each cost more than than $40,000.  </P> <P> Marmolejo and Oldenberg were both charged with suspicion of conspiracy, grand  theft and obtaining property based on fictitious credit applications, Branum  said. Two other people are still wanted in connection with the case, police  said. Police have not recovered any of the cars.LYNDA NATALI  </P></p>

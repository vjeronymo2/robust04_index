			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Maltsev: "Criminal Millions"] </F>   [Text] One scandal follows another: Corporations and  consortiums collect a bit of money from trusting citizens, and  later disappear into thin air along with large sums of money.  The citizens moan and groan and...once again take their money to  the next "benefactor."    Three major swindles burst forth almost simultaneously: two  in Moscow and one in Novosibirsk. Muscovites "were made happy"  by the Independent Oil Concern, which collected 260 billion in  three months of existence, and by the investment fund  Oil-Diamonds-Invest, whose business was also not  inconsequential. But if the words "oil," "diamond,"  "investment," and so forth, sound magical to the capital's  investors, it seems it was even easier to deceive residents of  Novosibirsk.    A certain joint-stock company of the closed  type--Fineko--which allegedly was a branch of the Irkutsk Credit  Industrial Bank, simply announced in a TV commercial that it was  beginning to pay b-i-g interest rates for money it collected,  specifically, 30 percent per month. The minimum payment, of  course, had to be not less than a million. But, as can be seen,  the matter did not stop here: In one week, 150 million was  collected. Were it not for the vigilance of the law enforcement  organs, the volume of the swindle would be no less than the  capital "oil swindle."    Absolutely all Fineko's documents were fakes, including the  license granting the right to financial operations.    The victims of the fraud were mainly people of pension age.    The victims of the Moscow swindle in those days even came to  a rally demanding protection from the authorities.    This is a very difficult task, given the current legislative  base and the unstable economic situation. It is precisely for  this reason that people fall for the bait, inasmuch as they want  to guard their money against inflation. After all, each time  they were induced by promises of high interest.    "Such promises in fact do not always reflect a capability to  fulfill them, but rather they are a signal for the law  enforcement organs to be interested in how legal the activities  of the `enrichers' is," Viktor Sushentsev, deputy chief of the  West Siberian Regional Administration in the Fight against  Organized Crime, to whom the editorial office turned for  information on this matter, commented about the Fineko swindle.    This time, intuition did not let our protectors down,  otherwise many more people would have been deceived. Still, what  is to be done, if you want to guard against similar unpleasant  occurrences?    The most general advice is provided by an historical example  of a highly inflationary period in Italy. People were simply not  saving at all. It is said that at that time stores and  restaurants there were filled: The Italians were attempting to  get rid of money on their own pleasures, since it was no longer  possible to accumulate it.    The second piece of advice: Before turning over your money  it  is necessary to convince yourself that the receiving side has  the right to engage in investment operations.    Nikolay Beloslyudtsev, deputy chief of the main  administration of the Central Bank for Novosibirsk Oblast, said  that such a right is granted by a license to conduct banking  operations.    What is to be done if the license is forged, what does a  genuine one look like, and what if the ordinary investor does  not know?    The main administrations of the Central Bank of the Russian  Federation in the territories has all of the information on the  issuance of licenses. If the clients of Fineko had inquired at  the main administration concerning the Irkutsk Credit Industrial  Bank, it is very likely they would have been able to ascertain  that such a bank did not exist at all.    One should not take extreme positions and think that  everyone  who does not have a banking license but who works with money  received from the population is an outright swindler. Of course  not. But in any case it is necessary to be concerned about  guarantees for your money and get the maximum information about  those firms with which you intend to do business.    A banking license, of course, is the reliable guarantee  here,  inasmuch as its owner is obligated to form insurance funds in  the event of its ruin, so that investors do not suffer at the  same time. It is mainly banks that possess such licenses. Among  nonbank structures there are not many as such, and almost all of  them are located in Moscow.    A law on advertising could be a distinctive protective  mechanism. If the advertiser bore legislative responsibility for  texts published in the press and broadcast on radio and TV, then  probably it would be possible to institute proceedings  immediately, without waiting for a scandal. After all, it is  clear to every reasonable person: A yeast fungus has not been  invented yet for cultivating money. And the capabilities of  known catalyzers of this process are very limited.</p>

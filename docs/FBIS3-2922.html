			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Feature" by XINHUA reporters He Ping (0149 1627), </F> Ma Kuijun (7456 7608 0689), and Yu Shaoliang (0060 4801 5328):  "The Premier's Important Requests"]    [Text] Beijing, 13 Mar (XINHUA) -- The issues about  enriching the "food baskets" of urban and rural residents,  diverting water to the north, transporting west China's coal to  the east, settling debts between enterprises, and stabilizing  cotton output became the topics of discussion among Hebei  delegation's deputies attending the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress [NPC]. While joining the deputies'  discussion and listening to their views, Premier Li Peng also  chipped in and discussed with the deputies ways and means to  expedite reform and development.    In light of Hebei's actual situation, Provincial Governor Ye  Liansong said: "Commodity prices, especially prices of goods  closely related to people's livelihood, have a direct bearing on  social stability."    Li Peng supported his view, saying: "There are 23 kinds of  goods which are closely related to people's livelihood,  including the essential ones in their `food baskets.' In recent  years Hebei has been attaching great importance to the `food  basket' project and has done a fairly good job in promoting  direct trade between consumers and producers. I hope you will  sum up your experiences so that you can continue to improve your  work."    Cattle raising has been developing quite rapidly in Hebei.  Deputy Li Bingliang, deputy secretary of the Hebei Provincial  Party Committee, especially mentioned Li Fucheng, a major  cattleman in Sanhe County. Li Peng said: "I have visited his  cattle farm. I even met him when he made a special trip to  Beijing during the Spring Festival this year!"    Li Bingliang said: The size of Li Fucheng's cattle  production has been expanding ever since his cattle raising  business was semimechanized. His cattle inventory last year  exceeded 4,700 head; and he made a net profit of 6 million yuan  from the $5 million foreign exchange he created by selling 1,700  head of cattle.    Li was pleased with the report, saying: "Cattle raising is  profitable in many ways. Cattle bred for meat yield high  economic returns. In addition to meat, cow hide and bone can be  extensively processed into useful products. Cattle eat straw  and their droppings are good manure for soil improvement and can  also be used for producing marsh gas. Hebei has advantage in  this regard in many ways, and I hope that this project will  continue to be a success."    Deputy Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party  committee of Hebei, a major cotton producing region in the  country, said that low state-set prices for cotton and drought  are major problems hindering Hebei's cotton output. Li Peng  asked: "Are there any cotton plant comrades here? How much do  you pay for one dan [50 kg] of cotton?" Deputy Zhang Fenge, a  worker of the No. 1 Handan State-Operated Cotton Yarn Plant,  stood up and gave Li Peng an answer.    Li Peng said: "I mentioned in the government work report  that  the state will pay a higher price for cotton, but the textile  industry may not be able to tolerate if the price is raised  excessively. And so I think this problem can only be resolved  step by step along with the establishment of the socialist  market economic system and price restructuring. As for the  impact from drought, can we solve the problem by developing  water conservation measures, such as sprinkling irrigation, as  well as by improving cotton strains to make them more drought  resistant?"    When Deputy Liu Hanzhang, director of the Handan Iron and  Steel Works, took the floor, Li Peng asked him with concern: "I  visited your plant in 1988. Has its annual output reached 1  million tonnes yet?" After he received a positive answer, Li  Peng said: When I visited your plant, your annual output was  only 800,000 tonnes or so. Then Li Peng asked Liu about his  plant's production situation as well as the way it obtained its  coal, iron, and other raw materials and the types of products it  produces and their quality. Li Peng specially empasized the  importance of high technology, saying that high technology not  only can yield higher returns, but also can conserve large  amounts of energy.    Li Peng asked Deputy Xu Ji, director of the Kailuan Mining  Bureau: "Have you solved your water problems? How is  production? Have you totally removed price control? What is  the all-personnel labor productivity?" Xu Qi answered all the  questions, feeling very excited that Premier Li Peng was so  familiar with the situation in Kailuan and other areas in Hebei.  He also factually reflected the bureau's problems but pledged  to live up to the premier's expectations.    Li Peng said: Hebei has fairly good natural conditions and  fine revolutionary traditions, and it has made fairly fast  progress in its development since adoption of the reform and  opening up policy. This shows that as long as leading cores at  various levels are united, work with one heart and one mind, and  deal with common problems with concerted efforts, they can  expedite economic construction and make new progress in both  material and spiritual construction under the guidance of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    On improving state-operated enterprises, Li Peng stressed  that leading authorities at all levels should place this project  high on the agendas, take effective measures to create an  environment favorable for business, and help enterprises solve  their problems through upgrading their technology and  management. He said enterprises should give full scope to their  initiatives by taking advantage of the opportunities created by  various reform measures.    Li Peng said: As a major agricultural province, Hebei should  pay special attention to developing water-efficient agriculture  and scientific farming, and diversify operations on the basis of  stabilizing grain and cotton production.    As soon as the premier finished saying "I wish Hebei greater  success and faster progress every year!" the hall reverberated  with applause and laughter.</p>

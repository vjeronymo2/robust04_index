			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Next year, the Agency of Industrial Science and  Technology will introduce a new financing system in order to  further research exchange with private companies in broad areas  of research beginning with advanced science and technology  research. For private research organizations planning the  preparation for research exchange facilities and equipment,  50%  of the financing can be financed partially with facilities  financing from the Japan Development Bank. With the idea that  the object of financing in the first year will be the areas of  global environment, new materials, electronics, the estimated  requirements for the 1994 budget includes a total of &yen;10  billion.    Regions to be the object of financing are research exchange  facilities coupling the research institute with facilities for  inviting researchers, research information exchange facilities,  and general open facilities (halls, observation facilities,  seminar and workshop rooms). For example, when a private company  builds facilities on the scale of &yen;1 billion, 50% of  that,  &yen;500 million, will be low interest financing through the  Japan Development Bank. Also the conditions of financing are set  on a commercial basis.    According to AIST, semiconductors, life sciences, global  environment, electronics, new materials, and comfortable  environment are areas planned to be the object of financing.  Definitely, research exchange facilities concerning  CO[.sup]2[/] fixation technology which is one policy for the  prevention of global warming, technology for the improvement of  fine ceramics, and the residential environment are in the  policies.    The importance of the promotion of research exchange is  increasing with the start of planning for the ``Intellectual  Contact International Plaza'' supporting advanced research  exchange and the expansion of research and exchange affairs due  to the partial revision of the New Technology Enterprise Act.  This financing system aims for private energy being given to  places for such research exchange.</p>

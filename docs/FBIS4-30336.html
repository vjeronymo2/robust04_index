			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 25 KYODO -- Japanese business leaders  Saturday welcomed prime minister Tsutomu Hata's decision to  disband his two-month-old cabinet en masse in an effort to avoid  a political vacuum which would have occurred in the event of a  general election.    "That was the best decision that Mr. Hata could make" just  half an hour before the House of Representatives was to have  voted on a no-confidence motion against his cabinet, said  Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the powerful Federation of  Economic Organizations (Keidanren).    Citing many difficult problems facing Japan ahead of the  July  8-10 summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in  Naples, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) said, "The Diet should elect  a new prime minister to carry forward upcoming political reform  policies without taking any retracting steps."    "A general election would create a political vacuum for  almost one month. That would be a worst scenario for Japan,  which is only just beginning to see some signs of economic  recovery," Hiroshi Saito, chairman of Nippon Steel Corp., said,  expressing his relief.    Kosaku Inaba, chief of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, another influential business group, said, "A new  government is required to make utmost efforts to salvage the  ailing economy and promote administrative and tax reforms."    But Makoto Murata, head of the Japan Petrochemical Industry  Association, voiced his perplexity over the ongoing political  uncertainty, which he said would have adverse effects on  currency and stock markets and on business activities.</p>

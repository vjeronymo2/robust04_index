			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / City foresees life ban on Levitt Speculation is mounting in the City that Mr Roger Levitt, chairman of the collapsed Levitt Group, will be the first individual banned for life from the investment business. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has the power under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act to ban individuals who it considers have damaged investors' interests severely, but it has never used those powers. The chairman of one self-regulating organisation said yesterday: 'Mr Levitt is a classic example of where Section 59 ought to apply.' SIB declined yesterday to say whether it intended to apply Section 59 in the Levitt case. The use of Section 59 in the Levitt case would meet concern in the financial services sector that the light sentence given to Mr Levitt has undermined the regulators' position and that a sterner deterrent to such conduct is needed. Leading City figures have expressed frustration at the sentencing of Mr Levitt to 180 hours of community service for misleading regulators about his company's health. The company later collapsed with debts of Pounds 34m, causing millions of pounds of losses to individual investors. The Investors Compensation Scheme, funded by a levy on the industry, paid out Pounds 616,000 to 25 investors, most of whom lost far more than the Pounds 47,000 ceiling on claims. Mr Joel Joffe, former deputy chairman of life insurer Allied Dunbar, said the sentence given to Mr Levitt would 'do great harm to the regulatory system'. Mr Garry Heath, the chief executive of the National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers, said the regulator had acted properly. He said: 'The judge has let us down.' Fimbra, the self-regulating organisation for financial advisers, yesterday said it could only re-emphasise that it was disappointed that the tough action by the regulators had not been mirrored by the sentence. 'On the positive side, Mr Levitt's company was stopped from trading three years ago by Fimbra, which shows the need for effective regulation to be there to stop those unfit to do business. In this and many other cases, we can stop them for good.' Letters, Page 18</p>

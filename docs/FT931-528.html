			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Hopes rise for debt relief accords: IADB annual meeting optimistic of more agreements by end of year MOST of the countries in Latin America without debt relief accords with creditor banks could secure agreements by the end of the year, according to bankers at the InterAmerican Development Bank annual meeting in Hamburg. They say significant progress has been made in recent talks with a number of Latin American governments. 'This should be a year where we can finalise Argentina and Brazil and get agreements in principle hopefully with Ecuador, Peru and Panama,' said Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, a leading Latin American creditor. His statement reflects a growing sense of progress at the meeting and, if correct, means only the Dominican Republic is left among significant bank debtors without some agreement this year. Other developments are: Argentina is set to finalise its deal on April 7, a year after it signed an agreement in principle. A more favourable mix than expected of choices by banks from the six options negotiated under Brazil's debt reduction agreement. Furthermore, the amount of debt covered by the agreement is some Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn less than the Dollars 40bn (Pounds 28.1bn) expected, making a finalisation of the agreement an easier prospect. Banks are shuffling their options, however, as they have chosen too high a proportion (63.1 per cent) of relatively expensive 'par' bonds for the government's liking. The Ecuadorean government and banks made 'some progress' in a meeting on Sunday, but an important obstacle is the lack of any interest payment since July. The two sides meet on April 6 in New York. Panama and its banks, led now by Citibank, are to begin talks on Dollars 1.9bn of principal and Dollars 1.1bn on back interest, unpaid since December 1987. Peru and its bank creditors are set to meet in May. Bilateral meetings between Mr Jorge Camet, finance minister, and bank lenders have taken place in Hamburg. Bolivia is set to sign today an agreement covering the buyback for cash of 94 per cent of its remaining bank debt.</p>

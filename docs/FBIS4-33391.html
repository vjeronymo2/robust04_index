			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] The Herraraist faction of the National Party has  questioned the legitimacy of the Sanguinetti administration,  which was placed in power through the 1984 elections. In a  document evaluating the current administration's actions in  government, the Herreraist faction characterizes this  administration "as the first elected without restrictions" since  the military regime.    The document points out the main achievements of the  administration headed by Luis Alberto Lacalle, emphasizing the  "transformations and changes in concepts, the economic and  social achievements, and the most incomparable and far-reaching  social work of the past few decades." The document also states  that "we want neither an all-encompassing nor an absentee  government."    The report, distributed among Herreraist constituents,  describes the government as having "concluded the transition  period that began with the 1984 elections, which were carried  out with exclusions (...) The Herreraist government was the  first to be elected without restrictions following the de facto  regimes."    The document mentions the attitude of current administration  employees, especially their "firm, prudent, and clear conduct in  attaining national goals, without demagoguery or a desire for  political gain; their respect for the law and the Constitution;  and their search for a consensus in resolving state problems in  the most important areas of national life."    The document mentions the basic actions of government. It  mentions the following economic achievements: "balanced public  finances; clear and reliable exchange and monetary policies;  inflation is being fought against; public and private financial  institutions are operating within the rules and controls that  generate trust in the financial system; tax evasion and  organized smuggling are being decidedly engaged; and the  encouragement of productive retooling, which is being promoted  by private initiative."    In the area of labor relations, the document points out that  "management and workers negotiate collective agreements without  the state's participation. Nevertheless, the state has greatly  supported collective bargaining. The concept of productivity has  been incorporated into labor relations, giving rise to new forms  of relationships between companies and their employees. Private  and government-owned enterprises work out far-reaching  collective agreements that ensure peaceful labor relations. The  official banking sector programmed and enforced the equalization  of salaries with the private sector."    With regard to agriculture, the report underlines the  reduction of tariffs on the importation of capital goods, the  elimination of the tax on the National Silo Fund, (and) the  reduction of the Imesi [specific domestic tax] levied on the  sale of diesel oil, which has led to a drop in the price of this  type of fuel."    The document moreover counts "the eradication of  foot-and-mouth disease" and "the strengthening of agricultural  research" as achievements.    It also underscores the attainments in the area of tourism,  noting that "the objectives that were established have been  greatly surpassed, as our 1995 goal of 2 million visitors was  met in 1993. It is estimated that Uruguay will meet the target  of 3 million tourists per year by the year 2000."    The tract enumerates the laws proposed by the government  which it labels "revolutionary laws."    It mentions the process of the so-called "law on  government-owned enterprises," including its "partial"  abolishment following the plebiscite held on 13 December 1992.    The document contends that pursuant to the provisions of  this  law that remain in effect, the executive branch "liquidated ILPE  [State Seal and Fishing Industry], and implemented the necessary  mechanisms to allow private capital to buy a share in Pluna  [Uruguayan National Airlines]."    It then mentions such achievements as the reform of the port  administration system, the end of the insurance monopoly, and  the elimination of red tape through the National  Debureaucratization Program (Pronade)."    The document highlights the work done in the area of  housing.  The Uruguayan Mortgage Bank constructed 10,057 homes between  1990 and 1993, and granted 7,280 personal loans.</p>

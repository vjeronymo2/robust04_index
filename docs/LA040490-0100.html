			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCREEN STYLE: A HAIR AFFAIR  </P> <P> THE MOVIE: "House Party"  </P> <P> THE LOOK: Bright, bouncy and decidedly youthful. Hip Hop rapper duo Kid 'N Play  (Kid -- Christoper Reid -- and Play -- Christoper Martin) get busy in this  kinetic teen-buddy comedy shot for chump change.  </P> <P> THE STAR VEHICLE: The filmmakers spent their meager money wisely, and in the  process have introduced a new star: Kid's towering head of hair -- a  fez-shaped, totally tubular creation with shaved sides. The exceptional do was  maintained through the movie by stylist Byron Ellison.  </P> <P> THE PLAN: Centerpiece of this raucous and soulful flick is the party referred  to in the title. Play (of Kid 'N Play) has his crib all to himself when the  folks foolishly leave town. Play intends to play indeed so he arranges the  party of the year. Kid, along with his hair, has been grounded by Pop for the  evening but he slinks out later to make the scene. The party is big and the  beats blare. The outfits are even louder.  </P> <P> THE STYLE: Rookie director Reginald Hudlin instructed the film's costumer,  Harold Evans, to give him a "comic book" look. "We used as much color as we  could and spread it around," explained Evans. Red. Lime. Purple. The party  would look brightly lit even in a blackout -- gold chains, earrings and knuckle  strips abound. The gyrating throngs are nattily clad, Play wears a beige suit  with a turquoise collar, Sharane (A. J. Johnson) is attired in a tight yellow  thigh-length outfit topped with a small red jacket. To start his big day, Kid  wakes up in bright white pj's with a multicolored geometric print.  </P> <P> THE STORES: Evans created some of the outfits himself and procured the rest at  the Beverly Center and local department stores Bullock's and Nordstrom.  </P> <P> THE LABELS: "We tried to keep him colorful," says Evans. The young man's shirt  was iridescent gray silk and emanated tones of reds and blues. Was it a name  brand? "It wasn't that type of show," laughs Evans, whose wardrobe budget could  fit into a thimble.  </P> <P> THE PAYOFF: A statement-making personal style doesn't necessarily mean an  expensive wardrobe. As in the case of "House Party" a terrific 'do will do.  DAVID PECCHIA  </P></p>

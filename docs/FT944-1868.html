			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): King coal's big test - Michael Smith analyses the prospects of RJB Mining Ever since coal powered the British industrial revolution last century, the sector and its workers have held a powerful grip on the public imagination. This was shown as recently as two years ago by the extraordinary outcry that greeted the government's plans to close 31 mines. But will the public now back its apparent fondness for the industry with hard cash? The question arises because RJB Mining has agreed to pay Pounds 815m for the English mining assets of British Coal and is inviting the public to take a stake. Institutions already have taken up 125m shares being issued to provide Pounds 400m of the money. But 15 per cent of these have been placed conditionally by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the bank advising RJB, so that private investors can have a chance to buy a slice of the industry. They are, however, getting a range of contradictory advice because of the controversy surrounding the bid. The main charge by RJB's critics is that it has over-estimated seriously the size of the market. Whereas RJB expects to be able to sell 34m tonnes a year late in the 1990s, some of its rivals say a figure in the mid-20s is optimistic. Nor do they share RJB's view of the prices it can get. Indeed, some City analysts believe RJB has got its figures so badly wrong that the company will be struggling to make any money at all by the year 2000. They also question whether RJB will, as it claims, be able by 1998 to pay off much, if not all, of the Pounds 494m it is borrowing to make up the total Pounds 894m that British Coal will cost. On top of all this, the company has no guarantee yet of contracts with the generators after 1998. If deals of the size and quality for which it hopes do not materialise, and there is a debt overhang, then RJB could end up in trouble. Chief executive Richard Budge says the company's estimates for future markets are, if anything, cautious. But he says that even targets were not met, the company could cut down in size without incurring great costs. 'We are much more flexible than people think,' he says. Budge is helped by the approach he has taken to cost-cutting. His business plan assumes he must reduce costs by only 3 per cent a year - and even his critics concede that is extremely conservative. But the bait for investors is the promise of substantial rewards if the company does manage to achieve its targets. If, as RJB says, the acquired business can make Pounds 120m pre-tax profit next year, then the new shares are, at 320p, being issued on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 6.5. The p/e is one of the main criteria by which shares are judged; the lower the ratio, the cheaper the share. The stock market average is about 12, allowing RJB to argue that its shares are cheap. The yield on this year's forecast dividend is about 4.9 per cent against a market average of 4.2 per cent. RJB, however, is promising strong dividend growth, particularly after the debt is paid off. If it makes its targeted pre-tax profit of Pounds 220m in 1999, it should be able to to fulfil its promise. For investors, putting money into coal is not the safe bet of, say, electricity. The power sector offers strong dividend growth, too - now more than 20 per cent a year. Thus, RJB investors must believe that it can offer an even higher growth than electricity, particularly after 1998. Institutional investors have been prepared to back Budge and there are bound to be private investors who will follow suit. They should consider the advice of an industry executive who knows Budge well and admires him. 'It's a bit like gambling on the 3.30 at Chepstow,' the executive says. 'My own hunch is that he will pull it off; that he will achieve the targets he has set. But I am not sure. He might end up flat on his face. 'I would certainly not be putting my mother's last money into it - but if I had some spare cash, I might risk it.' Investors have until 3pm on Tuesday to apply. An application form is available on page 3 of Weekend Money and in other newspapers.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Chief says BSkyB was near liquidation last year BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, came close to liquidation last year, it was revealed yesterday. Mr Frank Barlow, chairman of the consortium, said the trouble came less than five months after the merger of British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Television when Barclays Bank turned down an application for a Pounds 200m project loan. Mr Barlow is also group managing director of Pearson, which owns the Financial Times and has a significant stake in BSkyB. 'Technically we (BSkyB) were insolvent. If we went on trading without further financing we would have been trading while insolvent and I could have gone to jail,' Mr Barlow said yesterday at a London lunch. Mr Barlow immediately flew to Tucson, Arizona where Mr Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of The News Corporation was staying at a health farm. News Corp has a 50 per cent stake in BSkyB. Mr Barlow said that over dinner he explained that unless Mr Murdoch could invest Pounds 100m he would seek the protection of the courts and that would have led to liquidation with vast debts. 'Rupert was very sympathetic, although obviously he thought I was trying to pull some plot to reduce his stake.' The Pounds 200m was raised with Mr Murdoch putting up part of his Pounds 100m in value. Mr Barlow forecast that by mid-1993 the venture would make profits after financing charges.</p>

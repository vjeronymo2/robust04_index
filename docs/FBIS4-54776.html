			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- The Christian Democratic  People's Party (KDNP) is the only political force in Hungary  which relies on stable principles and is able to pursue a policy  which encompasses both commitment to a market economy and social  sensitivity, KDNP Chairman Laszlo Surjan said at a rally in  Budapest today, closing his party's electoral campaign.    After the parliamentary elections, Hungary should continue  to  press on down the path it has followed over the past four years,  Surjan said. Owing to its policy programme and team of experts,  the KDNP is capable of giving a positive boost to the current  government's work, he said, stressing that the present governing  coalition should be transformed and refreshed rather than  dismissed.    In Surjan's view, conservative Christian Democratic policy  should play a determining role even in the future, because  neither the liberal nor the socialist alternative can solve the  country's current problems.</p>

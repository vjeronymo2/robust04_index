			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part two" of the report by Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van </F> Khai at the opening of the Ninth National Assembly's Fifth  Session held at the Ba Dinh Conference Hall in Hanoi on 26 May  -- recorded]    [Text] With the results obtained in the implementation of  its tasks during the first months of the year, the government  has resolved to provide guidance for satisfactory implementation  of the resolution of the mid-term party conference and other  resolutions of the National Assembly's fourth session with the  aim of achieving at least an 8-percent increase in this year's  economic growth rate and creating potential for achieving a  long-lasting double-digit growth rate with high results, so as  to gradually narrow the gap in development compared with nearby  countries. Only by unfailingly overcoming the danger of being  left behind further economically can we achieve firm  sociopolitical stability, strengthen national security and  defense, and further develop our foreign relations on the basis  of independence and sovereignty.    In this spirit, I would like to further elaborate on some  major issues with which we are experiencing difficulties and on  which we must revamp our policies so as to satisfactorily  implement the tasks for 1994 and prepare for 1995:    1. Continue to ameloriate and stabilize the financial and  monetary market:    A. How to balance the budget?    The report of the Finance Ministry points out difficulties  encountered in balancing the budget. Compared with the figures  in the first four months of the year, the average monthly  figures achieved in the last six months of the year show that  our revenue and expenses increased 1.5 fold and 1.66 fold  respectively.    The fact that the National Assembly has ratified a request  to  increase revenue collection to meet our budget demands is a  guarantee for the implementation of socioeconomic and national  defense tasks and for helping contain inflation.    The conference held by the entire tax sector in mid-May  decided that we are capable of a 10-percent increase in tax  collection compared with the total tax and fee collection  budgeted for the first half of the year. If we take into  account the possibility of increasing tariff collection by the  customs sector, we may exceed the collection target by 15  percent. The feasibility of this target relies on our potential  for developing production and expanding commercial exchange,  along with efforts to enforce various tax laws and the  discipline on budget contributions. We must overcome the tax  collection shortfall, which is still great, in the state  business sector, in individual and private ventures, and in  those joint ventures with foreign countries. This shortfall  also results from a failure to turn in the tax money obtained  from home sales and land use. The enforcement of important laws  and regulations is the most important task in which  administrative and financial organs at various levels must  closely cooperate with various mass organizations, professional  associations, and the people in ensuring scrupulous and fair  enforcement.    We must exploit the potential for increased tax collection  in  the following directions:    -- The export-import tax is not only a huge source of  revenue  for our budget -- accounting for one-fourth of our total revenue  -- but also an important means of ensuring domestic production.  Along with readjusting the tax table for exports and imports in  accordance with the resolution adopted in late March by the  National Assembly Standing Committee, we must intensify our  anti-smuggling activities at various border gates and conduct  inspections to obtain delinquent taxes on those products which  have already been illicitly imported, especially those goods  that may diminish domestic production. This task must be  closely organized, directed, and undertaken with specific  targets. To implement it, we must have cooperation between  various sectors and we must win the sympathy and support of the  people.    -- The leasing of land or the transfer of the land-use right  and the use of state-owned houses for business purposes will not  only generate huge amounts of revenue but also ensure better  management and use of these properties. Although in practice  this task is very complex, the more we procrastinate or adopt a  wait-and-see attitude, the more state property will be gnawed  off and abused. The government advocates undertaking this task  resolutely and openly in a way suitable to the actual conditions  so the people can oversee it.    -- We must scrutinize and sternly deal with those cases of  illegal land allocation or land sales in which proceeds are not  turned in to the government.    -- The prices of certain kinds of goods, which are either  fixed or controlled by the state and are not suitable to the  relations of supply and demand, such as gasoline and oil,  electricity, cement, and the like, must be readjusted rationally  so as to help economize on consumption and to achieve a balance  between supply and demand and, at the same time, increase  revenue for the budget.    Increased revenue should be coupled with reducced  expenditure as stipulated by the National Assembly resolutions,  with the goal of reducing budgetary strain. In implementing the  National Assembly resolutions and the government decisions on  practicing thrift, by mid-May there have been 47 ministries and  central level agencies and 17 provinces and cities to actually  draw up plans to practice thrift. According to the plans of the  10 ministries that have been inspected, the amount of the  projected expenditure reduction is 1.357 trillion dong,  including 382 billion in capital construction, 943 billion in  production and trade, and 32 billion in administrative  expenditures.    The government urges all sectors and localities to complete  their plans to practice thrift. The plans need to be calculated  carefully and be concretely feasible. The Ministry of Finance  will have to study the accounting and set up guidelines for  using the money saved in its role of helping to ensure a  balanced budget. The major expenditures, especially those for  capital construction projects, must be allocated reasonably in  accordance with the real-life situation of budget revenue. In  the current situation, we are not allowed to consider  expenditures for out-of-plan projects. Expenditures for new  policies, new positions, and so forth should depend on actual  revenue increases. We should actively try to expand our  borrowing ability, either from foreign sources or from the  people, to cover our investment and development needs. We  should develop medium- and long-term borrowing plans with  interest rates which can attract people's savings and which are  in good accordance with bank loan interest rates.    B. Continue to maintain the fiscal stability and  single-digit inflation rate:    The value of the dong is influenced by two things. On the  one hand there are reasons for prices to go up and the  purchasing power of the dong to go down. Increase expenditure  in the coming months will cause demand to increase during the  last several months of the year. A large inflow of foreign  currency from various sources will increase the circulating  money supply and push demand for goods up, thus creating more  pressure for higher prices. On the other hand, the difficulties  caused by the lack of a consuming market and from the  competition of goods smuggled from overseas can also cause  prices of agricultural products and some consumer goods to drop  significantly. The large foreign currency inflow will also make  the value of the dong increase slightly, thus weakening  production and export activities.    We need to accelerate our production activities and increase  domestic and international trade. At the same time, we need to  be well aware of keeping supply and demand balanced, intervening  as necessary to maintain inflation at the single-digit level. We  should try to avoid any sudden fluctuations in prices of goods,  services, gold, and the dollar, either increases or decreases.  The unreasonable disparity in prices between agricultural  products and industrial ones should be overcome. The government  is in the process of adjusting foreign currency management  policy aiming at stabilizing the realistic exchange rates on one  hand, and on the other limiting the large use of the dollar  domestically, first in credit and payment transactions between  business establishments and banks. Conditions should be created  for the gradual implementation of the principle that the should  dong only be used in Vietnam. [end recording]</p>

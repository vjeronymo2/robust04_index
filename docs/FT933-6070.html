			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Dilution measures for acid rain: The UK's awkward diplomacy may be tarnishing a hard-won record The question of whose pollution is producing acid rain, causing European forests to wither and fish to die, is one of the longest-running international environmental disputes. Officals from 36 countries meeting in Geneva this week will try to find an answer. The issue is particularly sensitive for Britain, which has been accused of jeopardising a United Nations-backed treaty to curb the pollution. Britain's refusal in 1985 to sign an earlier agreement curbing sulphur emissions, one of the leading causes of acid rain, earned it the tag of 'dirty man of Europe'. The UK has found it hard to shrug off the label, despite introducing expensive measures to clean up power stations, the main polluters. Now Britain's resistance to the latest, more stringent targets proposed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva, which includes western and eastern Europe as well as the US and Canada, is drawing new venom from its neighbours. Earlier this month, , Mr Thorbjoern Berntsen, Norway's environment minister, hurled personal abuse at Mr John Gummer, his UK counterpart. The British reluctance is prompted by the desire to protect the already shrunken demand for British coal from power generators. Tighter emission standards might force them to burn less British coal. But some government officials privately fear that the UK is sacrificing its hard-won environmental record for nothing. The programme to close mines and to generate a greater proportion of electricity from gas means that the UK may meet the proposed targets, in the same way that it has now met the terms of the 1985 protocol it once resisted. 'The negotiating position on acid rain is not taking account of the actual run-down of the coal industry,' according to one observer of the talks. International disputes over acid rain first emerged at the end of the 1970s when the Scandinavians sought explanations for why some of their forests were turning brown. Acid rain is caused mainly by sulphur dioxide, which is emitted when coal and oil are burnt, and by nitrogen oxides, emitted by power stations and transport. The acidity is generally slight, 'about the same as a can of Coca-Cola', says Professor Ian Fells of Nottingham University. But the gases, sometimes dissolved in rain, can travel thousands of miles - across national borders - before being deposited, making disputes particularly hard to resolve. Scientists generally agree about the harmful effect of the acid on water quality and fish, and its role in corroding buildings. However, 'there is more doubt about the mechanism of damage to trees - it can be hard to distinguish the effects (of acid rain) from those of drought', says Prof Fells. The source of acid rain is clear, however. In Britain, coal-burning power stations are the main culprits, spewing out 72 per cent of total sulphur emissions in 1990. They also discharged 28 per cent of nitrogen oxides in the same year, though this is less than the amount discharged by traffic. Nevertheless, Britain's emissions have been falling because the decline of heavy manufacturing has reduced industrial energy demand, and there has been a switch by domestic users from coal and oil to gas. Sulphur dioxide emissions dropped from 6.4m tonnes in 1970 to 4.9m tonnes in 1980 and 3.5m tonnes last year. Emissions are now set to fall further, partly because of the need to fall into line with the European Commission's large combustion plant directive, a treaty covering power stations. National Power, one of the two main generators in the UK, emitted 1.3m tonnes of sulphur dioxide last year; it must halve that level by 2003. PowerGen, the second-biggest generator, last year produced slightly less than 1m tonnes of sulphur dioxide and must cut levels to 669,000 tonnes by 1998. These targets will be reached by two routes. The first - fitting old, coal-fired power stations with equipment to remove sulphur and other pollution - is expensive. Between them, the generators expect to spend more than Pounds 3bn on such improvements during the 1990s. But power companies find it cheaper to switch to cleaner fuels such as natural gas or imported coal, which has roughly half the sulphur content. The result of these changes, environment ministers say, is that the UK will not only meet the EC directive on large plants, but also the terms of the 1985 United Nations treaty it refused to sign. That prediction holds firm, ministers say, despite the government's decision this month to license the use of orimulsion, dubbed the 'world's dirtiest fuel'. Despite such optimism, Britain is arguing in Geneva that it would have difficulty meeting the proposed terms. The UK's neighbours are pressing for it to make a 79 per cent cut in sulphur emissions on 1980 levels possibly by 2000. Britain is countering with a bid of a 70 per cent cut by 2005. Other countries derive the 79 per cent figure from the model developed by the Austria-based International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, the most-quoted of the three scientific models used by the UN. According to Ms Fiona Weir, of Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, Britain's reluctance to accept the 79 per cent target implies that it is abandoning 'the principle of basing standards on good science'. Government officials reject this claim, saying that Britain's resistance stems from disagreement with the model. They argue that another UN model, run by Imperial College in London, recommends a lower target for UK emis-sions. But officials also concede that the principal force behind the British position in Geneva is the Department of Trade and Industry's desire to protect British Coal, after the political storm aroused by this year's pit closures. The DTI fears that power generators would turn to imported coal or shut down ageing coal-fired power stations prematurely rather than fit expensive pollution-control equipment. Some independent forecasters endorse this view. Mr Jim Skea, energy specialist with the Sussex University-based Science Policy Research Unit, says: 'If the government signed up to a 79 per cent reduction by 2005, that would probably be the nail in the coffin for what is left of the British coal industry.' The DTI argues, though, that its caution is warranted. Its officials believe the decision not to sign the 1985 protocol was right at the time - a fall in emissions during the 1980s was not anticipated. But some officials in the UK environment department point out that the dispute on targets may be unnecessary. The irony, they suggest, is that many coal-fired power stations are scheduled to be taken out of commission only a few years after the date set for pollution reductions. Britain will then see a further sharp fall in emissions, and may, after all, meet the toughest proposed targets. If this is the case, the UK government's awkward diplomacy on acid rain will, for a second time, have tarnished the appearance of a respectable environmental record. In the meantime, by insisting on keeping its options open, Britain is dealing itself a difficult hand, and its neighbours' frustration is unsurprising. If 'drittsekk' is the only insult hurled at British cabinet ministers on the road to a new sulphur protocol, and Norwegian the only European language in which abuse is uttered, the government may consider that it has got off lightly.</p>

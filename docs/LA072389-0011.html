			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELVIS  </P> <P> How ironic for Priscilla to say, " 'We are into preserving Elvis' name and  image,' " when she published her book exposing Elvis' most intimate moments and  then co-produced the TV miniseries aimed at eroding his reputation. If she felt  "a cultural responsibility," she would handle his image with more taste. The  love that existed between Elvis and his public has been destroyed by this  crassness.  </P> <P> S. FRANCIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

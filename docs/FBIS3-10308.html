But things were not left at that. Once again, the  diplomatic offensive went to work, in direct contact with the  people who are definitely the main characters of Cuban foreign  policy. This time the diplomats toured areas of interest in  Havana Province, the production of which is mostly  agricultural-industrial.    On the first day of their tour, the group visited Guines,  where plantain crops and Blas Roca Calderio Contingent's  Agricultural- Livestock Cooperative No. 30 are. They also toured  potato producing areas, a cold storage center, and the national  center for the production of laboratory animals. In all their  visits, they spoke to the people. [passage omitted]    These workdays through the interior of the country have  become a window to the world, through which the efforts of the  Cuban people to overcome can be seen by all.</p>

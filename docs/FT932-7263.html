			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Furnishing a label of quality Bernstein Group, a manufacturer of fitted kitchens, faced a problem common to many companies. Its products met half a dozen British Standards governing matters such as strength and hinges and it had qualified for the FIRA Gold Award, a furniture industry quality label. But while the FIRA award, introduced in the early 1980s by the Furniture Industry Research Association, was well known in the industry, it was not familiar to most of Bernstein's potential customers. Bernstein needed a more readily recognizable quality label. At the same time, FIRA and the British Standards Institution felt fitted kitchens would benefit from a purpose-designed British Standard. This would allow BSI to create a Kitemark which manufacturers could place on their products. At FIRA's prompting BSI put together a furniture industry committee which wrote BS6222, covering domestic kitchen equipment. The first part, relating to the strength of the 'carcass' was published last year and further parts, covering surface finishes, adhesive bonding, humidity performance and packaging are due to be finished shortly. Bernstein, a Manchester-based company with sales of Pounds 100m and a workforce of 950, did not have to change its kitchens because it already met the existing, fragmented standards and it had also qualified for BS5750, covering its quality systems. BSI now insists that companies seeking Kitemark approval also have BS5750. Bernstein became the first fitted-kitchen manufacturer to obtain the Kitemark last August though it has since been joined by a second company, Hygena. Maintaining the Kitemark involves two visits a year from FIRA, which has been authorised to carry out regular tests by BSI and costs about Pounds 1,500 a year, says John Atherton, Bernstein's quality systems manager. (Though initial testing of a kitchen range could cost between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 10,000). It is difficult to quantify the impact of the Kitemark on sales, he says but he is happy to have a better-known quality label. FIRA is aware of the problems national industry organisations face in getting their quality labels better known. 'The problem for organisations like FIRA is we can't afford a massive national promotion,' says Colin Aitkenhead, chief executive. It was partly for this reason that FIRA became a co-founder, 18 months ago, of the European Association of Research Institutes for Furniture, linking 12 national organisations. The European furniture industry is awash with national labels including the FIRA Gold Award, the mobelfakta label used in the Nordic countries and the French Norme Francaise. The European association hopes to achieve an agreement on mutual recognition by the different national organisations and is working on creating a common label for furniture. But these hopes depend on the creation of European standards for furniture manufacture and these are still some way off.</p>

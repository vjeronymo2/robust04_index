			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Gubarev: ``Prepare the Candles, Ladies </F> and Gentlemen! The Shutting Down of Nuclear Power Stations  Presages a Power Catastrophe'']    [Text] It could happen as early as February. The Russian  president and government will find it necessary to introduce a  state of emergency. This was stated by directors of nuclear  power stations who gathered in Moscow. They warned that, as  early as February, the Leningradskaya, Smolenskaya, Kurskaya,  Novovoronezhskaya, Kolskaya, and Bilibinskaya power stations  will be unable to operate, and hence they will have to shut down  their reactors.    Yes, the ``greens'' who have been ``at war'' for some years  now with the aid of their Western colleagues against Russia's  nuclear electric power stations [AES's] can celebrate a  ``victory.'' In the situation which has developed our power  stations are simply physically incapable of operating, since  there is no fuel, it is impossible to carry out systematic  repairs, and there is no money to buy spare parts and  consumables. And this is at a time when the only sector in  Russia which has not decreased production since 1991 and has not  permitted a slump [sentence as published]. Moreover, on the  results of the work for 1993 our nuclear power stations were  superior in virtually all indicators to the AES's of France and  the United States. This applies to the reliability of  operation, the number of breakdowns, and the performance of the  service personnel. These are not ``our'' statistics, but the  conclusions of international experts and organizations.    It should be remembered that in the European part of Russia  AES's produce almost one-half of the electricity, and one-fourth  of this goes to such centers as Moscow and St. Petersburg. Add  to this the fact that ``nuclear'' electricity is two to three  times cheaper than the price which we, the consumers, have to  pay. Therefore, the shutdown of AES's will at the very least  provoke a two- to threefold increase in tariffs; but we are  already used to this.... But something else is more dangerous:  Stations are turning from producers into mighty consumers of  energy, since this is required in order to maintain safety. And  you can't just ``hit the switch''--we all know full well what  happened at Chernobyl.    And there is no use in hiding it, because of the shutdown of  enterprises--including chemical, metallurgical, and machine  building enterprises--an electricity surplus has developed in  Russia. Electricity is mainly generated by coal and other  thermal stations, and consequently, the ecological situation is  sharply deteriorating. Discharges into the atmosphere of all  manner of substances harmful to man and life in general will  increase dramatically. Here is a truly ``Pyrrhic victory'' for  ecology!    Surely we can learn something from the experience of  Armenia,  where the decommissioning of AES's led to catastrophe? Or from  the sad experience of Ukraine, where the power situation  provoked a disastrous slump in industry and agriculture, and  therefore, in the life of society as a whole? Do we really  prefer to learn from our own mistakes? However, there is not  long to wait: If we do not intervene in the fate of Russia's  nuclear power stations today, within a month we will find out  what a power crisis is really like.... So prepare the candles,  ladies and gentlemen!    The directors of Russia's AES's, who gathered at the  ``Rosenergoatom'' concern for their emergency meeting, see as  the main culprit of their woes the ``supermonopoly structure of  the RAO `YeES Russia' [Russian joint-stock company `Integrated  Energy System of Russia']--the sole consumer of our output.''  In their appeal to B. Yeltsin and V. Chernomyrdin they laid  special stress on this fact.    And it is possible to understand the directors: Any monopoly  is harmful. The RAO buys energy from nuclear stations and, as  is the custom with us, does not pay for it in full. But the RAO  also does not receive money from consumers--it is probably  impossible to find one enterprise today which has paid for the  electricity it has received. Moreover, even our neighbors in  the nearby foreign parts prefer not to pay--there are more than  sufficient examples of this.    Effectively Russia has provided just over 3 trillion rubles'  [R] worth of electricity free of charge over the past few  years--they took it and did not pay! You might think that we  were already living under communism.... No, not ``we,'' but a  great many enterprises and republics; and ``we'' are forced to  pay over the odds for our light and heat.    The nuclear physicists work well. And the government  understands this: It is no accident that the country's top  leadership listened attentively to their problems. And hence  the directors of Russia's AES's write in their appeal:    ``We thank our government for the fine decisions aimed at  stabilizing the financial position in nuclear power engineering  which it made in October-December of last year and which have  been sunk by the prevailing reality existing in our country,  where it is not the decisions of the government or the president  that are fulfilled, but those of structures of the type of the  RAO `YeES Russia' and people who prefer to burn scarce organic  fuel, rather than deliver cheap power from AES's to consumers.''    The directors go on to cite a surprising fact: ``Of the  credits worth R70 billion allocated by the government in October  1993 to pay for energy delivered from AES's, in three months  only R6 billion has reached the AES's; R30 billion of the  indicated sum for some reason was left in a commercial bank'' (I  omit the name of the bank so as not to give it further  publicity--V.G.). True, the AES directors are mistaken here:  The money was not ``left'' in this bank for two months, but was  successfully ``put to work''--it brought in to the bank twice  the amount, since the ``nuclear R30 billion'' really ``did its  stuff.'' And very few employees of the bank cared that at some  nuclear power stations employees are not receiving their pay....    No, the employees and directors of Russia's AES's are not  threatening a strike: They understand full well how serious the  situation is today in power engineering and industry, but are  warning the president, the government, and all of us, that they  will be forced to shut down AES's, since their duty as  professionals and as human beings forbids them to allow new  Chernobyls. The AES directors clearly state that they cannot  allow the slightest risk in the operation of AES's. But, to be  honest, the AES directors no longer hope for help from the  government, since not one of its decisions has been fulfilled.</p>

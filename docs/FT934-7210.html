			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (2): Arnault proves worth the wait - Alice Rawsthorn and Ian Rodger profile five of the leading lights in the high-profile world of luxury goods / Bernard Arnault THERE is almost always an irritating delay before the beginning of any Paris haute couture collection, but the audience at this summer's Christian Lacroix show was forced to wait for even longer than usual. Eventually a slim figure edged his way to one of the little gilt chairs on the front row. Bernard Arnault had finally arrived and the Lacroix show could start in earnest. Arnault, 44, is chairman of LVMH, the company behind a string of prestigious products from Hennessy cognac and Christian Dior cosmetics to Christian Lacroix couture. He made his name in the 1980s as one of the bright young entrepreneurs who sprang from the bureaucratic ranks of French industry and is now established as one of the most powerful people in luxury goods. In the early days Arnault was best known for the ruthlessness with which he fought - and won - the battle for control of LVMH. He then went on, with his army of accountants, to shake up the business by scrutinising once-sacrosanct expense claims and hiring, or firing, designers. One employee recalled asking him out to lunch only to be told, 'But what would we have to talk about?' Others remember, or would rather forget, his constant home telephone calls even on Christmas Day. These days Arnault stresses the softer side of his nature. His publicists are fond of saying that he always really wanted to be a concert pianist, as if the LVMH chairman had stumbled into the grubby world of business by accident. But the ruthlessness is still there, as his rivals at Yves Saint-Laurent discovered this summer. YSL has been mired in law suits since the French champagne industry objected to the name of its new fragrance, Champagne. And who runs the biggest champagne business in France? Arnault.</p>

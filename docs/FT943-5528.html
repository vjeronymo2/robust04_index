			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Archer named in client details for Anglia share deal The stockbroking account set up by Lord Archer for dealing in Anglia Television shares days before the takeover bid from MAI contained his own name as part of the client reference details. The former Conservative party deputy chairman told Department of Trade and Industry inspectors investigating allegations of insider dealing that he placed the share orders on behalf of a Mr Broosk Saib. It emerged yesterday that the account used by Lord Archer at brokers Charles Stanley for dealing in the Anglia shares was set up in the name of 'B Saib Esq, c/o J Archer, Alembic House'. Lord Archer has a penthouse in Alembic House. Mr Alistair Darling, Labour's spokesman on the City, said this disclosure reinforced his party's case that the DTI should publish the report into alleged insider trading, so that the public could judge what really happened. At the end of July Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, decided not to take any further action against Lord Archer The DTI investigation focused on two orders placed by Lord Archer for the purchase of 50,000 shares in Anglia, whose directors include his wife Lady Archer. The first was placed on January 13, the day after Anglia's board had been given details of the price MAI was prepared to pay for the television company's shares in a takeover bid. At around 10am, Lord Archer called Mr Simon Wharmby at Charles Stanley. He had never before dealt through Charles Stanley but had used Mr Wharmby's services at his previous stockbroking firms. He asked Mr Wharmby about the availability of Anglia shares. Mr Wharmby found out that a parcel of 80,000 shares was available. Lord Archer said that the price being asked was too great, and placed an order to purchase 25,000 shares at around 486p. Mr Wharmby then spoke again to Charles Stanley's dealers, who clinched a deal with a market marker, or wholesaler of shares. According to Stock Exchange records, the deal was done at 10.25am. Mr Wharmby then telephoned Lord Archer and told him the deal had been completed. He had assumed that Lord Archer was dealing for himself. However, Lord Archer said the shares should be booked in the name of Mr Saib. Lord Archer also told Mr Wharmby he would be interested in buying more shares if they became available at a similar price. As a result, the following day Mr Wharmby telephoned him and offered him a second parcel of 25,000 shares, which Lord Archer agreed to buy, again on behalf of Mr Saib. The deal was done at 2pm. Both deals were completed in such a way that they counted as falling into the next trading account, which meant no money had to change hands at that stage. The following Tuesday, January 18, MAI announced its Pounds 292m takeover bid very early in the morning. At 10am, after the share price had soared by about 160p, Lord Archer telephoned Mr Wharmby and sold the shares, netting a profit after commission of just over Pounds 77,000. An 'account payee only' cheque for this amount, made out to Mr Saib, was sent on February 4 to Lord Archer's London address.</p>

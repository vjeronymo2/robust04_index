			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lionheart falls into Pounds 870,000 loss LIONHEART, the Cheshire-based paint brushes and home improvements group which returned to the dividend list only last year, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 870,000 for 1992, and passed its final distribution. The loss compared with a profit of Pounds 2.39m. Mr Paul Lever, executive chairman, blamed recession for depressing sales volumes by 19 per cent and forcing price cuts that reduced margins by 3 percentage points. After shedding a fifth of the workforce to save Pounds 2m, he said Lionheart was now back in profit. All 1991 figures have been restated under accounting standard FRS 3. Turnover was up nearly 23 per cent at Pounds 43.6m (Pounds 35.5m) but cost of sales rose 25 per cent to Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 21.9m) and net operating expenses by 54 per cent to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 10.4m). This reduced operating profit to only Pounds 207,000 against a previous Pounds 3.21m. Exceptional debits, made up of abortive acquisition costs and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations, were Pounds 372,000. Interest charges rose from Pounds 543,000 to Pounds 705,000. After two years of reconstruction under Mr Lever, Lionheart returned to the dividend list with a 0.3p final a year ago. It then paid an interim dividend of 0.2p. Mr Lever said: 'After consultations in the City we decided it was better to be prudent and preserve resources. We could have paid a 0.1p final and still have headroom, but with the uncertainty about the economy we felt it better to be careful.' The company, in which Newell, the US paint brush manufacturer, increased its stake from 13.4 per cent to 20 per cent during the year, has reduced gearing from 37 per cent to 12.7 per cent by the sale and leaseback of its Wellingborough factory. Mr Lever said profitability returned in the fourth quarter, although an expected Christmas pick-up in sales of shower curtains and bathroom accessories had not materialised.</p>

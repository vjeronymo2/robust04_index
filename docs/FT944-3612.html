			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Strong recovery in car sales: Signs of growth in Germany and Italy boost European figures West European new car sales increased by 11.9 per cent year-on-year in November to 926,000, the European motor industry's strongest performance since the early summer. The rebound last month was supported by clear signs of recovery in Germany and Italy combined with continuing strong growth in France, Spain and Scandinavia. New car sales in the first 11 months rose by 5.4 per cent to an estimated 11.1m. In Italy, where sales in the first 11 months, were still 5 per cent lower than a year ago, new car registrations rose last month by 18.9 per cent year-on-year to 135,600 according to estimates from the Italian Ministry of Transport. German sales rose last month by 8.6 per cent to an estimated 249,000 according to figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. In the first 11 months they were virtually unchanged at 2.97m, an increase of 0.1 per cent. Sales have continued to rise strongly in France and Spain, where the governments introduced financial incentives early this year to encourage scrapping of old cars. In France sales rose by 21.4 per cent in November to 190,700, and by 20.1 per cent year-on-year in Spain to 66,600. Overall new car sales in November were higher than a year ago in 13 of 17 west European markets. The pace of the recovery was weakened only by the slowdown in the UK. The UK new car market was leading west Europe out of recession in the first half of the year, but sales have declined year-on-year in each of the last two months. The strongest growth among the Europe's big six volume carmakers has been achieved by the PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault groups of France, which have benefited from the sales recovery at home and in Spain. PSA Peugeot Citroen raised sales by 10.1 per cent in the first 11 months and market share to 12.8 per cent from 12.3 per cent a year ago. The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has lost ground this year in west Europe, but it staged a strong recovery in November helped by the recent launch of new models. VW group registrations rose by an estimated 18.5 per cent last month. It was outperformed, however, by the Fiat group of Italy, which increased November sales by 34.9 per cent. Japanese carmakers continue to lose market share with sales falling by 0.7 per cent in November despite the 11.9 per cent rise in the overall market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS January-November 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume       Volume    Share (%)  Share (%)                             (Units)    Change (%)   Jan-Nov    Jan-Nov                                                         '94        '93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET            11,100,000         +5.4        100.0      100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURERS:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volkswagen group         1,768,000         +3.6         15.9       16.2  -Volkswagen             1,140,500         +1.2         10.3       10.7  -Audi                     291,300         +0.8          2.6        2.7  -Seat                     280,400        +15.5          2.5        2.3  -Skoda*                    55,800        +15.6          0.5        0.5 General Motors****       1,442,000         +4.3         13.0       13.1  -Opel/Vauxhall          1,377,100         +3.9         12.4       12.6  -Saab**                    47,100        +23.0          0.4        0.4 PSA Peugeot Citroen      1,426,600        +10.1         12.8       12.3  -Peugeot                  857,700         +9.6          7.7        7.4  -Citroen                  568,900        +10.7          5.1        4.9 Ford group****           1,315,200         +7.0         11.8       11.7  -Ford                   1,289,400         +6.9         11.6       11.5  -Jaguar                    10,000         -1.7          0.1        0.1 Renault                  1,217,200         +9.1         11.0       10.6 Fiat group********       1,195,300         +7.2         10.8       10.6  -Fiat                     937,300        +11.9          8.4        8.0  -Lancia                   152,300         -2.3          1.4        1.5  -Alfa Romeo                93,500        -13.8          0.8        1.0 BMW group                  722,100         +6.2          6.5        6.5  -BMW                      361,800         +5.1          3.3        3.3  -Rover                    360,300         +7.2          3.2        3.2 Mercedes-Benz              396,900        +21.4          3.6        3.1 Nissan                     362,200          3.7          3.3        3.6 Toyota                     293,300         -1.9          2.6        2.8 Volvo                      185,800        +17.9          1.7        1.5 Mazda                      167,100         -8.7          1.5        1.7 Honda                      158,600         +4.8          1.4        1.4 Mitsubishi                 111,100        -15.7          1.0        1.3 Suzuki                      69,800        -20.8          0.6        0.8 Total Japanese           1,223,500         -6.2         11.0       12.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany                  2,968,300         +0.1         26.7       28.1 United Kingdom           1,837,700         +7.8         16.6       16.2 France                   1,798,600        +14.6         16.2       14.9 Italy                    1,533,000         -5.0         13.8       15.3 Spain                      821,200        +21.7          7.4        6.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *VW holds 31 per cent and management control of Skoda. ****Includes cars imported from US and sold in western Europe. **GM holds 50 per cent and management control of Saab Automobile. ******** Fiat group includes Lancia, Alfa Romeo, Innocenti, Ferrari and Maserati.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: ACEA (European Automobile Manufacturers Association) estimates.

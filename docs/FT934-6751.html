			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nippon Shinpan declines 35% Nippon Shinpan, the consumer credit company, suffered a 35.3 per cent fall to Y4.9bn in pre-tax profit for the first half to September, as Japanese consumer spending weakened during the period and the company increased provisions for non-performing loans, writes Robert Thomson. Turnover during the six months fell 8.4 per cent to Y2,603.9bn, although the company said the number of credit cards issued during the period rose, partly because of the success of a card linked to Japan's popular and newly-professionalised soccer league. Retail sales slipped as consumers lost confidence in the face of reductions in overtime and smaller annual bonuses, which directly affect Nippon Shinpan, the largest Japanese provider of credit card services. The government, under pressure from Japanese industry, is debating whether an income tax cut will revive consumer confidence, though a decision is unlikely before the financial year ends in March. For the full year, Nippon Shinpan expects a pre-tax profit of Y13.6bn, compared to Y14.3bn last year, and a net profit of Y3.4bn, down from Y4.7bn.</p>

Bezruk;  MNTK ``Mikrokhirurgiya glaza'' [Eye Microsurgery], Moscow; reply  to article ``Experimental Radial Thermokeratoplasty in Rabbits''  by S. T. Feldman, W. Ellis, J. Frucht-Pery, A. Chayet, and S. I.  Brown; UDC 617.753.1-089]    [Abstract] In the course of conducting theoretical and  experimental studies of the histopathological effects of  thermokeratocoagulation on rabbit corneas, the authors found a  similar American study (Feldman, et al.) to be erroneous in its  conclusion that thermokeratocoagulation is inadequate in terms  of safety and efficacy. In this work, the authors found that  thermokeratocoagulation is relatively safe and that severe  tissue damage is primarily caused by improper insertion of the  needle into the cornea. The authors also found that the use of  thermal effects in ophthalmic surgery calls for a very precise  application of data obtained from animals to humans, i.e.,  thermocoagulation conditions designed for humans cannot be  automatically applied to rabbits, which was the mistake made by  the Americans. They also concluded that using mathematical  simulation in ophthalmosurgery will substantially facilitate the  analysis of specific surgical processes, greatly reduce costly  and time-consuming medical and biological studies, and provide  for more accurate predictions of the outcome of operations,  including the transition from animal to human experiments. The  computerized TERMO-K modeling program (IBM PC AT) developed by  the authors successfully predicted the American  ophthalmologists' results, which was additional proof of the  program's scientific and educational applicability.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Kazakh Supreme Council Deputy Aleksandr </F> Garkavets by VESTNIK KAZAKHSTANA special correspondent Nikolay  Gora; place and date not given; under the rubric "Frank  Conversation": "Aleksandr Garkavets: Practical Work Showed That  Dialogue Between Deputy Groups Will Serve Society's  Consolidation"]    [Text] Aleksandr Nikolayevich Garkavets was born in  1947 in Donetsk Oblast. He graduated from Kharkov University,  and has worked at Ukrainian newspapers and publishing houses.  Completed graduate study at the Institute of Oriental Studies of  the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Since 1987 he has been  head of the Russian Language department of the Kazakh Academy of  Sciences' Linguistics Institute.    Doctor of philology, author of 13 books.    Elected Supreme Council deputy by state list from  Kustanay Oblast. Deputy chairman of the parliament's Committee  on Culture, Press, Mass Media, and Public Associations.    Today the parliament member answers our special  correspondent's questions.    [Gora] Well, Aleksandr Nikolayevich, the parliament, like a  big boat--if one may put it this way--has reached the open sea  of life. And it is very important for the deputies-oarsmen to  take their places and work at full capacity. In my view,  however, the parliamentary boat is moving in a quite leisurely  way; a lot of time is spent on arguments, discussions, tongue  lashing. What is your opinion on this subject?    [Garkavets] The Greeks called boats of this class--that is,  with so many oarsmen--catarga; the Turks called them  galere, and the oarsmen took to the oars not because  it was their calling; also, to ensure coordinated rowing, the  methods used on these quite sturdy vessels were, to put it  mildly, command-administrative. However, if we extend your  metaphor to picture other branches of authority--as analogous  big boats--then the parliament is the only surface vessel  solidly moored to them: All its work, miscalculations, and  shortcomings are in the public view, while the other seafaring  vessels are predominantly of an underwater variety and are  equipped not with oars but nuclear reactors. They are the ones  pulling our society from one bright future to another--through  thorns to the stars. And the neighboring flotillas, too, are  trying to prevent us taking off on an independent voyage. While  the blame falls on those who are exposed.    That is why I think that in these conditions the parliament,  in keeping with the will of the voters expressed during the  elections, first and foremost must decide whether we really are  going where the people want us to go, and whether we are doing  so the right way. In order to define our strategy we have to  first of all sort out interparliamentary relations. Therefore,  some time has been spent on organizational matters. There were  inevitable arguments and attacks. But it simply does not happen  otherwise in collectives where everyone is equal.    There are already some results of the discussion on the  strategic issue: "Are we heading in the right direction and are  we going about it the right way?" In its statement, produced  after almost a week of debate on this issue, the parliament  questioned the correctness of the course of socioeconomic and  legal policy of the government. Now we will hear the government  program of reforms, in particular, urgent measures for getting  out of the crisis, into which it has led us in the first place.  Although for objectivity's sake one has to admit that it could  be several times worse.    [Gora] All deputies have equal rights, but it is no secret  that they have different potential. This means we can assume  that in time some or other parliament member will simply be  unable to carry the heavy load, to meet the high standards. Who  can determine the effectiveness of a deputy's activities and  recall him if he cannot handle his job?    [Garkavets] Do I handle well, for instance, the "job of a  professional parliament member?" And what is a "professional  parliament member" and what is his job description? For many,  including myself, these are notions that so far have not been  precisely and clearly defined. We know for certain two things:  We were elected by the people, and our only duty is to carry out  the will of the people who elected us by the means set by the  law. How to carry this out so that the work will be considered  professional is still to be decided. The main criteria of  parliamentary professionalism will be most graphically expressed  in the laws on the Supreme Council and on the status of the  Supreme Council deputy, and other related legislative acts. Then  you can put the Supreme Council and its deputies to a real test.    [Gora] Deputies of the former parliament stayed close to the  population, met with voters quite frequently, conducted open  dialogue, and reported on the work done and on carrying out the  mandates. Now it appears that professional parliament members  will not have much time for meetings, unless one counts short  vacations. Will this not lead to isolation from the voters; will  a wall of alienation not rise up between deputies and voters?    [Garkavets] It is unlikely that the deputies of the current  parliament will detach themselves from the population. Special  time is set aside for work in the oblasts (districts). There  also will be an assistant to the deputy, hired specifically for  this purpose, working there. Anyway, our people know their way  to the capital very well--they will not let us drift away.    Being an armchair scholar, and having shifted only a few  years ago from history and theory to the practice of ethnic and  language policy, lawmaking in this area, as well as public work  in the area of ethnic revival, in five to seven years I have  accumulated such intensive contacts that a professional  politician can only dream of. They will keep me on my toes.  Especially considering that I, as the chairman on the public  associations subcommittee, spend many hours every day in  discussions with leaders of the republic's most active  associations of citizens of diverse political leanings, ethnic,  confessional, and other affiliation.    [Gora] Factions have been established and are operating in  the parliament. Can their activities exert perceptible influence  in lawmakers' activism, the parliament members' quality of work?    [Garkavets] I do not yet know about factions, even the  radical-moderate faction of the National Congress of Kazakhstan,  to which I belong as a member of party's political executive  committee, but some deputy groups, which formed as we went, have  already clearly made themselves count. For instance, the  Progress group, which prepared the draft of the parliament's  statement of no-confidence in the government's course of  socioeconomic and legal policy. The work showed that the  dialogue between deputy formations will be businesslike and  constructive, and will serve society's consolidation instead of  splitting it. Although in the conditions of economic  stratification there are more then enough preconditions for a  schism both in society and in parliament, first and foremost on  a class basis. What will ensure calm in the parliament and a  semblance of peace in the country, however, is not potential  attempts to cajole deputies, practiced in exploiter states. Only  concern for unprotected population strata, consistent  implementation of the principle of pay according to labor, and  priority support for goods producers--and in ethnic policy, the  principle of equality--will preserve peace in Kazakhstan and the  working zeal in parliament.    [Gora] Lawmaking undoubtedly will require of parliament  members daily strain, exhausting labor, and great intellectual  and emotional efforts. In my opinion, an important part is the  skill to conduct discussion in such a way as to prevent unneeded  waves of emotions from arising. I do not want to hurt the  feelings of any of your colleagues, but observations show that  not everyone possesses the skills to conduct dialogue calmly.  How do you raise the level of deputies' political culture?    [Garkavets] Joint involved work--humanity has not invented a  better teacher of ethics. Working together in committees,  commissions, working groups, and plenary sessions, we will  gradually, as they say, adjust. One cannot do without emotions,  however. We are defining the principles of a state system,  organization of production relations, participation in socially  significant labor, and distribution of the aggregate product.  This is not at all a semantic dissection of phrases comprising  the law.    [Gora] You were at the beginnings of the Ukrainian national  center. I assume you still hold its concerns close to heart.  What has it achieved, and what tasks is the center facing?    [Garkavets] The main task today is the publication of  Kazakhstan's republic-wide newspaper UKRAYINSKIY NOVYNY, which  was founded by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of  Kazakhstan; the publisher is the republic publishing house  Deuir. More than 150 Ukrainian newspapers and magazines are  published outside Ukraine, where about 11 million Ukrainians  live; there are also about 70 institutes, departments, and  chairs. All of them, however, exist mainly on public money. Even  to organize a chair of Ukrainian studies in Harvard University,  which now has an independent Institute of Ukrainian Studies, 25  years ago the Ukrainian diaspora had to collect $2 million. Our  newspaper, however, was from the very beginning financed by the  state--the first state Ukrainian newspaper outside Ukraine. For  Kazakhstan's Ukrainians, for Ukrainians all over the world, it  is testimony to the true internationalism of the Kazakh people,  who are building together with us, citizens of other  nationalities, a sovereign democratic state. With great pleasure  I serve as the newspaper's volunteer editor in chief.    [Gora] And now a little about yourself. How do you spend  whatever little free time you have, when you manage to find it?    [Garkavets] I am continuing my work on a collection of  folklore of Urum (Kypchak-language) Greeks in the Azov region,  in four volumes--about 2,500 pages. There are about 400 pages  left to go. I have been collecting material for more than 20  years in the Mariupol area, and now I can finally publish these  texts together with the original 18th-19th century manuscripts.  Then it will be time to publish a unique dictionary of this  language. Also, I help my friends in forming art publications. I  make computer-generated layouts for them. For instance, Sultan  Orazelinov's photo album "Abai Eli" ("In the Abakh Land") will  be published soon--it will be printed in the Czech Republic. In  a month or two an American weekly newspaper about unusual and  amazing events in the world--WEEKLY WORLD NEWS--will begin  publication in Russian; it will also be printed in the Czech  Republic. Initially it will be published twice a month. This is  also my hobby.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Equity Issues: Finnish forestry sector boosted by devaluation THE DEVALUATION of the Finnish markka has sparked international investor interest in Finnish stocks, prompting several issues in the forestry sector. Metsa-Serla, one of Finland's leading forestry groups, plans to raise around Dollars 100m through a direct offering of B shares to international investors. The proceeds will be used to reduce the group's debt and to expand operations. The group says that it wants to exploit increased international demand for its shares at a time when its financial performance is improving and its shares have risen strongly. The group's B shares have risen by 72 per cent this year to FM172. Meanwhile, Repola, another Finnish timber company which is 20 per cent owned by Metsa-Serla, has priced its international share offering at FM66.25 per share, approximately FM1 below Monday's closing price. The offering was increased from 6m shares to 7m shares. SG Warburg, the lead underwriter, has the option to increase the size by a further 1m shares. The size and price of the Metsa-Serla offering will be set according to market conditions after the June 9 publication of the group's financial figures for the first four months. These are expected to show that the group has returned to profit, confirming the forecast it gave when it announced a 1992 loss of FM290m. The issue is mainly being targeted at the US, UK, Swedish and central Europe markets, where demand for the group's shares has increased since Finland relaxed restrictions on foreign share ownership at the start of the year. Metsa-Serla, along with other Finnish forestry groups, has seen its international competitiveness restored by the heavy depreciation of the markka since November 1991 and has also benefited from significant restructuring. Mr Timo Poranen, chief executive, said: 'Our main target with this issue is to reduce our gearing, but we also want to continue our focus on high value added production.' A specific plan is to convert the group's Kirkniemi mill to 100 per cent production of coated magazine paper. Kleinwort Benson is the global co-ordinator of the offering, while Kansallis-Osake-Pankki has been appointed as co-lead manager. This is the second international share issue to be announced by a leading Finnish group in the last few days. Last weektelecommunications group Nokia announced that it was making a Dollars 100m offer. It confirms a growing sense of confidence among the country's leading exporters. Banco Santander, the Spanish commercial bank, said yesterday that it was launching a Dollars 195m share offer in the US, AP-DJ reports. The offer, which is Santander's fourth US share tender since its first in September 1991, will bring to Dollars 750m the amount of capital it has raised on the New York Stock Exchange, the bank said. 'The funds obtained will reinforce Santander's broad capital base, raising its capital adequacy ratio to 13.57 per cent, the highest of the big Spanish banks,' Santander said. The preferential shares carry subscription but not voting rights and a maximum dividend of 8 per cent, the bank said. Chia-Hsin Cement, the third largest cement company in Taiwan, has priced its offering of global depositary receipts at Dollars 16.90, a premium of 3 per cent over a five-day average. Each global depositary receipt is based on 10 ordinary shares. The offering was arranged by Jardine Fleming.</p>

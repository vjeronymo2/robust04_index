			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Testing times for Dollars The dollar is likely to come under further pressure this week after last week's downward shift. Wide interest rate differentials with Europe, and continued confusing signals about US economic recovery may hinder its progress. Consumer confidence shot up in May, but M2 growth fell short of the Federal Reserve's target range. Attention this week will focus on non-farm payroll data for May and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' index. Economists are forecasting that around 103,000 new jobs were created in May, less than in April but greater than the average number of jobs created per month since the second quarter of last year. After the Bank of Japan's aggressive buying of the Yen last week, traders said they would be watching closely to see how firm the Japanese currency goes over the next few weeks. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation expects to see the Yen hit 124 against the dollar. 'The Bank of Japan appears to be sending a message loud and clear that it would like to see a stronger yen,' he said. According to Mr Gerard Lyons at DKB International, the Japanese Bank, trading partners have been pressurising Japan to reduce the size of its trade surplus. At the last G7 meeting in Washington the weakness of the yen was singled out as a hindrance. The Japanese government's apparent desire to strengthen the yen has probably been spurred by the prospect of the World Economic Summit in Munich next month. Tomorrow the Danes go to the polls in a referendum on whether Denmark should ratify the Maastricht treaty on Emu. Traders said the result was enough in doubt to keep the EMS currencies on edge.</p>

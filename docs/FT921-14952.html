			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Pearson drops idea of MGN purchase PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group, confirmed last night that it was no longer interested in acquiring Mirror Group Newspapers. Mr Frank Barlow, managing director of Pearson and a former Mirror Group executive, who was enthusiastic about an acquisition at the right price, said: 'In the light of the information we have, we have decided not to pursue the acquisition.' MGN has been in difficulties since the collapse of the business empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, believes Pounds 400m is missing from the MGN pension fund, and Pounds 100m from the company. In addition, the Mirror group, whose main titles are the Daily and Sunday Mirror, The People, The Sporting Life, and the Scottish Daily Record and the Sunday Mail, have around Pounds 340m in ordinary debt. If little of the money is retrieved, the company capitalised at Pounds 500m when the shares were suspended in November may not be worth much. Mr Tiny Rowlands's Lonrho group also said late last year it was not interested in an acquisition. The main remaining candidate to buy the left-of-centre publisher is a management buy-out led by Mr Richard Stott, the editor of the Daily Mirror, a plan backed by Electra, the venture capital group. There is also believed to be interest in putting together consortiums to bid from Hambros bank and Mercury Asset Management, the venture capital arm of SG Warburg, the merchant bank. Mr Barlow told his executive management committee on Monday he thought the numbers did not justify acquiring MGN. This was endorsed at a Pearson board meeting on Friday.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Mutual building societies good for corporate diversity Sir, Your editorial, 'Halifax and after' (November 28), suggests that if the proposed conversion of a merged Halifax/Leeds to plc status were to mark the beginning of the end of mutuality in the mortgage finance sector that would be no bad thing. You point out that the 1986 Building Society Act imposes regulatory constraints upon societies. Rather than advocate a relaxation of these constraints you appear to prefer wholesale conversion of building societies. The main argument in favour of this view is that 'the accommodating regime of mutuality' creates an 'absence of accountability'. By implication, plcs are made accountable by the need to create value for shareholders and the threat of takeover as a sanction against failure. There are two reasons for scepticism about this argument. First, mutuals face a very real sanction from their members; building societies are obliged to repurchase at face value the claims that depositors have on them at short notice. Members can withdraw resources from the management of a mutual and can do so independently, quickly and cheaply; no concerted action is necessary. In contrast, a plc is under no obligation to buy back its equity from dissatisfied shareholders at any price, let alone a fixed price. The operation of the secondary market in company shares leaves the assets of the company under the control of the managers, save in the event of a successful, hostile take-over bid. Second, if it is through the discipline of the threat of hostile takeover that quoted companies are kept on their toes there are good reasons to worry. The evidence on takeovers in the UK does not suggest that bad performance is the most obvious cause of hostile bids (see Tim Jenkinson and Colin Mayer's recent Hostile Takeovers, McGraw Hill); nor does it provide much support for the view that takeovers result in efficiency gains. And dramatic ups and downs in share prices over short periods justifies scepticism about whether stock market valuations reflect a cool assessment of the fundamental value of a company - surely a necessary condition for the efficiency of the takeover mechanism. The belief that all the resources devoted to intermediation in the market for retail deposits and home loans should be under the control of management who must respond to the signals from equity prices suggests a faith in the operation of the stock market that is not justified by the evidence. There is a lot to be said for diversity in corporate form. David Miles, senior UK economist, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Ropemaker Place, 25 Ropemaker Street, London EC2Y 9LY</p>

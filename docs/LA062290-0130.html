			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAATCHI &amp; SAATCHI DRIVES OFF WITH MORE TOYOTA BUSINESS  </P> <P> Oh, what a feeling to advertise Toyota. Just ask executives at the Torrance  agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific, which on Thursday won another  $20-million chunk of Toyota business.  </P> <P> Its newest client is Southeast Toyota Distributors Inc., of Deerfield Beach,  Fla. The group is responsible for Toyota vehicles distributed in five Southern  states. Saatchi's Los Angeles office will open branch offices in Ft. Lauderdale  and Atlanta to service the new client.  </P> <P> "There is no better compliment than to be awarded a new piece of business from  someone who knows us and our work so well," Joe Cronin, president of the  agency, said in a statement.  </P> <P> Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific handles the lion's share of Toyota's  advertising nationwide -- affecting more than 500 Toyota dealerships. Besides  Toyota's corporate advertising, it also handles 12 dealership associations and  two Toyota distributorships.  </P> <P> In recent months, a growing number of Japanese dealer associations -- including  Toyota, Nissan and Isuzu -- have hired the agencies that also create ads for  the auto makers. These auto groups generally say that the corporate agency has  a better feel for the company's image, and the associations can save money by  purchasing advertising time and space in bulk.  </P></p>

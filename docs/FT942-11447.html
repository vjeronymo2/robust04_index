			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee surges still higher London coffee futures surged again yesterday to touch new 5-year highs above Dollars 1,700 a tonne in nearby positions as the squeeze on supplies continued to dominate the market. The July futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange held on to Dollars 41 of its earlier Dollars 63 rise to close at Dollars 1,683 a tonne. However, traders said the rapid price rise over the past couple of weeks had made many buyers nervous and reluctant to trade and that the price was being pushed up in relatively light volume. In New York, July futures on arabica coffee broke through the key resistance level of 95 cents a pound to touch 97 cents at one stage, but later dropped back to 95 cents. 'New York has reacted aggressively to London's lead, but although it remains strong, the market is more tentative today than earlier in the week,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, softs analyst at Merrill Lynch. With the July price having risen by Dollars 120 a tonne this week alone, the market is vulnerable to a sharp correction, but analysts believe the long-term direction is upwards.</p>

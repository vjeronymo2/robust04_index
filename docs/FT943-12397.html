			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / French nuclear waste claim Cogema, the French nuclear fuels agency, yesterday rejected allegations by Greenpeace, the environmental organisation, that its proposal of more generous terms on nuclear fuel recycling and waste to a German customer, PreussenElektra (PE), had broken French law. Revealing a May 1994 letter from Cogema to PE, which belongs to Veba of Germany, Greenpeace said Cogema was offering to 'keep not only (PE's) plutonium but also the majority of the waste, in France', in defiance of France's 1991 law banning the long-term storage of foreign nuclear waste in the country. A Cogema director denied that any such offer to PE had been made, saying that 'we try to recycle what we can and to treat the rest as best as possible'. He added that 'Greenpeace has its opinion, we have ours and the customers will decide'.</p>

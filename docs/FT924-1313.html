			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / International Company News: Lehel goes ahead as demand rises LEHEL, the Hungarian refrigerator producer owned by Electrolux of Sweden, yesterday forecast that 1992 profits would strengthen 16.6 per cent to Ft950m (Dollars 11.5m) before tax on sales little changed at Ft12.1bn. The performance of Lehel, bought outright for about Dollars 60m in 1991 by Electrolux, Europe's largest producer of household appliances, contrasts with the generally frustrating experience of western multinationals with east European acquisitions. The performance comes mainly as a result of a dramatic improvement in productivity and an upturn in local demand. Lehel said productivity, as measured by volume per manhour, rose 72 per cent between April 1991, the first month after Electrolux agreed to buy the factory, and September 1992. 'The potential for productivity improvement was amazing,' said Mr Heikki Takanen, Electrolux vice-president in charge of the group's refrigerator business. 'We found hidden potential.' Lehel has increased efficiency by rapidly implementing profit centres; divesting peripheral activities; reducing the workforce by 32 per cent over 18 months to just over 3,200; and making more careful use of materials. Electrolux executives describe their successful approach to restructuring as at once 'aggressive' in implementing changes rapidly and 'pragmatic' in allowing joint working groups of foreigners and Hungarians to come up with the solutions. Electrolux also believes that its experience in making acquisitions and international character helped it to absorb the alien business culture it found at Lehel. At the same time as boosting production volume, the company has cut costs, overcoming weak prices and demand in western Europe, Lehel's most important market, and the Hungarian forint's continued appreciation in real terms. Sales have also benefited from a rebound in domestic Hungarian demand for refrigerators since May as the economy shows signs of having bottomed out. Electrolux does not, however, subscribe to the common view among multinationals that investment in one east European country can provide a springboard for the rest of the region, believing the strategy to lack substance.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tilak K. Gupta: "Major Naxal Groups Forge Unity"] </F>   [Text] Patna, March 21--In a significant development, the  Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), and the CPI M-L [Communist Party  of India-Marxist-Leninist (Party Unity), two of the most  militant Naxalite organisations in Bihar, have joined hands with  the powerful CPI M-L (People's War) group of Andhra Pradesh to  float the All India People's Resistance Forum (AIPRF). The  Maharashtra state unit of the CPI M-L (People's War) has also  become a constituent of the AIPRF.    While all these Naxalite groups function underground and  operate in a clandestine manner, they have over the years built  open and legal mass organisations for the peasant, workers,  student and youth as well as women fronts under various names.  The AIPRF, is scheduled to be the apex co-ordinating body of  more than 50 such frontal organisations active in different  states.    The CPI M-L (People's War), for instance, has built a  variety  of mass organisations in parts of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra,  Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Karnataka. The MCC, on the other  hand, has a number of mass organisations in Bihar, West Bengal  and claims to have some influence also in Assam, Tripura and  Uttar Pradesh. The CPI M-L (Party Unity), reportedly, has a  substantial presence in the coastal parts of Andhra Pradesh,  West Bengal, Punjab and Delhi, apart from its bases in the  South-Central Bihar.    The Rayatu Koolie Sangha, the frontal organisations of  agricultural labourers and peasants in Andhra Pradesh built by  the People's War group, inform AIPRF sources, enjoys membership  in lakhs. In Bihar, the now-banned Majdoor Kisan Sangram Samiti  (MKSS), agree most observers, has a substantial following. The  MCC, on the other hand, has floated a semi-legal mass  organisation, "Krantikari Kisan Committee," in the rural parts  of Bihar.    The AIPRF, according to inside sources, has been built to  pave the way for a concerted initiative to co-ordinate the local  struggles of its constituent bodies and give it an all-India  character. This apex body of the major Naxalite organisations,  is scheduled to hold a conference at Calcutta on March 21, to  give final shape to its manifesto. On the following day, the  AIPRF plans to hold a massive rally at Calcutta to give a  glimpse of the strength of the militant peasant struggles being  waged under their leadership in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and the  forest areas of Dandakaranya.    The draft manifesto of the AIPRF, presently, in circulation  among its constituents, states that its main objective is to  "build and develop powerful anti-feudal and anti-imperialist  struggles towards the goal of a new democratic India." But most  probably, this new platform would be utilised by the underground  Naxalite groups to articulate its views on major political  issues before a larger national audience.    Moreover, as the draft manifesto indicates, the AIPRF seems  to be desirous of forging a common front with diverse on-going  movements to defend the rights of tribals, Dalits, women and for  the protection of environment waged by various non-Maoist  formations. Interestingly, the movement against the Sardar  Sarovar Dam, more commonly known as "Narmada bachao andolan,"  has been singled out for special mention in this connection.    The growing opposition to the recently-concluded GATT  [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] treaty among various  sections of the Indian population also seems to have encouraged  these Naxalite organisations to search for a larger arena for  united struggle. No wonder, the draft manifesto of AIPRF, puts  stress on building united struggle with all those forces opposed  to the Dunkel draft. The draft, however, at the same time, terms  the opposition of Janata Dal, CPI [Communist Party of India] and  CPM [Communist Party of India-Marxist] to the Dunkel draft, as  only "nominal," and thus perhaps, excludes them from the purview  of joint action.    Asked to differentiate itself from the IPF [Indian People's  Front (leftist group)], and affiliate of the CPI M-L [Communist  Party of India-Marxist-Leninist] (Liberation), the AIPRF sources  point out that whereas IPF is an electoral outfit, the new  organisation will have no truck with parliamentary politics. It  may be noted that the CPI M-L (People's War), MCC and CPI M-L  (Party Unity), in fact, boycott elections.</p>

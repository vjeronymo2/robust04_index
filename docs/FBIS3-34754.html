'Arafat went to Cairo despite the Palestinian leadership's  decision to send a delegation headed by PLO Executive Committee  member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh and including Ahmad Quray' (Abu-'Ala'),  to be joined there by Nabil Sha'th, 'Arafat's adviser, and  Faysal al-Husayni from the occupied territories, as Mahmud  'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) refused to head the delegation, insisting on  his previous position, namely not to return to the negotiating  table until progress has been made and results produced in  "'Arafat's negotiations." [passage omitted]    According to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's sources, this solution  appealed to a number of PLO Executive Committee members, as it  saves 'Arafat's "face." 'Arafat was exposed to strong  criticisms during the Palestinian leadership's recent meetings  in Tunis because of the situation to which he has led the  negotiations. Well-informed sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  that the negotiations file is now full of ambiguity and the  issues have become confused as a result of 'Arafat's  interference, since he led the negotiations to the Davos  agreement, which ignores all previous agreements.    The sources criticize 'Arafat's practices and his  noncompliance with what was agreed by Palestinian negotiators in  the past. [passage omitted]    PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman al-Najjab has told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that huge and serious loopholes have emerged  in Palestinian negotiation performance. Numerous forces warned  about the danger of this even before the negotiations. And many  people expressed this inside the Central Council, which endorsed  the Declaration of Principles agreement.    Al-Najjab adds: "The most marked loophole is the  nonexistence of a body to refer to or an integrated negotiation  plan." Al-Najjab stressed that after the present negotiations in  Cairo the causes of these loopholes will be examined and ways of  tackling them explored.    He said that the only way out of the present situation in  the  negotiations is to return to what the Central Council decided,  namely the need to set up an authority for the negotiations,  draw up a plan for them, and select professional and political  capabilities to continue this process. And also to adhere to  the negotiation mechanism specified by the declaration of  principles agreement to secure the required agreements, whether  with regard to Gaza and Jericho, the transitional phase, the  final agreement, and so on.    Al-Najjab said that the Israelis feel that the time factor  is  in their favor, which is why they are resorting to  procrastination to gain more time and continuing their previous  policy before the Declaration of Principles agreement is  implemented.    Another Palestinian official, who asked to remain anonymous,  told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: The Israelis want now to consolidate  the new negotiation mechanism between 'Arafat and Peres, because  this mechanism gives more room to maneuver and play for time.  The official did not conceal that as a result of the mechanism  consolidated by 'Arafat, Israel is now in a better and more  comfortable position, so they are now in a position to step up  their conditions.

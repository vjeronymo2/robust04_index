			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN KILLS DAUGHTER, 8, HIMSELF  </P> <P> A Boyle Heights man despondent over breaking up with his wife returned home for  his birthday party Wednesday, then shot and killed his 8-year-old daughter  before turning the gun on himself in front of horrified family members,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Carlos Bernal, 43, and his daughter, Ruby, were pronounced dead at County-USC  Medical Center, each of a gunshot wound to the head.  </P> <P> Bernal's estranged wife, Mary Anne, and two other daughters saw Bernal shoot  himself, but were not hurt, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> "It's one of those sad, unfortunate things that happens," Lt. Richard Iddings,  a detective with the LAPD's abused child unit, said. "He had been very  despondent because of the breakup. . . . You can never judge what despondent  people will do."  </P> <P> Neighbors described the Bernals as a happy couple, with no outward signs of  trouble.  </P> <P> However, Mary Anne Bernal told detectives of "constant family disputes," but  did not elaborate, Iddings said.  </P> <P> The two split up a week or two ago, according to police and neighbors, and she  reportedly spoke of obtaining a restraining order to keep her husband away from  the two-story apartment building on Marengo Street where the family lived.  </P> <P> But Iddings said there was no indication that Mary Anne Bernal sought the  restraining order, nor had she begun divorce proceedings.  </P> <P> Carlos Bernal had been living with a friend in Eagle Rock since the breakup,  Iddings said. With Bernal's 43rd birthday coming on Wednesday, his wife invited  him to the apartment for a celebration. Someone had baked cupcakes.  </P> <P> The Bernals and their three children sat and chatted for an hour or so after he  arrived about 8:30 a.m., police said.  </P> <P> Then Carlos Bernal took 8-year-old Ruby into a back bedroom "to talk." Minutes  later, Mary Anne Bernal and the other girls heard a gunshot and rushed into the  bedroom.  </P> <P> "And they saw him put the gun to his head and shoot himself," Iddings said.  "That's when they found the 8-year-old."  </P> <P> It was not clear why Carlos Bernal, who police said used a .38-caliber handgun,  chose Ruby.  </P> <P> The other two children, 7 and 12, ran screaming from the apartment to an  interior patio area, neighbors said.  </P> <P> Police and ambulances arrived a short time later.  </P> <P> The Bernals managed the apartment building, which sits on a wide street facing  the San Bernardino Freeway. Neighbors said they were shocked by the shootings.  </P> <P> "They were a happy couple, always doing things with their kids," said a woman  who lives upstairs from the Bernals' unit. She asked that her name not be used.  </P> <P> A 9-year-old girl who used to play with Ruby said the child often spoke of  missing her father.  </P> <P> "She was his best, best daughter," the girl said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 7 Apr (TANJUG) -- Ivan Kovacevic,  spokesman of the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO], said in a  statement for TANJUG today that it is quite possible that  federal elections will be held, and added that he believes it  will be soon.    Kovacevic believes this will be "yet another trick" of the  Socialist Party of Serbia which, he believes, wants to retain  the existing, completely unjust electoral system.    "The Socialists would like to use this move to prolong their  authority, despite the fact that two-thirds of Serbia's citizens  do not vote for them," the SPO spokesman said.</p>

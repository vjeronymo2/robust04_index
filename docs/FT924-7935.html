			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Reduced losses at 600 Group HELPED BY a pension credit of Pounds 846,000, the 600 Group, the machine tool and mechanical handling equipment company, sharply reduced its pre-tax losses from Pounds 2.32m to just Pounds 97,000 in the six months to September 30. Mr Simon Powell, group finance director, said that the capital goods sector had seen little glimmer of any upturn except for 'the odd sign in small ticket stuff'. Although turnover eased to Pounds 49.4m (Pounds 50.7m) the company made trading profits of Pounds 489,000 (losses Pounds 1.18m). Losses per share were cut from 5.1p to 1.1p but the interim dividend is maintained at 1p with a Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 3.28m) transfer from reserves. Within the machine tool division, Colchester Lathe has now been amalgamated with TS Harrison, with the former's site being sold to Tesco for Pounds 12m net. Borrowings were paid down (giving the lower interest), but have since risen with relocation and redundancy costs. Gearing rose from 12 per cent at the March year-end to 20 per cent at September 30 but is expected by Mr Powell to reduce in the second half. Mr Powell said that for the first time in over two years orders received were exceeding sales. About 60 to 65 per cent of total sales go for export. Sir Jeffrey Benson, chairman, said that benefits were beginning to show from the previously implemented cost controls, restructuring and new product policy. Mr Powell said that in the half 234 jobs had been shed bringing the group total to 1,653. He said that two years ago the figure had been 2,800 and that virtually all the job losses had been in the UK.</p>

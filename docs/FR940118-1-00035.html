			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third mechanism for listing, included in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3), allows certain sites to be listed whether or not they score above 28.50, if all of the following conditions are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) of the U.S. Public Health Service has issued a health advisory that recommends dissociation of individuals from the release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;EPA determines that the release poses a significant threat to public health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;EPA anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use its remedial authority than to use its removal authority to respond to the release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these criteria, and pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA promulgates a list of national priorities among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. That list, which is appendix B of 40 CFR part 300, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) defines the NPL as a list of ``releases'' and as a list of the highest priority ``facilities.'' The discussion below may refer to the ``releases or threatened releases'' that are included on the NPL interchangeably as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.'' CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. A site may undergo CERCLA-financed remedial action only after it is placed on the NPL, as provided in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  EPA promulgated an original NPL of 406 sites on September 8, 1983 (48 FR 40658). The NPL has been expanded since then, most recently on October 14, 1992 (57 FR 47180).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPL includes two sections, one of sites being evaluated and cleaned up by EPA (the ``General Superfund Section''), and one of sites being addressed by other Federal agencies (the ``Federal Facilities Section''). Under Executive Order 12580 and CERCLA section 120, each Federal agency is responsible for carrying out most response actions at facilities under its own jurisdiction, custody, or control, although EPA is responsible for preparing an HRS score and determining if the facility is placed on the NPL. EPA is not the lead agency at these sites, and its role at such sites is accordingly less extensive than at other sites. The Federal Facilities Section includes those facilities at which EPA is not the lead agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Deletions/Cleanups  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA may delete sites from the NPL where no further response is appropriate under Superfund, as explained in the NCP in 40 CFR 300.425(e) (55 FR 8845, March 8, 1990). To date, the Agency has deleted 56 sites from the General Superfund Section of the NPL, most recently the Suffern Village Well Field, Village of Suffern, New York (58 FR 30989, May 28, 1993), Pesticide Lab, Yakima, Washington (58 FR 46087, September 1, 1993), LaBounty Site, Charles City, Iowa (58 FR 50218, October 6, 1993), Aidex Corporation, Council Bluffs, Iowa (58 FR 54297, October 21, 1993), Hydro-Flex Inc., Topeka, KS (58 FR 59369, November 9, 1993) and Plymouth Harbor/Cannon Engineering Corp., Plymouth, Massachusetts (58 FR 61029, November 19, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also has developed an NPL construction completion list (``CCL'') to simplify its system of categorizing sites and to better communicate the successful completion of cleanup activities (58 FR 12142, March 2, 1993). Sites qualify for the CCL when:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any necessary physical construction is complete, whether or not final cleanup levels or other requirements have been achieved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) EPA has determined that the response action should be limited to measures that do not involve construction (e.g., institutional controls); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The site qualifies for deletion from the NPL. Inclusion of a site on the CCL has no legal significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the 55 sites that have been deleted from the NPL because they have been cleaned up (the Waste Research and Reclamation site was deleted based on deferral to another program and is not considered cleaned up), an additional 162 sites are also in the NPL CCL, all but one from the General Superfund Section. Thus, as of October 1993, the CCL consists of 217 sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cleanups at sites on the NPL do not reflect the total picture of Superfund accomplishments. As of September 30, 1993, EPA had conducted 591 removal actions at NPL sites, and 1,734 removal actions at non-NPL sites. Information on removals is available from the Superfund hotline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

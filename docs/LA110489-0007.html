			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SENTENCES ZSA ZSA GABOR TO 3 DAYS IN JAIL FOR SLAPPING A COP  </P> <P> Zsa Zsa Gabor must go to jail for three days, pay $13,000 in fines, do 120  hours of community service for a misdemeanor.  </P> <P> Oliver North was convicted of three felonies, walked away with a slap on the  wrist, a small fine and 1,200 hours of public service. He too manipulated the  legal process and remains unremorseful.  </P> <P> When the judge insists on psychiatric evaluation as part of the parole that was  the final slap in the face for Miss Gabor. I do not condone Miss Gabor's  behavior but there seems to be a flaw in the justice system.  </P> <P> ROMAINE HOOPER  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

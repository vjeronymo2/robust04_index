			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Kurt Kister report: "Bill Clinton in a Thankless Role"] </F>   [Text] Washington, 21 Apr -- What seemed unthinkable two  months ago is now going to be attempted, it seems. The U.S.  President wants to extend the Sarajevo model to five other  cities in Bosnia which the United Nations declared as safe  zones. Gorazde is one of them, and yet another in a series of  live broadcasts of that city's bloody siege by the Serbs has  compelled President Clinton to assume once again a role he does  not like, that of a world leader. As far as Bosnian issues are  concerned, such a role is infinitely difficult and thankless,  also because the army of armchair strategists, Balkan experts,  and aerial warfare analysts immediately criticize any decision  as too late, too hesitant, too belligerent, or too dangerous.    It is not yet certain whether the NATO countries, especially  those with troops in Bosnia, will agree to an expansion of the  air forces' assignment. Just as uncertain is whether Moscow  really is prepared to take part in the possible bombing of even  those Serbian military facilities that do not pose a direct  threat to UN forces. After all, this possibility of bombing  forms the nucleus of the Sarajevo model: Unlike the case in  Gorazde so far, in Sarajevo NATO said that it would attack more  than just individual tanks or artillery pieces to provide  so-called air support for the blue helmets. NATO said it would  expand its targets to include anything that fires upon civilians  within a radius of 20 km of Sarajevo.    This certainly amounts to an escalation, because according  to  the Sarajevo model, air attacks do not serve tactical purposes  such as the protection of friendly troops, but strategic  purposes such as the protection of foreign civilians and forcing  a withdrawal by the attackers. But NATO is not just trying to  avoid a Gorazde-type massacre. It is also attempting to take  the side of one of the parties to the conflict. This is exactly  what many critics of the so-far hesitant NATO want.    Just as many people in Europe consider U.S. aerial attacks a  wonderful tactic, many in Washington believe in the lifting of  the arms embargo against Bosnia. The Senate has voted  four-fifths in favor of this, and more and more leading figures  are arguing that the United States should cancel the embargo, if  necessary without the approval of the United Nations or other  NATO allies. "Let the Bosnians defend themselves," they  suggest, meaning: "Then we will not have to be involved any  more."    Clinton is considerably more careful here. Although he has  been calling for a lifting of the arms embargo ever since he  took office, he only wants to do so together with the allies.  In the White House, people fear that if the United States makes  any moves on its own, it might suddenly be stuck with the  commitment to deliver weapons to the Bosnians, and possibly also  teach them how to use them, which would hardly be a reduction in  U.S. involvement. In addition, what can the United States do if  other countries unilaterally declare a lifting of arms  embargoes, for example those against Iraq or Libya?</p>

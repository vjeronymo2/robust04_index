			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT FOR THE SEDATE  </P> <P> The island of Ios ("Ios Offers Best of Cyclades Without the Crowds," July 16),  is not for the sedate or the faint of heart. Like Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., during  spring break, the island is home to the Greek definition of hedonism but  without the sunshine state's amenities.  </P> <P> Primarily, Ios attracts a young Scandinavian crowd that spends the summer  sewing its oats on the nude beaches and in the wild discos. Ouzo spills faster  and more abundantly than water and European rock music fills the nighttime air.  </P> <P> (The book) "Let's Go Greece '88" describes Ios as having "more counter-culture  types per square foot than any other place in the world." Such words should be  fair warning for those individuals whose oats have already been sown.  </P> <P> KATHERINE JANE BLEIFER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

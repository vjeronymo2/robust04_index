			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST;  </P> <P> SPRINTER WATTS SUFFERS ANOTHER INJURY  </P> <P> For the third time in three seasons, USC sophomore sprinter Quincy Watts has  suffered a leg injury.  </P> <P> Although the latest mishap -- a strained left hamstring incurred in last  Saturday's meet at USC's Cromwell Field -- does not appear to be as serious as  the previous two, it continues a disturbing trend.  </P> <P> As a senior at Taft High in 1988, Watts strained his right hamstring in a dual  meet. He strained the same muscle -- lower in the leg -- last season during a  workout and it ended his freshman season at USC.  </P> <P> "He's on a day-to-day basis right now," USC spokesman Gary Pine said. "He  definitely won't run at (the Mt. San Antonio College Relays) this week, but  they're hoping he'll be back for the UCLA dual (Apr. 28)."  </P> <P> Brad Williams, a 6-foot-4, 260-pound All-Marmonte League offensive lineman at  Camarillo High, said earlier this week that he will attend Princeton of the Ivy  League next fall. Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships.  </P> <P> Cal State Northridge has taken over the lead in the CCAA softball standings by  the slimmest of margins. The Lady Matadors' two-game sweep of UC Riverside last  week placed CSUN ahead of defending national champion Cal State Bakersfield by  .042 percentage points.  </P> <P> Northridge is 32-17 overall, 7-1 in CCAA play. Bakersfield is 31-4, 10-2, going  into Saturday's doubleheader showdown between the schools at Bakersfield.  </P> <P> The Cal Lutheran softball team (24-9-2), led by pitcher DeeAndra Pilkington, is  ranked 12th in the most recent NAIA poll and has clinched its fourth  consecutive regular-season District 3 championship. Pilkington, a senior, has  thrown seven consecutive shutouts against District 3 opponents and has not been  scored on in district play.  </P> <P> Howard Hilton, 26, formerly of Hueneme High and Oxnard College, was optioned  this week by the St. Louis Cardinals to the club's triple-A team in Louisville.  In his major league debut last week, Hilton pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings in  a 6-5 victory over Montreal. Hilton logged three innings this season, striking  out two.  </P> <P> Vince Plymire, a former state heavyweight champion at Moorpark College, lost a  15-0 decision to 1984 Olympic gold medalist Bruce Baumgartner on Thursday in an  opening-session match in the U. S. National Freestyle Wrestling Championships  in Las Vegas. Baumgartner is seeded first in the 286-pound class.  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan goes slow on commission change JAPAN, the only leading stock market nation where brokers' charges are still fixed, is about to take its first step towards the deregulation of trading commissions. An advisory committee is expected today to endorse a gradual liberalisation, starting with transactions of more than Y1bn (Dollars 8.4m). The measures are due to take effect from April next year. Transactions in excess of Y1bn make up 5 per cent of all trades among the big four securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and some 2 per cent for the top 10 second-tier brokers. The immediate impact of deregulation is thus likely to be minimal. The decision to go-slow on deregulation is seen as a victory for the securities industry, since the changes will have little impact on brokerages' returns. The brokers have argued that injecting competition into commission rates would lead to higher small-lot rates and drive individual and small-lot investors away from the stock market. Fixed brokerage commissions took most of the blame for the spate of stock scandals two years ago, when brokers were found to be underwriting the share losses of favoured clients. Supporters of deregulated commissions argue that price competition would have made this practice obsolete. The securities industry was outraged when the ministry of finance agreed to review fixed commissions, since the ministry had originally agreed with the securities industry that commissions would remain fixed but lowered to international standards. Deregulation of commissions would result in lower profits for the brokers. The advisory group will also recommend that the effects be carefully monitored, implying that full liberalisation may take longer than many critics of the system anticipated. Supporters of liberalisation, including institutional investors and some foreign houses, argue that fixed commissions help maintain Japan's brokerage oligopoly. But the securities industry contends that lower costs for institutional trading will result in lower costs for individuals. Liberalisation will hurt smaller houses, which rely heavily on client commissions; and an increase in large-lot transactions could mean greater risks for the bigger brokerages. The ministry of finance, the reluctant advocate of commission liberalisation, says an agenda for further deregulation is not yet set, due to the weakness of the stock market and heavy losses among smaller brokers. Although stock market weakness has forced the ministry of finance to scale down its plans for financial reform, an easing of the barriers between banking and the securities industry, together with interest rate deregulation, appears to remain an official priority.</p>

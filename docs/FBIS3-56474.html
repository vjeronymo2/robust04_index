Chubays Keeps His Status"]    [Text] The president has sharply thickened the plot of  appointments to a new cabinet by his edict yesterday under which  Anatoliy Chubays stays on as chairman of the State Committee for  the Management of State Property and is appointed deputy  chairman of the Russian Government "over and above the number of  deputies determined by the edict of 10 January."    Vladimir Mau, aide to Yegor Gaydar, says that the  confirmation of Anatoliy Chubays' status is in line with the  provision of the 1991 law on privatization stating that head of  the State Committee for the Management of State Property  simultaneously has vice premier status. Thus, the decision that  Chubays should keep his "privatization minister" office has  automatically led to keeping him in the number of government  leaders. Remarkably, his status is now in fact higher than that  of the other deputy chairmen because the president decided his  fate apart from the government as a whole. According to  unofficial information, Chubays's appointment came as a surprise  also for the head of the cabinet.    If one is to stay in the legal fairway, certain conclusions  can be drawn from the reservation that Anatoliy Chubays was  appointed "over and above" the quota of deputy government  chairmen set three days before that (four vice premiers). The  president's edict sets down a 4+N formula of the number of vice  premiers. This was also indirectly confirmed yesterday by  Vladimir Shumeyko, elected chairman of the Federation Council,  who let it be known that the Russian political Olympus is  inclined to regard leaders of the Federation Council as having  been "posted" from their former jobs. Thus he can nominally keep  his position of first deputy premier, in which case the number  of deputy chairmen grows to six.    Amending one edict by another increases chances of  unexpected  decisions. It has become known from sources close to the  president that another vice premier, Aleksandr Shokhin, is seen  as a candidate for the position of minister for cooperation with  CIS member countries, but he cannot keep his vice premier rank.  Shokhin's realm has already been dealt a painful blow. The  Russian Agency for International Cooperation and Development,  whose chairman he was, has been placed under the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations with the obscure status of a "state  institution." Neither does Shokhin have any chances whatever to  take the place of the premier's long-time friend Oleg Davydov as  head of the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. Shokhin,  tipped as a candidate for the head of the Duma's international  affairs committee, let it be known guardedly, after the Duma  session yesterday, that he did not rule out chances of filling  the post of minister for CIS affairs. His uneasiness about  whether this position would include vice premier rank was  betrayed by the persistently repeated idea that "relations with  the CIS should be directed by a specially trained vice premier."    It is not clear whether one more vice premier, Boris  Fedorov,  would be able to carry into effect his plans of control over the  entire financial sphere including the steering of the ruble rate  policy and the external debt problem. Fedorov announced a press  conference for 18 January (the composition of the government is  to be announced on 17 January) where he is expected to announce  whether he is happy with the position of finance minister which,  according to its status, has always measured up to that of a  vice premier.</p>

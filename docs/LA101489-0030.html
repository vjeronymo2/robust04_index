			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> MEET AT CAL POLY SLO COULD CLARIFY RANKINGS  </P> <P> Most coaches swear that they are not concerned with rankings, but Cal State  Northridge cross-country Coach Don Strametz is not one of them.  </P> <P> Although Strametz realizes that his team's performance is more important than  its ranking, he always wants to know where Northridge stands in the NCAA  Division II polls.  </P> <P> "I'm curious to see how other people view us," Strametz said. "That's always  interesting."  </P> <P> In this week's poll, the Northridge men are ranked sixth, the Lady Matadors  fifth. And although Strametz was pleased with the men's ranking -- their  highest during his 11-year tenure -- he said that the CSUN women were ranked  too highly.  </P> <P> After all, the Lady Matadors were two places ahead of California Collegiate  Athletic Assn. rival Cal State Los Angeles, even though the Golden Eagles  easily defeated them for the UC Riverside Invitational title two weeks ago.  </P> <P> "I don't know what they're basing it on, but they're off base right now,"  Strametz said. "We're not that good."  </P> <P> The picture could be clearer today when several of the top Division II teams  meet in the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Invitational.  </P> <P> San Luis Obispo, Air Force and UC Davis, the top three ranked teams, will meet  in the women's race, and five of the top 12 ranked teams, including  second-ranked San Luis Obispo, will battle in the men's race.  </P> <P> The others are Northridge, UC Riverside (ninth), UC Davis (11th) and Cal State  L. A. (12th).  </P> <P> Best defense: The Occidental football team is in first place in the Southern  California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, partly because of its  topsy-turvy defense.  </P> <P> The Tigers, 3-1 overall and 2-0 in SCIAC play, lead the conference in total  defense, allowing 268.8 yards a game.  </P> <P> Occidental is first in rushing defense, allowing just 107.5 yards a game.  However, the Tigers are last in passing defense (161.3 average).  </P> <P> Opportunity knocks: A rough road to the Western State Conference football title  might be a little smoother for the Glendale football team as a result of  Saturday's 17-17 tie between Bakersfield and Los Angeles Southwest.  </P> <P> Bakersfield, the defending national champion, also tied Glendale, 19-19. The  two ties are equivalent to a loss in the WSC standings. That leaves the door  open for teams such as Glendale and Moorpark, both of which are unbeaten in  conference play.  </P> <P> Glendale (2-1-1 overall, 2-0-1 in the WSC) will meet Santa Monica today before  opening division play against L. A. Southwest next week.  </P> <P> Things change: In 1971, Cal Lutheran defeated Westminster (Pa.), 30-14, to win  the National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics Division II football title. The  championship was the only NAIA football game to be nationally televised and  marked the pinnacle of Cal Lutheran's football fortunes.  </P> <P> Still a strong NAIA team, Westminster (5-0) is ranked No. 1 in Division II this  week. Cal Lutheran joined the NCAA Division II in 1984 and will drop to  Division III when its scholarship players have exhausted their eligibility. The  Kingsmen are currently 1-4.  </P> <P> Bradley tank: Moorpark's Freddie Bradley, named the Western State Conference  offensive co-player of the week, has moved up in state and conference  statistical rankings on the strength of his 191-yard, five-touchdown  performance against Pierce.  </P> <P> Bradley is the second-leading rusher in the WSC and 15th in the state with 417  yards. He has scored 60 points to lead state players, averages 50.7 yards a  kickoff return and leads the WSC in combined rushing, receiving and return  yardage.  </P> <P> Road overkill: In its first year of existence, the Moorpark women's soccer team  opened on the road with two tournaments and then kicked off its South Coast  Conference schedule with seven consecutive home matches.  </P> <P> Fine, but now Moorpark (10-1-1, 4-1-1 in league play) must go on the road for  eight consecutive conference matches before ending the season with a home match  against Bakersfield.  </P> <P> "I'm fairly upset about that," said Coach Daniel Ohayon, whose team won't play  at home for more than a month. "The league screwed us up. It builds too much  confidence, and then when we go into strange grounds, the players are lost."  </P> <P> Day off: A Cal Lutheran men's soccer game at Christian Heritage scheduled for  today was canceled because Christian Heritage dropped its program to the club  level.  </P> <P> The Kingsmen can use the time to regroup after a shocking 2-2 tie Wednesday  against Southern California College, which had the worst record of the 10 teams  in the NAIA District 3. Tuesday, Cal Lutheran will meet Westmont, which is tied  for No. 1 in the NAIA poll.  </P> <P> Gary Klein and staff writers Brendan Healey and John Ortega contributed to this  notebook.  </P></p>

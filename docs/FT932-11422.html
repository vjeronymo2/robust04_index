			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Major's EC policy puzzle: Europe After so many demoralising months of hard pounding over the notorious Maastricht Treaty, the British government has decided it is now safe to come up from the bunker and re-nail its tattered flag to the European mast. The ratification war is not yet won. But the end is near enough for the prime minister to believe he can and should re-affirm his support for the treaty. So he has started delivering some pro-European speeches, despite the undiluted hostility of a minority of his party, led by Lady Thatcher. So far it is not easy to detect the policy prescriptions in Mr Major's pro-European message. He is in favour of Britain's continued membership of the Community, because being outside would be worse; he believes Britain should be at the heart of Europe, whatever that may mean; but he does not have any positive agenda for where the EC should go next or what it should do. Mr Major is happy to express hostility to any form of centralism in Brussels. But for the rest, what we are getting is a message which is pro-European in tone, but without any discernible policy content. We should not be surprised. There was a time, in the distant past, when some people in the original six member states believed that Britain would eventually outgrow its innate scepticism, and come to understand, or even share, their commitment to the Community model of European integration. The reality of two decades of British membership has disabused them of this touching faith. The plain fact is that the British political establishment does not like the treaty, and does not care much for the Community either. And the depth of its aversion has emerged clearly in the Maastricht ratification debates. Ostensibly there is a large majority in Westminster in favour of the treaty. But the debate over the social chapter has exposed a deeper reality, because it has generated conditions in which quite different alliances can conduct a covert fight against the Community behind the cloak of opposing party ideologies. Objective reasons for Britain's Euro-scepticism are elusive. The UK economy is not radically different from other Community members. Whatever Mrs Thatcher's wishes, Britain is not like America: its social structures are similar to those of all other European countries, with highly developed networks of public welfare, health, education and social protection. Whatever its irrational reasons, it is manifest that the British political establishment is uncomfortable with the European ambitions of its opposite numbers on the Continent. Until last September, Mr Major pretended to have a European policy, in the formula: Pounds 1 = DM 2.95. Events showed this was just a slogan, built on a fantasy. Arguably, Mr Major needs a more solid European policy, and needs it urgently. Ratification of Maastricht is not the end of the story. Unless the exchange rate mechanism collapses completely, the other states will press forward. What will Mr Major say then? The negotiations to admit new members from EFTA cannot fail to re-open debate on the full gamut of Maastricht commitments. What will Mr Major say then? At the very least, enlargement must include more majority voting, and most likely a strengthening of the European Parliament. What will Mr Major say then? If he is not to be wrong-footed on such politically loaded policies, he needs to look for some issue where he can take a slightly more constructive stance. The obvious choice should be the foreign and security policy chapter in the treaty, because Britain has real assets: its diplomatic service, its professional army, its seat on the Security Council, its nuclear weapons. But the British establishment's conditioned reflexes jerk it three ways: the claims of European co-operation have tended to give way to great-power nostalgia or to vice-regal submission to the US. Bosnia has been a case in point. While the US stayed home, Britain and France worked hand-in-hand. When President Clinton threatened to get involved, Britain cranked round to get in line, regardless of the merits of the new US policy. This US whip-saw cannot be good, either for Europe or for Nato. Now there is a school of thought in Whitehall that Britain is under no urgent pressure to respond to the Community agenda. First, the programme for Economic and Monetary Union is in disarray. Second, some other member states are themselves in political difficulty; for example, Italy, Belgium, Spain. Third, there are major uncertainties over the costs of our social welfare systems. It would be difficult to deny the reality or the gravity of these problems. There is clearly a multi-faceted crisis of the European nation state; one facet is political corruption, as in France, Spain and, above all, Italy; another is the failure of the left-right political model, as in France; a third is the tension between the illusion of national sovereignty and the pain of regional solidarity. There is also the crisis of European competitivity, which shows up in the arguments over EMU, over the costs of the welfare state and the social chapter, and contradictory pressures between protectionism and trade liberalisation in the Uruguay Round negotiations. And then there is the crisis of strategic disorder - witness the disintegration of Russia and Yugoslavia. But anyone who argues that these crises exonerate Britain from coming to terms with the Community paradigm, and from finding a constructive European policy, is making a mistake. Unfortunately, it is the same mistake Britain has been making for 50 years.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Asylum seekers are dealt with fairly in UK Sir, Your editorial, 'Without charge' (October 19) about detention of asylum seekers contained a number of inaccuracies. May I set out the relevant figures in their context: 22,370 applications for asylum were made last year which is below the 1991 peak of 44,000 but well above the 1988 figure of 4,000. More than 90 per cent of asylum seekers are not genuine refugees under the 1951 UN Convention to which Britain adheres. Each application is considered carefully on its merits in accordance with that convention. Powers of detention under the Immigration Act 1971 are exercised only where there are good grounds for believing that the person will not comply with any conditions imposed, if released. Detention is authorised initially by a chief immigration officer - not by an immigration officer as you say - and is reviewed by an immigration service inspector within 24 hours. There are then monthly reviews at increasingly senior levels. I do not find it surprising that, in 22 of the cases referred to in the Amnesty International report, release was granted before the case was finally resolved. This is surely evidence in itself of the effectiveness of the reviews. You say 'some detainees (but not all) are eligible for bail'. Following changes made by the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, anyone refused asylum can appeal to independent appellate authorities and anyone who has appealed can apply for bail. It is not the case that immigration officers ignore their obligation to tell detainees of the reason for their detention. All detainees are told orally, in a language which they understand, of the reasons for detention. In addition, anyone who is refused entry or is being removed as an illegal entrant or is the subject of a deportation order is given notice in writing, setting out their rights of appeal and giving details of the free advice and assistance available to them. Britain complies with its obligation under international conventions to which it is a signatory. Our system has to deal fairly and promptly with genuine refugees and at the same time combat bogus asylum claims. Powers of detention are necessary in some cases. We seek to detain as few people as possible and less than 1.5 per cent of asylum seekers are currently detained. Detention is a necessary part of a policy of firm and fair immigration control.

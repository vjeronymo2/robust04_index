			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President-elect Roman Herzog by Klaus </F> Bresser and Klaus-Peter Siegloch in Berlin -- live]    [Excerpts] [Bresser] Congratulations on your election, Mr.  Herzog, and thank you very much for coming to us in this news  office so quickly after your reception. You have been elected  president by the representatives of the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] and large parts of the  Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP]. They represent one half  of the republic. What are you going to tell the other half now?    [Herzog] What I said in my brief acceptance speech: The  president has the task of representing all parties, all groups  of the population. I fully understand that one part of the  Federal Assenbly did not consider me the most suitable  representative of their views. However, as I have had to do and  liked to do over the past 10 years as a constitutional judge, I  will try to be there for everyone and, as it has been said,  stand above the parties and establish understanding where it is  necessary and possible, given the weak powers of the president.  [passage omitted]    [Siegloch] From politicians of the Social Democratic Party  of Germany [SPD], one hears that the president has been elected  against the desire of the population, which has been deduced  from many polls. Is this irritating?    [Herzog] It is indeed irritating, I must admit that.  However, you know, on the other hand, I must say that if we had  conducted a six-month presidential election campaign, I would  have been just as well-known [as SPD candidate Rau], and if I  had been as well-known as one of the leading SPD politicians  without such an election campaign, I would not have properly  fulfilled my previous office, whose main task it is not to  constantly appear in public. This was included in the  conditions, so to speak.    [Bresser] This election was characterized by party tactics  and power interests. This was the case already in past  elections. However, today this is particularly true in view of  the forthcoming Bundestag elections. If this election is now  contrary to the wishes of the majority of the people, does this  have consequences for you? For instance, if you run again for  president in five years, would you then advocate a direct  election by the people?    [Herzog] I have always been of the view -- and this is not  an ad hoc invention, as my latest comprehensive, printed  statement on this matter dates back to 1985 -- that two things  must be clarified if one wants to do that: First, the president  would have to have quite different powers in this case. A  president who conducts a six-month election campaign all over  the country and is then supported by more than half of the  people and their votes and who then notes that he has only the  few powers that the Basic Law gives him would simply not be able  to stand this psychologically.    [Siegloch] But would you want it? Would you want to be the  president elected by the people?    [Herzog] Yes, I would very much want that, but not for the  price that afterwards the powers are missing.    [Siegloch] The example of Austria would not convince you?    [Herzog] No, precisely that would not convince me.    [Siegloch] Thus, powers first and then popular election?    [Herzog] Yes, but I am not calling for the powers.    [Siegloch] And, therefore, not for popular election?    [Herzog] This is the essential point. Of course, one can  topple the Basic Law and establish a presidential democracy, as  in France or in the United States, but our parliamentary  democracy -- regardless of the bugs it occasionally shows -- has  basically worked well. Why should one now create a completely  new constitutional structure? And then, think of one thing. If  we four candidates had attacked each other in a real election  campaign all over the country for the past six months, how would  the person elected today by the people be able on 1 July to make  it clear to the people that he is there for everyone. This is a  completely different situation.    [Bresser] But the past few weeks have shown that the people  want such a popular election, that they do want it. Does one  not have to draw consequences from that, at least think about  whether one should change the Basic Law?    [Herzog] One has to discuss this rationally, also with the  people. I understand this quite well.    [Siegloch] Thus, the last word has not been spoken, in your  view? The matter must just be clarified?    [Herzog] I repeat: powers and popular election or no powers  and no popular election. At the moment, I really do not see any  reason to turn our entire constitutional system inside out just  because this is fashionable now.    [Siegloch] Very different men have held this office:  Theodor Heuss, Gustav Heinemann, and Richard von Weizsaecker.  Whom do you think you are closest to regarding the way you will  fulfill this office?    [Herzog] These are all very great names and it would be  difficult for me at the moment to compare myself with one of  them. Probably, the situation that we are facing can be best  compared with the one that Theodor Heuss was facing.    [Bresser] Why?    [Herzog] Under Theodor Heuss, the FRG was established anew;  it entered a very difficult international situation, and now we  are certainly in a far easier, but similar situation of  upheaval, as well as at the international level. This large  Germany is currently having problems, but must find a completely  new role in the world as soon as the problems are overcome,  which I do not doubt. I am not speaking about Bundeswehr  missions -- this matter has been sent to Karlsruhe and must be  decided there -- but I mean that quite in general. Of course,  this Germany, which is watched a bit suspiciously -- and rightly  so for obvious reasons -- currently needs a representative who,  similar to Theodor Heuss, shows -- also with a certain bonhomie  -- that Germany is now different than some textbooks say. I  mentioned the term easy-going before.    [Siegloch] Is this some kind of slogan for your office?    [Herzog] This is very important to me.    [Bresser] You are talking about being easy-going; you are  talking about bonhomie. But do you not also want to utilize the  leeway that the Basic Law -- and you participated in writing the  comment on the Basic Law -- leaves to the president? And where  would you prefer to use it?    [Herzog] This will not change. There is not anything new in  this field. The president has powers of decisionmaking in case  of a permanent government crisis, if the Bundestag is no longer  able to elect a chancellor with the chancellor's majority or  keep him in office. In this situation, the president has a few  powers of decisionmaking -- you know, appointing a minority  chancellor or dissolving the Bundestag and announcing new  elections, which cannot be repeated at will.    [Siegloch] All this might happen on 16 October.    [Herzog] Yes, of course, but all these are things that I  hope will not happen. Then there remains the power to check the  laws that must be signed as to their constitutionality. You  know how this was done by the previous president. Everyone used  this right once, if at all. This is quite correct because the  president can sign only an entire law or not sign it at all. If  he has constitutional reservations regarding one stipulation in  a long law, he will not be well-advised to refuse to sign the  entire law, but he will probably sign it -- as many of the  presidents expressly stated -- to make it possible to go to  Karlsruhe, because the Federal Constitutional Court can examine  an individual stipulation and, if necessary, declare it  unconstitutional and null and void. This will not change much,  and these are basically the president's powers. Anything else  involves representation, giving an example, and making speeches.  This is, in my view, the attraction of this office.    [Siegloch] Nevertheless, the relationship between the  chancellor and the president is watched relatively closely.  Helmut Kohl brought you into politics in Rhineland-Palatinate.  Will it be easier for him with you than with Richard von  Weizsaecker?    [Herzog] We will have to wait and see. I never analyzed the  relationship between Richard von Weizsaecker and Helmut Kohl so  thoroughly as some of your colleagues. I will wait and see. In  any case, I am my own man and no one's governor. [passage  omitted]    [Bresser] When you went into politics, you first went to  Bonn for Rhineland-Palatinate and then to Baden-Wuerttemberg as  cultural minister and later as interior minister. There you  were considered a very tough politician. You advocated....    [Herzog] You are warming up this story again!    [Bresser] Yes, this is part of your curriculum vitae. You  advocated rubber bullets against demonstrators and also tear gas  for the police as a weapon. Would you do that again today?    [Herzog] I would do both again, because of the  considerations I made at that time, which your colleagues did  not believe. It was always said that using a baton is a milder  method. If you have ever seen the use of a baton from both  sides' perspective, this is hand-to-hand combat. There is real  brutality there. In this case, the only way is to separate the  groups involved, including the police. This was the point of  this gas. The second matter was the rubber bullets. From the  very beginning, their use was intended only in cases in which,  according to police law, the police are permitted to use live  ammunition. Now, I ask you whether it can be justified to use  live ammunition in case of emergency, if there is a milder  method, namely rubber bullets, even though they are still  dangerous. I am still convinced that I was right about that. I  just was misunderstood.    [Bresser] You were understood as meaning that you wanted to  use these means against demonstrations in general. Now you are  obviously talking about people committing acts of violence.    [Herzog] This was said in this way at that time; I just was  not believed. This is really not my fault.    [Siegloch] For the public, there was quite a different  Herzog as a constitutional judge: Under your leadership, the  ban of a demonstration against the Brockdorf nuclear power plant  was lifted -- freedom of assembly also in those cases where  there is the risk that some people might abuse this right. Have  you become more liberal due to your experiences, or how would  you interpret this?    [Herzog] No one should rule out that a new task and a new  office also give him a new view on some problem. However, what  was decided in this ruling on Brockdorf was my policy as  interior minister in Baden-Wuerttemberg, this was the so-called  Stuttgart line, which consisted in not seeing a demonstrator as  an enemy right from the start, which consisted in saying: If  someone demonstrates peacefully, he has this right, even if  others are not peaceful.    I would like to put it as follows: As interior minister of  Baden-Wuerttemberg, I would not have issued the comprehensive  ban on demonstrations around the Brockdorf nuclear power plant  in the way this was done. And I have witnesses to that.    [Bresser] The liberals have recently criticized you with  considerable harshness because of your attitude on dual  citizenship. You retracted your statements afterwards. You  said that those foreigners who do not want to become Germans may  also stay in our country. However, then you stuck to your basic  attitude, which is: no dual citizenship. Is this not also  interference in politics, and would you continue this as  president?    [Herzog] Basically, no. These are statements that I made in  the Bundesrat 10 or 12 years ago. I must admit that a sentence  was left out in this interview because I was not paying  attention. By the way, if you read this interview, the  formulation of dual citizenship only in exceptional cases is  correct, but the exceptional case is mentioned right afterwards,  namely the second and third generation of foreigners. This is  not an exception in terms of numbers [sentence as heard]. One  must indeed discuss these matters. In my party, I have so far  been attacked because I have advocated dual citizenship under  certain circumstances. Of course, this must be discussed. Over  the past few weeks, I have had a very lively correspondence with  foreigners' associations and my attention has been drawn to  completely new problems, which are linked with ius soli, for  instance. I am quite open to that. However, I expressly repeat  that, even though I did not retract anything, I should have  noticed that this one sentence was missing.    [Siegloch] Originally, an eastern German should have become  president; a southern German, a Bavarian, now has become  president. You like to talk about different German tribes. Is  it not first necessary to have east and west grow together. You  briefly mentioned that in your acceptance speech. Will you  appeal to the west Germans' conscience more in the future?    [Herzog] First of all, it must be clarified in a relatively  broad discussion what must grow together and to what extent we  must grow together. I have repeatedly said that the idea that  there is a wall in the people's minds is partly linked with the  idea that all people, all Germans, must be identical. They have  never been that -- individuals have never been that nor have the  tribes. One can certainly not demand -- even if this is done in  the most intellectual newspaper articles -- of a group of 17 or  18 million Germans, like the ones in the new laender, who had  completely different experiences of life for 40 years than we  had, that they suddenly think in the same way as the Germans in  the west. This simply cannot be and does not need to be either.    This means, first of all, that we have to talk about the  extent to which we should and want to come together. Second, of  course, there are the basic problems that we have at the moment  -- namely that it is made clear to the western Germans, who have  to make great sacrifices for the reconstruction in the new  laender, that this is just the compensation for a more fortunate  fate that they had. For me it is very important that the  citizens in the new laender see, as I said before, that we need  them. They are contributing much of what we do not have in this  way. I just want to mention the economic sector: They have an  enormous knowledge of East Europe. Just think of their language  skills. At the moment, we do not need that very much, but this  may be different in two or three years.    [Bresser] In this matter and in others the president mostly  works through talking. Next year you will have to give a great  speech on 8 May 1995. What will this day, the end of World War  II, be for you: a day of liberation or a day of defeat?    [Herzog] I will certainly not give you this speech today.    [Siegloch] In your acceptance speech, you said that a casual  word may allay some tenseness. Now you have an opportunity to  do so. We would like to give you the beginning of a sentence  and ask you to complete it quite spontaneously.    [Herzog] Only if I can think of something.    [Bresser] Loving Germany....    [Herzog] I love only people. I can love the German people.    [Siegloch] A grand coalition in Bonn is....    [Herzog] ...probably the ultimate resort.    [Bresser] That the Germans deserve a permanent seat on the  UN  Security Council....    [Herzog] ...we should not fight for it, but we cannot avoid  our responsibility either.    [Siegloch] That the people should have more of a say in the  future....    [Herzog] ...I am for it, but one finally has to talk about  the issues that can be subjected to a referendum. I mostly  think of personnel decisions at the local level.    [Bresser] That a Bavarian becomes president for the first  time....    [Herzog] ...need not necessarily be bad.    [Siegloch] Anyone who takes politics too seriously....    [Herzog] ...probably also takes the rest of his life too  seriously and thus sometimes blocks his view of the truth.    [Bresser] Really important for me is....    [Herzog] Really important for me is that I feel everyday  that I have lived up to my tasks.    [Siegloch] Anyone who thinks that I am sociable fellow....    [Herzog] ...is free to do so.    [Bresser] I get quick-tempered if....    [Herzog] ...if I intend to do so. Normally, I am not  quick-tempered.    [Siegloch] Anyone who says that in the future, I have to  beware of what I am saying....    [Herzog] ...is right -- and you have been trying do that,  too -- but I am still rather satisfied with myself at the  moment. It is inherent in the office that has been transferred  to me today. This office must have a certain degree of dignity.    [Bresser] However, who wants to be understood by the  people....    [Herzog] ...who must speak quite clear German, in particular  -- I quote Kurt Tucholsky -- main clauses, main clauses, main  clauses.    [Siegloch] Being in the limelight....    [Herzog] ...is something that I have not always wanted.  However, I will manage.    [Bresser] Anyone who says that I am cool right down to my  heart....    [Herzog] ....does not understand me very well.    [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Herzog. In conclusion,  after such a day, are you a bit proud this evening?    [Herzog] If I say no, you will believe that I am flirting  with myself a bit. There is a certain satisfaction. Proud is  not the proper word. There is a certain satisfaction, but, you  know, it is an enormous challenge, and I must first see whether  I can live up to it.    [Bresser] Thank you very much, Mr. Herzog.</p>

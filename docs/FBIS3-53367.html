			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer, Navit </F> Zomer, and Washington-based correspondent Hayim Shibi]    [Text] Last night, a delegation of leading Israeli  economic figures arrived in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, for a  series of meetings.    The delegation includes Labor Knesset Member Rafi Edri; Dan  Propper, president of the Industrialists' Association; Dani  Gillerman, president of the Union of Chambers of Commerce; Klal  Director General David Vinshel; Eytan Sheshinsky (of Kur); Bank  Hapoalim Chairman 'Amiram Sivan; Mikha'el Federman of the Dan  hotels; Dov Lautman of the Delta textile company; and other  economic figures.    The delegation will hold meetings with the Moroccan prime  minister, the finance minister, the commerce and industry  minister, the agriculture minister, and other economic figures.  This is a reciprocal visit, returning a visit in Israel by a  Moroccan delegation.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres attribute great importance to the visit. They met the  members of the delegation prior to their departure, and Peres  told them: "The time has come for Israeli-Moroccan relations to  move forward a step, be open, and be anchored in open  agreements." Rabin added: "Economic ties between Israel and  Morocco constitute a practical expression of the fruits of  peace."    Hayim Shibi adds: Syrian businessmen have been invited to  attend a meeting with Israeli entrepreneurs in Washington in  February. The Syrians have not yet responded to the invitation.  Entrepreneurs from the Middle East are expected to attend the  meeting, in which the U.S. Commerce Department is involved.</p>

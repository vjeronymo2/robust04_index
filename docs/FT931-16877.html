			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Life in the Single Market: Corporate America takes a long view on EC - On the outside looking in, recession in the Community worries its trade rivals EUROPEANS may be going through collective jitters about the future, but American businesses with interests in Europe have no such doubts. That, at least, is the message from a straw poll of leading US executives on their outlook for investment in Europe. Last autumn's currency crisis and the difficulties over the Maastricht treaty may be shaking the EC to its core but it does not appear to daunt US corporate investors. They take the long view. What really worries them is the recession gripping several European economies. But even this gloomy outlook is not making them alter their capital spending plans dramatically. The recession, and the recovery, have already been factored into a long-term view of a market which is larger than the United States and remains extremely attractive. Mr John Hunter, president of Coca-Cola's international division, says his company is heavily committed to both western and eastern Europe. It has invested Dollars 3bn in western Europe, including Dollars 450m alone in the now unified eastern regions of Germany and a further Dollars 1bn of capital in central and eastern Europe. 'We are bullish on Europe. I think that whatever doubts there might be about the future of the EC, these are things that will be handled in due course and will not cause us any worry. We are in any case handling things on a country-by-country basis,' Mr Hunter said. Coca-Cola, in line with many other US companies, is not daunted by the prospect of a two-speed Europe dominated by Germany and France. 'Regardless of what happens we still go to market day in and day out,' Mr Hunter added. Mr Richard Braddock, who resigned recently as president of Citicorp, the biggest US bank, said Europe's appeal as an investment destination remains. 'To me the core fact is that Europe, in aggregate, is a marketplace some 50 per cent larger than the US. Anyone who had the simplistic view that Europe would come quickly together without the need to differentiate by market or culture was mistaken.' At American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T), which has an estimated Dollars 2bn invested in Europe, there were fewer than 50 employees in Europe a decade ago. Today there are 25,000. Mr Randall Tobias, AT&amp;T's vice chairman, dismissed any notion of changing his company's plans because of the difficulties over Maastricht. 'Quite frankly my view really has not changed at all. 'We have taken a very long term view and I think what is happening now is an almost inevitable set of very difficult issues that can be expected - monetary issues, nationalism, defence and security. I think it is inevitable that there should be some bumps in the road along the way. It won't be easy, but I am as optimistic as I was two years ago.' Mr Jack Quindlen, chief financial officer of Du Pont, the leading US chemicals company currently awaiting final approval for a deal to swap nylon and acrylic assets with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), said he never thought unification would be easy. 'I am not surprised at the difficulty Europe has had in getting Maastricht approved - given what they are trying to accomplish.' Mr Quindlen advises his European counterparts to examine the early federal history of the US. 'When you think of the first 50 or 100 years of the Supreme Court, it was spent deciding cases about who owned the rivers and who controlled commerce between the states. 'Why should European unification be easier? We still see Europe as a very large and attractive market and nothing has changed.' Mr J. Dennis Bonney, vice chairman of Chevron, the fourth biggest US energy group, said his company had major UK investments in the North Sea, totalling several hundred million dollars. But the stalled unification process had not had any significant effect on investment. 'We continue to view all of Western Europe as a favourable environment for investing.' Mr Art Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, said the recent setbacks to unification had modified his view of Europe, but not dramatically. 'Certainly we are looking at a weak economic environment and a slowdown in unification. That means tactical things have changed, but the outlook has not. Chase has more than Dollars 5bn of assets in Europe and we will be looking at Europe as a crucial part of our global strategy,' Mr Ryan said. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley, the investment bank, says there is more caution about investment but this is due to worry about the economic outlook rather than the problems of unification. 'Our own view is that the fundamental trend is still very much in place,' he said. 'We will see important steps toward integrating Europe and we have not changed our long-term view.' Some on Wall Street even see Europe's problems as an opportunity. Mr James Harmon, chairman of Wertheim Schroder, the investment bank, said the next few years would be 'a window of opportunity for American corporate and individual investors because there will be significant restructuring of European businesses, plus privatisation'. These will depend upon capital infusion from external sources and US capital is clearly both perceived and in substance available for playing a major role in this process.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Arkla Companies <FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>  oppose any Index. They assert the justification given for the Index (that it is needed so capacity buyers can locate available capacity) is unsupported. They argue that this function is satisfied by the firm shipper's incentive to release capacity and potential buyers' ability to place ``want ads'' advertising their interest in acquiring capacity. If firm shippers, not already posting firm capacity, fail to respond to a ``want ad,'' the Arkla Companies maintain the capacity holder is unlikely to be interested in releasing capacity. Further, they assert that small users (who are alleged to be at an information disadvantage to large users) would not likely be sophisticated enough to manipulate the data on the thousands of contracts electronically available through the Index. If the Commission does require an Index, they maintain the Commission should eliminate its Part 284 reporting requirements and permit the pipelines to charge a fee for the use of the Index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ANR Pipeline Company, Arkla Energy Resources Company, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation, and Minnegasco.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public notice of these filings was given on March 3, 1994, and the National Registry and PEC Pipeline Group filed comments supporting Group 1's proposal containing the nine data elements. The National Registry contends the information on receipt and delivery point MDQs is needed so the market can be aware of receipt and delivery point capacity that can be acquired through capacity release. It points out that many pipelines allocate greater firm receipt and delivery point capacity than they do mainline capacity and shippers may want to acquire the receipt or delivery point capacity independently of mainline capacity. <FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>  In response to those opposing disclosure of receipt and delivery point information, the National Registry contends that capacity information should not be considered proprietary. It also argues that disclosure of receipt points is unlikely to reveal a purchaser's gas purchase strategy, since it does not disclose pricing, duration, or delivery conditions and, in most cases, even the supplier could not be divined from the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 41 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, it asserts that a replacement shipper (having obtained a package of mainline capacity) and using a particular point as an alternate point may want to acquire firm rights at that point from another shipper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PEC Pipeline Group supports the Group 1 proposal because this option actually will reduce costs by eliminating the duplicate reporting requirements for firm transportation contracts. It points out that the information required by the Index is essentially the same as is now required to be filed in the initial and subsequent reports under Part 284, so no additional costs for gathering the information are created by the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the Group 1, more inclusive, proposal has significant merit, and the Commission is very interested in pursuing this proposal further. The proposal provides useful information to the market about capacity, while also setting the stage for reducing filing burdens on pipelines and streamlining the Commission's reporting requirements. The Group 2, more limited, proposal is not as attractive because, without receipt and delivery point information, it would not reduce filing burdens. Moreover, information on receipt and delivery points would be of value to those seeking releasable capacity and disclosure of such capacity information is not confidential, since it presently is disclosed publicly through the initial and subsequent reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission, however, is unsure about some details of the proposal. For example, as framed, it would eliminate the initial and subsequent reports for firm and interruptible transportation, but would provide only information about firm transportation in the electronic Index. The proposed Index would be updated only when a new contract was written or upon the filing of a section 4 rate case, whereas the subsequent reports now must be filed whenever a material change in the contract occurs. The proposal states that the Index would be available in downloadable form, but does not specify the format for the download (EDI or another format) nor whether shippers will have access to the information in other forms. In addition, the proposal does not discuss how the information will be archived in the event access to historical data is needed. The Commission staff and the Working Group, therefore, should work to develop a final proposal to be provided to the Commission by September 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Business Practice Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Order No. 563, the Commission concluded that standardization of business transactions unrelated to capacity release should be the next step in the standardization process. Working Group 3 had been considering such standards and had identified 33 high priority items, of which ten were considered most critical. <FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>  The Commission found that standardization of these ten, or most of them, provided a good departure point for this effort. The Commission stated that the Working Group should propose an appropriate implementation schedule for the ten identified data elements. The Working Group also was to continue its efforts to identify which of the remaining 23 high priority data elements, as well as any others, require standardization and propose a schedule for implementation of standards for these elements as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 42 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ten elements were: timely flowing volume; timely volume allocation reports; predetermined allocations and shipper ranking; imbalance status; customer scheduled receipts and deliveries; customer specific curtailment/interruption information; customer specific operational flow orders; daily nominated volume acknowledgement; customer penalty status; and input and modify gas nominations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

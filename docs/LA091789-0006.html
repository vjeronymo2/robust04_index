			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GODFATHER'S SON;  </P> <P> HIS FATHER ONCE RAN THE L.A. MOB. TODAY, TONY BROOKLIER WALKS THE THIN LINE  BETWEEN HIS UNDERWORLD ROOTS AND A PROSPEROUS LAW PRACTICE.  </P> <P> AS A CHILD, he would dream the same dream over and over, until the dreadful  image would tease the backs of his eyelids even by day: He and his father are  walking along a road in the early evening darkness when, out of nowhere, a pair  of headlights pierces the horizon. The two points of light grow monstrously  large; the dull whine of an engine becomes a roar. The boy jumps in front of  the father and, with the pounding cylinders only inches away, grabs the car's  bumper and heaves the entire machine to the side of the road. The father sighs  quietly. The boy stands trembling. And, in the distance, two more headlights  appear.  </P> <P> "It was all in the wrists. Timing," explains Anthony P. Brooklier, who at 43 is  now one of Los Angeles' most successful criminal lawyers and supposedly immune  from childhood bogymen. But the image he has come to call simply "the dream"  keeps nudging back at odd hours, perhaps because it has become a leitmotif for  much of his life.  </P> <P> He is the Godfather's son. He is the boy from suburban Anaheim who grew up the  son of Dominic Brooklier, onetime powerful boss of La Cosa Nostra in Los  Angeles. He is the high school football star who played catch in the back yard  with Aladena (Jimmy the Weasel) Fratianno, a Mafia hit man who has confessed to  at least five contract murders. Brooklier is the young lawyer who left his job  as a deputy state attorney general to defend his father against serious  criminal charges, only -- unlike the boy in the dream who fended off the  onrushing car -- to watch the aging Mafia don die in prison.  </P> <P> There is probably no one in the Los Angeles legal community who has quite the  mystique of Tony Brooklier, a tall, perfectly coiffed Italian-American who has  somehow managed to straddle the gap between a modern, successful criminal  defense practice and the remnants of an underworld heritage that is centuries  old.  </P> <P> The mystique has to do with more than the Hugo Boss pinstripe suits, more than  the front table at Giuseppe that he frequents with Hollywood and reputed  underworld luminaries, more than the quick, evasive joke that is elicited  whenever anyone asks him about the family business. ("If I told you, I'd have  to kill you," he once muttered to an inquiring reporter.) Through it all, there  is the nagging sense that the consigliere image is cheerfully cultivated,  artfully crafted -- and, like most successful illusions, rooted somewhere in  fact.  </P> <P> Brooklier, a partner in the small Beverly Hills law firm of Marks &amp;  Brooklier, has built a respected practice, one that ranges beyond organized  crime, defending accused white-collar criminals, cocaine barons, corrupt public  officials, stock swindlers, even former law-enforcement agents. But Brooklier  -- along with his longtime law partner Donald B. Marks -- is unquestionably the  man the Los Angeles mob calls first when there's trouble with the law.  Brooklier has handled at least a part of virtually every case brought to  federal court by the Los Angeles Strike Force on Organized Crime in the past 10  years.  </P> <P> It was Brooklier who, in a 1987 stolen-securities case, won an acquittal for  Michael Rizzitello, described in numerous court documents and government  reports as one of the most powerful organized-crime figures in Southern  California today. It was Brooklier who got Robert (Fat Bobby) Paduano, whom  state attorney general's reports describe as a Mafia associate, acquitted of  stock-swindling charges in 1986. And it was Brooklier who helped lead the plea  negotiations last year that led to unexpectedly lenient sentences for most of  the Peter J. Milano crime family.  </P> <P> Now, in one of the most important organized-crime cases to go to trial here in  several years, Brooklier will defend Rizzitello in Orange County Superior Court  on charges that Rizzitello fired three bullets into the head of Santa Ana  nightclub owner Bill Carroll, who had allegedly been resisting the mob's  attempt to muscle in on club revenues. (The trial was scheduled to begin  tomorrow.)  </P> <P> "This is for not letting us eat," Rizzitello is alleged to have snarled as he  fired the gun from the back seat of a car one night in 1987 while the driver,  co-defendant Joey Grosso, allegedly held Carroll down.  </P> <P> The nightclub owner was permanently blinded but survived. For 18 months, he  refused to say who had shot him and why, but finally, when prosecutors agreed  to dismiss unrelated fraud charges against him, Carroll identified Rizzitello  and Grosso as his attackers. Brooklier says he expects to prove that  law-enforcement officials, desperate to get Rizzitello behind bars, put Carroll  up to fingering the longtime reputed Mafia figure. He also says he'll suggest  who did shoot Carroll, and why Carroll was too confused -- or afraid -- to  identify his real attacker.  </P> <P> Only a few of the city's most hardened criminal investigators still voice  suspicions about Brooklier's background as the son of a former Mafia boss. Most  top prosecutors say Brooklier is an energetic, highly principled attorney who  has shrewdly capitalized on his heritage to cash in on what, with the Justice  Department's sweeping crackdown on the mob over the past decade, has been a  lucrative field of law.  </P> <P> "He certainly knows those kind of guys come to him, and he represents them, and  he makes money off them," says James Henderson, the former federal prosecutor  who successfully tried Dominic Brooklier in 1980. "Moreover, the reason they  come to him has something to do with who his father was. He's Dominic  Brooklier's son. They probably feel he can be trusted more than other lawyers  they know." But Brooklier, Henderson says, "bends over backward" to allay any  suspicions that he is the mob's representative at the courthouse.  </P> <P> Aging mob boss Dominic Brooklier was Tony's initiation into the high-stakes  world of criminal defense law, seeking his son's help to fight the first of two  massive federal indictments for extortion, racketeering and contract murder  returned against him and his lieutenants just three years after Tony graduated  from law school in 1971.  </P> <P> The second indictment led to a 1980 trial, during which the young lawyer helped  cross-examine one of his childhood friends and stood before a U.S. district  judge in a tearful plea for his father's freedom. It is something that  Brooklier over the years has refused to publicly discuss.  </P> <P> But gradually, in a series of interviews during the past several months,  Brooklier for the first time revealed the details of his unusual childhood,  growing up in Orange County as the son of a seemingly ordinary car dealer who  authorities say was inducted into the criminal world's most secret society, an  affectionate father who worried about his sons' grades at school -- and a man  so powerful and revered that conversation would stop when he walked into a  room.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it was," Brooklier says. "I saw it when I was 5 years old.  My father could walk into a place, and for whatever reason, the room would  stop. It was as if every eye was on him. He just had an incredible charisma in  a very subtle way. He wasn't loud, he wasn't fast-talking, he was understated.  But men respected my father."  </P> <P> FOR DOMINIC Bruccoleri, born in 1913 just after his parents arrived from  Palermo, Sicily, surviving in Detroit's crowded Italian neighborhoods depended  not on how fast you talked, but how smoothly. He picked up English by the time  he was 8, along with the anglicized family name, "Brooklier," and became a whiz  at numbers by analyzing odds and making bets at the horse races.  </P> <P> Dominic made his way the way every other kid on the streets made his way:  hustling. Setting up pins at the bowling alley. Dipping into the till when the  opportunity presented itself. Charging guys for not being hassled when they  tried to park with their girlfriends outside. But all that changed when  Brooklier, as he always told it, took the rap for some older guys for robbing a  bakery in Toledo and went off to the Ohio State Penitentiary.  </P> <P> He spent the first 48 hours in a cell so small he couldn't even sit, and was  repeatedly beaten and antagonized by a guard for so long that one day, in a  rage, he heaved the sentry over the side of the third-tier cellblock. The guard  survived, but Brooklier got an extra several years. While waiting it out, he  befriended Fratianno, who was serving 10 to 25 years for attacking and robbing  a bookmaker behind on his tribute payments.  </P> <P> Eventually, both of them ended up in Los Angeles at the beginning of what would  become the notorious Sunset Wars of the late 1940s and early 1950s, when  gangster Mickey Cohen, the West Coast's legendary mob chieftain, was struggling  to hold on to the city's gambling and loan-sharking rackets against a veritable  siege of Italian upstarts -- among them, Fratianno and Brooklier.  </P> <P> On July 20, 1949, Cohen and a few friends were emerging from a post-midnight  supper at Sherry's Restaurant when a flash of gunfire erupted from behind a  nearby billboard. Cohen and three others were hit; one of Cohen's top thugs was  killed, but the rest survived.  </P> <P> Although the shooting was never officially solved, Fratianno years later in his  memoir, "The Last Mafioso," said Brooklier had been one of the two gunmen.  </P> <P> At the time, Brooklier was married -- to the former Frances McBride, a woman  Tony describes as "an Irish Lucille Ball" -- and had started a family and  settled down in Monterey Park. "We led a very 'Ozzie and Harriet' life," Tony  says. "I kid you not."  </P> <P> Well, not entirely. There was the time in the middle of the Sunset Wars when,  fearing retaliation from Cohen's henchmen, Brooklier packed his wife,  3-year-old Tony and his baby brother and a bodyguard on a plane to hide in  Texas until things cooled off. By the time he was 6 or 7, Tony remembers  sensing that something wasn't quite right about his father, "like maybe  something bad had happened to him once."  </P> <P> "Maybe I'd overheard something, but I started asking my mother questions," he  says. "She was evasive, which made me more curious, so I'd just ask more  questions. And I think, just to lay the cards on the table, my father just told  me. You know, 'Just shut the kid up; let's tell him the truth.' " He told his  son about the years he had spent in the penitentiary, about how he had thrown  the guard over the rail and why, "and that he didn't want that for his  children," Tony recalls.  </P> <P> The elder Brooklier, Tony says, was always direct with his children. When an  indignant nun threw Tony out of a fourth-grade Catholic-school class in Los  Angeles for questioning the doctrine of original sin -- the idea that a baby  who died without being baptized was irreversibly bound for purgatory -- he was  alled into the principal's office to face his father and an alternative: Either  apologize to the nun in front of the class or be expelled.  </P> <P> "I had told the nun that this couldn't be true," he said. "She said it was  true. I said it wasn't fair. She looked peeved and said something like, 'Life  is unfair.' So I said, 'Then it's B.S."  </P> <P> Brooklier took his son out of the earshot of the principal and sat down. "What  are you going to do?" he asked.  </P> <P> "I don't know," Tony replied. "What do you think?"  </P> <P> "It's up to you."  </P> <P> "You won't be mad no matter what I do?"  </P> <P> "No, I won't be mad," Brooklier said.  </P> <P> At that point, Tony decided he had been right to begin with. It was unfair.  </P> <P> "I think it's B.S., too," his father replied. Tony was enrolled in public  school near the family's new home in Anaheim.  </P> <P> One late night just a few months later, the stillness was broken by a knock on  the door. Tony and his two brothers were in their pajamas watching television,  and Tony got up to see who was there.  </P> <P> "I go to the door, there's like 15 cops with their guns drawn," he recalls. "I  say, 'What do you want?' I say, 'Who are you?' They say, 'We're the police. Is  your father home?' I say, 'You wanna arrest him?' They say, 'Yes.' I say, 'Do  you have a warrant?' So the cop says, 'What are you, his lawyer?' "  </P> <P> The officers burst into the house and grabbed Brooklier on a complaint alleging  attempted extortion. "Have you ever seen anybody arrested?" Tony says, shaking  his head. "It's traumatic to see somebody get arrested, even if you don't know  them, but especially to see your father like that, at gunpoint. I mean, I'd  never seen a gun before in my life."  </P> <P> The charges were later dropped, but the bitter memory lingered. At school,  classmates had seen the elder Brooklier's photograph in the newspaper with the  word "Mafia" next to it, and Tony heard about it the next day, over and over.  "I had problems," he admits. "But I trusted my father, and I believed in him so  much that I made myself be above that. And I stood up for him. The way I saw  it, it was my privilege that he was my father."  </P> <P> Brooklier took over his own used-car dealership in Maywood, and Tony went to  work for him after school, washing cars on the lot. FBI agents frequently  monitored Brooklier's meetings with organized-crime figures at the dealership  and at nearby restaurants, but what Tony remembers about those days are the  long talks they'd have, the way they'd pass the time between customers.  </P> <P> The elder Brooklier had left school after the third grade, but they played a  game in which Tony looked up the most obscure word he could find in the  dictionary and asked his father to define it. "I think, without fail, he could  tell you what it was," he says. "He had a lot of time when he was young, you  know, so he constantly read."  </P> <P> Tony says he never knew whatever else his father might have been involved in at  the time. Later, much later, Brooklier would talk with his son obliquely about  "this thing" -- the way in which Mafiosi in the United States, if they talk  about it at all, refer to their organization, La Cosa Nostra: "this thing of  ours." Mostly, Tony says, his father led him to believe that "this thing" was  in his past.  </P> <P> But Fratianno, in his memoirs and in a recent interview, said that Brooklier  even then was working as a soldier in the struggling Los Angeles crime family  headed by Nick Licata. The two of them had been "made" as Mafiosi together in a  ceremony in a small Los Angeles winery, Fratianno said.  </P> <P> Brooklier was becoming more and more powerful within the family by the time  Tony graduated from Savanna High School in Anaheim in 1964 and got a  congressional appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. Brooklier, Tony says, had  always been "amazed" at the A's he and his brothers earned at school. "You have  to consider the fact, here's a guy who when I was 15 was delighted that I  didn't have any felony convictions."  </P> <P> Tony was determined to become a Navy fighter pilot. Brooklier flew back with  his son to Annapolis for a day of touring, surveying the plight of the  midshipmen "plebes" at the hands of their upperclassmen. "I feel like I just  dropped him off at the joint," he remarked to his wife when he got back.  </P> <P> Midway through Tony's first year at the academy, a national report on organized  crime identifying Brooklier as a high-ranking member of La Cosa Nostra in Los  Angeles received national publicity. One of the commanders called Tony into his  office. Tony didn't have to resign, he told him, but he should not expect to  make a successful career with the Navy, either. "You know, 'You come up for  advancement, who's going to get passed over?' It was a real shock to me. There  I was, real proud to be part of the United States Navy, and all of a sudden,  I'm not a midshipman anymore, I'm the son of a Mafia chieftain -- boom."  </P> <P> Tony quietly resigned from the academy, but by then it didn't seem to matter.  He had already decided to go into law and enrolled at Loyola University and,  after that, at UCLA law school. "I wanted to put myself in a position to help  my father," he explains. "Because I sensed when I was a kid what was going to  happen. It's a thing all kids live with, you know -- your parents will get  divorced, they'll get hurt, they'll die. But that wasn't my fear. My thing was,  see, I was so taken about what my father told me happened to him when he was a  kid (in prison), I was so emotional about that, that I . . . was never going to  let it happen again."  </P> <P> That, he figures, is where the dream came from, the one about hurling away the  cars that were bearing down on his father. And that vision came to life late  one night in 1974, while he was still with the state attorney general's office.  Dominic Brooklier and several of his lieutenants had been indicted in a plot to  extort money from bookmakers, loan sharks and pornographers.  </P> <P> Of 12 men indicted, Brooklier was the only one who had not surrendered by the  time he knocked on his son's door at 2 a.m.  </P> <P> "You heard the news, I guess," Dominic Brooklier said quietly.  </P> <P> "Who's going to represent you?" Tony asked.  </P> <P> His father looked at him and smiled. "You are, of course."  </P> <P> Tony pointed out that he was only a few years out of law school, and hardly  equipped to take on a racketeering case against a man accused of being  under-boss of an organized crime family.  </P> <P> "Nothing like starting at the top," Brooklier replied.  </P> <P> With that, Tony ordered his father into the car, and the two drove all night  from Sacramento to Los Angeles. He had to ask someone where the federal  courthouse was. Surrendering his father to federal marshals, Tony sat down with  the prosecutor on the case, veteran organized-crime strike-force attorney James  Twitty. "How many indictments are there?" the young lawyer asked, trying to act  knowledgeable.  </P> <P> "Why, there's only one indictment, Mr. Brooklier. Your father is charged in 11  counts of that one indictment." Twitty paused a moment. "Is this your first  criminal case?"  </P> <P> Eventually, all 12 defendants entered guilty pleas under a rarely used legal  provision that technically allowed them to continue to maintain their  innocence. Brooklier was sentenced to 20 months in prison. Virtually the entire  family was behind bars just after Licata, the family boss, died at the age of  77. When Brooklier emerged from prison in the mid-1970s, it was to take over as  Mafia boss for all of Southern California.  </P> <P> AS DOMINIC Brooklier was leaving prison as a new Godfather, the FBI was gearing  up for a long-range sting operation designed to put the Mafia in Los Angeles  out of business for good. Two undercover agents set up a phony pornography  business in Van Nuys, then leaked word that it might be a good target for a mob  shakedown. Frank (the Bomp) Bompensiero, a Mafia capo in San Diego who had been  informing for the FBI, spread the word.  </P> <P> By the time the mob discovered it was a setup, most of the Mafia's top  lieutenants had been secretly recorded extorting the undercover agents. And on  the night of Feb. 10, 1977, someone retaliated. Bompensiero's body was found in  a pool of blood.  </P> <P> When the 20-count federal indictment came down charging Brooklier and four  reputed lieutenants with masterminding both the pornography shakedown and  related scams and obstruction of justice in connection with Bompensiero's  murder, Fratianno, who had become the government's star Mafia witness,  testified that Brooklier had put out the contract on Bompensiero.  </P> <P> Again, Brooklier asked his son to represent him -- this time with experienced  defense lawyer Alvin Michaelson.  </P> <P> "I was in a very touchy situation," Brooklier explains. "This is my father, and  if I'm going to represent him effectively, I have to know what happened. And he  told me, he said, 'I promise you, I swear to you, I had nothing to do with  this.' He said, 'A couple of the other things, in terms of the conspiracies to  extort, I may have a problem with that, OK? But I swear to you. . . .' He had  nothing to do with Bompensiero. And that reassured me. Then, I felt that I  could do it, with a clean conscience. I couldn't have done it, and I wouldn't  have done it, if I'd thought he was guilty. But my father never lied to me."  </P> <P> Tony believed that Fratianno was lying about Brooklier's part in the murder to  cover up his own role; he prepared an exhaustive cross-examination to expose  Fratianno as an unreliable witness.  </P> <P> At the height of the two-month trial in 1980, Tony's law partner, Donald Marks,  grilled Fratianno for days, exposing a few crucial inconsistencies between his  testimony at trial and what he had said in his memoirs. Fratianno shrugged them  off to bad memory.  </P> <P> Then it was learned that Arizona police had discovered hand-scrawled notes in  exiled mob boss Joseph Bonanno's garbage can in Tucson, Ariz., five days after  Bompensiero's killing. The notes, written in Italian and English, said: "Call  Turi (the nickname of his son, Salvatore), PM. Tell Turi -- Thursday night. Con  Semiautomatica. Scanzalora (corta) 22. Che no fa tanto rumore." Translated, the  note said, "Tell Turi -- Thursday night, with a semiautomatic, gun (short) 22,  that doesn't make much noise."  </P> <P> Bompensiero had been killed on a Thursday night, with a .22-caliber weapon  equipped with a silencer.  </P> <P> Together with doubts about Fratianno's testimony, the note planted enough doubt  in the jury's mind about who had killed Bompensiero to acquit Brooklier and the  others on the charges related to the Bompensiero murder. Brooklier was  convicted on 11 other lesser counts of extortion and racketeering.  </P> <P> Michaelson handled the closing argument in the case, but at Brooklier's  sentencing two years later, it was Tony who stood at his father's side before  U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter Jr., calling his father at first simply "my  client."  </P> <P> "Mr. Brooklier has been very dedicated to his wife, his children. He always has  been," Tony said. "I am not going to attempt to fence with the court. There are  things in the past that he shouldn't be proud of, I'm not proud of, but he has  always provided for his family.  </P> <P> "I just remind the court that he is 67 years old," Tony went on, breaking into  tears when he referred to his father's recent heart operation. "There is  concern among his family about how many years he has left . . . and I can  assure the court that, whatever sentence he does, he will be missed every day."  </P> <P> Brooklier was sentenced to four years in prison, but he never finished doing  his time. He died in a Tucson prison medical center on July 18, 1984, 11 months  into his term, six months before he would have been eligible for parole.  </P> <P> During the last few months, Tony flew to Tucson every week or so, and the two  would talk about what their lives had come to, how Tony had become a successful  lawyer and how Dominic had, as he saw it, outlived himself.  </P> <P> "I said to him once, 'I hoped that this was over, that the family couldn't take  any more of this, my mother couldn't take any more of this,' " Tony recalls.  "And he said, sort of in a philosophic way, 'It's been over for a long time.'  He said, 'We're dinosaurs.' "  </P> <P> "My father was a product of his times, OK?" Tony says. "When my father was  growing up, it wasn't very good to be Italian. My father strove for what he  wanted within his world as he knew it. I have to think that things were  different then. You know, it's easy to look back and say, 'You should've gone  to Yale.' But things weren't like that when my father was born."  </P> <P> "This thing," he says, his voice catching, "this thing had outlived its reason  for being. This was a defensive mechanism to fight the inequity and the  injustice when Italian people first established themselves in the United  States. And when it became something that was not noble . . . something that  was not in favor of justice, in the broadest sense, it had outlived itself. And  my father understood that. It was over. It is over."  </P> <P> These days in the Brooklier family, the Mafia is regarded a little like an  amusing old aunt. In the office of his well-tended home in Anaheim, Tony keeps  an old photo of himself and his two brothers with the inscription, "Wanted for  Questioning by the FBI. (Call 1-800-DON'T START CAR.)"  </P> <P> BROOKLIER, ORDINARILY one of Los Angeles' priciest lawyers (his retainer alone  can run into tens of thousands of dollars), is representing Michael Rizzitello  for what he admits is a nominal fee. Rizzitello was short of cash, he says,  "and I don't feel I can turn my back on him over money."  </P> <P> For some lawyers and investigators, that raises anew the question that  Brooklier admits has dogged him throughout his legal career: How much of his  business grows out of old loyalties to his father and his father's friends?  </P> <P> The question gets at the nagging label of "mob lawyer" that occasionally  attaches to Brooklier, a tag that carries a host of shady connotations that  have little to do with Brooklier's practice. Many, schooled in Hollywood,  associate "mob lawyers" with Robert Duvall's character in "The Godfather," a  consigliere who is an initiated member of the crime family and who counsels the  family leadership on its illegal activities.  </P> <P> There's a big difference between that and what Brooklier does, which is to  represent reputed Mafia defendants in court, much as he might any other  criminal defendant. But some prosecutors and investigators wonder whether  Brooklier's long association with mob figures has made him more reluctant than  other lawyers to allow his clients to cooperate with government investigations  of organized crime.  </P> <P> "The way the Mafia works is, they need house counsel," says one longtime  organized-crime investigator, who asked not to be identified. "What they need  is somebody the Mafia knows will not run to the prosecution and make a deal and  give up the rest of the Mafia.  </P> <P> "The mystery about Tony is, which hat does he have on at what time of day? A  lot of his clients are mob guys. Why do they go to him? Is it because they know  they can trust him?"  </P> <P> Many criminal defense lawyers frequently encourage their clients to agree to  testify against other co-defendants as a way of obtaining more lenient  sentences. Brooklier, however, has almost never negotiated a cooperation  agreement on behalf of a client; in fact, he admits, independent record  promoter Ralph Tashjian's recent agreement to cooperate in the government's  long-running investigation into payola in the entertainment industry is the  first he has ever negotiated as a lawyer. And it "took a lot of soul searching"  before he decided it would be in Tashjian's best interests to cooperate, he  says.  </P> <P> "Don't forget, the prosecutorial agency that Tashjian has agreed to cooperate  with is the prosecutorial agency that put my father in jail, where he died. OK?  So I had a lot of personal things to overcome," Brooklier says.  </P> <P> Given that he leaves decisions on whether to cooperate up to his clients, why  is it that it has happened only once in more than a decade? "I think a lot of  it has to do with my background," he says slowly, pausing to ponder the  question. "My background is, you don't enter into an agreement with someone and  then, when everybody gets caught, turn on them. You take your lumps. And I've  had to reconcile that with my obligations as a lawyer. My obligation as a  lawyer comes first."  </P> <P> In court, Brooklier has a reputation for meticulous preparation and a  dangerously disarming style. In the midst of a major organized-crime  racketeering case with half a dozen defendants, several prosecutors said,  Brooklier is usually the defense lawyer who doesn't stand up with constant  objections. He smiles and shakes his head when asked if he wants to  cross-examine a witness -- until the one witness with damaging testimony about  his client takes the stand. Then he unloads a stinging interrogation he's been  up all night preparing.  </P> <P> The result, says former strike-force prosecutor John DuBois, who lost the  Rizzitello stolen-securities case to Brooklier last year, is that the jury  tends to forget everything about Brooklier's clients except the weaknesses in  the cases against them.  </P> <P> "Some people, in order to get noticed, have to scream and yell. Tony doesn't.  He's sort of beyond that," says Asst. U.S. Atty. Mark Bonner, who believes  Brooklier's direct, nonconfrontational style won a surprisingly lenient  sentence for a woman Bonner believed to be a key player in a major cocaine  ring. "You've gotta keep your eyes on him like a hawk, because if you don't,  before you know it, your pants are off and you're standing there naked. He's a  very dangerous customer. . . . He doesn't make mistakes."  </P> <P> AT GIUSEPPE Ristorante on any given Friday night, Brooklier is likely to finish  his pasta and grab the microphone at the piano for a rendition of "Jailhouse  Rock" (he loves Elvis) followed by "Volare" -- in Italian -- "for my mom."  </P> <P> "We think Elvis Presley was Italian," Brooklier announced to the unwary diners  one recent night. "Don't prepare to be entertained. Prepare to be appalled."  </P> <P> He hasn't always seemed so lighthearted. His father's trial "almost killed  him," and at first he didn't seem likely to recover, says his mother.  </P> <P> "It was like that for all of us," Frances Brooklier says. "The last time I saw  (Dominic) in prison, I remember walking through the door, and he had aged so  much. I turned around to go, and he had told me never to turn around, but I  looked back and his shoulders looked like a man who was 90 years old."  </P> <P> Tony left his wife, Nancy, soon after, and didn't move back in again until just  a few months ago, before their 21st anniversary. "It seemed like he wanted to  stay away from everybody he loved," Frances Brooklier recalls.  </P> <P> Brooklier says it was important for him to go home again to be with his two  sons, ages 15 and 18, to be the kind of father to them that Dominic was to him.  "It's very important to me," he said one night over dinner, tears suddenly,  unexpectedly, streaming down his face, "that you understand that I respect my  father. . . ." His voice faltered. "Ultimately -- " He stopped again to catch  his breath. "And I miss him every day."  </P> <P> Perhaps, it was suggested to him, the worst of it is the old dream again, but  this time, the car wasn't turned away. This time, the father would be separated  from the son for good. "He wasn't. Listen to me," Brooklier says, finally  breaking down completely. "He was never separated from me. . . ."  </P> <P> Yet life, as always, has a way of strolling on. Just last year, James  Henderson, the prosecutor who put Tony's father in prison, launched a book  project with Brooklier about the close friendship that had grown between the  two men in the years since the trial. Although the book deal is indefinite at  this point, Brooklier has signed a separate contract for a TV movie with the  Guber-Peters Co. His agent? Bruce Kelton, the former strike-force prosecutor  who also sat on the prosecution team, the guy who urged jurors to remember that  Dominic Brooklier and his lieutenants were nothing more than "swines in a  sewer."  </P> <P> "Small world," Brooklier shrugs. "Isn't it?"  </P></p>

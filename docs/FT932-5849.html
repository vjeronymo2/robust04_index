			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / The rush through China's most open door: The headiness and the headaches of an investor-friendly boomtown in south China IF THERE is one place in the province of Guangdong that symbolises both the successes and pitfalls of China's new economic policies it is Dongguan, a city of nearly 1.4m people on the western reaches of the Pearl River estuary between Hong Kong to the south and Guangzhou to the north. In many respects Dongguan is a shining example of Deng Xiaoping's 'opening to the outside world'. There are more than 10,000 companies in the city that depend on foreign capital for their existence, or are partly or fully foreign-owned. Since the watershed year 1978, when China turned its back on autarky and embraced 'socialism with Chinese characteristics', foreigners have invested nearly USDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) in textiles, consumer electronics, food products and much else in Dongguan. Over the past 14 years the city has achieved an annual average rate of growth of 20 per cent - outstripping the provincial and national averages comfortably. As Mr Yang Xiaotang, a foreign investment official with the Dongguan municipality says: 'The economic growth of Dongguan has been mainly due to foreign investment; without it, we would not have grown.' Dongguan set out to be a business-friendly location for foreign investors from the beginning, and to tap the far-flung Chinese diaspora. What is fortunate for Dongguan is that it is not that far flung. Of the estimated 850,000 overseas Chinese who can trace their ancestral homes to one of the 29 towns and 582 administrative districts of the city, some 650,000 live in Hong Kong or Macao. Collectively they have been responsible for about 80 per cent of 'foreign' investment in the city. Investors have brought to Dongguan capital and expertise and they have gravitated to the once rural city and environs because of a particularly enlightened Communist Party leadership. Under the rubric of 'honouring contracts and keeping promises' it has convinced some foreign investors, whose first experience of investing in China may have been anything but positive, that business success can be achieved on the mainland. One example is Vtech, a London-listed but Hong Kong-managed consumer electronics, computers and mobile telephone manufacturer. It first invested in Shenzhen, in the early 1980s but found that the local Communist party and government apparatus wanted too much control over the factory. It moved a few miles north to Dongguan and today, after a cumulative investment of HKDollars 700m (Pounds 59m), employs 8,000 permanent workers. 'We told them that we wanted to run the factory ourselves and we wanted to do the administration,' says Mr Joseph Tam, the Hong Kong manager. 'They agreed. We are also free to recruit any person we like and fire them if they do not meet our requirements.' The local government receives a steady income from Vtech. In addition to a HKDollars 30 a worker monthly fee it receives the hard currency - a percentage of which it shares with the central government - associated with Vtech's exports which amounted to nearly Yn3bn (Pounds 337m). This access to hard currency has allowed the city to develop some of the best roads in China and an advanced telecommunications systems. In spite of a big effort to develop the local electric power industry, power shortages are a frequent occurrence, especially for households, and most companies and small businesses have their own standby power generation facilities. Although Dongguan has been successful in its supply side reforms, it is a prisoner of the lack of macro-economic policy coherence in China. In Dongguan, as elsewhere in the Pearl River delta, rapid industrialisation, speculative property investment, tight labour markets and the gradual relaxation of exchange controls for the yuan are unleashing destabilising inflationary forces and it is far from clear if the Chinese authorities have the means to control it. According to Mr Marc Dreyer, general manager of Nestle Dongguan, a joint venture manufacturing instant coffee and powdered whitener for the domestic Chinese market, pay and employment is the biggest issue facing managers. 'You have to reassess pay levels regularly,' he says. 'It is the biggest issue facing managers of joint ventures in China and you have to do it without any real reference points.' Mr Tam of Vtech, however, has a most unwelcome reference point. Across the road from Vtech's factory is a new installation assembling colour television sets. Recently it posted a sign offering any Vtech employee a promotion and 20 per cent more than they were earning. In March this year Vtech increased wages 20 per cent and, says Mr Tam, it expects to have to increase wages by a further 20 per cent soon. 'If we don't increase wages they will all cross the road,' says Mr Tam. Some investors are having to pay their employees in Hong Kong dollars to retain them. One businessman brings the cash with him in a suitcase. It is risky, he concedes, but his workforce has lost confidence in the yuan.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Scarce borrowers stick to floating-rate note issues Renewed volatility in government bonds dampened activity in the Eurobond market again yesterday. Dealers said they expect the flow of new issues to be very subdued this week. The few borrowers to brave the market stuck to floating-rate note issues, which are less sensitive than fixed-rate bonds to interest rate uncertainty, since they perform like money market instruments. Barings launched a Dollars 150m issue of floating-rate notes due March 2001, with put and call options from March 1999. The notes have a discounted margin of 50 basis points over three-month Libor. An official said that the proceeds would be used to provide funding for Barings' securities business. Like a number of other banks in recent weeks, Barings took advantage of the opportunity to secure floating-rate note funding, as an alternative to bank credit lines. In the French market, Toyota Motor Credit launched a FFr840m one-year deal, which pays 7.63 per cent times the number of days that the Paris interbank offered rate falls within a predetermined range. In the sterling market, Cheshire Building Society launched a small Pounds 10m issue of Pibs (permanent interest bearing shares) via Hoare Govett, the second such offering to pay a variable interest rate. The deal pays interest of 2.4 per cent above six-month Libor. First National Building Society, Ireland's second largest building society, launched the first floating-rate Pibs issue, a Pounds 25m deal, earlier this month. Dealers said that more floating-rate Pibs are likely to be launched, although demand may be rather limited. 'Natural buyers of Pibs are fixed-rate investors who want to lock in a certain level of income,' said one syndicate official. Elf Aquitaine has had its long-term securities ratings placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service, which cited concerns over the effect of lower crude oil prices on Elf's balance sheet. Elf's long-term debt and preferred stock are currently rated Aa3. Its Prime-1 short-term rating is not under review. Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, have given Malta an a2 and an a (stable) rating, writes Godfrey Grima from Valetta. Mr John Dalli, the finance minister, said both agencies view the island's economy as strong and in the process of increased liberalisation.</p>

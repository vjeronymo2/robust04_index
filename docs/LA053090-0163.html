			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> PAULSEN'S COURT FIGHT IS NO JOKE  </P> <P> A court battle between comedian Pat Paulsen and his former wife is no joke,  with Paulsen claiming she defrauded him of $200,000 and Linda Chaney-Paulsen  accusing him of racketeering, libel and slander.  </P> <P> Paulsen testified Tuesday in Jefferson County Court that he set Chaney-Paulsen  up in the booking business and that she repaid him by diverting money from  business accounts of Pat Paulsen Enterprises Inc. in Lakewood.  </P> <P> She also hid business records from him, leaked harmful stories about him to the  National Enquirer and faked illnesses to get his sympathy, Paulsen alleges in  his lawsuit.  </P> <P> Among other charges, Chaney-Paulsen claims in a countersuit that the comedian  married her, then filed for divorce simply to take over the business that was  in her name. She also claims that Paulsen's income rose dramatically while she  arranged his bookings.  </P></p>

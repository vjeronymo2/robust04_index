			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Morgan Crucible reassures as profits rise 5% MORGAN Crucible, the UK- based materials technology group, yesterday went some way towards dispelling concerns about its balance sheet and profitability by demonstrating strong cash generation and a larger than expected profit increase. Reporting a 5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 32.5m, Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the group generated Pounds 5.3m of net cash after maintaining capital expenditure, compared with a Pounds 26m outflow in the same period last year. Analysts were equally encouraged that Mr Farmer had reconfirmed a commitment to resist the acquisition trail. Six months ago investors were concerned about the group's high gearing, the use of acquisition provisioning that appeared to bolster profits and the volume of corporate deals. Mr Farmer would not comment on progress towards selling the Holt Lloyd car care business, which is considered non-core and depresses group operating margins. The subsidiary made a Pounds 3m first-half operating profit in a 'sparkling performance' and was likely to make Pounds 7m for the full year, he said. The pre-tax profit increase was struck on sales up 19 per cent at Pounds 401.6m, or an increase of 6.4 per cent excluding the effect of currency adjustments and acquisitions. Earnings per share rose 2 per cent to 9.6p and the group is paying a maintained 5.75p interim dividend. Morgan Crucible squeezed Pounds 23.7m cash out of working capital - equally from stock and debtors. Net debt at the end of the period, however, remained less than Pounds 1m lower than the year-end figure at Pounds 157.7m after adverse currency movements. Gearing was almost unchanged at 66 per cent but the interest bill was covered more than five times by operating profits. Mr Farmer gave a bleak assessment of world markets. While group order intake was up by at least 7 per cent, with Australasia, the UK and North America showing gradual improvement, continental Europe and Japan were causing concern. 'I do not think 1994 will be the take-off year,' Mr Farmer said. At the operating level profits rose 16 per cent to Pounds 40.8m or 1 per cent excluding the effects of currency and acquisitions. The speciality materials, technical ceramics and thermal ceramics divisions all advanced, while the carbon division was held back by the US. Lex, Page 20</p>

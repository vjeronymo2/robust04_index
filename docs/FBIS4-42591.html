			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "All the Talk About Provide </F> Comfort"]    [Text] The Parliament has to act at the end of this month  for the extension of the mandate of the "Provide Comfort" force,  which was set up by the United States, Britain and France to  protect the Kurds of northern Iraq against Saddam Husayn and his  troops. Turkey has been the host country to the force with  "certain misgivings."    Many hawks in the military hierarchy have claimed the force  has contributed to the strengthening of the clandestine Workers  Party of Kurdistan (PKK) in northern Iraq. They say the PKK has  effectively used the safe haven in northern Iraq to train the  terrorists who have wreaked havoc in southeastern Turkey.    We hear that some people in the government are inclined to  use the extension of the mandate of "Provide Comfort" as a  bargaining chip against the American move to link U.S. aid to  Turkey with human rights and the Cyprus question.    At first the claims surfaced when the final communique after  Saturday's [28 May] National Security Council failed to mention  that the council has recommended to the government the extension  of the mandate of the force for another six months. The mandate  of the force ends at the close of this month and the Turkish  Parliament has to vote on it before June 29 if the force is to  stay on in Turkey. The next meeting of the council will not take  place before the Parliament is required to act on the extension.  So the possibility emerged that, because the final communique  did not mention the matter, the "extension" of Provide Comfort  could be in jeopardy....    The government gave out confused signals which did not help.  Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin ruled out any "blackmail"  concerning "Provide Comfort," while Deputy Prime Minister Murat  Karayalcin said Washington should draw the appropriate  conclusions from the fact that the National Security Council did  not mention the extension of "Provide Comfort"...    The TURKISH DAILY NEWS later learnt that the council did  discuss "Provide Comfort" and probably gave the go-ahead to the  extension without publicly announcing it, just to give  Washington the jitters.    So all this business of "defying" Washington and telling it  to take its "Provide Comfort" force out of Turkey is just empty  talk. Turkey is in no position to use "Provide Comfort" as a  trump card, especially when the allies could move the force to  southern Cyprus and deny us a very important leverage on  northern Iraq and the Iraqi Kurds.</p>

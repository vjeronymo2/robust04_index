			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Press Service of Ukraine's Ministry of </F> Defense and UKRINFORM: "Ukraine Does Not Trade in the Fleet"]    [Text] Some mass media have echoed the information carried  by the Saudi Arabian newspaper ASH-SHARK AL-AUSAT [name as  transliterated] about Ukraine's intention to sell "a  considerable part of its share of the former Soviet naval fleet"  to Persian Gulf countries. Referring to "sources in  Washington," the newspaper maintains that rapid assault crafts,  torpedo boats, destroyers, and minelayers are up for sale. Iran  has allegedly been offered a submarine.    This is obvious misinformation aimed at undermining  Ukraine's  prestige and compromising it in the eyes of the world community.  As of today, Ukraine does not own any part of the former USSR's  naval fleet, and, therefore, there can be no talk of it selling  warships.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Britons get richer and spend more THE AVERAGE British household is 20 per cent richer in real terms than 10 years ago, according to a survey published yesterday. The study by Mintel, the international market research group, also shows that potential individual wealth - calculated by saleable assets  - has surged by more than 200 per cent over the same period. The survey of lifestyle and spending habits of the past decade shows the British spend a greater proportion of their income than in 1981. UK consumer spending was Pounds 376.5bn last year, 26 per cent more in real terms than in 1981. Savings as a proportion of income fell to 7.5 per cent, against 13.1 per cent in 1981. Much of that increased spending now goes towards insurance and pensions, which accounted for just Pounds 3.9bn in 1981 but had risen to more than Pounds 17bn by last year. Sickness and accident insurance has grown almost five times in cash terms since 1981. Mintel's report identifies trends which it expects will alter the nature of consumer spending in the current decade. The number of households is likely to increase from 22.7m last year to more than 24m by 2001 but average household size will probably fall from 2.5 people to 2.3 people. Single-person households are predicted to increase to 6.8m by 2001, compared with 4.6m in 1981 and 5.9m last year. The study suggests that the household services market has been a boom area in the past decade, growing by almost 450 per cent and now worth Pounds 2.9bn. According to Mintel it may be worth Pounds 5.5bn by 1996. Britain appears to be turning into a nation of restaurant lovers. Last year spending on food for consumption in the home was Pounds 42.56bn, a decline to 11 per cent of total expenditure from 15 per cent 10 years ago. Total food expenditure increased by 8 per cent in real terms in the decade. At the same time spending on eating out grew by 4 per cent annually. Britons now spend Pounds 13.7bn a year in restaurants. Britons have spent an average of 3 per cent a year more on holidays over the past decade. The record, tape and musical instrument business has been the fastest-growing leisure sector, at 12 per cent a year. The losing sector is clearly tobacco products, with sales falling by an average annual rate of almost 3 per cent since 1981. British Lifestyles 1992. Mintel, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 22 Jan 94 Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] With the political reform bills having been  rejected by the House of Councillors, the outlook for the  Japan-U.S. summit on 21 February, as well as for the ongoing  Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, looks uncertain. A  vice-ministerial-level meeting is set for 23 January in  Washington to discuss government procurements and other matters,  but negotiations in all sectors are experiencing very rough  sailing over issues like U.S. demands for numerical targets.    Meanwhile, regarding to the impact which the current  political chaos will have on the talks, there are now two  contrasting views emerging within the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs [MOFA] -- one predicts "the United States will push  hard, becoming despaired of the Hosokawa government," and the  other says "they will soften their position out of consideration  for the chaotic political situation in Japan."    The United States is now beginning to show irritation over  the negotiations which are making slow progress. Secretary of  Treasury Lloyd Bentsen will arrive in Japan on 23 January. U.S.  Trade Representative Micky Kantor has expressed his intention to  visit Japan. The country is calling on Japan to make a  political decision to reach a breakthrough in the talks.    Meanwhile Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade  and industry, insists "there is no discrepancy in views between  the government and bureaucrats." But according to a senior MOFA  official, there are increasing views in Japan that because of  the problem raised by the political reform issue, "it is now  possible Japan's political alternatives will narrow."    An official of the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry was perplexed, saying: "If revised political reform  bills are promptly adopted, there will be no major impact on the  negotiations. But if this situation leads to a weakening of the  coalition government by the Social Democratic Party of Japan  breaking up, or leads to the fall of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa from power, there is no telling what will happen to the  talks."</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Accountancy Column: Balancing rules and professional judgment - Dennis R. Beresford looks at the lessons the UK should derive from US experience On August 20, the Accountancy Column's subheading stated: 'Roger Davis argues that professional experience and instinct should count for more than rigid adherence to the rule book.' I submit that accounting standards and professional judgment must be more like equal partners. And that companies as well as auditors must supply this judgment. In the US we have tried both general principles and much more detailed standards. Most business people and senior partners of audit firms support the former in theory but ask for the latter in practice. This is for some of the same reasons mentioned by Mr Davis: the threat of litigation and increasing competition in the audit business. But there are other reasons as well. One key factor is that business has become much more complex. Actions taken by companies to sell their products internationally, protect against a multitude of financial and other risks, adjust to new technology, and other developments often raise new accounting issues. Professional judgment and common sense can guide the accounting for many of these issues. Nevertheless, most agree that financial reporting is not useful unless there is a reasonable degree of comparability from company to company. Can readers of financial statements place much credibility in those statements if company A decides that an expenditure is an asset and company B decides the same expenditure is a current period expense? When these transactions relate to significant items that affect a wide range of companies some standardisation is essential. A good illustration is the current debate at the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on accounting for hedging transactions. Many companies have entered into contracts designed to reduce their exposure to commodity, foreign currency exchange, or interest rate risks. A loss may occur on such a contract that the company expects will be offset by increased profit on a future sale or other transaction. Under what circumstances, if any, should that loss be considered an asset? This is the kind of issue that I believe needs careful consideration by standard setters. A common approach is likely to result in more useful financial reporting. As another example, consider the 'simple' case of accounting for business combinations. How should common sense and professional instinct, as Mr Davis puts it, apply to questions such as: Why should some combinations be accounted for as acquisitions and others as mergers? What future costs should qualify as liabilities in recording an acquisition? Should any excess purchase price (goodwill) be charged to reserves or capitalised and amortised? I submit that these types of pervasive questions are best addressed overall by standard setters rather than case by case. The alternative is chaos in financial reporting where the best individual judgments cannot possibly compensate for lack of reasonable uniformity in the basic reporting model. At the same time, the standards must recognise limitations and leave room for application of judgment. For example, a standard might provide general guidance on the future costs that qualify for liability treatment in an acquisition. But the company and its auditor must exercise considerable judgment in deciding which future events actually qualify for such treatment. There is a temptation for standard setters, encouraged by questions from auditors and company representatives, to go overboard and pursue uniformity past the point of diminishing returns. The FASB has sometimes erred in that direction. The result is rules that only a specialist can interpret, and accounting that loses sight of the objective of meaningful reporting. As Mr Davis puts it: 'The avoidance industry will find the loopholes, and the inevitable consequence being yet more rules.' I agree that we must avoid that vicious circle. Striking an appropriate balance between accounting standards and application judgment is not a new phenomenon. For many decades at least, companies and their auditors have had to determine the amounts of allowances for losses on receivables, inventory obsolescence, impairment of operating assets, and countless other amounts in the financial statements. A general accounting standard underlies each of these items but appropriate professional judgment still is critical to the resulting reports being 'fairly presented', as we put it in the US. Another point alluded to by Mr Davis is the length of recent standards. While his reference was to the UK, it also describes the American situation very well. But it is important to analyse the sheer size. Most of our US standards, and increasingly those in other countries, use the bulk of the document to explain why we have done something. A 'basis for conclusions' describes our reasoning, including our responses to arguments raised during the public comment process. Our documents also often include illustrations and other guidance to make them more user-friendly. A relatively short standard accompanied by reasoning and illustrations seems to be what companies and auditors find most useful. As mentioned earlier, both the threat of litigation and increasing audit competition have contributed to requests for more standards. Unfortunately, we have seen too many situations in which the auditor is told: 'I plan to follow this accounting unless you show me a rule that says I can't' One response to this would be what Mr Davis calls this 'sticking to what your guts tell you'. But that does not assure that the accounting will be appropriate, particularly for emerging issues. For these new developments, the FASB's constituents recommended that an emerging issues task force could assist. Similar efforts were started later in Canada and the UK. These efforts rely heavily on practicing auditors and company financial officers to resolve issues before they become bigger problems. Interestingly, a large number of the matters dealt with by this group in the US have involved broad principles where professional judgment results in too wide a range of reported outcomes. Regulators, the audit firms themselves, or others insisted on more objective sidelines to narrow the application of judgment. In summary, accounting standards and professional judgment in their application must co-exist if the art of financial reporting is to remain relevant. Finding the right balance, not overly emphasising one or the other, is our challenge. Dennis R Beresford is chairman of the US Financial Accounting Standards Board</p>

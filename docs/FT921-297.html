			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (10): Hard work, flexibility and common sense - Profile: Mura textiles IT is not often you find a Louis Feraud or a Boss label in any of the textile factories in eastern Europe, or in any of the republics of the former Yugoslavia. And it is seldom in this part of Europe that you come across young men and women designing and working on computers for next season's fashions. But this is precisely what is taking place in the Mura textile factory, which is located in Muraska Sobota, a town of 16,000 inhabitants set on the great Pannonian plains in north-eastern Slovenia and almost touching the borders of Hungary. Here, the people of Muraska Sobota have been engaged in the textile industry since 1925 when Mr Janez Cvetic set up a small workshop in which he employed four women to sew underwear. Since then, the textile factory, which was nationalised after the Second World War, has expanded into an export-driven enterprise, spread over eight plants, employing more than 6,500 people and exceeding an annual turnover of DM130m. Mr Bozo Kuharic, the general director of Mura, puts the successful growth and expansion down to hard work, flexibility, and common sense. 'Three years ago, we knew that the political climate throughout Yugoslavia was changing. It was becoming more complicated to do business with the other republics. So we concentrated even more on expanding the export side of the business,' he explains. Today, more than 90 per cent of Mura's production is geared specifically for western markets. The textile industry in Slovenia contributes more than 7 per cent to the republic's GDP and employs more than 50,000 people. It has traditionally been an export-oriented industry. 'Over the past few years, we saw how we were losing part of the Yugoslav market,' says Mr Kuharic, 51, who joined the company 24 years ago and who has been general director for the past 14 years. 'We were ready to find new export markets - after all, the export business is nothing new for us. Thirty years ago, it was decided by the management that it should be export driven, and we have not looked back since,' he says. Mura, as a general principle, does not sell to western markets under its own label although it has two of its own labels which it markets abroad. Instead, European retailers, equipped with their own designs, commission Mura to cut and manufacture the products. Mrs Danijel Plemenitas, the technical manager, says that more than three-quarters of its clients are 'steady'. 'This means that our employees can identify with the label. We try to have the factory floor designed in such a way that one group of employees will be sewing for one particular western retailer. I suppose it builds up a kind of loyalty,' said Mrs Plemenitas. Mura's biggest client is Germany, which accounts for 70 per cent of its turnover, followed by the rest of the European Community countries. Mr Kuharic says the US and Britain remain difficult markets because of textile quotas. As a means of trying to expand into the US market, Mura established a joint venture in New York in which it holds a 25 per cent stake. It also has a joint venture in Munich. The comfortable turnover of Mura means that it can update its equipment, and import quality fabrics, mostly from Italy. Its annual imports total DM30m. In recent years, the company has been investing about DM10m in machinery, particularly computers. Recently, it has been diversifying into computer software management programmes which it sells to other enterprises in Slovenia. These sales now account for about 10 per cent of its turnover. In the near future, the Mura management plans to invest in computerised cutting machines. But the future also raises questions about whether the capital base of the enterprise should be increased. Mr Kuharic says Mura will only negotiate a privatisation package if the company is treated on equal terms with a bidder. At the moment, Mura is socially-owned, which means that neither the state, nor private individuals, own the company. Instead, it is owned by the workers. Under the terms of a federal law passed by the Yugoslav government in 1989, they have the right to buy out the company themselves, or initiate privatisation proceedings with a foreign partner through Slovenia's Agency for Privatisation, and the republic's development fund which are overseeing the republic's privatisation process. 'We will be eventually transformed into a limited company,' said Mr Kuharic. 'About 15 per cent of the shares would be held by the employees, 40 per cent would be sold to a domestic or foreign partner, and we would decide later what to with the remaining 40 per cent of the shares. It depends on what kind of legislation the Slovene government decides,' he says. Mr Kuharic says Mura's capital base is strong. 'We do not have any outstanding loans or credits. We can use our foreign exchange earnings as we wish.' In common with other enterprises in Slovenia and the other republics of the former Yugoslavia, the management of Mura is represented on the board of the local Ljubljanska Bank. Mr Kuharic thinks that in future, creditors should not be members of the boards of banks. And what about eventually marketing Mura's own label among western retailers? Mrs Plemenitas says the company spends little on marketing its own product, adding that Mura's strength is its flexibility and its reliability in satisfying its clients. 'Launching our own label would require a large investment in terms of marketing. I suppose it is a question of perception. It is like trying to compete with a Mercedes,' she said.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cautious increase in coffee futures Coffee futures prices bounced back again yesterday after recent falls as traders covered short positions in the market ahead of a report from the US department of agriculture assessing the frost damage to Brazil's coffee trees which is due on Friday. Soft commodities prices in general moved ahead partly as a result of technical buy signals motivating traders, but also based on fears about crop supplies in coffee, cocoa and sugar. The November coffee futures contract at the London Commodity Exchange rose by Dollars 91 a tonne to Dollars 3,283 a tonne yesterday, but trading remained light and market participants were cautious. New York prices slipped in late trading after London's close as the market remained in limbo ahead of the crop report. 'There's no rhyme nor reason to the way this market is trading at the moment until the news about the crop report is out,' said Ms Judy Ganes, soft commodities analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. The USDA report will be released after the close of trading on Friday which means that prices will not be affected by its findings until trading next Monday. Cocoa prices jumped in London trading on some technical buying and short-covering. The market closed Pounds 24 a tonne higher at Pounds 1,054 a tonne as some traders reported a growing interest from speculators and investment funds in cocoa trading. 'We're seeing lots of inquiries and a growing involvement of hedge funds in the cocoa market in the past few weeks,' said a commodities director at a US investment bank.</p>

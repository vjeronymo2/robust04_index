			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEAM USA DEFEATS POLAND IN WORLD TOURNEY; GOALIE INJURED  </P> <P> Team USA closed out the preliminary round of the World Hockey Championships  with a 6-1 victory over Poland today, but possibly lost its goaltender for the  rest of the tourney with an injury.  </P> <P> John Vanbiesbrouck, who plays for the New York Rangers, was removed to a  hospital with a suspected broken jaw after being hit by the puck early in the  second period.  </P> <P> Vanbiesbrouck was struck in the lower part of his face mask when a Polish shot  deflected off his stick. The accident occurred about six minutes into the  second period during a Polish power play.  </P> <P> Team USA already had one player sidelined with an injury. Last Friday,  defenseman Phil Housley had torn collarbone ligaments in a 7-4 win over West  Germany and has not played since.  </P> <P> Vanbiesbrouck was replaced in goal by two-time All-American Robb Stauber of the  University of Minnesota, who shut out the Poles the rest of the way.  </P> <P> Team USA completed the preliminary round-robin portion of the tourney with a  2-1-4 won-tied-lost record.  </P> <P> The Americans play Poland again in the first relegation group game on  Wednesday. The last-placed team drops to the B championships next year.  </P> <P> Team Canada faces defending world champion Sweden, and the unbeaten Soviets,  7-0, play Czechoslovakia in the opening medal round games Thursday.  </P></p>

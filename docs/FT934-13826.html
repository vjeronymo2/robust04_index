			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Watchdog lists executive dodges THE NATIONAL Audit Office report highlights some disqualification cases: A case pending: a retail company went into liquidation in 1992 with debts of Pounds 400,000. The directors had been previously responsible for two companies which failed in similar circumstances. Conduct included misapplication of goods and company funds, excessive director remuneration and expenses, retention of customer deposits while knowingly insolvent, and failure to keep adequate accounts books. A case leading to disqualification of two directors for 10 years: a manufacturing company entered voluntary liquidation in 1989 with debts of more than Pounds 500,000. The directors advanced monies to a connected company without due consideration; carried out transactions to the detriment of specific creditors; maintained insufficient accounting records; and traded without reasonable prospect of payment of creditors. Insolvency practitioners also gave examples of the type of actions taken by unfit directors. A typical director of a company engaging in unfit conduct may have deliberately paid off a bank overdraft in the months before the company failed because the overdraft was secured against his or her own property. Directors often reduce outstanding loans they have made to their company before collapse, using their knowledge of the state of the finances unfairly to put them ahead of other creditors to the company. They may well be consistently late in paying tax to the Inland Revenue, value added tax to Customs and Excise, and in sending annual returns to Companies House. Mr John Alexander, corporate insolvency partner with Pannell Kerr Forster in London, said he often came across cases of directors who had used company funds to pay for house extensions at the same time as rebuilding work at their factory. They may have holiday homes overseas, pay their spouses as though they were company employees and give their children company cars. There may also be corporate hospitality boxes at football or rugby clubs.</p>

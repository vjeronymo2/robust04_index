			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva by </F> correspondent Antonio Esteves Martins on 11 January; place not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] It was confirmed this morning that  the current members of NATO are willing to extend the  organization to include the democratic states of Eastern Europe.  [passage omitted]    [Martins] For the first time in its history, NATO has  enabled  its military and logistic structure to be at the service of the  WEU, so that in the context of military operations, the European  allies can implement their common defense and security policy.    [Cavaco] There is, therefore, a major change taking place in  NATO. The WEU is the political arm of the European Union for  the implementation of the defense policy. But at the same time  it is NATO's European pillar. NATO as a whole is interested and  strongly committed to strengthening this European pillar of NATO.    [Martins] Above all, because we are to witness a reduction  of  the U.S. presence in Europe, the allies should from now on have  a more active role in their own security. This situation  pleases Portugal, moreover, because it will reinforce the  importance of the Lajes air base [Azores].    [Cavaco] The Azores are today, and increasingly, seen as  Portugal's contribution to peace in the world, because you  should also bear in mind that this summit has reaffirmed the  possibility of operations outside the area, with the involvement  of NATO troops in association with troops from non-NATO  countries. [passage omitted]    [Martins] If you were not the Portuguese prime minister but  the prime minister of Hungary, Poland, or even Slovakia, would  you feel satisfied and safe with what is written in the final  communique?    [Cavaco] I would have to be realistic. But I am not  surprised that the leaders of Poland, or Czechoslovakia [as  heard], or others, would like the community or the alliance to  give more concrete and precise steps toward enlargement, but I  think this would be a mistake.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Terminology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA proposed that the vehicle requirements be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to vehicles manufactured to operate on CNG-only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``dedicated'') vehicles and to vehicles manufactured to operate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on two fuels, CNG and either gasoline or diesel fuel. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency referred in the NPRM to this latter type of vehicle as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a ``dual fuel'' CNG vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Blue Bird, Oklahoma Gas, and the NGVC commented that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency used the term ``dual fuel vehicle'' incorrectly. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters explained that the industry's generally understood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning of ``dual fuel vehicle'' is a vehicle that uses a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixture of two fuels simultaneously, in this case CNG and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another fuel such as gasoline or diesel. A vehicle that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of operating either on CNG and another fuel such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline or diesel, but not a mixture of both, is referred to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a ``bi-fuel'' vehicle. A vehicle equipped with one fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system and designed to operate on CNG is referred to as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``dedicated CNG vehicle.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has decided to adopt the generally accepted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminology used in the alternative fuel industry for vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that operate on more than one fuel. Accordingly, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule includes definitions for ``Bi-fuel CNG vehicle,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Dedicated CNG vehicle,'' and ``Dual-fuel CNG vehicle.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency notes that these definitions are generally consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the statutory terms in the Energy Policy Act. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 403 of that Act amended certain provisions in Title V of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions for ``dedicated vehicle'' and ``dual fueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles.'' The definitions of these terms in this notice are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the statutory provisions. The one difference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the agency's definitions and the statutory definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is that the agency's definition of ``bi-fuel'' vehicle also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falls under the Act's definition of ``dual fueled automobile''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., ``an automobile which is capable of operating on an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative fuel [such as CNG] and on gasoline or diesel)''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, the agency believes that it is necessary that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its definition of ``bi-fuel'' vehicle include the greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specificity provided by the industry's definition of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Performance Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Allowable Pressure Drop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regulatory background. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the ANPRM, NHTSA discussed the possibility of proposing a prohibition against any fuel leakage during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crash test and for up to 30 minutes after the vehicle's motion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> had ceased. A number of commenters to the ANPRM objected to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no-leakage requirement, claiming that any pressurized gaseous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel system will produce a minimal amount of leakage from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fittings and valves. Along with their concerns about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicability, commenters further stated that a no-leakage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement would be overly restrictive in comparison to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard No. 301. That standard permits a minimal amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leakage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments on the ANPRM, NHTSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided that instead of proposing a no-leakage requirement, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would propose allowing not more than a minimal level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leakage for a specified time period. The allowable leakage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was patterned after Standard No. 301 and was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to avoid the practicability problems associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a no-leakage requirement. The agency believed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable amount of leakage is equivalent in energy content to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the leakage allowed for gasoline in Standard No. 301.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposal, CNG leakage from the vehicle's entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel system would have been measured for a 15-minute period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following a barrier crash test. The proposal discussed two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives related to measuring the allowable leakage: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Leakage would be measured through incremental measurements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the time of impact until the vehicle ceased motion, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the subsequent five-minute period, and every minute in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next 10-minute period, or (2) the cumulative leakage would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured only once, at the end of the 15-minute test period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With either measurement, the total gas permitted to leak at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the test period would have been the same. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency requested comment on the feasibility and practicability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of specifying gaseous leakage measurements at specific time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals and about devices that are capable of measuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incremental pressure changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

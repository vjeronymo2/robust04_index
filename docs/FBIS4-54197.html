			<p>BFN     [Text] At its executive committee meeting this morning,  Sakigake [Harbinger Party] formally decided to accept members of  the "Minshu no Kaze [Wind of Democracy]" group, which consists  of four Diet members who left the Japan New Party [JNP] on 20  May, as new members of the parliamentary grouping it leads.    Sakigake has already formed a Diet group with Seiun, also  made up of three JNP defectors. The "Minshu no Kaze" members  will also be admitted to this group. Sakigake will register the  new group shortly.    In view of this, Sakigake will also allow "Minshu no Kaze"  members to participate in its policy study group with the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ].    At today's executive meeting, Sakigake Secretary General  Hiroyuki Sonoda also reported on SDPJ Secretary Wataru Kubo's  recent statement on his intention to participate in molding the  political regime, including cooperation with the incumbent  ruling coalition parties, on condition that the Hata cabinet  resigns en masse. He reported that Kubo said he had merely  wanted to turn the tide because people tend to think of the SDPJ  as attempting to cooperate with the Liberal Democratic Party, or  as favoring the dissolution of the Diet and holding lower house  elections under the present medium-sized constituency system.  Sonoda said Kubo explained that he was not actively thinking of  returning to the coalition.</p>

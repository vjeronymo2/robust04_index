			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EXUDE WINS MTV'S VIDEO COMPETITION  </P> <P> Exude, a rock band from Anaheim, won MTV's monthly "Basement Tapes" contest  Thursday for its video "Safe With You," an AIDS-awareness song. Exude's victory  over three other groups means that MTV will play the video six times over the  next month.  </P> <P> "It's going to help a lot," said Exude's singer, Frank Rogala. "It's going to  be great exposure."  </P> <P> It won't be the first time the band has been in the national spotlight: Exude  won Musician Magazine's "Best Unsigned Band in America" contest in 1987 and was  included with nine other groups on a record produced by Warner Bros. and  circulated among the recording industry.  </P> <P> "Somebody better sign us because we're not letting these other bands have a  chance to win these contests," Rogala said, laughing.  </P> <P> Actually, "the music business seems a little cautious when it comes to us,"  Rogala said, adding that he hopes the MTV award might finally earn the group a  recording contract.  </P></p>

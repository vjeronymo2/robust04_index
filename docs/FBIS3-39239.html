			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Transportation Ministry has rejected criticism  of the planned Hamburg-Berlin Transrapid rail link that has been  voiced by experts. The 13 economics professors of the  Scientific Advisory Council are "no longer up to date on the  current work," spokesman Veit Steinle said in Bonn on Thursday  [10 February]. This regards the financing concept and capital  resources of the operating companies. The Advisory Council has  called the financing concept incomplete and the estimated cost  of 8.9 billion marks, indicated by the Transport Ministry,  unrealistic.    The spokesman said that Germany has not had the best of  experiences in the transport sector. Putting into practice  future-oriented technologies has become a crucial problem for  Germany as a business location. The willingness of German  Railways head Heinz Duerr to use the Transrapid is a clear sign  of courage and risktaking. This does, however, not exclude  sober evaluations, the spokesman said.</p>

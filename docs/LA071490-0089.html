Maj. Gen. Khim Nyunt, head of military  intelligence, said the junta will not yield to international pressure for the  release of Aung San Suu Kyi and a transfer of power to her National League for  Democracy. Suu Kyi, daughter of the country's foremost independence hero when  it was Burma, was placed under house arrest July 20, 1989. She has never been  formally charged.  </P></p>

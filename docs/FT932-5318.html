			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Management: Time for Cadbury to tackle high pay AS spring gives way to summer, British bosses usually breathe a sigh of relief. The flood of annual reports becomes a trickle, ending the now customary 'open season' for attacks on newly disclosed top pay rises. Company directors look forward to six months of gold-plated peace. But 1993 may prove far less comfortable. This is not just because lower company performance seems to have given more than a quarter of them smaller bonuses, or none at all. Far more painful is that the pay controversy has ceased to preoccupy merely the meddlesome but ephemera-minded media. Instead, institutional shareholders are suddenly up in arms. From having always turned a blind eye, or cursed quietly behind the scenes, a bunch of activist institutions has burst noisely into public view. They were on TV last Sunday, demanding an end to various abuses and to the lax and over-long executive contracts which help create them. Until recently, most representatives of the business world, other than the outspoken new head of the Institute of Management, were equally reticent. Then came last month's remarkable assault on his fellow bosses by Sir Owen Green, for decades one of the UK's most respected chairmen. He attacked them for 'awarding themselves huge pay rises', no matter how well or badly their company performs - or how small a rise they give to the rest of their staff. Inevitably, Sir Owen's onslaught has lent weight to misguided media criticism of almost any sizeable pay rise, however well justified. Obvious examples include the promotional increases announced in May for the new heads of de-merged ICI and Zeneca. But in many cases the general opprobrium is well justified. Take the string of over-the-top pay-offs to failed executives which have been disclosed in recent weeks, to the fury of reformist institutions. Then there was the golden 'hello again' for Gerald Ronson: an absurdly generous five-year contract worth Pounds 4.4m for the head of the receivership-threatened property group - fresh from his ignominious part in the Guinness affair, for which he was imprisoned and fined Pounds 5m. Institutional ire was stoked by the fact that the deal was approved by a bunch of supposedly upstanding banks and accounting firms. Just as questionable and illuminating of the inadequacy of British corporate governance over such matters, was the ultra-generous pension enhancements and consultancy deal given to the recently retired - and highly respectable  -head of Guinness. It was piquant, to say the least, to see these arrangements being defended at the annual shareholders meeting last week by no less a figure than the former chairman of Rolls Royce Motors, who heads the committee of non-executive directors which sets executive pay levels at Guinness. Remuneration committees dominated by non-execs have been touted by the establishment for years as the answer to pay abuses in British boardrooms. But how can anyone seriously have faith in a system where one highly-paid baron, no matter how respected, sits in judgment on another? Which brings us to the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance. Though its Code of Practice takes effect on July 1, its work is far from done. Through a sub-committee which will meet to monitor compliance with the Code, it has the muscle to issue further 'recommendations' whenever it likes over the next two years. In order to foster outside support for the rest of its Code last year, the Committee pulled its punches on pay. This was in spite of pressure from certain institutions and some of its members, to have directors' pay made subject to shareholder vote. It hid behind the argument that it did not see 'how these suggestions could be made workable'. What would happen if someone's package were voted down? And wouldn't executives be reluctant to join the company if approval were uncertain? These excuses were always feeble. The new force of outside pressures means the Committee can now abandon them. It has no choice but to do so if it wishes to anticipate, and avoid, what its chairman called last Sunday 'the heavy hand of regulation'. As soon as possible, Cadbury should adopt this agenda: Clarify that its recommended three-year limit on service contracts excludes rolling ones. Better still, reduce the term to two. Make its call last year for 'full disclosure' mean what it says by borrowing the new formula of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This requires the disclosure, in great detail, of each element of the 'compensation package' of the five highest-paid executives; Cadbury requires far less data and about only the chairman and one other. Submit each person's package to shareholder vote. If this year's US experience is anything to go by, few packages would cause problems. Instead, companies would be forced to do their homework carefully in advance, tailoring packages within bounds of acceptability laid down by institutional shareholders, either in direct discussion or via specialist consultants - whose business is now booming in America. In such an environment, only the most crass of top managers would be loath to join a company before their packages were approved. If, through poor anticipation or oversight, the occasional package was voted down, the executive concerned would revert to his or her previous year's arrangements - or be put on an equivalent of the UK Inland Revenue's emergency tax coding. Impractical? Unfeasible? You can bet your last half million pounds that a government regulator would find a way. So can Cadbury.</p>

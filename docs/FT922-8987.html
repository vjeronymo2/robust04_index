			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Letter: Mistaken prescription for BT prices Sir, Mr Matson, the chairman of National TeleCable, argues (Letters, May 6) that BT should reduce its prices but would not do so until forced by competition. In fact, since 1984 we have, under rules agreed with Oftel, reduced prices by more than 25 per cent on average, in real terms, for our main services. Last year, for example, we cut international call charges by 10 per cent. Oftel's current RPI-6.25 per cent price cap will require real and nominal price cuts again this year. Mr Matson describes as 'beguiling but fallacious' our argument that competition should operate freely in the telecommunications market without rules designed to favour one player at the expense of another. His proposal appears to be for BT to make a one-off price reduction and then to freeze its prices regardless of economics until it has lost a substantial share of 'the relevant market' - perhaps the sector in which cable businesses currently operate with statutory TV monopolies. Mr Matson would apparently like the government regulator to serve him a share of the telecommunication market on a plate. That is not competition. His prescription for achieving that result is also mistaken. BT's prices overall are no higher than necessary to cover our cost of capital at the market rate. If we are required to reduce them, Mr Matson and our other competitors will have to face a level of BT prices which is less than economic. Compelling BT to charge less than is sufficient to cover our cost of capital will prevent competitors from establishing themselves. So Mr Matson does not offer convincing arguments for changing the policy of open competition to which the government is committed.

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Boris Yeltsin could meet with his Chechen  counterpart Dzhokhar Dudayev only if the Chechen president  recognized that his republic is part of the Russian Federation.  However, it is more likely that a dialogue with Dudayev will be  conducted by Russia's Premier Victor Chernomyrdin since economic  talks are seen as the chief means for Moscow and Groznyy to  smooth their relations. The Russian Counterintelligence Service  Director Sergey Stepashin made these statements at a meeting  with lawmakers and cabinet officials from Kabardino-Balkaria in  Nalchik Thursday [5 May] night.    On the situation in North Caucasus, Stepashin noted that  regional stability was wishful thinking without a settlement  with Chechnya. The way it is, as Stepashin put it, the republic  poses a threat for Russia's stability. For one thing, he  stressed, Grozny financially supports opposition movements  across the North Caucasus.    A dialogue with Dudayev, in Stepashin's opinion, should be  pursued in "a tough key," and the prime task is to safeguard the  railways crossing Chechnya.    According to Stepashin, there is an entirely different  situation in Kabardino-Balkaria, where the president,  parliament, and government are explicitly in favor of keeping  Russia's integrity as a state. He called for using  Kabardino-Balkaria's potential to guarantee peace in the North  Caucasus, normalize the situation in the region, advance the  negotiating processes, and draw up recommendations on how to  settle conflicts, above all between Osetians and Ingushes.    In regard to rampant crime in Russia, Stepashin urged the  stiffening of the federal penal code and judicial system. By  federal intelligence information, there are about 150,000 guns  in private possession in Russia, and some Russian gangs are even  armed with heavy weapons.</p>

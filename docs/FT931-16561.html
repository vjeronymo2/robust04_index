			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Management: Resolute approach to good health - Health Check MANY of us soon find that the new year's resolutions we made with much enthusiasm only a few days ago quickly fall victim to the demands of business life. But it need not be that way if you derive real pleasure from the resolutions you make. My suggestion is to replace the stoic flavour of traditional resolutions with new priorities on improving your quality of life. The following should all be considered: Rekindle close relationships. A stress-filled business life can damage personal relationships. But remember that they are the key to your health and happiness. Respect your body and mind and listen to the signals they send you. Sleep when you are tired and eat when you are hungry instead of out of habit. Stay active. You may not like swimming and jogging. That's OK. There are alternative exercises ranging from chopping wood to going for long walks. Remember, diseases of all kinds tend to hate moving targets. Make alcohol part of a larger ritual; convivial dinners are a healthy use of alcohol. Drinking alone is a problematic form of self-medication. Manage stress. Reading, yoga, music, sex, walking and meditation are constructive ways to relax. Quit smoking. There is no easy way out of this one. But if you do smoke, limit yourself to those cigarettes you really 'enjoy'. And smokers should avoid alcohol - it lowers their resistance. Develop hobbies that are totally absorbing, different from your job, fun and satisfying. If they involve your family, so much the better. There is mounting scientific evidence that the age-old axiom 'laughter is the best medicine' contains more than a kernel of truth. Humour is the easiest way to reduce stress. Make enjoyment of life a priority. Keep in mind that life is your real career, not business or a profession. The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.</p>

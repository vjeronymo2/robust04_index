			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(2) of this final rule, OSHA specifies various requirements for the proper use of chain saws in the logging industry. OSHA believes these requirements are necessary to protect loggers from injury when using chain saws. Several commenters also supported the proposed chain saw requirements as reasonable practices (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). As discussed earlier, the WIR survey indicates that chain saw accidents accounted for 20 percent of the reported accidents (Ex. 2&hyph;1). According to a Maine BLS, from 1980&hyph;87 there were an average of 362 disabling chain-saw injuries each year (Ex. 4&hyph;176).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years there have been many improvements in chain saw safety due to the introduction of devices such as chain brakes, bar tip guards, and reduced kickback bars and chains. Also, the availability of protective chaps and pads of ballistic nylon or other lightweight protective materials have provided further protection for chain-saw operators. OSHA believes that proper use of improved chain saws and personal protective equipment, and compliance with the work practices will greatly improve the safety record of chain saw operations. OSHA also believes that proper training in these requirements will result in better understanding of how these safety devices and work practices can work to reduce chain-saw related injuries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(2)(i), OSHA is requiring each chain saw placed into initial service after the effective date of this section be equipped with a chain brake. In addition, this paragraph requires that chain saws meet all other requirements of the ANSI standard B175.1&hyph;1991 ``Safety Requirements on Gasoline-Powered Chain Saws.'' This incorporation by reference of ANSI B175.1&hyph;1991, has been approved by the Office of the Federal Register, in accordance with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. The final rule has been revised to reflect this approval and provides the requisite information regarding access to the text of ANSI B175.1&hyph;1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e)(2)(i) also requires that each chain saw placed into service before the effective date of this section be equipped with a protective device that minimizes chain-saw kickback. Finally, this provision also requires that chain-saw kickback devices not be removed or otherwise disabled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule did not require installation of chain brakes or other devices. The proposed rule did, however, require that when such devices were present they should be inspected frequently and maintained. The need for devices to prevent kickback was specifically raised as an issue in the notice of hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA received many comments on whether chain-saw protective devices should be required in the final rule. These comments have been discussed above in the Major Issues section. One commenter suggested that loggers be allowed to remove chain brakes when, in the judgment of the operator the presence of the chain brake creates a hazard greater than the hazard the brake was designed to avoid (Ex. 5&hyph;55). This commenter suggested that it is more hazardous to have a chain brake when the saw is operated on its side and at other unspecified times. However, the commenter did not provide any data or other evidence to support his contention. There is no other data or evidence in the record that chain brakes may create additional hazards at any time during the cutting process. Additionally, OSHA believes that once the chain brake is removed it is likely the operator will leave it off and remain exposed to injury from chain saw kickback. As noted in the earlier discussion, commenters stated that removal of devices is occurring, thereby exposing the operator to the risk of injury due to kickback. Therefore, OSHA is requiring that chain-saw kickback devices not be removed or otherwise disabled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that each gasoline-powered chain saw be equipped with a continuous throttle system which stops the running chain when pressure on the throttle is released. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. OSHA received one comment that stated that if the safety equipment that came with the chain saw were in place, the accidents listed in the preamble would not have occurred (Tr. W1 66). Therefore, this requirement has been retained in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

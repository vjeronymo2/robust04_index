			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Sutherland elected new chief of Gatt MR Peter Sutherland, chairman of Allied Irish Banks and former EC competition commissioner, was yesterday elected by acclamation to be the new director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Sutherland said his immediate priority was to help push the Uruguay Round of global trade talks to 'a quick, comprehensive and far-reaching conclusion'. The talks, launched in 1986, are due to end this December, three years behind schedule. Mr Sutherland, who takes over from Mr Arthur Dunkel on July 1, has been appointed for an initial two-year term renewable for a further four years. The split reflects proposals in the draft Uruguay Round agreement drawn up by Mr Dunkel in December 1991 to create a new more powerful multilateral trade organisation. This would subsume the 111-nation Gatt and proposed sister bodies on trade in services and intellectual property. If the MTO comes into being, Mr Sutherland's terms and conditions would be renegotiated for the remaining four years. For the first two years, he will be paid Dollars 190,000 a year plus a 'representation allowance', a package worth about Dollars 28,000 more than Mr Dunkel. Mr Sutherland yesterday paid tribute to Mr Dunkel for bringing the Uruguay Round negotiations so close to a deal and said the round would remain his personal legacy to the world. The 47-year-old Irishman will be Gatt's fourth director-general since its creation in 1947.</p>

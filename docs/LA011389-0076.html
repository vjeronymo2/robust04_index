			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROHR PLANNING RESEARCH SITE IN CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> In what Chula Vista officials see as an affirmation of its largest employer's  long-term commitment to their city, Rohr Industries said Thursday it plans to  build a major office, research and engineering facility on an 11.5-acre parcel  of land that it acquired this week for $3.25 million.  </P> <P> Rohr, a booming aerospace manufacturer, declined to release details of its  plans for the property, which is next to and north of its 150-acre complex on  Chula Vista's bay front at H Street.  </P> <P> Rohr also declined to say what it will spend developing the site. Before  construction can begin, Rohr faces a plan review that could take a year or  more, officials said.  </P> <P> But Chula Vista redevelopment director Paul Desrochers said the land could  easily accommodate more than 500,000 square feet of office and light industrial  buildings. Rohr eventually will build at least one multistory building on the  site, perhaps a headquarters office structure, Desrochers said.  </P> <P> Boosted by increased worldwide demand for commercial aircraft, Rohr has  experienced rapid growth over the last two years, causing the company to  convert much of the research and engineering space at its H Street facility  into manufacturing use. Rohr makes a variety of jet engine components,  including rings, nacelles and thrust reversers.  </P> <P> Over the last 18 months, Rohr's payroll has grown from 8,000 to 11,000  employees, more than 6,400 of whom work in Chula Vista. Of Rohr's 5.5 million  square feet of plant space companywide, about half is in Chula Vista, company  spokesman Dick Dalton said Thursday. The rest is at eight other sites in the  United States and France.  </P> <P> Rohr's sales for the fiscal year ended July 31 were $906.8 million, up 46% from  the $663.4 million the previous year.  </P> <P> Rohr bought the land from Chula Vista Investors, an investment entity headed by  William J. Barkett. Barkett acquired the property and about 110 more acres on  the Chula Vista bay front in September from a joint venture of Santa Fe  Southern Pacific Corp. and Watt Industries.  </P> <P> Barkett has told the city that he plans to build two 26-story hotel towers  totaling 1,800 rooms on the land just north of the parcel sold to Rohr. The  Radisson Hotel chain has expressed interest in operating one of the planned  towers.  </P> <P> The land sale has been sought by both Rohr and Chula Vista for many years,  Mayor Greg Cox said Thursday. In fact, Chula Vista's redevelopment agency  assisted Barkett in acquiring the land by giving him a $3.25-million "bridge  loan" to cover the cost of the parcel destined for Rohr.  </P> <P> "We are delighted over the sale of the property," Cox said. "It's a good sign  for Rohr and a healthy sign for the city in that it will solidify Rohr's  presence for years into the future."  </P></p>

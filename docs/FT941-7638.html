			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Discrimination case settled Australia's biggest sex discrimination case, involving nearly 700 women and the country's largest company, has been settled nearly 14 years after the case began, Reuter reports from Sydney. Reports said the settlement would cost steel, mining and oil giant Broken Hill Proprietary at least ADollars 7m (Pounds 3.4m) and perhaps as much as ADollars 20m. The case, involving steelworks at Port Kembla, New South Wales, went to the High Court after the women claimed they had been denied work because of their sex.</p>

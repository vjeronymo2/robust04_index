			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Raw material costs limit growth at British Polythene RAW MATERIAL increases adversely affected British Polythene Industries, the acquisitive polythene film products maker, which reported slightly increased pre-tax profits up from Pounds 6.53m to Pounds 6.61m in the half year to June 30. Operating profits slipped from from Pounds 7.81m to Pounds 7.77m on increased sales of Pounds 96.6m (Pounds 85.1m). The group has bought three businesses since it raised Pounds 20.6m earlier this year in a rights issue, taking total acquisitions to 11 since its Pounds 15.5m rights issue in 1991. However, Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive, expects the company's rate of acquisitions to slow down. 'Target companies are attracting higher prices than we believe are justified. We are not willing to pay the prices that people seem to be paying and will therefore wait until the market is more favourable.' Mr McLatchie said the three businesses purchased since March were operating profitably. The company is not planning to manufacture retail bags in a joint venture in China until next year. Borrowings rose to Pounds 14m (Pounds 12.5m), mainly because of acquisitions, representing gearing of 18 per cent. Lower interest rates saw a decline in net interest payable to Pounds 698,000 (Pounds 771,000). Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 12.29p (13.27p). The interim dividend is increased to 3.75p (3.5p).</p>

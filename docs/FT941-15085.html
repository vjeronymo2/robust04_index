			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: No change in fundamental sentiment - London Few equity strategists at the leading UK securities firms appear to be seriously upset by the sudden panic over base rate prospects which has upset the stock market. And, since US influences also shared the blame for the sharp fall in the Footsie at the beginning of the week, it should be said that the US houses in London are still among the optimists when it comes to UK interest rates and inflation. Lehman Brothers sees not one but two further cuts in base rates before the end of June, while Goldman Sachs predicts base rates at 4 1/2 per cent in mid-year. It would not be difficult to round up similar forecasts from strategists at UK broking and investment houses; BZW, raising its year-end Footsie forecast to 3,900, says 'the interest rate environment is better than expected'. So perhaps some investors have been mistaking a bout of profit-taking for a fundamental change of sentiment. Most European stock markets, and certainly London, became overheated before Christmas, and some form of correction was seen as inevitable. But chartists of UK equities applauded when the FT-SE Index bounced from the 3,350 support area on Thursday and by the end of the week it seemed clear that the rest of the market agreed with them. There are other reasons for believing that the stock market may yet show the 6 per cent gain traditionally recorded in January - this is around four times the average monthly gain for the rest of the year. Company results may at long last be showing the signs of benefit from economic recovery for which the market has been searching. The banking sector was impressed by results from TSB, which provided a sound platform for the trading figures due later this month from the rest of the sector. The leisure sector, which is central to hopes for a strengthening in UK consumer spending, is looking ahead more positively after Rank Organisation drew attention to the implications of the rise in holiday bookings. While analysts have tended to keep ratings on Rank itself fairly restrained, in view of the range of its activities, the holiday bookings lesson has not been lost elsewhere. British Airways is favoured as an obvious beneficiary from the expected jump in holiday traffic which began to show itself at Christmas time. Cyclical stocks, including leisures and hotels, have significantly outperformed over the past year but Goldman Sachs is among those to believe that leisures are still sufficiently undervalued to warrant further investment. Perceptions that current valuations on UK equities are generous has brought some repositioning by the institutions but their actions appear positive rather than negative. The more optimistic analysts argue that, while equities may appear overvalued in terms of prospective price/earnings ratios of more than 15 for this year, they should be seen as undervalued in terms of gilt yields or short-term interest rates.</p>

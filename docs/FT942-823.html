			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Economic Watch: Healthy economic growth for France French economic growth in the second quarter was healthy, according to Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, Bank of France governor. He was responding to a question on the bank's latest monthly survey of 12,000 companies. Mr Trichet said the economy had 'all the ingredients' for the growth to be 'durable and provide sound employment'. Inflation would be '2 per cent or less this year and in the years to come'. Mr Eduardo Catroga, Portuguese finance minister, said unemployment would not improve until Portugal's recession-hit economy resumed an annual growth rate of at least 2 per cent. The government does not expect this to happen until 1995.</p>

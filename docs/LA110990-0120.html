			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT: L.A. BROKERS MAY START GETTING THE AX  </P> <P> The broom is about to sweep through many Southland brokerages, as Wall Street  again cuts staff to deal with its continuing business slump.  </P> <P> To many corporate treasurers, money managers and individual investors, the  latest purge of brokers and investment bankers may just seem like more  comeuppance for an industry that enjoyed an orgy of riches in the 1980s.  </P> <P> But the new round of layoffs may hurt more than those getting the pink slips.  The financial services industry's deep retrenchment is threatening to create a  vicious circle that will make it even tougher for many companies to find  financing, more difficult for investors to trade stocks and less likely that  the investment business will ever return to a sense of normalcy.  </P> <P> "Up to now, the industry has cut fat," says Frank Baxter, president of  brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co. in Los Angeles. "Now, they're starting to cut  into the muscle."  </P> <P> In the latest Wall Street purge:  </P> <P> * Prudential-Bache Securities will slash its nationwide investment banking  staff of 180 by about two-thirds. The Los Angeles staff of about eight  investment bankers apparently will be reduced, but a spokeswoman in New York  insisted that Pru-Bache "will continue to have an active investment banking  presence in Los Angeles." However, sources say the firm's San Francisco  investment banking office will be closed.  </P> <P> * Merrill Lynch this week cut 50 investment bankers nationwide, including  several in West Coast offices, a spokeswoman said. Since the beginning of the  year, Merrill has cut its banking staff by 18%, to 575 now from 700.  </P> <P> * First Boston, which trimmed its Los Angeles staff earlier this year, may soon  lose more people here as the firm begins a new round of cutbacks across the  board. Some rival investment bankers believe that First Boston may ultimately  pull out of Los Angeles. The firm won't discuss its plans.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an unknown number of Southland brokers are leaving the business one  by one as clients continue to hibernate from the depressing bear market. "The  guys we're losing are the younger ones who have been in the business two or  three years," says Bob Juneman, senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds  in Los Angeles. "They're finding it very difficult to get enough people on the  books to make a living."  </P> <P> What's significant about the latest cuts is that they follow already severe  brokerage staff reductions that have taken place since the 1987 stock market  crash. Nationwide, securities industry jobs have plunged 19% since 1987, to  210,000 from 260,000.  </P> <P> Yet brokers' business has fallen even faster, as investors have continued to  flee the stock market and as corporate merger activity has dried up with the  slumping economy. Wall Street's desperation to cut investment bankers -- the  people who advise companies on takeovers, stock offerings and other finance  needs -- suggests that brokerage chiefs see no recovery in the economy soon.  </P> <P> Of course, if there's no business for those former hot-shot investment bankers,  it makes sense for them to find something else to do. But the downside for  Southland companies is that Wall Street's bloodletting is further aggravating  the longer-term problem of shrinking liquidity -- the availability of money.  </P> <P> For example, area companies will have fewer financing options if more  investment banking firms pull out of the market. Likewise, the loss of more  stock traders and brokers can make it tougher for investors to buy or sell  stocks. That, in turn, feeds on itself: As big investors in particular find it  more difficult to trade stocks, they trade less. That cuts brokerage revenue  further, which forces the brokerages to launch new cutbacks. On it goes.  </P> <P> Tom Akin, managing director at Merrill Lynch in Los Angeles, says his  institutional trading department has already been cut 15% to 20% over the past  two years, to about 60 people currently. To cut more would damage the  department's long-term prospects, he says. "We're at the point now where you  either rethink your entire business strategy or you hold," Akin says.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, corporate and individual clients alike also may begin to suffer  simply because brokers and investment bankers are under such extreme mental  pressure -- the ultimate threat of being out of work at any moment. "Fear and  paralysis have reduced the intensity of service," says Jefferies' Baxter.  </P> <P> Yet some major Southland companies say that, so far, they feel more pampered  than ever by Wall Street brokerages. The shrinking market is leading many firms  to pound on every door. "They've been very aggressive for our business," says  Bruce Jaffe, executive vice president at electronics distributor Bell  Industries in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Mattel Inc. Chief Financial Officer Jim Eskridge says "they (brokerages) are  all coming in and giving us proposals. Every one of them has a toy company they  think we should buy."  </P> <P> Indeed, if there's any benefit in Wall Street's shrinkage, it's that the people  left should be the best at service, ideas and stamina.  </P> <P> The question is whether that much smaller field will be interested only in big  companies such as Mattel. If so, smaller Southland companies could find it more  difficult to get the financial help they'll need down the road.  </P> <P> But Lloyd Greif, corporate finance chief at brokerage Sutro &amp; Co. in Los  Angeles, believes that regional firms such as his can fill the needs of smaller  firms. In fact, he argues that the cutbacks at major brokerages will help  smaller area businesses rediscover regional brokerages' financial capabilities.  </P> <P> As long as the economy keeps eroding and the stock market keeps falling,  however, the outlook for every brokerage remains troubled at best. Don't count  on the latest firings to be the last. Says one L.A. brokerage chief: "I would  expect there are going to be a lot more bodies floating face down in the pond  between now and February."  </P> <P> Briefly: Another sign of the times on Wall Street: Stockbrokers just entering  the business -- however few there may be in the current market -- will be  getting a special "ethics brochure" mailed to their homes from the National  Assn. of Securities Dealers. The brochure stresses "the need for  professionalism and fair dealing with investors," especially in periods such as  this one, NASD says. . . .  </P> <P> The disclosure Wednesday that San Diego real estate investor M. Larry Lawrence  has taken a 2% stake in Caesars World doesn't answer the big question: Who was  buying in early October? That's when a flurry of activity sent the stock up 25%  to $13.625 a share. Alan Aiello, Lawrence's investment manager, says he wasn't  buying then. Caesars continues to move higher on takeover speculation, up 50  cents to $15.625 on Thursday.  </P></p>

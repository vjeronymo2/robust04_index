			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has reiterated that  Pakistan intends to highlight the Kashmir issue at the  international level, but it will keep the doors open for  bilateral negotiations to resolve the issue.    In an interview with the Dubayy daily KHALEEJ TIMES, she  referred to the changes in the global scenario, saying things  that seemed impossible in the Middle East, South Africa,  Cambodia, and Somalia have now become possible. She said  Pakistan and India cannot remain passive and allow this region  to be a center of tension. Referring to her efforts to find a  solution to the issue, she said that by expressing its  willingness to hold the foreign secretary-level talks that took  place in Islamabad, Pakistan paved the way for negotiations.  This demonstrates our determination to solve this problem on a  bilateral basis. She said, however, that Pakistan does not want  to make bilateral talks an excuse for crushing the Kashmiris.  Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan has made several other proposals,  such as a reduction of forces in Jammu and Kashmir; the  abrogation of barbaric legislation in the occupied valley; the  release of the Hurriat Conference leaders; and permission for  human rights groups, the international mass media, and diplomats  to visit Kashmir.    Answering a question, she said another extremely important  element of Pakistan's foreign policy is improving its relations  with the United States through meaningful talks. The prime  minister said Pakistan does not want these relations to be  limited to the single aspect of the nuclear issue; we want to  make these relations multidimensional. Referring to the  Pressler law, she said Pakistan does not have a nuclear weapon  and has demonstrated a great deal of perseverance and restraint  by refraining from detonating a nuclear explosion. Pakistan has  decided not to exceed the existing limits unless its existence  is threatened. Thus, from a legal point of view, Pakistan has  not violated the Pressler law. She said this law has assumed  the form of a veto that is in India's hands. Benazir Bhutto said  Pakistan welcomes the Clinton administration's policy of  controlling, reducing, and eliminating nuclear programs at the  regional level. On the issue of the F-16 aircraft, she said  Pakistan should receive these aircraft because it was a  commercial deal and Pakistan has already paid for them.  Pakistan should get the F-16's or the money should be refunded.</p>

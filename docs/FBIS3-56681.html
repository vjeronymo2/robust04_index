			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kamin report: "Secret Power Center Begins To Form </F> in State Duma"]    [Text] Differences between the State Duma factions  hampered the process of approval of the heads of the  parliament's lower chamber committees yesterday. This, however,  had no impact on the intention of deputies of various political  orientations to play together the leading role as the primary  legislative organ. Notably, a statement made by Vladimir  Shumeyko, recently elected chairman of the Federation Council,  about a possible shift in the lawmaking center of gravity to the  upper chamber of the Russian parliament met with a negative  assessment from Duma members of the most diverse party  affiliations.    Vladimir Shumeyko's aggressive position toward the Duma is  caused by rather well-founded fears: the economic consequences  of an active influence in the lower chamber by the left-wing  populist forces may prove more appreciable than were the  opposition moods of the Supreme Soviet that the president  disbanded. On the other hand, Shumeyko's point of view was  apparently corroborated by the expectation of serious opposition  to the Duma's left wing by Russia's Choice supporters, something  that could have dragged out work and given cause to accuse the  chamber of inefficiency during the organizational stage (the  elections for speaker, the formation of the committees  leadership).    Much as could have been expected, Shumeyko's statement was  adamantly opposed by members of the Duma. Independent grouping  leaders Irina Khakamada (the 12 December group) and Vladimir  Medvedev (the "Independent Regional Policy" faction) noted that  it held no water from the constitutional point of view.  Yabloko's head Grigoriy Yavlinskiy called it "nonsense."  Aleksandr Pochinok, a Russia's Choice supporter and more  experienced in parliamentary ways, stressed that "Shumeyko is a  strong guy, but bypassing the Duma at the time of forming the  budget would not succeed at all."    At the same time, the outcome of the elections for the heads  of Duma committees showed that the positions of the democratic  blocs are not all that weak -- the committee for budget, taxes,  banks, and finances is lead by Mikhail Zadornov ("Yabloko") with  Aleksandr Pochinok ("Russia's Choice") as his deputy, and  Gennadiy Kulik, former vice premier of Russia, having been  elected as his other deputy. Besides, representatives of the  democratic wing have filled the deputy positions in the economic  policy committee, the privatization committee, and the  industrial committee, of which, however, Vladimir Gusev of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has become chairman. The  opposition has also taken over the offices of the heads of  committees for agrarian questions and for economic policy.    As a result, the alignment of forces does not indicate a  preponderance of supporters of one economic view or the other.  The apparat experience of Duma members such as Anatoliy  Lukyanov, however, around whom an informal center of opposition  leadership is already taking shape, affords a supposition that  the left-wing populists in the Duma may score a success in  voting on fundamental economic questions. Attesting to this is  also a higher level of organization of the opposition supporters  that was already demonstrated during the struggle between  factions last week.</p>

That country's insistence  on getting us to sit on the defendant's bench leads to the same  vicious circle every year," Jose Antonio Perez Novoa, the head  of the Cuban delegation at this commission and the Cuban  ambassador to the UN European office, stated.    The Cuban diplomat considers that the apparent concern of  the  United States and the countries which, almost always due to  pressure, echo such "an immoral manipulation of human rights  with political objectives, do not worry us in the least. Those  concerns are not legitimate because they come from a country  that is incapable of satisfying the most basic rights of its  people and attempts to make another country yield through  hunger," Perez Novoa asserted. He also questioned "the United  States' concern for democracy" because "that country has  financed, supported, and helped the most repressive regimes and  the most brutal dictatorships."    According to the Cuban ambassador, the resolution "does not  worry us because Cuba's only concern is the complete and  absolute development of the Cuban people, as it will allow us to  guarantee the rights we won a long time ago and above all to  maintain the independence and sovereignty we achieved in 1959."    In Perez Novoa's opinion, "it would be absurd to purport  that  the United States end this farce because it has ended the  criminal blockade it imposed on Cuba, alleging that this small  Caribbean island represented a Communist threat."    Cuba -- added the diplomat -- will never refuse dialogue and  cooperation on a truly impartial and objective basis with due  respect to sovereign equality. It will not accept impositions  that only seek to satisfy the whims of the hegemonic power of  the latter part of the 20th century. "We are a free, sovereign  country with the right to choose our own road and find our own  solutions to the problems we confront. This right, this  sovereignty, and this independence will never be negotiable,"  for a country that "after being a colony of slaves is today an  honorable and independent country that will never surrender,"  Cuban Ambassador Perez Novoa asserted.</p>

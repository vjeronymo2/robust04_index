			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Do Not Let the `Phone' Issue Jeopardize the </F> Future of Japan and the United States"]    [Text] On 15 February, the United States announced it has  ruled that "Japan's market is closed for car and portable  phones, violating a 1989 agreement between the two nations." It  plans to draw up within 30 days a list of Japanese products  which will be subject to punitive tariffs. Should Japan fail to  respond with opening its market, the United States is prepared  to initiate sanctions, including imposing punitive tariffs.    However, this matter is difficult for us to understand, no  matter how we look at it.    A bilateral agreement on cellular phone systems guarantees  U.S. access to Japan's market by allocating certain frequencies  to U.S. firms which adopt a transmission system that is  technologically different from that which Japan has already  adopted. In other words, the accord gives equal opportunities  to U.S. firms, but it does not guarantee them equal results  after they have been given a chance to compete with Japanese  firms.    Currently, the issue has been pulled away from the hands of  the government and is now subject to business strategies of  private firms. According to the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications, however, the United States has demanded  during trade talks which have been held so far that Japanese  phone service companies purchase 225,000 portable phones within  the next 18 months because U.S. firms have not made a good  showing.    Apparently, the "results-oriented" trade policy of the  administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton is also reflected  among private firms. No wonder Japan complains that it is  impossible to bring this about, to say the least.    At their meeting last week, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  and President Clinton must have surely confirmed the two nations  would resume talks on their trade issues after a cooling-off  period. The latest U.S. moves rub this agreement in the wrong  way and add more fuel to the bilateral trade friction, rather  than help it cool off.    Since the Japan-U.S. summit meeting has ended in a failure,  we urge that both nations maintain their composure. Should the  two nations, whose combined GNP accounts for 40 percent of the  world's total GNP, find themselves bogged down in a trade war,  it would be harmful not only to themselves, but also to the  whole world.    It cannot be denied that the latest U.S. decision implies a  "retaliatory" measure against Japan for the latter's rejection  of U.S. demands for numerical targets at the framework trade  talks.    It has also been reported that the United States intends to  withdraw a promise it has made at GATT's new round of  multilateral trade talks (Uruguay Round) to reduce tariffs on  electronic products. It is believed the United States has in  mind major Japanese items in connection with this move. After  the summit meeting, the U.S. Government, together with Congress,  has hinted that it is considering various options toward  imposing retaliatory measures against Japan. This is extremely  regrettable.    The United States is resorting to a strategy which includes  sanctions because it believes that, from past experience, Japan  will not change unless there is outside pressure and that, if  pressured, Japan will eventually give in.    Unfortunately, the agreement between the two nations in 1989  regarding opening of Japan's market for car and portable  telephones is a classic example. At the time, the Japanese  Government insisted there were "no more frequencies left for  allotment" to U.S. firms. However, the government gave in to  demands of the U.S. Government, which threatened sanctions by  invoking its 1988 Trade Act. Thus, the government agreed to a  last-minute political settlement which allowed U.S. firms to  gain access to the Japanese market.    Such involuntary market opening maneuvers should now be  discontinued.    Should the U.S. Government initiate sanctions against Japan,  it would be logical for Japan to take its case before  multilateral review under GATT. That, however, would further  escalate the tension between the two nations.    The telecommunications industry can be expected to still  continue making solid growth. We feel Japan and the United  States can further cooperate in fields they are strong in, such  as technological and product development and building  information networks.</p>

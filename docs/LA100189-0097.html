			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'THE OLD ONES ARE DYING OFF AND THE YOUNG ONES LEAVE US';  </P> <P> LITTLE COAL-COUNTRY TOWN RUNNING OUT OF YOUTH, TAXES, TIME  </P> <P> Tired old Jacksonville is running out of coal, youth, taxes and time.  </P> <P> Hanging on with only about 60 residents, caught between decreasing tax revenues  and increasing state pressure to install sewers, the Borough Council has begun  to talk about disbanding and casting Jacksonville's nearly square-mile of  territory to the mercy of neighboring townships.  </P> <P> "If we go another five or 10 years, no one is going to be here anymore," said  Councilman Stanley Gryczuk, 77, a retired miner and butcher.  </P> <P> "The old ones are dying off and the young ones leave us," said Councilwoman  Mary Grimm, 81, a retired cook.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not as Big as Saltsburg  </P> <P> Jacksonville, about 50 miles east of Pittsburgh, was never as big as nearby  Saltsburg. But plentiful coal and hard work kept it on the map, its young folks  close and its future hopeful.  </P> <P> With neat frame houses scattered along a hillside, it boasted as many as 150  residents in the 1930s, mostly coal miners and their families, and even a bank,  barber, butcher, blacksmith and railroad station.  </P> <P> "It was the quietest, nicest town you'd ever want to see," said Jacob Grimm,  84, Mary Grimm's husband, a retired miner and himself a councilman "for, oh,  about 30 years."  </P> <P> Council members say there are fewer people willing, or able, to govern.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Salva, in his 60s, has been too ill to attend a council meeting in  two years.  </P> <P> "We don't expect him to come to the meetings. We bring things to him," Mary  Grimm said. "In the last election, we were trying to get someone new to be the  mayor, but no one would run, so we just wrote Tom in."  </P> <P> The average age of the council members, including the Grimms and Gryczuk, is 71  1/2 years, without counting young Frank Stango.  </P> <P> Stango, 21, a business major at nearby Indiana University of Pennsylvania, was  recruited for the council several years ago by his mother, Councilwoman  Josephine Stango, 56, a part-time postal worker.  </P> <P> Councilman Adam Gordish, a retired coal miner, is 75 years old. His son-in-law,  Robert Yatzkanic, 56, is also a councilman. Delores Yatzkanic, Gordish's  daughter and Yatzkanic's wife, is borough secretary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> GOP Landmarks  </P> <P> Almost everyone is a Democrat. Mary Grimm said there are six Republicans and  she can give directions to each of their houses.  </P> <P> Townsfolk say Yatzkanic, an X-ray technician at a nearby Westinghouse Electric  Corp. plant, is one of the half-dozen or so people in Jacksonville still  working.  </P> <P> "Everybody's retired," Mary Grimm said. "We have more widows in town than  anyone else. The young people grow up, go to school and then they leave."  </P> <P> The council also expects young Stango to leave town one of these days. It  recently won permission from a Common Pleas Court judge to allow it to  eventually reduce its numbers from seven to five members.  </P> <P> "Jacksonville's as big as it's going to get," Stango said with a shrug. "Unless  something comes this way, I don't see any reason for anyone to move in."  </P> <P> The borough has no property, no municipal building and no equipment of its own.  The council pays $10 to meet once a month in a classroom at the United  Presbyterian Church about halfway up Mill Street.  </P> <P> Delores Yatzkanic estimated the borough's annual budget at about $19,000,  mostly to keep water in a few fire hydrants, street lights illuminated and Mill  Street and a few side roads repaired and plowed.  </P> <P> "We didn't have to name our side streets until we got ambulance service," Mary  Grimm said.  </P> <P> The borough pays a man with a pickup truck $45 to plow and sand the streets  whenever it snows.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State Demanded $700 a Year  </P> <P> Council members were shocked when a state agency said Jacksonville must  contribute $700 a year for unemployment insurance for the trucker and the  borough's part-time attorney.  </P> <P> They are angry that state or Indiana County officials often charge the borough  the same standard governmental fees paid by larger communities, such as  Indiana, the county seat of about 16,000 people.  </P> <P> Most public tasks, such as patching a municipal road, are too small for local  contractors to bother with, Gryczuk said. Bigger projects would jolt the  municipal budget and the taxpayers.  </P> <P> "We have to wait three or four years to accumulate enough money to get a road  fixed," Gryczuk said.  </P> <P> Council members also are worried about a potential financial knockout -- a  longstanding demand by the state Department of Environmental Resources that  Jacksonville install a sewer system to replace septic tanks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sewer Charges  </P> <P> Josephine Stango said the latest estimates put the cost for sewers at about $40  per month for each homeowner, mostly for interest on the capital expenditure.  </P> <P> She said the borough doesn't have the money for engineering studies for the  sewer project. Mary Grimm said most residents can't afford sewers anyway.  </P> <P> At the Golden Pheasant tavern on the two-lane state highway, owner Eddie Sklar,  himself a former councilman, worried that new talk of disbanding the  municipality may cost him his liquor license eventually.  </P> <P> "This is my livelihood," he said. "I don't want to lose it."  </P> <P> Sklar suggested that the borough can save money by asking homeowners to pay for  the street lights near their homes and by asking neighboring townships to run  their plows down Mill Street occasionally.  </P> <P> He said council members should have installed sewers years ago, when costs  would have been less.  </P> <P> Sklar was instrumental in getting an oil driller to sink the community's water  well just outside the borough line for free.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acknowledges Difficulty  </P> <P> But he concedes that running a little town is difficult. When he was a  councilman more than a decade ago, for example, he recalls that the borough  received $180 in revenue-sharing money, but had to spend $144 on a required  newspaper advertisement to describe publicly how the money would be spent.  </P> <P> Josephine Stango said officials are reluctant to break up the borough, which  was founded in 1853 and named after President Andrew Jackson.  </P> <P> "We would never disband if it would hurt anybody," she said.  </P> <P> Still, with an eye on lowering taxes and benefiting from ample road equipment  in neighboring municipalities, council members say they are considering  overtures to officials of adjacent Black Lick and Young townships.  </P> <P> "But who would take us?" Mary Grimm said. "We don't know."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 KYODO -- The leadership of the  Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan  -- SDPJ] on Tuesday drew up a blueprint of a new coalition  government on the premise that the coalition government of Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata resign voluntarily.    The blueprint said a new government, in which the SDP hopes  to take part, should have a basic philosophy of democracy,  freedom, fairness and peace based on respect for the  Constitution.    A third coalition government must establish trustworthy  relations among the coalition parties, it said, indirectly  criticizing the formation in late April of a parliamentary group  by other coalition partners excluding the SDP.    The SDP withdrew from the coalition following the formation,  forcing Hata to form the first minority government in 39 years.    Basic policies of a new coalition government should be  agreement among parties on the coalition governments of Morihiro  Hosokawa and Tsutomu Hata, it said.    As for tax system reform, the blueprint calls for abolition  of the consumption tax and agrees to raise indirect tax to cope  with the aging of society. It wants to enact bills for tax  system reform by the end of the year.    The SDP urges the peaceful settlement of the North Korean  nuclear issue by cooperating with the United States, South  korea, China and Russia.    The plan also proposed setting up a council of Diet leaders  and holding regular summit meetings of the parties to ensure  transparency of decision-making procedures.    The SDP has said it will return to the ruling coalition if  Hata and his cabinet ministers resign en masse voluntarily.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Monday his party will  move to form a caretaker government with the largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to oversee a general election if  talks with the coalition fail.    The LDP plans to submit a no-confidence motion against the  Hata cabinet after passage of the state budget for fiscal 1994,  expected Thursday. If a no-confidence vote is approved, Hata  must either dissolve the House of Representatives for a snap  general election or disband his cabinet en masse.</p>

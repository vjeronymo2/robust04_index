			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 3 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese and  British experts on the airport committee, after a six-month  break, restarted talks here this afternoon, focusing on the  fourth financing proposal put forward by the British side  earlier.    After today's meeting, Chinese representative Hu Houcheng  said that China has always backed the idea of building a new  airport in Hong Kong.    China puts emphasis on efficiency and cost for the project,  which should cause no financial burden on the future special  administrative region of Hong Kong, Hu said, adding that the  Chinese side had made suggestions for the British latest  proposal.    The British representative said that the common ground  between the two sides is quite considerable, but they have to  make a bit more efforts in order to resolve the remaining  technical issues.    In answer to media questions on this afternoon's session, a  government spokesman described the meeting as "friendly and  positive".    "This afternoon the Chinese side asked various questions  about our fourth financing proposal, and we will be providing  them with answers as soon as possible," the spokesman added.</p>

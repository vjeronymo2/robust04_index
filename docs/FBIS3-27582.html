[Zhang Yulai] Since the 14th CPC National Congress, the  building of the socialist market economy structure has developed  very quickly. However, some problems worthy of attention have  cropped up, such as overheated investment in fixed assets,  excessively fast development in the development zones, and  excessive credit scale and monetary input. Why is it that  whenever we talk about developing the economy, people think of  speeding up capital construction, expanding scale, and  increasing investment?    [Meng Xianzhong] All these problems reflect a long-standing  conspicuous problem in the economic construction of our country:  People have attached importance to the speed of the economy  while ignoring the quality of the state economy and have been  accustomed to the quantitative type of economy which increases  extension while failing to meet the requirement of taking  economic results as the center.    Economic development, of course, includes accelerating the  speed of economic development and increasing the percentage  growth of the GNP and this is of great significance. However,  we cannot belittle the improvement of the quality of the state  economy. In view of the present tendency to attach importance  to quantity while belittling quality, I think that it is  urgently necessary to make clear that to improve the quality of  the state economy is a pressing task in building the market  economy.    [Zhang] What is the meaning of the concept "the quality of  the state economy?"    [Meng] All things are determined by quality and quantity.  In the same way, the state economy is also determined by  quality and quantity. The quantity of the state economy means  the scale and speed of economic reality and economic  development. The quality of the state economy is about whether  or not the economic structure of a country is rational and  whether or not its economic operations are highly efficient. To  be specific, the quality of a country's economy is determined by  various factors, such as the rationality of the industrial  structure, the foundation and main propelling forces of economic  development, various rates of input and output, labor  productivity, and the amount of national income generated by the  social GNP.    As viewed from our macroindustrial structure, facts clearly  show that the second and tertiary industries are not developed.  Therefore, we must make great efforts to develop the second and  tertiary industries. As viewed from the industrial and  transportation fields, structural contradictions between  industries have become more and more conspicuous. In  particular, infrastructure like railway transportation and the  support capacities of basic industries are still quite weak. At  present, railway transportation can only meet 60 to 70 percent  of the needs of freight transport and has become a "bottleneck"  in our economic development. To speed up our economic  development, we are first faced with the task of readjusting the  industrial structure to make it more rational and modern.    In assessing the quality of the economy from the angle of  the  industrial structure, it is also necessary to look at the  internal structure of each industry. In recent years, for  example, although the percentage of industrialization in some  localities has been greatly increased, the industrialization in  many localities is at a low level. This means that, although  industrial production has become the dominant social production  activities in these localities, the products turned out are  mainly primary products which consume visible resources and the  value added to them by means of high-technology and  new-technology is quite low. They are in an unfavorable  position in commodity exchanges. In 1992, it turned out that of  the 500 enterprises with the best economic results, over 70 were  cigarette plants; of the top 500 enterprises in handing over  profits and taxes to the state, more than 90 were breweries. In  1993, ranking first and second in the 500 enterprises with the  best economic results in our country were also tobacco  processing and beverage enterprises. In the United States and  Japan, almost all of the top 500 enterprises with the best  economic results are industrial enterprises using  high-technology or using a large percentage of high technology.  Only a few tobacco enterprises, Philip Morris, British American  Tobacco, Japan, Spain, and Renault [lei nuo 7191 6179] are among  the world's 500 biggest financial groups. [names as published]  Besides, all these tobacco enterprises have diversified  business. Just think, when the tobacco processing and beverage  industries have become the main industrial enterprises with good  economic results in a country, how can we talk about economic  competitive power or comprehensive national strength?  Nevertheless, some localities are still expanding the production  of cigarettes and wine.    [Zhang] You said there are problems in the industrial  structure of our country. What is the relationship between the  foundation and propelling forces of economic development and the  quality of the state economy?    [Meng] The central resources and propelling forces of  economic development vary in different historical periods. In  the agricultural society, land was the central resource and  agricultural labor was the main force propelling economic  development; in the modern society, industrial capital was the  central resource and production with machines on a large scale  was the main propelling force; and since the second half of the  20th century, human capital has become the central resource for  economic development and science, technology, and culture have  become the main propelling forces in economic development. At  present, 50 to 70 percent of the GNP in developed countries is  created by the input of science, technology, and culture. That  the input of science, technology, and culture has become the  main propelling force implies among the input of resources,  power, capital, labor, science, technology, and culture, that  science, technology, and culture account for a greater  percentage and the output of science, technology, and culture is  high. Only this represents the level of modern production.  China proves definitely inferior in this respect. The rate of  industrial products contributed by science, technology, and  culture is less than 30 percent and, in recent years, the  percentage in a few provinces and municipalities has tended to  decrease.    [Zhang] Please tell us more about the question of the  input-output ratio.    [Meng] Viewed from various individual input-output ratios,  the quality of the energy utilization coefficient, the profit  and tax rate of capital, and the economic results of investment  in fixed assets are low. The energy consumption of unit GNP of  China is six times that of Japan and more than twice that of the  United States. The profit and tax rate of capital in China is  only equivalent to one-quarter to one-third of that of the  developed countries. The economic results of investment in  fixed assets in our country is even more worrying. Of the  existing 2,200 billion yuan in fixed assets, those lying idle  and those with a low utilization rate account for one-third,  almost as much as 700 billion yuan. This means the economic  result of one-third of them is very little.    [Zhang] It seems that a low input-output ratio implies great  waste. Please tell me more about the level of social labor  productivity in our country.    [Meng] Compared with the developed countries, the social  labor productivity in our country is quite low. Let's take the  auto industry for instance. The biggest auto production group  in our country has 100,000 workers and staff members. Its total  sales volume in 1991 was about 6.2 billion yuan. The  accumulated number of automobiles produced since the plant was  set up 40 years ago is less than 2 million. Japan's Toyota Auto  Corporation has less than 100,000 workers and staff members.  Its sales volume in 1991 was $65.454 billion. Germany's  Mercedes-Benz has 376,000 workers and staff members. Its sales  volume in 1991 was $54.259 billion. The number of automobiles  turned out each year by either of the last two auto corporations  exceeds 2 million. Just think, without a high labor  productivity and without a good quality of the economy, how can  we compete with other countries after reentering the GATT.    What is especially worthy of our attention is that in recent  years, although the output value of some provinces and  municipalities has grown very fast, the labor productivity has  fallen. This shows that the economic growth of these provinces  and municipalities is the outcome of a high input of manpower,  financial resources, material resources, and energy resources  instead of raising the labor productivity. It should be pointed  out that this kind of high output and high speed have covered up  the fall in the labor productivity.    [Zhang] It seems that without improving the quality of the  state economy, it will be difficult to increase our economic  strength and the comprehensive national strength, or to compete  with other countries. In particular, the per capita possession  of reserves of major minerals, clean water, farmland, forests,  or pastoral land in our country is below the world's per capita  level and the per capita possession of nonregenerated energy  reserves is also below the world's per capita level. If we  blindly seek a high output value and a high speed by means of a  high input, we shall inevitably damage the conditions for  sustained production and the capacity to expand reproduction.    [Meng] It is precisely so. Let us look again at the  question of the formation of the national income by the social  gross output value. This question has a bearing on the final  economic results. In the 1950's, 100 yuan of social gross output  value resulted in over 50 yuan in national income. However, in  the 1980's, the amount went down to just over 30 yuan instead of  going up. This shows clearly that the quality of our economy  urgently needs improvement.    In short, developing the economy by improving the quality of  the state economy or one-sidedly developing the economy by a  high input and a high consumption rate are two different ways of  thinking which will lead to two different results and prospects.  We should never overlook this. During his inspection tour of  the south at the beginning of 1992, Deng Xiaoping, while  stressing the necessity of quickening economic construction,  explicitly pointed out: It is necessary to pay attention to  quality, economic results, and the export-oriented type  enterprises and "to develop the economy faster, we must depend  on science, technology, and education." In the report from the  14th CPC National Congress, it is also explicitly pointed out  that the economic construction of our country should realize two  kinds of transition. One is the transition from the planned  economy structure to the market economy structure and the other  is the transition from a quantity-type economy to an economic  result-type economy. Many of us have paid attention only to  speeding up the development of the economy while overlooking the  necessity of depending on science, technology, and education to  develop the economy. At present, the people have a greater  awareness of the transition to the market economy but their  awareness of the transition to an economic result-type economy  is still very vague.    [Zhang] How do you think the quality of the state economy  can be improved?    [Meng] Consumers should have awareness of the quality of  commodities, enterprises should have awareness of the quality of  the products, and the leadership at all levels should have  awareness of the quality of the state economy. To the  leadership at all levels, awareness of the quality of the state  economy is the most important awareness of the economy. The  improvement of the quality of the state economy is a system  engineering project and there is much work to do in this  respect. The most important thing is to depend on improving the  quality of the national science, technology, and culture and on  training capable personnel.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On Monday President Boris Yeltsin signed the federal  budget law for the second quarter of 1994 which binds the  government to finance spending in the first half of the year  based on the guidelines for 1994.    The Central Bank was ordered to offer the government a  credit  of 10.6 trillion rubles to cover the budget deficit. The credit  is given for 10 years at 10 percent annual interest with  repayment in equal installments as of 1998.    To restrict spending on federal government bodies the  following ceilings have been set on current expenditures: 82 Bn  rubles to the presidential administration, 11.303 Bn to the  Council of the Federation of the Federal Assembly, 27.754 Bn to  the State Duma, 15.189 Bn to the government (except ministries  and departments).    The federal budget expenditures approved by parliament last  week are set at 46 trillion rubles (25.2 percent of the annual  figure), revenue - 28.6 trillion (23.7 percent of the annual  sum) with a deficit of l7.4 trillion. The budget law came into  force immediately after being signed by the president.</p>

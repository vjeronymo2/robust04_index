			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira tumbles to an historic low THE LIRA tumbled to an all-time low against the D-Mark yesterday, undermined by the investigations into the alleged criminal connections of Italian politicians, writes James Blitz. The Italian currency reached its lowest point in history of L991.50 against the D-Mark at the start of European trading yesterday, but later recovered ground to close at L987.6, some L11.5 down on the day. The currency came under heavy selling pressure in the European morning after weekend reports that Italian magistrates had told Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister, that he was under investigation for possible connections with organised crime. The inclusion of the highly respected Mr Andreotti in the investigation of officials appeared to imply that the political crisis in Italy had few bounds. The rise in Italy's projected budget deficit for this year to 167 trillion lire also helped to depress the currency. Dealers said the Bank of Italy intervened on currency markets, buying the lira as it hit the historic low. Mr Neil MacKinnon, an economist at Citibank in London, said that if the currency crossed L991.50 to the D-Mark again, the next support level would be L1035. Far from weakening on the morrow of the second round in France's National Assembly election, the French franc rallied strongly. It closed at FFr3.393 to the D-Mark from a previous close of FFr3.405. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London, believes that if the franc holds to this level until Thursday, the Bank of France may cut its intervention rate, currently at 12 per cent. However, he believes the French franc may come under a speculative attack once the new prime minister and government have been named. Several economists pointed out that the franc's rally yesterday was not underpinned by large- scale flows into the currency. Sterling fell back  1/4 pfennig against the D-Mark yesterday, because of renewed speculation in the UK that the government might be forced to bring down interest rates again. UK building societies have threatened to put up mortgage rates in an attempt to compete with the high rates on the British government's National Savings instruments. The pound closed at DM2.4275. The dollar continued to look very soft against the D-Mark in spite of a reasonably strong set of US economic indicators, including a rise in February's single homes sales by 4.6 per cent. The market failed to respond to the indicators, partly because of low volumes and book squaring at the end of the first quarter. However, the dollar is capped by expectations that Friday's non-farm payroll figure will be weak, rising by a modest 80,000 in the view of some dealers. The dollar closed at DM1.6280, down about  1/4 pfennig on the day. In New York it finished lower at DM1.6258.</p>

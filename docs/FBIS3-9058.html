An MP for the Bulgarian Socialist  Party asked the defence minister if some destabilization of the  Bulgarian Army could be expected after some ten days ago part of  the members of the Rakovski Officers Legion launched a sign-in  for an address to the Ministry of Defence and parliament setting  out their demands; the officers who signed the address were  disciplined.    The sign-in campaign is not a revolt against the Ministry of  Defence as the press wrote, Mr. Aleksandrov said. In his  opinion, the case is a reflection of the army's actual problems  which have been raised and discussed more than once. The  officers' major demand, out of 21, is unacceptable, Minister  Aleksandrov said. It is for a budget appropriation of 37  billion leva for the army in 1994; under the National Budget Act  which Parliament already passed, the army is allocated 12  billion. The 1994 Budget Act is already a fact and there is no  room in the army for those who do not want to comply with it,  the defence minister said. As to the other demands, Mr.  Aleksandrov admits that "though disputable and badly worded,  they are grounded to some extent." According to the defence  minister, the real problem is not the officers' demands but the  means they have used in trying to resolve the existing issues.  He described the sign-in campaign as "a conspicuous violation  of the Constitution and breach of the Armed Forces' statute"; in  his opinion, the culprits got their just deserts: A commander  was punished by a dishonourable discharge from the army on  disciplinary grounds, the other officers who had taken part in  the sign-in were disciplined.    The defence minister said that according to a special poll  conducted in the army by his order, the seeds of populism fell  in good soil in the armed forces, while the financial  difficulties and the opportunity for manipulations they offer  could explode the situation.</p>

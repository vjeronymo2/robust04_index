			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Airlines hit at levy on departures The introduction tomorrow of an airport departure tax in Britain was attacked yesterday by the International Air Transport Association as an example of government taxation policies undermining the recovery of the airline industry. Mr Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the trade organisation that represents more than 200 international airlines, criticised the tax in his annual report, prepared for the association's annual meeting in Mexico City today. Mr Jeanniot said that the Pounds 325m the UK levy would raise would go directly to the Treasury. 'Taxes simply increase airline costs at a time when consumers are demanding lower fares,' he said. The association said the industry had lost Dollars 4.1bn (Pounds 2.6bn) on international scheduled services alone last year and had losses for the past four years totalling Dollars 15.6bn. But things were improving, with traffic growing more quickly than capacity. Mr Jeanniot said airlines were expected to show a modest profit on international scheduled services of about Dollars 1bn this year. But he warned that 'profitability of Dollars 1bn would represent less than 1 per cent of turnover against a steady requirement for 5 to 6 per cent.' The tax has been attacked by UK airlines, which say that it will distort competition because it does not apply to other forms of transport. It has caused problems for airlines because of confusion about the rate to be charged for different European countries. The tax involves a levy of Pounds 5 for travel to European destinations and Pounds 10 to other international destinations. Airlines expected the Pounds 5 levy to apply only to European Union member states, however, and have been charging Pounds 10 for travel after November 1 to European destinations outside the EU. But the tax for all European destinations has now been set at Pounds 5, and airlines will be refunding passengers who have been overcharged when they check-in. A British Airways official said: 'This is causing us a big headache.' Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, has said that revenues from the new tax should be ploughed back into improving UK aviation infrastructure. The government has countered that the UK was one of the few remaining countries which did not levy an airport departure tax. Lex, Page 18</p>

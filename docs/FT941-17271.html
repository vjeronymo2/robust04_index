			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Yeltsin plans curbs on abuses of privatisation by voucher Russian president Boris Yeltsin published a decree yesterday aiming to conclude a voucher privatisation programme by July, amid increasing fears about protection for small investors. In what one investment fund manager predicted would turn into a 'series of loud scandals over the next six months', Russian citizens face growing risks on the country's weakly regulated financial markets. Every night, television viewers, already confused about how to invest privatisation vouchers that were distributed to all citizens last year, face a deluge of advertisements from investment funds licensed to invest in a broad portfolio of companies on behalf of voucher holders. Yesterday, MMM-Invest promised to turn vouchers into 'gold', saying its portfolio of shares had increased in value 82.7 times. Another, Neft-Almaz-Invest (literally, Oil-Diamond-Invest) promised to pay an annual dividend of 750 per cent. But one fund manager, Mr Vladimir Koshelev, said last night his fund, called Programma Privatisatsiya, would not be paying any dividends this year, and that other funds should not promise big payouts. He pointed out that many privatised enterprises were precarious. Reliability is the pitch made by Mr Koshelev's own fund, which even uses the same logo as a government ad for the mass privatisation campaign. But Mr Koshelev sees nothing wrong with his own fund's TV ad - claiming European Community endorsement because it had been given a Euromarket trophy. The Financial Times has confirmed that the award was granted to all paying guests at a Dollars 3,900-per-couple seminar held in Brussels last month by a private organisation called the European Market Research Centre (EMRC). The award was included in what Ms Florence Daxhelet, deputy co-ordinator of EMRC, described as the 'global price for the seminar'. The EMRC's brochure claims the patronage of the European Commission's Directorate-General 23, responsible for business development, although Ms Daxhelet said EMRC received no financial support from it. European Union officials made clear that this award could not confer Commission endorsement. Mr Yeltsin's decree outlines which enterprises can be privatised and exempts investment funds from tax on dividend income. Re-selling shares for a capital gain is difficult in a highly illiquid market. Trading in vouchers is illegal. Risk extends to all manner of financial services. The central bank last week broadcast a statement warning investors off the GMM investment trust, which has a Dutch registration. Last night, GMM issued its own press release, the contents of which were also broadcast on television. However, it only denied newspaper allegations that it had funded the neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky - not mentioning the central bank's announcement that GMM had no licence to conduct its banking operations.</p>

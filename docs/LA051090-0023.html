			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEMORRHOID ADVICE  </P> <P> Question: I would appreciate any advice you can give me as to how I could  modify my diet to lessen the problem I have with hemorrhoids. I have already  made it a point to have a high-fiber cereal for breakfast each morning.  </P> <P> Is there anything else?  </P> <P> Answer: Whole grain foods, including bran breakfast cereals, should be a part  of a diet for anyone bothered with hemorrhoids. Other whole grain foods include  whole grain bread, brown rice and unprocessed oatmeal.  </P> <P> Fruits and vegetables should also be incorporated into your diet, particularly  apples and oranges, prunes, carrots and green leafy vegetables. In addition,  try to have six to seven glasses of water, including fruit juices, each day. On  the other side, limit your consumption of alcohol and stay away from foods that  are highly seasoned.  </P> <P> In addition to diet, I suggest you participate in a program of exercise on a  regular basis. This will improve circulation and muscle tone, and help your  condition.  </P> <P> For Duane, Lansing, Mich.: Polyunsaturated fats are usually found in vegetables  and vegetables oils.  </P></p>

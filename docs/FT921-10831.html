			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Universities agree to start merger steps LEICESTER University and Loughborough University of Technology have agreed the first steps of a collaboration that may lead to a merger later in the decade. Such a merger would be the first in the UK between two independent universities, each with its own charter. A joint committee, set up by Mr Ken Edwards of Leicester and Professor Den Davies of Loughborough, the vice-chancellors of the universities, have decided to: set up a joint research fund; formulate joint research proposals; undertake the joint teaching of undergraduates; reconvene the joint committee in about 18 months to discuss merger. The merger idea was floated last May and endorsed by the universities' senates. Since then working parties have been examining the feasibility of the idea. The weekend decision to collaborate rather than work immediately towards merger springs from concern about future funding of a joint institution. Mr Edwards said: 'Never has higher education been in a state of such uncertainty.' The vice-chancellors believe that it will take at least 15 months before results of the government's planned changes in the funding of higher education and in the support given to research will become apparent. Lack of clarity about future funding concerns indivi-dual departments at both universities, strengthening internal opposition to merger. The case for merger rests on the proximity of the two universities, which are just 12 miles apart, and their similarity in size. Each of the universities has about 6,000 students and about 270 full-time academic staff, and they also each offer largely complementary courses. Leicester was created as a university in 1957, Loughborough in 1966. The main 37-acre Leicester campus is in the city and is fully developed. Loughborough has 216 acres with room for expansion.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Cost cuts hold Suzuki Motor to 11.5% decline SUZUKI Motor, the Japanese car and motorcycle maker, yesterday reported an 11.5 per cent fall to Y9.35bn (Dollars 76m) in parent-company pre-tax profits in the half-year to September. The results, relatively robust compared with most Japanese vehicle makers, were underpinned by a 2.7 per cent rise in sales to Y518.5bn. Exports of motorcycles were particularly strong, with sales up by 32.6 per cent to 203,416 units. Unlike many competitors, Suzuki reduced general administrative and sales costs, from Y66.8bn to Y61.8bn. As a result, Suzuki's operating profits rose by 43.4 per cent to Y13.79bn. But the pre-tax figure was dragged down by a sharp deterioration in non-operating costs, following an improvement last year. Non-operating costs were Y4.49bn, against non-operating income last year of Y990m. Sales of motorcycles rose by 14.3 per cent to Y88.8bn, while car sales climbed by 1.2 per cent to Y367.4bn. Although Suzuki's mini-car business was hit by a decline in Japan's mini-car market, with sales off by 6.2 per cent to 235,634 units, sales of small cars with engines under 2,000cc rose by 25.9 per cent to 29,147. Total unit sales of motorcycles were up by 8.2 per cent to 203,416 units, while car sales were down by 2.3 per cent to 403,057 units. Net profits fell by 14.3 per cent to Y4.14bn.</p>

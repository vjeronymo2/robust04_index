This is what  Comrade Wang Qun set forth at the regional forum on setting up  the rural and pastoral social service system.    The regional forum on setting up the rural and pastoral  social service system was held in Ulanqab League on 26-27  February. Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee;  and Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the regional party committee  and chairman of the regional government, attended and addressed  the forum. The forum was chaired by Bai Enpei, deputy secretary  of the regional party committee and head of the regional leading  group in charge of the rural and pastoral work; and Yun Bulong,  vice chairman of the regional government. Present at the forum  were over 60 persons, including responsible persons of leagues  and cities in charge of agricultural and livestock work,  regional departments concerned, and some banners and counties.    The comrades participating in the forum heard the  introductions of the experiences in promoting organizational  reform, developing "leading economy," and setting up the  socialist service system, gained by Qahar Right Wing Rear  Banner, Wuchuan County, Tongliao city, Ningcheng County, Linhe  city, Xi Ujimqin Banner, and three townships and villages of  Qahar Right Wing Rear Banner and Liangcheng County; and also  proceeded from reality to deeply discuss the issues of deepening  reform and accelerating the setup of the overall service system.    Comrade Wang Qun prominently stressed the important  significance of setting up and perfecting the rural and pastoral  social service system. He pointed out: Accelerating the setup  of the rural and pastoral social service system is an important  measure for implementing the guidelines of the third session of  the 14th party Central Committee and the central policy on  grasping favorable opportunities to deepen reform, expand the  scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain  stability; a priority to deepening the rural and pastoral  reform; a reliable way for speeding up economic development and  making the people, towns, townships, sumu, banners, and counties  rich; an urgent demand for promoting organizational reform, the  change of government functions, and the transfer of personnel,  alleviating the financial difficulties of banners and counties,  and maintaining social stability; and the necessary way for  introducing agriculture, animal husbandry, and the rural and  pastoral economy to markets, accelerating the setup of the  socialist market economic system, promoting the combination of  urban and rural areas, coordinating development, and making the  peasants and herdsmen become fairly well-off as soon as  possible. Setting up a perfect social service system is  deepening the rural and pastoral reform and accelerating the  pace of development. This will gigantically promote the  region's reform, development, and stability.    Comrade Wang Qun stressed: Accelerating the setup of the  rural and pastoral social service system is a hard job. Whether  or not we win a victory in this battle is a grim test for the  cadres at various levels. The leaders at various levels should  be promoters of progress, foster a sense of high responsibility  and a sense of high urgency, foster the idea that development  can be accelerated and stability can be maintained only by  accelerating reform, firmly grasp the current favorable  opportunity which is conducive to agricultural and livestock  development, conscientiously conduct study and make  arrangements, organize forces to boldly engage in practice, and  strive to make achievements as soon as possible.    Comrade Wang Qun urged: The party committees and governments  at various levels should realistically strengthen the leadership  over the setup of the rural and pastoral social service system.  We should persistently streamline superstructure, strengthen  the grass roots, change functions, intensify service, and  mobilize a large number of young cadres and science  professionals and technicians to bring into play their wisdom  and intelligence at the service organizations. According to the  "three-conducive" principles and in line with actual conditions,  we should formulate appropriate policies, conscientiously  provide service organizations with production bases, and create  necessary conditions for setting up and developing the service  system. Leagues, cities, banners, and counties should mobilize  their leading bodies; organize and send, in a well-planned  manner, cadres to towns, townships, and sumu; help conduct  specific study and solve their working problems; and grasp the  work of townships one after another.    Comrade Wu Liji said in his speech: At present, our region  is entering a new key stage of rural and pastoral reform. The  broad masses of peasants and herdsmen are advancing from having  sufficient foods and clothing to being fairly well-off.  Therefore, we should grasp the current favorable opportunities  to accelerate the pace of conducting organizational reform and  setting up an overall service system. It is urgent to  vigorously develop the "dragon-shaped economy" characterized by  having peasant households become shareholders of companies,  linking enterprises with production bases, combining production  and processing with marketing, and making trade, industry,  agriculture, animal husbandry, and science a coordinate process.  The governments at various levels should positively change  functions and work style, intensify service, and bring into full  play their functions for serving the rural and pastoral areas,  the peasants, and the herdsmen. Comrade Wu Liji set forth  specific opinions on working out necessarily relaxed policies to  encourage office cadres, science professionals, and technicians  to positively make contributions at overall service  organizations.</p>

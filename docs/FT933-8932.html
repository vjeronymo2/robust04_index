			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Schering stars as Germany joins afternoon rise BOURSES climbed consistently over the day, a trend reflected dramatically in Germany where the Ibis-indicated, post-bourse DAX index rose to 1,894.63, up 1.6 per cent from its earlier close on short covering and foreign buy orders, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT ended the official session with the DAX just 0.64 higher at 1,865.80 as turnover fell from DM8.9bn to DM8.4bn. The big winner at this level was Schering, the pharmaceutical group, which closed DM54 higher at DM926 and went on to DM935, up 7.2 per cent on the day, after hours. Schering said in New York last night that its Betaseron multiple sclerosis drug will yield a yearly average of Dollars 8,500 to Dollars 10,000 per patient. Mr Mark Tracey, of Goldman Sachs in London, raised his earnings estimates on this basis and is now forecasting 30 per cent annual earnings growth from DM40 a share in 1993. Meanwhile, the construction group, Hochtief, rose DM23 to DM1,148 as it confirmed that the British government had invited it to bid for a contract to build a high-speed rail link between the Channel Tunnel and London. Mr Michael Geiger, of NatWest Securities, thought it unlikely that Hochtief would get the contract but the invitation highlighted its attractions on a 1994 p/e of 14.7, adjusted for work in progress, off-balance sheet work, overstated provisions and Hochtief's virtual 20 per cent stake in its competitor, Holzmann. Meanwhile PWA, the paper group, and Kugelfischer, the ball bearing manufacturer, rose DM5.80 to DM182.80 and DM6 to DM140 for two-day gains of DM13.30, and DM17 respectively. Mr Geiger said that while DAX stocks are nearing their all-time highs, a number of companies in the broader market still have a long way to go; all-time highs for PWA and Kugelfischer are DM349, and DM507. PARIS reported strong foreign buying and domestic institutional selling as the CAC-40 index rose by 27.61 or 1.3 per cent to a new high of 2,167.39. Interest rate hopes were behind the buying, as the Bank of France cut its 24-hour lending rate for the second time this week. Turnover was unusually heavy at FFr5.4bn, up from FFr3.45bn. Suez traded in an exceptionally heavy 1.28m shares as the share price climbed FFr8.40 to FFr345.40 ahead of an expected change in its CAC-40 weighting today. Michelin rose another FFr5.70 to FFr199.20 as Lehman Brothers, which gave the stock an outperform rating on Tuesday, said that European tyre stocks were cheap relative ot other automotive stocks, and that the market could focus on the French market-leader as the new big cost-cutting story. MADRID gave foreign buying, and lower rates in the interbank and secondary debt markets the credit for its new high as the general index closed 2.55 higher at 274.18. Turnover climbed from Pta12.53bn to Pta20.75bn. Banesto stood out with a rise of Pta345, or nearly 15 per cent to Pta2,675 on the success of its capital raising operations. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index rose 2.50 to 127.10 as cyclical stocks received a boost from better than expected half year figures from Hoogovens. Strong foreign demand developed from London and New York, while local traders continued to cover substantial short positions. Hoogovens rose Fl 4.80 to a 12-month high of Fl 51.30. Among other cyclicals, DSM added Fl 3.10 to Fl 98.30 and Akzo was up Fl 4.40 at Fl 170.50. KLM rose Fl 2.20 or 6.4 per cent to a 12 month high of Fl 36.60 on plans to scrap its Royal Class service and increase the number of tourist class seats. MILAN began nervously, still assessing Ferruzzi and Montedison's troubles, but the market picked up early losses as the outlook for lower interest rates lifted the mood. The Comit index ended 0.01 higher at 588.78. Fiat continued higher in rumour-driven trade, adding L84 to L7,095 ahead of today's expiry of options and Olivetti put on L79 to L2,059, also amid speculation about asset sales. Banks remained under pressure over concern at their exposure to debts of the Ferruzzi group. Mediobanca fell L50 to L16,200 and Credito Italiano slid L15 to L2,630. Ferruzzi and Montedison remained suspended, but Fondiaria, the insurance subsidiary, shed L160 to L30,890. ZURICH picked up after a weak start and the SMI index finished 26.2 higher at 2,410.7. UBS bearers shrugged off the profit-taking of the previous two days and rose SFr18 to SFr1,199 in brisk trade ahead of today's half yearly results, and Ciba Geigy bearers recovered SFr13 to SFr749 after their recent weakness. Cyclical shares also saw good gains. Fischer jumped SFr40 to SFr965 after Tuesday's SFr35 drop. Alusuisse bearers added SFr16 to SFr570 and Holderbank ended up SFr21 at SFr789. STOCKHOLM overcame early profit-taking to turn higher amid speculation that the Riksbank will cut its official marginal rate today. The Affarsvarlden index rose 13.2 to 1,260.3. A smaller than expected first half loss from SKF, the ball bearing manufacturer, helped the mood; the B-shares rose SKr3 to SKr115. OSLO soared 2.4 per cent to a 1993 high with lower money market rates contributing to the rise. The all-share index rose 13.17 to 563.63 in heavy turnover of NKr743m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 11                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1263.60     1265.76     1266.68     1267.67 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1348.40     1350.82     1350.41     1349.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1267.06     1269.13     1272.92     1274.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1351.59     1352.13     1355.05     1354.98  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 10     Aug 9     Aug 6     Aug 5     Aug 4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1261.80   1269.95   1272.34   1268.56   1268.09 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1348.51   1352.97   1348.44   1340.80   1339.61  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1274.70; 200 - 1356.53 Low/day: 100 - 1263.60  200 - 1348.40.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / World Trade News: India's private thoughts on power - Delhi recognises that without improved electricity supply, the reform programme will falter FREE electricity is one of life's few blessings for slum dwellers in Shahdara, east Delhi. It is easily obtained by scrambling up an electricity pole and attaching a wire to the overhead mains. Occasionally someone gets electrocuted in the process, but not often. Electricity board officials turn a blind eye to such pilfering, which happens all over India. The effort of collecting payment from slums is not worth the revenues. Also, decades of socialist thinking have encouraged many Indians to regard the mostly state-owned electricity distribution boards as welfare agencies. Farmers in Karnataka state, south India, pay just 5 per cent of cost for their current. In neighbouring Tamil Nadu they pay nothing. The result is chronic losses for the industry and electricity shortages leading to frequent power cuts for consumers. However, the government of Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the reform-minded prime minister, is committed to overhauling the industry: it recognises that without improved electricity supplies, the economic modernisation programme will grind to a halt. After years of relying on state-owned industry, Mr Rao is calling on private companies - including foreign groups - to build and operate 100 per cent privately owned power plants. But business has so far been slow to respond. In the last year, the ministry of power has attracted inquiries from 40 companies, including 25 from abroad, interested in building and operating power stations with a total capacity of 20,000 MW. But only four small-scale plants with a combined capacity of 1,300 MW are under construction, all by Indian-owned companies; four large projects totalling 8,000 MW and involving foreign capital, have been approved by the government, but none is yet under way. The cautious response is partly due to the huge scale of the proposed investments and partly to doubts about the government's ability to overhaul the industry's anti-commercial practices. Though ministers in Delhi are committed to reform, many local politicians, who use cheap electricity to buy farmers' votes, are not. As Mr S V Joshi, director of power distribution at the Indian affiliate of Siemens, the German engineering group, says: 'It took the US 10 years to switch from public to private sector power generation. India can't do it in two or three.' The government's 1992-1997 economic plan calls for the addition of 31,000 MW of public sector generating capacity to the existing total 78,000 MW (which includes 9,000 MW from private plants). But the public sector does not have the funds to implement the plan. Even if it did, India would still be short of electricity. Hence the need for private investors. As the head of the Delhi office of a European engineering group says: 'If we can get it right, the opportunities are limitless.' Getting it right involves getting the finance right. With a large power station costing Dollars 1bn and more, the only viable way for private companies to fund such projects is to split the cost between different equity partners and lenders, including multilateral institutions such as the World Bank. For example, Enron, the US energy group, is planning a Dollars 2bn plant for Maharashtra state to supply Bombay. Enron is considering asking lenders for 80 per cent of the funds, with 20 per cent in equity split between three partners - Enron, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and General Electric, the US engineering group which would supply much of the equipment. The World Bank, which has funded much of India's existing power capacity, says it would support schemes involving private companies. Officials believe public sector boards are generally poor managers - because of breakdowns, Indian power plants run at an average of 60 per cent of their full capacity and 23 per cent of their output is lost during transmission. However, money alone will not persuade private companies to invest. They also want to be certain their investments will be safe and they will get an adequate return. The Indian government has proposed contracts which would allow generating companies to pass on increases in fuel costs (the main variable cost) and earn a minimum net annual profit of 16 per cent. But most foreign companies say this is not enough. They are asking for central government guarantees that they will be paid by the state-level electricity boards, which are the main distributors. The companies are worried because the electricity boards are controlled by local state governments, which use electricity supply as a political tool. Foreign companies are also concerned about the security of fuel supplies since most plants will rely on coal from state-owned mines. However, the central government has so far ruled out guarantees, saying the answers lie mainly in watertight, legally enforceable contracts. The most the power ministry will entertain is indirectly endorsing guarantees offered by state governments. This may not be enough even for Enron. Aware of such doubts, the power ministry this month ordered state governments to permit private companies to enter into power distribution as well as generation. This would allow private companies to supply, for example, a selected group of consumers, such as factories on an industrial estate - potentially an attractive option. The ministry is considering further incentives to tempt foreign companies. Officials also point to the success of the four Indian private companies in the industry - the Bombay Suburban Electric Supply Company, the Calcutta Electric Supply Company, Ahmedabad Electricity and Tata Electric Companies. All are profitable and most are expanding capacity. Mr Joshi of Siemens says: 'This proves India can do it.' But no-one expects a quick transformation. Mr M Ranji, a senior power ministry official says: 'There are no easy solutions. That's the cost of democracy in India.'</p>

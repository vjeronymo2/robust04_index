			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Turnround continues at SCA SCA, Sweden's second largest pulp and paper group, rebounded to a SKr788m (Dollars 97.2m) profit after financial items in the first nine months from a SKr5m loss in the same 1992 period. However, it warned that market conditions had worsened during the autumn, and said full-year profits would now be at the bottom of the SKr1.1bn to SKr1.3bn range it forecast in August. 'The market trend this autumn has been substantially weaker than expected, with continued price declines for corrugated board and testliner, as well as pulp and fine papers,' it stated. It stressed there was 'great uncertainty' about the timing of any recovery. The group, which has just raised SKr1.4bn from a rights issue, said third-quarter profit amounted to SKr238m. This compares with a SKr99m loss in the same 1992 period but is lower than profits of SKr271m and SKr279m in the first two quarters of 1993. SCA has relied on cost-cutting, the weaker Swedish krona, lower raw material costs and volume growth within its Molnlycke hygiene division to offset increasingly fierce competition in many of its main markets. Molnlycke has helped SCA weather the pulp and paper recession better than many of its competitors. It increased its sales to SKr11.2bn from SKr9.2bn over the nine months, helping to lift group sales by 8 per cent to SKr25.4bn. The hygiene unit also accounted for more than half of group operating profits of SKr1.53bn with a 28 per cent increase to SKr822m. A bigger marketing effort and new product launches have helped it to hold prices and lift market share, in spite of intense competition.</p>

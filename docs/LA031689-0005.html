			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MEDIA WATCH  </P> <P> The New York Times no longer will allow its critics to vote in awards  competitions, including the prestigious New York Film Critics, New York Drama  Critics, Tony and National Book balloting. After discussions with critics and  arts editors, Times executive editor Max Frankel banned participation of Times  critics in awards distributed in all fields outside of journalism. Frankel said  the paper, which publishes its own 10 best lists every year, will allocate more  space to critics and arts writers. A spokeswoman for the New York paper said  Wednesday that "we see ourselves as having to be more objective, having some  separation between reporting on the arts and being part of the process that  votes on awards given."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Sergey Babkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 2 TASS -- United Nations Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali praised Russian diplomats for their  contribution to the peace settlement in the former Yugoslavia in  his speech at the Moscow State Institute of International  Relations.    The U.N. secretary general said that the solution to the  problem of Sarajevo and Tuzla was found thanks to Russian  initiatives.    As concerns the participation of a Turkish contingent in the  international peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia,  Butrus- Ghali said it would play no negative role in the region.  The United Nations is an international organisation, and its  peacekeeping forces must also be international, he said.    Asked about the international community's role in the  Middle-  East peace process, the secretary general pointed to the mission  of the U.N. peacekeepers in the conflict zone. He welcomed any  initiatives designed to promote the peace process in the  Middle-East.    Butrus-Ghali said the international community is interested  in expanding the presence of the United Nations and Russia in  the peacekeeping operations on the territory of the former  Soviet Union. He noted that the main pitfall on this path was  financial, as the budget of the U.N. peacekeeping efforts has  increased considerably in the past two years.</p>

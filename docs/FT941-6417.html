			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / TUC sets out to broaden scope The Trades Union Congress wants to broaden its links and exert influence across the political spectrum and not just in the Labour party. That was the main message yesterday from Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary since September, in his 'relaunch' of the organisation. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, said that he saw the organisation's modernisation as 'a welcome and necessary step if unions are to market their services to their individual members more effectively in the workplace and help employers to become more competitive'.</p>

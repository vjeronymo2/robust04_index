			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Agatha Ngai] </F>   [Text] Oxfam's programme director in Hong Kong has warned  that economic prosperity could endanger the livelihood of  residents in poorer districts. John Sayer says that Beijing's  "blind strategy" of attracting foreign investment could backfire.    Many villagers in the mountainous regions of southwest  China,  mainly unskilled minority tribal groups living far away from  markets, have no advantages to offer in the competition for  foreign capital. On the contrary, run-away prices have made it  more difficult for the peasants in these destitute areas to  escape poverty, he said.    Mr Sayer said Xiao Li, a peasant from Shiyahou village in  Yunnan, perfectly illustrated how difficult it was for peasants  in these remote areas just to survive -- let alone get rich.  Due to poor soil and difficult farming conditions, Mr Li has  difficulty in growing enough food to support his family. Every  year, he manages to squeeze the equivalent of about $200 by  selling his meagre harvests in the markets.    For up to six months a year, Mr Li has to borrow from his  relatives to survive. Mr Li was not lazy, nor did he lack the  initiative to earn more money, said Mr Sayer, but peasants  seldom got credits from the Chinese banks to purchase even the  most basic farming tools needed for their first steps towards a  decent living.    "The soil is poor for growing rice, but it allows planting  of  some rough crops for animals," said Mr Sayer. "They survive  just by borrowing food from relatives. But (in return), they  lose their self-esteem and become more dependent," he said.    The situation only began to improve for Mr Li after he  obtained a 100 yuan (about HK$89) low-interest loan from Oxfam,  said Mr Sayer. "Only when they can sell more than they buy,  inflation can help them to gain more money," he said.    The programme director also said he was glad that many  villagers had adopted year planning in planting their crops.  "Now they know when to raise chickens and pigs so that they can  fetch the best market price, say, in the Lunar New Year," he  said.    Mr Sayer described China's seven-year poverty eradication  programme as "an ambitious plan." But he said Oxfam in Hong  Kong "never talks about ending poverty." "In Tokyo, there are  still men sleeping on the street. Instead, we aim at reducing  poverty," he said.    Mr Sayer said the annual income of households in some  villages in Yunnan and Guizhou, where water and electricity  supply projects under the charity have taken place, had already  increased by 78 per cent from 200 yuan.    "Yunnan will grow faster in the next two decades (because)  the border province can construct trade links with Thailand,  Burma, and Singapore. But regions where markets are almost  nonexistent, such as Sichuan and Guizhou, will take more years  to develop," he added.    He said Oxfam would expand its development projects to  southern China this year, focusing on health and hygiene  problems in the region. "If you're ill, you cannot work," he  said.</p>

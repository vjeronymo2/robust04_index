			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MADONNA'S PARTY: STARS AND DANCING  </P> <P> Madonna and a few hundred of her close, personal friends invaded the Park Plaza  over the weekend as her record label threw a late-night fete to celebrate the  release of her new album, "Like a Prayer."  </P> <P> Paparazzi staked out the entrance, while inside, guests paid tribute to the  singer/actress/soft-drink hawker by dancing to her latest single, "Like a  Prayer." The newly peroxided (and newly single) Madonna showed off her dancing  skills too, but showed no signs of acquiring stigmata all night.  </P> <P> "Is that part of her new album? Is that?" asked guests, who were trying to  guess which of the disco-y tunes blasting through the speakers were part of  Madonna's current repertoire. Most everyone commented on how fabulous she  looked.  </P> <P> Wandering through the vast, Viking-like rooms of the Plaza were Madonna gal-pal  Sandra Bernhard (the two were also dance partners); Warren Beatty hanging with  Lauren Hutton, Beverly D'Angelo and Lori Singer; too-hip modeling agents Omar  and Paul Fisher; the Hollywood Kids; Dwight Yoakum (almost unrecognizable sans  cowboy hat); Little Richard; chain mail designer Michael Schmidt; actor Billy  Wirth; cosmopolitan gadfly Amos Newman; artist and boulevardier Jeffrey Knoll;  and various record execs, musicians, models and denizens of the night.  </P> <P> There was no sign of Sean Penn.  </P> <P> Warner Bros. served canapes, make-your-own tacos and an entire table of  desserts. But why was no one eating? This crowd couldn't have been that  diet-conscious. Maybe no one wanted to dribble salsa on their leather, the  preferred fabric of the evening.  </P> <P> Agent-types opted for oversized suits and an occasional ponytail, while rockers  showed off tattoos and nose rings. And let's not forget girls in cut-out minis  and bustiers, the latter vaguely reminiscent of Maddie in her old days.  </P> <P> Later in the evening, rappers took the stage in one of the rooms, while others  danced to Madonna songs while watching the new "Like a Prayer" video. Some  opted to watch the crowd or work it.  </P> <P> And when the party wound down about 1-ish Sunday morning, where did the  cognoscenti scatter? Why, to b.c., of course, where just the night before  patrons had danced atop the bar.  </P> <P> Although the hot-hot supper club has only been open a scant few weeks, one girl  was overheard whining to her friend in the bathroom: "Cynthia, I think this  place was cooler when no one knew about it, y'know?"  </P></p>

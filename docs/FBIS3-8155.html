			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] During a ceremony at Cotroceni Palace today Prime  Minister Vacaroiu introduced the new holders of the four  ministerial portfolios.    [Begin Vacaroiu recording] As you well know, the examination  of the possibility for a government reshuffle lasted for quite a  long time and created a number of problems in the operation of  the executive. Eventually, together with the ruling party, the  PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania], we reached the  conclusion that in the current very difficult stage, in  practical terms it would be best to have a monocolor government  team which includes PDSR representatives and some experts. As I  mentioned before, we mainly thought that the government team  should include highly qualified people and good organizers who  are able to implement the reform program for 1994, which is a  very complex program.    At the same time, we also took into consideration the  practice in most countries and the recommendations of the  Council of Europe regarding the appointment of civilians, people  with high professional qualifications, to the helms of two  ministries, the Ministry of National Defense and the Interior  Ministry.    For example, we chose Gheorghe Tinca, who, as you know, has  occupied the position of state secretary with the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs. He is a lawyer by profession. He worked on  disarmament issues for a very long time with the United Nations.  At the same time, he is a person of integrity, with good  professional training.    Doru Taracila, currently vice president of the Senate, will  occupy the position of minister of interior. He is also a  lawyer by profession, with a good training, and a person whom we  believe will bring a new moving drive in the activity of  finalizing the reform process. But in a primary and very  delicate area, we believe Mr. Taracila will carry out a much  more intensive activity to fight crime and corruption in Romania  together with Mr. Danescu, who will continue to occupy the  position of secretary of state and will be deputy interior  minister.    Our nomination for the position of justice minister, a  nomination accepted by Romania's president, was Mr. Chiuzbaian.  He is also a lawyer by profession, currently president of the  Lawyers' Union of Romania and general inspector in the Ministry  of Justice. We believe that he has the necessary qualifications  to continue what we have started with Senator Ninosu in this  area of reform of the legal system, and we hope that in a very  short time he will succeed in finalizing this reform and, at the  same time, to lay a new basis for the functioning of prosecuting  magistracies in provinces.    We proposed Paul Novac for the position of minister of  transportation, a proposal also accepted by Romania's president.  Mr. Novac currently holds the position of secretary of state in  the Ministry of Transportation. He is a fine expert. He has  held positions at various levels in the respective specialty, he  has managed to fulfill his duties correctly, and we believe that  in this very difficult ministry, due to the variety of  activities that it has to coordinate, he will succeed in  fulfilling his duty and giving a new impetus to the reform  process in Romania.    These are the four nominations that we have submitted to  President Ion Iliescu. Following the analysis carried out in  these past days, these nominations have been accepted, and here  we are. Today this acceptance took concrete shape in the  appointment of the new ministers.    I extend them heartfelt wishes for success and, first, I  wish  to say that I am convinced that they will adjust very rapidly  and we will succeed in establishing a competent government team  that is capable of implementing the program of reform, which, as  I have already mentioned, is a very difficult and complex  program. At the same time, however, it is a program expected by  the population, because its goal is to end the current crisis,  to reduce inflation as much as possible, and to create an  adequate framework that will allow for the improvement of  people's standard of living.    In conclusion, I want to express the hope that the political  forces represented in parliament and trade unions will be at our  side and will support the new government team in this difficult  period. Thank you. [end recording]</p>

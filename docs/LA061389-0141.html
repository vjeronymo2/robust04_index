			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> O.C BOARD REFUSES TO BAN BIAS AGAINST AIDS VICTIMS;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS REJECT PLAN ON 3-2 VOTE  </P> <P> In a 3-2 vote before a tense and emotional crowd, the Board of Supervisors  today killed a proposed anti-discrimination ordinance to protect AIDS victims,  making Orange County the first urban area in California to reject such a  measure.  </P> <P> The supervisors heard about three hours of testimony from nearly 40 speakers --  almost equally divided on the issue -- before making their vote shortly after  noon.  </P> <P> The opposition was led by Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition  based in Anaheim. Sheldon said his group sent out about 1,000 letters to  encourage people to attend.  </P> <P> Sheldon and many other critics charged that the ordinance would grant special  rights to homosexuals, a high-risk group in regards to AIDS, at the expense of  others.  </P> <P> "They are a class of people linked together by behavior," Sheldon said of  homosexuals. "Reasonable people might want to consider their perverted sexual  behavior" when asked to associate with AIDS victims in work or social  situations.  </P> <P> Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, who joined Supervisor Thomas F. Riley in  supporting the ordinance, said, "I support the fears and concerns of those  opposed to the ordinance -- it is a fear of the unknown. I'm concerned about  the spread of the disease. I'm concerned about ignorance spreading the  disease."  </P> <P> All three of the supervisors voting against the ordinance -- Don Roth of  Anaheim, Roger Stanton of Santa Ana, and Gaddi Vasquez of Mission Viejo -- said  they believe existing state and federal laws already protect AIDS victims from  discrimination.  </P></p>

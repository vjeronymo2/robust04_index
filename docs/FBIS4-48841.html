			<p>BFN     [Text] Kinshasa, May 26 (AFP) -- Zairian President Mobutu  Sese Seko has recommended the immediate demilitarisation of the  Rwandan capital of Kigali, the Zairois Press Agency AZAP said  Thursday [26 May].    "It is vital to declare Kigali and an area up to 20  kilometres around the town neutral," the Zairian president said.    Mobutu said this would allow "the intervention of United  Nations forces, emergency services of humanitarian  organisations, as well as the setting up of a government of  national union following talks between the two parties to the  conflict."    Zaire, along with Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania, borders the  tiny east African nation where up to half a million people have  been killed in fighting between the majority Hutus and minority  Tutsis since early April.</p>

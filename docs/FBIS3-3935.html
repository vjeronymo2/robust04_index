"We're concerned about inflationary pressure at present, but  we are confident we can deal with it," Zhou Zhengqing,  Vice-Governor of the People's Bank of China, told journalists in  Beijing yesterday.    Inflation in 35 major Chinese cities hit 23.3 percent in  January. This far exceeds the government target of 10 percent  for the whole year.    "We will screen out excessive investment in fixed assets,  but  that does not mean a stringent policy will be imposed," said Dai  Xianglong, another vice-governor of the bank.    The country's commercial banks have big reserves and are  ready to finance "sustained development" of the economy, he said.    He predicted that domestic production would soon pick up  from  a low last month when the country was on holiday.    Tight control over money supply means funding key projects  afloat, while putting a brake on runaway investment, he  explained.

At the moment about 80 percent of national banks loans are  used to bolster large and medium-sized State-enterprises.    The bankers sought to dispel fears that China's economy  would  continue to suffer money floods alternating with financial  drought.    "We have adopted a cautious monetary policy since last year,  which is neither austere nor liberal." Dai said.    Zhou outlined measures to control growing inflation. These  included:    -- Keeping a tight control over the national credit,  especially in fixed assets;    -- Bolstering the production of grain, cotton, edible oil,  meat, sugar and vegetables to curb price rises;    -- Making every effort to recoup bank loans on time;    -- Putting an end to borrowing from banks to settle the  nation's budgetary deficit. Instead the deficit will be offset  by the sale of State treasury bonds.    Bond issues help stabilize the value of the yuan, Zhou said.    Whereas funding the deficit with massive bank loans only  leads to currency fluctuation.    Zhou said the yuan had held its value against the US dollar  after the unification of the two-tier foreign exchange rates.    But he added that the devaluation of the yuan on the black  market, must end.    "On the whole, we're confident we can maintain a stable yuan  against the US dollar.    "This is because current account exchanges have been  conducted at the market rate of $1 against 8.7 yuan," he  explained.    Zhou also said that the central bank would not raise its  interest rate to boost savings.    Bank deposits by city dwellers had increased 320 billion  yuan  ($36.8 billion) by the end of last year.    Bank interest rates were raised twice last year as a result  of runaway money supply that fueled the inflation.    The country's foreign exchange reserves also jumped from  $21.2 billion at the end of last year to $27.2 billion by  February.    Zhou said the nation will have embraced a unified inter-bank  foreign exchange swap market in April, to which both domestic  and foreign banks can have access.    In another development, Zhou said China is to hammer out a  series of banking laws this year to bring its financial reforms  onto a legal track.    The laws concerning the central bank, commercial banks,  securities, negotiable instruments and insurance are all  expected to be ready by the end of the year, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "I hope to resume my duties as Russia's prosecutor  general as the upper house of parliament did not accept my  resignation," Aleksey Kazannik told Interfax in an interview he  gave in a Moscow hotel. In his view, this decision made by the  Federation Council "has not created any new realities or complex  problems."    "I will work. What kind of problem can that be? Because the  upper house did not endorse the presidential decree on my  resignation, I remain Russia's prosecutor general and that is  all there is to it. Under Article 102 of the Constitution this  issue is to be decided by the upper house. I appreciate the  Federation Council's respect for the Constitution and the Law.  This will be the first swallow of the 'legal spring'," Kazannik  said.    "I would have been grateful to the Federation Council even  if  it had accepted my resignation," Kazannik continued. "The very  fact that this issue was discussed in parliament proves that our  law makers respect the law and legality. People understood that  it was impossible to live in a legal vacuum."    Kazannik said that "when the decision made by the Federation  Council is formulated, this will be a legal act which cannot be  resisted. In this way, there will be no question of Aleksey  Ilyushenko staying in office as an acting prosecutor general."    Kazannik recalled that he had been dismissed from the  prosecutor's office on February 15 by order of an acting  prosecutor general. "I understood then that the situation was  awkward and did not even withdraw my job records from the  prosecutor general's office," he said.    "The upper house's decision changes my plans. Now I am not  thinking of any political parties. I am sure that President  Yeltsin and I will have good business relations in the framework  of the Constitution of which he is the guarantor as head of the  Russian state," Kazannik said.    He emphasized that he would concentrate on fighting crime  when he resumed his duties.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] In its attempt to check illicit opium cultivation in  Meghalaya, where this practice is the most prevalent among all  the seven north-eastern States, a team of officials of the  Narcotics Control Bureau, Eastern Region, recently raided Badak  village in the Mariyang circle of east Siang district.    They destroyed more than 400,000 of opium plants. The NCB  [Narcotics Control Board] team, assisted by CRPF [Central  Reserve Police Force] jawans, set on fire the plants spread over  30 plots on April 4, said Mr S. Nag, assistant director of the  Bureau, in Calcutta on Monday.    According to the Union Finance Ministry sources, opium  cultivation is rampant in east Siang and Lohit districts of  Arunachal Pradesh for quite some time.    Apart from opium, another alarming trend is the massive  cultivation of high-quality ganja in the Ukhrul and Senapati  districts of Manipur which fetches Rs 1,500 and above a kg.    A major haul of about 1.5 tons of Manipur ganja in Calcutta  in December last by the NCB is an eye-opener.</p>

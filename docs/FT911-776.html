			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / EC takes a considered view of pig manure THE European Commission has been unfairly criticised for being naively visionary and interferingly nit-picking at the same time. On the one hand, the Berlaymont bureaucrats are trying to subsume our nations into a 'federastical' super-state, while pretending that the Community can swan around and resolve crises like the Middle East where real superpowers have failed. On the other, they carry out dastardly ambushes on icons of our cultures, such as the smoky bacon crisp and the defenceless tilde, the 'N' with a diacritical mark - thus n - which they want taken off Spanish keyboards. Happily, it can be revealed that such allegations are unfounded and that senior officials engage daily with the most intractable of our secular problems. Manure dominated no fewer than three lunch tables patronised by the most senior of officials in a Berlaymont watering-hole this week. Exquisite asparagus and mouth-watering monk-fish could not deflect them from their grapple with pig-droppings (state aids for the processing of). Here in a poop-scoop was the classic dilemma of the Great Market which the EC is building: how to reconcile fair competition with the environmental imperative of keeping the citizenry dropping-free. It is the Dutch who have brought this burning issue to a head. The Netherlands is a small country with a lot of people and even more pigs. The problem is that reprocessing manure is not a going business without state subsidies which are illegal and competition-distorting under EC laws framed for people rather than pigs. Dung recyclers are honoured citizens in the Netherlands. Brussels officials were left in no doubt of this on a recent visit to a reprocessing plant, dominated by a picture of Queen Juliana raising a toast with a glass of water by-produced from pig manure. Any lingering scepticism has now been dispelled by a no-nonsense letter to the Commission, re the absolute necessity of state aid for manure reprocessing, from Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister himself. While the controversy rages, it may be just as well that that Mr Lubbers is tipped as a possible replacement for head of the Commission after its currently presiding visionary, Mr Jacques Delors. Mr Delors is an urban Frenchman, with a rather romantic view of the countryside (he is said to have a cousin with just six cows). Mr Lubbers, it is patently obvious, is very sound, and prepared to get to grips with real grass-roots stuff.</p>

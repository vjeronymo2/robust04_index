			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / IRWIN L. KELLNER: CAN OUR LONG EXPANSION ROLL A 7?  </P> <P> Not long ago, the economic expansion celebrated its sixth birthday. It was a  significant event because the U.S. economy had never grown for six straight  years without the help of a war. Indeed, if the expansion continues through the  summer, it will become the second longest ever, surpassing the 80-month upswing  that occurred during World War II.  </P> <P> In view of the fact that, over the past 130 years, a recession has struck once  every 4.3 years, it would seem that the chances of this expansion lasting much  longer are remote. Or are they? History may teach us some valuable lessons, but  it doesn't necessarily impose ironclad rules on us when it comes to the  inevitability of recessions.  </P> <P> Keep in mind that the natural tendency of the U.S. economy is growth. The  population is constantly expanding; education and technology are always  boosting productivity, and people's natural aspirations are to improve their  living standards.  </P> <P> Keep in mind, also, the fact that recessions don't come from outer space, from  the weather, or from deep within the Earth. They are caused by policy makers,  reacting to fears that this natural tendency toward growth at times can lead to  overheating, thus to an upsurge in inflation.  </P> <P> When demand for goods and services outpaces supply, as it does from time to  time, prices will rise. This may also coincide with other inflation-generating  developments, such as bad weather affecting crops, strikes, wars and so on. The  end result: a big run-up in  </P> <P> prices and a clampdown by the monetary and fiscal authorities to keep inflation  from getting out of hand.  </P> <P> In the past this restraint has come in the form of tax hikes, spending  cutbacks, a reduction in the money supply and sharply rising interest rates. Of  course, the intent was to slow down demand, thus dampening price pressures.  Sometimes demand slowed -- but still expanded -- and sometimes it actually  contracted. When it declined, we experienced a recession.  </P> <P> The U.S. economy has managed to avoid a full-fledged recession for more than  six years because of an unusual set of developments:  </P> <P> The last recession was so long and so deep that it left the economy with plenty  of room to grow, in the form of unused capacity, vacant space and unemployed  workers.  </P> <P> Early in the expansion, the dollar shot up in foreign exchange markets,  dampening domestic price pressures, while at the same time forcing U.S.  businesses to spend heavily on new machinery, computers, etc., to remain  competitive.  </P> <P> Labor restrained its wage demands because of competition from abroad, as well  as widespread domestic corporate restructurings. The surge in new machinery put  in place boosted productivity, putting even more downward pressure on unit  labor costs.  </P> <P> Oil prices began falling around the end of 1985, further dampening price  pressures.  </P> <P> The stock market's crash of October, 1987, ironically gave the expansion  another lease on life by cooling things off, allowing the Federal Reserve to  push interest rates lower, at least temporarily.  </P> <P> While capacity may be snug in some industries, consumer spending has tapered  off at the same time, reflecting satisfied demands, a need to rebuild savings  and to service relatively high debt loads.  </P> <P> After falling for three years, the dollar stabilized in 1988, taking pressure  off inflation from the standpoint of rising prices of imports as well as from  too strong exports.  </P> <P> Having said all this, can we now expect to set more records for this expansion?  Or have we just about run out of luck when it comes to inflation-retarding  developments?  </P> <P> At the moment, things seem to be getting out of balance. We are still consuming  more than we are producing, as evidenced by the deficits in both our domestic  budget and in our trade balance with other countries. This is being only partly  offset by the reluctance of the Fed to provide enough money to satisfy all  these demands: Short-term interest rates rose nearly three percentage points in  1988 alone while long-term yields climbed about three-quarters of a point.  </P> <P> As a result, the economy is apparently growing fast enough to generate a rise  in the rate of inflation. In the past 12 months, the consumer price index has  risen almost 5%, compared to 4.4% in 1987.  </P> <P> To keep the economy from getting further out of balance, we must bring  consumption and production into closer alignment. This will permit the Fed to  relax its grip on the supply of money and credit, enabling interest rates to  fall. Lower interest rates are the key to maintaining economic growth.  </P> <P> It is to be hoped that the new President and the new Congress will be able to  come up with a plan to reduce Washington's budget deficit. For when you talk  about bringing consumption and production closer together, the buck starts  here.  </P> <P> </P></p>

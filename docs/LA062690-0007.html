			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GRAND JURY CALLS FOR NEW CODE OF ETHICS;  </P> <P> CONDUCT: THE PANEL CRITICIZES THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY BY COUNTY OFFICIALS  INVOLVED IN APPROVING DAVID H. MURDOCK'S LUXURY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN LAKE  SHERWOOD.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Grand Jury, criticizing the conduct of several public  officials involved in billionaire David H. Murdock's Sherwood Country Club  project, recommended Monday the creation of an ethics board to write a code of  conduct for county officials.  </P> <P> The grand jury said it found no evidence that county officials acted illegally  in working with Murdock since 1987, when his 1,900-acre country club and luxury  housing development at Lake Sherwood was approved.  </P> <P> It found, however, that some county employees and officials had created an  "appearance of impropriety" by attending a barbecue hosted in 1989 by Murdock  at his Arabian horse ranch in Hidden Valley.  </P> <P> Several permit requests were still pending before the county at that time, the  panel noted. And the developer's controversial proposal to form a special  district to tax new residents -- and possibly existing ones -- for millions of  dollars in improvements at the lake still has not been voted on by the Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> "Although such conduct is not illegal, citizens have the right to observe their  public servants conducting themselves in a way which exemplifies fairness  towards all and favoritism towards none," said the panel.  </P> <P> The report did not name the officials who attended the barbecue, but county  Public Works Director Art Goulet said that he and more than a dozen other  county officials and employees who had worked on the project attended the fete  at Murdock's request.  </P> <P> Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, in whose district the project is located,  planning chief Thomas Berg and Robert Braitman, whose county agency oversees  the formation of special tax districts, also attended, Goulet said.  </P> <P> "He wanted the opportunity to thank everyone personally for all the work they  had done to bring the project to fruition," Goulet said Monday. "He spent a lot  of time explaining his vision of the project, and I think it was valuable. You  gained a better understanding of the project in its entirety."  </P> <P> Goulet said that, except for Murdock's proposal for a special tax district, the  developer had already gained all non-routine approvals required for  construction of 650 luxury homes near the lake near Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> "There was nothing unethical" in attending the barbecue, the public works  director said. Schaefer said a county ethics code, if so strict it would have  kept her from attending Murdock's barbecue, might also ban meetings with  homeowners groups. "Where do you draw the line?" she said. "I don't think there  was any breach of ethics here.  </P> <P> "The essence of this report is what this project has created," Schaefer said.  "It has saved 125 families their homes because their septic tanks were in  failure and they had no potable water. The only solution was to bring in sewer  and water lines, which they could not afford."  </P> <P> Murdock representatives declined to comment until they read the grand jury  report, which was released Monday.  </P> <P> Murdock, in arguing before the Board of Supervisors in 1987, pledged to build  sewer and water mains that connect existing houses to community systems, and he  has, Schaefer said.  </P> <P> "I think that over time this project is going to be such a tremendous asset for  the county. People will look back on this report and say, 'What are they  complaining about,' " she said.  </P> <P> The detailed, 22-page grand jury report, which caps six months of  investigation, also faulted county officials for an alleged lack of  communication that will allow Murdock to sell Lake Sherwood for millions of  dollars rather than give it away to a community group.  </P> <P> In 1987, Murdock pledged the "dedication" of the lake. The grand jury said that  county supervisors testified that they thought he had committed himself to  giving it away. In 1988, he first mentioned selling the lake, but it was not  until last month that county officials sought to clarify his position, the  grand jury said.  </P> <P> County lawyers decided that the meaning of "dedication" was not clear in the  original approval and concluded that they could not force Murdock to give up  the lake without payment.  </P> <P> To avoid such confusion, the panel recommended changes in the way the county  investigates proposed developments and monitors them after they are approved.  </P> <P> The panel was particularly critical of Murdock's pending proposal to form a  district to tax all of the area's property owners -- both existing and future  homeowners -- for perhaps $20 million to repay him for improvements around the  lake.  </P> <P> To sweeten the deal for the existing 122 homeowners, Murdock agreed in 1987 to  pay their sewer and water taxes.  </P> <P> But Murdock also wants taxes to be levied against both the 122 existing  homeowners and 650 future owners of luxury houses at his new country club to  repay him for the millions of dollars he has spent to fill the once-empty lake  and to repair and improve it.  </P> <P> He has pledged to reimburse existing homeowners for their share of the cost of  repairing the lake if they will join another special tax district to be formed  soon to maintain the lake in the future.  </P> <P> The proposal for a special tax district to pay for all Murdock's water, sewer  and lake improvements is expected to be considered by the Board of Supervisors  next month. The grand jury recommended that the request be denied because  Murdock's proposed tax district would give the developer leverage to pressure  existing homeowners to join the lake maintenance district.  </P> <P> During the grand jury investigation, lake-area residents said jurors had  questioned them about Murdock's relationship with county officials, including  Supervisor Schaefer, whose 1988 campaign fund-raiser Murdock hosted at his  nearby Arabian horse ranch.  </P> <P> The supervisor noted Monday that the grand jury had cleared her of any  wrongdoing.  </P> <P> "Allegations were made by some of an improper relationship existing between the  developer and certain elected officials within Ventura County," the grand jury  said. "During the course of this investigation, the Grand Jury found no  credible evidence which would substantiate those allegations."  </P></p>

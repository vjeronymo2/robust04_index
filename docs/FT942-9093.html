			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: American Barrick wins title to Goldstrike The US interior department has finally granted American Barrick Resources full title and ownership of the 1,800-acre Goldstrike property in Nevada, which contains North America's biggest gold mine. American Barrick, controlled by Mr Peter Munk, the Toronto financier, will now acquire the property for USDollars 5 per acre from the US government. It will also be exempt from mining production royalties now proposed in Congress that would total about Dollars 700m over Goldstrike's life. 'This gives us full security for the Dollars 1bn we invested to develop the mine,' said Mr Vincent Borg, Barrick spokesman. The company bought the property in 1987. Mr Bruce Babbitt, interior secretary, has been pushing for higher prices for federal public lands and production royalties via changes to the 1872 US Mining Law. American Barrick early this year persuaded a US court that Mr Babbitt had overstepped his authority by trying to change the 'patenting' system by which mining companies gained the final title to federal lands they are working. Although Mr Babbitt called yesterday's signing of the Goldstrike title 'the biggest gold heist since the days of Butch Cassidy,' Mr Bob Miller, Nevada governor, said American Barrick had met all commitments and is a big contributor to the state economy. Goldstrike provides most of American Barrick's gold output, estimated at 1.8m oz in 1994 and 2m oz in 1995.</p>

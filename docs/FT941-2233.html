			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Germany's opposition moves to allay fears on tax plans Germany's opposition Social Democrats were attempting to save themselves from an electoral own-goal last night after stirring public fears with a commitment to raising taxes on higher-income earners. The party leadership, surprised by a setback in local elections at the weekend, claimed that government ministers and their supporters in the German press were deliberately distorting the tax plan to suggest that it would affect a majority of taxpayers. The emergence of concerns in the Social Democratic party (SPD) comes only a week after it emerged as clear victor in the first of Germany's 19 state and national polls, and a few days after it confidently announced a draft election platform. The proposal to impose a 10 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' only on the better-paid, instead of the present plan for 7.5 per cent from all income taxpayers from next January 1, has aroused criticism from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government and from many SPD supporters. Banner headlines in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper denounced the 'tax hammer' of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the SPD leader. It said income earners on a gross salary of DM3,846 (Pounds 1,526) a month would be affected - more than half of all taxpayers in the country. Chancellor Kohl and his Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is lagging far behind the SPD in the opinion polls with seven months before the general election, seized on the tax plan with undisguised glee. Mr Peter Hintze, the CDU general secretary, said Mr Scharping was 'demolishing his own election chances'. Some commentators suggested that the drop in SPD support in the local elections in northern Schleswig-Holstein at the weekend - where its vote dropped from 42.9 per cent (in 1990) to 39.5 - was partly due to the tax furore. The CDU also lost support, down from 41.3 to 37.5 per cent. Last night the SPD leadership insisted that its opponents were deliberately misinterpreting its tax plans, which it said would add no more than DM23 a month to the tax bills of the top 17 per cent of taxpayers.</p>

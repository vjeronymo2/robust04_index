The law also contains rules about advertising deposit accounts, including accounts at depository institutions offered to consumers by deposit brokers. The act is implemented by the Board's Regulation DD (12 CFR part 230), which became effective June 21, 1993. (See final rule published on September 21, 1992 (57 FR 43337), correction notice published on October 5, 1992 (57 FR 46480), and amendments published on March 19, 1993 (58 FR 15077).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its initial rulemaking, the Board was guided by several general principles, such as establishing simple rules that minimize the possibility of errors and compliance costs and providing institutions with flexibility to promote a variety of product choices for consumers. This included designing a simple, easy-to-use formula for calculating the APY. As deposit brokers and institutions began complying with the new formula, the Board was asked by the Securities Industry Association (SIA) and others to reconsider how the APY is calculated. Proposed amendments that would provide for an additional APY formula were published on December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64190).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The difficulties associated with the current APY formula stem from the formula's assumption that interest paid on an account remains on deposit until maturity. For some accounts, the formula produces an APY that reflects the time value of interest received. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For others the APY fails to reflect the time value of interest received. This happens in cases where institutions offer long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) that are noncompounding but pay interest periodically. In this case, the formula produces an APY that is less than the contract interest rate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, assume $1,000 is deposited in a one-year CD with a 6% interest rate that compounds quarterly. Consumers have the option to receive quarterly interest checks instead. In both cases, the APY is 6.14%, even though the consumer who compounds interest receives $61.40, and the consumer who takes quarterly interest checks receives $60.00.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, assume $1,000 is deposited in a two-year noncompounding CD with a 6.00% interest rate. Some institutions may offer the consumer the choice of receiving all interest ($120) at maturity, or receiving two interest payments ($60) each year. The APY in either case is 5.83%_lower than the 6.00% interest rate_because the formula looks at the total amount of interest paid, not when it is paid out. The SIA states the maturities of CDs purchased through deposit brokers range from three months to 10 years but average about two years (based on dollar-weighted maturities).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

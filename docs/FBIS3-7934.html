			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Martin Schmuck] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] If Moscow and Bosnian Serb  leader Karadzic have their way, the airport in Tuzla, an  industrial town in eastern Bosnia, is to be opened and guarded  by Russian blue-helmet soldiers.    Talking to ZDF, Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic said that  this is unacceptable. Bosnia has more Russians than it needs.  The country does not want any Russians, who do not cooperate in  stopping the war. They are only supporting the Serbs and just  serve to cover up the domestic problems between the government  in Moscow and Russian right-wing extremist Zhirinovskiy and  divert attention from their internal problems, Ganic stated.</p>

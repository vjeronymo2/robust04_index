			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Situation on the Korean Peninsula Is </F> Easing"]    [Text] The situation on the Korean peninsula is easing  after former U.S. President Carter's mediation in Pyongyang.  The heads of state of North and South Korea are ready to hold a  historic summit meeting. A preparatory meeting for this summit  will be held in the cease-fire village, Panmunjom, on 28 June.    The United States has relaxed its tone, saying that if the  DPRK is willing to freeze its nuclear program and accept the  relevant conditions on nuclear transparency, sanctions will be  suspended.    Why could Clinton not make the situation develop toward  relaxation in the previous period? But when Carter proceeded  with mediatory work, the situation began to "brighten." Some  people said that Clinton was pretending to be harsh, whereas  Carter was pretending to be honest; they were cooperating with  each other and using both hard and soft tactics; as a result,  the situation changed for the better.    But other people said that this exactly portrays a decline  in  U.S. strength. Unaware of the actual strength of the U.S.,  Clinton sent out a high-pitched action signal, but he could not  implement it. Therefore, Carter went to Pyongyang for an  informal visit, during which results were achieved. Clinton  immediately said that "there are indications of hope" and  acknowledged that a summit meeting between North and South Korea  will be a constructive breakthrough.    Clinton's miscalculation resulted from his prolonged idea  that the United States was powerful; he thought that if the  United States meted out "sanctions," a small country would  knuckle under, obey orders, and be willing to be dominated by  hegemonism. But even small countries like Somalia and Haiti  have rendered the United States at its wit's end and put it in  an awkward situation. The U.S. hard-line attitude on the Korean  peninsula has pushed it into a blind alley. Imposing pressure  cannot necessarily resolve problems, whereas talks are the way  to improve understanding and dispel misunderstanding.    A U.S. internal analysis of Clinton's sanctions program  against the DPRK indicates that the United States is at a  disadvantage and that there is too much risk involved. 1) The  United States is making all-out efforts to pursue a foreign  policy of participating in Asia-Pacific economic cooperation,  but sanctions will cause confrontation and a tense situation in  the Asia-Pacific region. This is unfavorable to Asia-Pacific  economic development and will be resisted by Asia-Pacific  countries; sanctions cannot last long and could ruin U.S.  strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region if implemented by  force. 2) U.S. sanctions may force the DPRK to adopt a stronger  attitude or withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty;  in such a case, it will be difficult for the United States to  carry out nuclear inspection in the DPRK. A confrontation  between the United States and the DPRK could finally lead to  U.S. involvement in a war. 3) If force is used, the United  States will suffer casualties. Waging a war abroad will trigger  internal controversy; the United States, which is experiencing  an economic depression, does not need to take such a great risk.  4) Clinton does not have a detailed plan for using force as a  backup. How many troops will he dispatch? How long will the  United States fight? How big will the scale of the war be? If  Congress does not support it, he will back off from the plan.    The United States always assumes a harsh posture before  talks  are held, in an attempt to silence its opponent and make it  yield, so that it can gain the upper hand at the negotiating  table. But after assuming a magnanimous posture, its character  usually comes to light--ability falling short of ambition. If  its opponent insists, it will back off. This "Solomon-type" [as  published] trick has become outdated.    Is the DPRK developing nuclear weapons? Russia is the  country which designed the nuclear reactor for the DPRK. A  senior person in charge of Russian nuclear energy said that the  assertion that the DPRK is developing nuclear weapons is a  vilification; the DPRK is not manufacturing nuclear weapons.    Clinton's "sanctions" have, on the contrary, provided the  DPRK with an opportunity to bargain--it can conduct diplomatic  contacts with the United States through "freezing its production  of nuclear weapons." The upcoming dramatic development will be:  The United States and the DPRK will hold talks in Geneva. The  noise of "sanctions" has temporarily subsided.</p>

The Kim Chaek iron and steel complex turned out much more  molten iron than the assignment on the first day of the new  year. Its furnacemen have increased the production of iron per  charge 20 percent as against the previous, cutting the time of  melting 30 minutes.    The Sangwon cement complex overfulfilled the first day's  assignment by more than 20 percent by operating all the  automated kilns and equipment in full capacity.    The Pyongyang and Pukchang thermal power complexes have kept  all the equipment in full-capacity operation to effect a great  upswing in power production.    The railway transport plan has also been overfulfilled from  the first day.    The General Bureau of Western Railways surpassed by far its  transport quotas. Over 10,000 more tons of freight were carried  on the first day than the rated traction tonnage.</p>

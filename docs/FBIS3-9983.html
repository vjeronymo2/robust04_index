			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>   [Text] The trips reportedly made to Venezuelan territory by  alleged U.S. counterspy Aldrich Ames went unnoticed by the  Sectorial General Directorate of Identification and Control of  Foreigners (DIEX).    Sources of the DIEX, which comes under the Interior  Ministry,  have told EL NACIONAL the entries of the former chief of the  CIA's counterespionage Soviet Division to the country did not  appear in immigration records. The visits to Venezuela  attributed by REUTERS to Ames' wife Maria del Rosario Casas  Ames, of Colombian origin, were not recorded either.    It should be noted the entries and departures file has  computer records for the last three years. Arrivals or  departures made before 1990 must be looked up manually.    International wire reports have reported Ames had been  meeting with CIA personnel since 1985 in the Venezuelan capital.  It is therefore presumed he entered the country with false  identification.    Ames has been accused of counterspying for the Soviet Union  and later for Russia. He reportedly earned $1.5 million for his  efforts.    When this report was written, DIEX officials had not  received  the official order to determine the migratory movement of the  spy or his wife.    Editor's Note: In a NEW YORK TIMES report published  yesterday, it is said U.S. authorities have revealed Ames met  with his contacts during two secret trips to Santa Fe de Bogota  (in October of 1992) and Caracas (in November of 1993).    U.S. authorities have found cryptographic messages in the  middle of papers investigated which are related to Caracas, and  they said $86,700 were deposited into Ames' accounts at the  Dominion Bank of Virginia and The Riggs National Bank upon his  return from the Venezuelan capital.</p>

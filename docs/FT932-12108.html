			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong returns to record-breaking ways EXTENDED buying prompted by a depreciation of the yen against the dollar lifted the Nikkei average, but light profit-taking before today's national holiday left equity prices off their intraday peaks, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed 247.86, or 1.2 per cent, higher at 20,454.57, after a day's best of 20,716.39 and low of 20,268.65. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 20.08 at 1,592,76, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 5.88 at 1,266.08. Volume was estimated at 800m shares, compared with Tuesday's 608m. Advances led declines by 861 to 195, with 117 issues unchanged. Brokers said investors continued their buying spree in response to the yen's sharp decline against the dollar following intervention by the US Federal Reserve in overnight trading; and after remarks by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, about possible plans among G7 nations to stabilise the international exchange rate markets. The yen ended at Y111.88 to the dollar in Tokyo trading. Market participants also reacted favourably to the official index of leading economic indicators for February, released on Tuesday afternoon and indicating a possible bottoming out of the economy. Mr Yuichi Matsushita, senior market strategist at Nikko Securities, expects the Nikkei to trade above the 22,000 level in May, as institutional investors shift some assets from short-term money market instruments to equities. He added that confirmation of a new bottom in the stock market and the economy are necessary before a sustained Nikkei advance will happen. Consumer electronic issues moved higher, Sony appreciating Y90 to Y4,990, Pioneer Electronic Y90 to Y2,540 and TDK Y50 to Y3,940. Investors continued to target brokerage concerns, Daiwa rising Y90 to Y1,370, Nomura Y80 to Y2,190 and Nikko Y50 to Y1,090. Companies that have recently announced restructuring plans moved ahead, with Japan Airlines advancing Y80 to Y830 and Alps Electric Y80 to Y1,120. Profit-taking, however, pressured Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which retreated Y13,000 to Y960,000. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 361.09 stronger at 22,284.23 in volume of 32m shares. Roundup THERE WERE strong performances from both Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur among the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG returned to its record-breaking ways as the market demonstrated its satisfaction with the latest round of Sino-British talks and on hopes that the proposed airport project would be discussed. The Hang Seng index climbed 58.02 to an all-time closing high of 6,894.90, having topped the 6,900 mark earlier in the day. Turnover totalled HKDollars 4.88bn, against HKDollars 5.36bn on Tuesday. Cathay Pacific moved forward 30 cents to HKDollars 11 on strong demand from foreign institutions, while properties, which have lagged behind the market, also gained ground. Cheung Kong put on 40 cents at HKDollars 26.30 and Sun Hung Kai Properties HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 36.75. KUALA LUMPUR saw good gains in some index stocks, which left the composite index up 2.86 at a record 695.43. But the broader market was mixed as further speculative buying alternated with bouts of profit-taking. NEW ZEALAND made headway in high turnover of forestry sector stocks and the NZSE-40 index rose 18.91 to 1,622.58 in a strong business of NZDollars 43m. Fletcher Challenge added 8 cents at NZDollars 2.85 and Carter Holt Harvey firmed 5 cents to NZDollars 3.10. TAIWAN finished mostly firmer although trade was sluggish. The weighted index moved ahead 20.96 to 4,527.07 in thin turnover of TDollars 25.86bn. MANILA made progress after a weak start as bullish investors stepped up buying of blue chips. The composite index gained 15.28 at 1,564.67. SEOUL picked up after four consecutive sessions of declines and the composite index rose 5.45 to 728.41. JAKARTA edged ahead in moderate trade and the official index firmed 0.92 points to 312.19. AUSTRALIA recouped most of an early loss during a day of lacklustre trading. The All Ordinaries index was finally just 1.2 easier at 1,703.5. Turnover was boosted by large trading in Poseidon Gold September 1994 options, which fell 10 cents to ADollars 1.45 with 24.4m options changing hands. SINGAPORE was subjected to profit-taking as investors turned cautious, the Straits Times Industrial index slipping 6.71 to 1,779.92 after Tuesday's record close. BANGKOK fell across a broad front for the third day as investors continued to worry about an investigation of alleged share manipulation. The SET index closed 13.13 weaker at 856.85.</p>

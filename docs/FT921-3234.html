			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Names to discuss further action on Outhwaite losses ABOUT 600 Lloyd's Names who were members of the loss-making Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 but did not benefit from the Pounds 116m out-of-court settlement negotiated last month have been invited to a meeting in the next two weeks to discuss possible further action. Mr David Tiplady, of the London law firm DJ Freeman, said yesterday he was convening an open forum of Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting on the insurance market - to review their options. His call follows a meeting earlier this month in London of about 80 working Names - those with jobs with brokers or underwriters at Lloyds  - who belonged to the Outhwaite syndicate but did not take part in the action to recover some of the Pounds 200m losses it made. The working Names affected by the Outhwaite settlement are in several cases highly placed at Lloyd's and had been hoping to persuade Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, to back an extension of the out-of-court settlement. They are now dismayed to find this possibility receding. Mr Tiplady, who has instructions from a group of Names involved in the Outhwaite case, said yesterday that he was acting on behalf of a different type of Name from this group. 'The people I represent are overseas Names - Americans, Australians, South Africans - who were unable to take part in the action because in some cases they did not even know that it was happening,' Mr Tiplady said. Members' agents at Lloyd's were advised to pass on details of the action to their overseas Names when it was launched, but it appears some agents did not do so. A group of the Names not included in the original court action has been advised by counsel that they are not 'time-barred' and can pursue the case even though it is more than six years since the Outhwaite syndicate reported its losses. In the original action 987 Names alleged that negligence on the risks of asbestos by RHM Outhwaite Underwriting and 80 other agencies led to syndicate losses of more than Pounds 200m.</p>

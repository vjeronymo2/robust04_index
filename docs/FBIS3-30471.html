Articles 102 and  103, which were left over from the former Czechoslovak Federal  Criminal Code, prescribe punishment for defamation of the state  or its symbols or top representatives.    Deputy Premier Roman Kovac, who informed journalists of the  decision, said the government had based its decision on the  views of the human rights organisation Amnesty International and  Slovakia's committee on monitoring the 1975 Helsinki human  rights agreement.    Article 102 is the basis for the current prosecution of Ivan  Lexa, head of the Government Office and state secretary of the  Privatisation Ministry, as well as a strong supporter of Premier  Vladimir Meciar. Lexa made allegedly defamatory remarks about  President Michal Kovac after Kovac refused to name him minister  of privatisation.    In the Czech Republic, President Vaclav Havel has called  upon  the government and the Constitutional Court to abolish or amend  the two articles.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 5 April  1994 on page 5 reports that Jose Espinoza Navas, leader of the  Permanent Congress of Workers, and Lucio Jimenez, National  Workers Front leader, expressed their reluctance to support the  IMF agreement which provides for the Enhanced Structural  Adjustment Facility. They stated: "We are not going to back with  our signature something which will harm the already precarious  situation of the workers." Espinoza said that union leaders were  "extremely concerned" because the agreement threatens the jobs  of 15,000 workers. Espinoza and Jimenez explained that the  threat of huge layoffs will determine whether the union leaders  participate further in talks with the High Level Commission  studying the agreement.</p>

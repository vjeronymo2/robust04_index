			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nigeria has formally responded to allegations made  against her by Cameroon on the dispute over the Bakassi  Peninsula. In a letter to the United Nations Security Council,  the minister of external affairs, Alhaji Babagana Kingibe,  refuted Cameroon's claims that Nigeria violated its territorial  integrity and annexed its land. Nigeria expressed surprise at  the steps taken by Cameroon to internationalize the issue before  the commencement of summit talks by the two countries to resolve  the issue. Such steps, Nigeria said, included the invitation of  French troops to the area, initiating a process with the  International Court of Justice at The Hague, and bringing the  matter to the attention of the OAU chairman.    Giving the background to the dispute, the letter explained  that on the 31st of last December, Nigerian troops were  dispatched to the Nigerian Bakassi Peninsula to avert a violent  clash between communities in Akwa Ibom and the Cross River  States who were laying claim to the Bakassi settlements, but  following the concern expressed by Cameroon on the Nigerian  troops' movement, the minister of external affairs visited  Yaounde to explain the troops' movement to President Paul Biya.  The Cameroonian foreign minister also visited Abuja with a  message from President Biya, and both sides agreed to resolve  the issue peacefully. The Nigerian note said that surprisingly,  while peaceful dialogue was proceeding, Cameroonian soldiers  from their position launched an attack on the Nigerian troops  first on 14 February and again on the 18th and 19th of the same  month. The Nigerian troops felt obliged to defend themselves,  but they were ordered to cease fire as soon as the attack on  them stopped.    The letter expressed the hope that the Security Council  would  encourage the initiative for a bilateral resolution of the  dispute. Nigeria called on all third parties to refrain from  acts which could internationalize or aggravate the situation.</p>

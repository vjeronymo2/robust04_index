			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 9 May (AFP) -- General Victor Manuel Vayas  was sworn in on Monday as new commander general of the Ecuadoran  Army during a simple ceremony at the Presidential Palace and  presided over by President Sixto Duran-Ballen. The ceremony was  attended by the Military High Command and members of the  cabinet. The outgoing commander general, Gen. Edmundo Luna,  traveled to the United States last week where he is undergoing a  medical checkup. The special military ceremony, with military  honors and the usual speeches, is scheduled for Thursday.    Defense Minister Gen. Jose Gallardo said the appointment of  a  new commander will result in the normal changes of Army officers  and reiterated that this will not represent a problem. The  defense minister added that Gen. Luna was replaced because he  had completed his time in the Army ranks. Vayas reiterated that  there are no problems. He said all is well and that he wants to  carry out his duties as established in the Constitution.</p>

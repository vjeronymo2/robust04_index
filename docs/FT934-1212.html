			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Zhu fails to cool Chinese economy Mr Zhu Rongji, vice-premier in charge of China's economy, admitted yesterday that measures he introduced earlier this year have not yet succeeded in eliminating over-heating. 'The macro-economic control policy has made encouraging achievements but we have not found a basic solution to prominent problems in the economy,' he was quoted as saying by state radio. 'There has not been a basic change in the fact that fixed-asset investment has remained high and money supply growth has remained large. The pressure of inflation still exists.' However, Mr Zhu's remarks underlined his determination to press ahead with economic reform while attempting to cool growth, which is expected to be 13 per cent in 1993, for the second successive year. His attempts since July to reassert macro-economic control by restricting bank credit and financial speculation have made him vulnerable to attack, particularly from powerful Communist party officials in the provinces and state-owned industry. Mr Zhu, who is also governor of the central bank, insisted recently that his measures remained on track, denying he had been forced to abandon them and loosen control of money supply. He stressed yesterday that control of inflation remained a priority. 'Stabilising the grain price and inflation. . . are key to a smooth implementation of next year's reforms,' he said. Grain prices have been of particular concern as inflation in big cities reached 21.9 per cent in November. Mr Zhu said the large increase in the price of grain at the end of November was 'abnormal, transient and caused by psychological factors'. China was enjoying a bumper harvest and stockpiles were at record levels. He said the state would sell some of its grain stocks to force prices down. He added that peasants, hearing government promises that the purchase price of grain would rise next year, had held on to stocks and officials did not understand how the market system should work.</p>

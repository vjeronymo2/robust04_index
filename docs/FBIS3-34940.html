Sa'di Mahdi Salih told him the West must understand that the  Iraqi people, who stood up to the largest aggressive force in  history, are solidly behind their wise leadership. The Iraqis,  he emphasized, are determined to defend their country's  sovereignty, and have confidence in their political choices.  The Iraqis will not stand for any interference in their own  affairs.    Sa'di Mahdi Salih said the United States is working to  perpetuate its control over the international community to  advance its own and Western strategic ambitions in the Arab  world. He urged the international community to work hard to  promote better international relations.    Mr. Stevens indicated that his visit to Iraq was useful in  that he was able to see firsthand the Iraqi people's distress  caused by the relentless sanctions. He was also impressed by  Iraq's rehabilitation effort to repair the damage wrought by the  aggression. He will use the information gleaned from his visit  to Iraq in a political file geared toward British public opinion.</p>

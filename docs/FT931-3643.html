			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Management: A timely tip for manufacturers Sir Alistair Frame, a former denizen of boardrooms from RTZ to the old Davy and now chairman of both British Steel and Wellcome, has an urgent message for fellow chairmen and chief executives: take some time out from running your companies. Sir Alistair, who is chairman of the CBI's 15-month-old National Manufacturing Council, is not suggesting they should quit their posts en masse. Rather, he says, they need to find space for thinking about new ideas. Whatever the distractions of running their companies in tough conditions, there should always be time, he says, to learn from the experiences of other UK companies, and from successful manufacturing companies overseas. As the first signs of light emerge for recession-bound UK manufacturers, and the government talks of industry taking advantage of sterling's devaluation to boost exports, the issue of the UK's manufacturing effectiveness becomes increasingly important. The point is not lost on the council, which is perhaps best known for its role as one of the many organisations lobbying the government on the importance of providing the right environment for manufacturing industry to flourish. That, says Sir Alistair, is going reasonably well, but is one of only four key tasks that the council has set itself. The others are to improve the relationship between industry and the financial world, in particular the City; to improve the image and status of manufacturing industry across society; and to lobby businesses to improve their competitiveness. Surprisingly, perhaps, Sir Alistair believes this internal lobbying process is the most important, focusing as it does on issues such as how industries can improve their service to customers, marketing, innovation, product quality and other ingredients of competitiveness. Getting all these things right is the route to what is commonly called 'world class' manufacturing. But the consensus among observers of the UK manufacturing scene seems to be that, while all the brightest ideas in manufacturing can be found in use in the UK, they are not applied nearly frequently enough. That was borne out by a survey last month co-sponsored by the Design Council and EDS-Scicon, the biggest UK information technology services company. This found that less than half of UK manufacturing companies claim to practise concurrent engineering, a process which cuts product development times by enabling design and manufacturing to take place simultaneously. Clearly, an important way to spread the word about new methods in manufacturing is for companies to share their experiences. The evidence suggests larger companies are more confident about doing that without always worrying that they are giving away commercially sensitive information. But the council is hoping to attract companies of all sizes to a series of seminars beginning next month, at which executives from different companies can learn from each other. Sir Alistair will also be addressing a conference called Winning the Market  -Industry on the Move, on April 28 and 29, organised by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. The conference, to be held at a hotel in Hertfordshire, will be similar to the well-attended Cambridge Manufacturing Forum series in the 1970s. Senior European industrialists will be examining the importance of understanding and developing markets, the coherent integration of marketing, design and manufacturing, and the management of technological advantage and innovation.</p>

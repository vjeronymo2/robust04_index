			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] has  been holding talks with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]  within the context of its coalition agreement with the Slovak  National Party [SNS]. HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik said  this after today's joint session of the HZDS and SNS  parliamentary groups in Bratislava. At the same time, he said  that they would not exclude an agreement with the SDL with  regard to stabilizing the Cabinet for a certain limited period  or until the elections, regardless of whom the HZDS was in  coalition.    Answering a question regarding whether a cancellation of the  coalition agreement with the SNS and concluding a new coalition  with the SDL are being considered, Kozlik said that they had not  looked at this issue from this point of view.    In this context, Miloslav Kona, chairman of the SNS  parliamentary group, expressed the conviction that the SDL would  change its stance on refusing a coalition with the SNS while its  chairman is Jan Slota.    Commenting on the alleged offer of the presidential post to  the SDL by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, Kozlik explained  that, during a free debate outside the framework of the official  HZDS-SDL talks, it had been noted that it would not be  impossible for the HZDS to imagine an SDL candidate for the  presidential post. However, this was not discussed as an actual  offer.    The parliamentary groups of the coalition parties also  discussed individual points of the agenda of the session of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic, which will open on 9  March.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Fed cuts rates to aid recovery: US takes steps to settle markets after plunge in Japanese share prices THE US Federal Reserve cut interest rates yesterday in an attempt to sustain the momentum of a weak economic recovery and prevent sharp falls in share prices in Japan from undermining confidence in US financial markets. The US central bank signalled a quarter-point cut to 3.75 per cent in the Federal funds rate - the rate at which banks borrow from each other. It was the first move since late December when the Fed cut the discount rate by a full point to 3.5 per cent. The move took Wall Street by surprise and prompted immediate gains in share and bond prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 43.61 at 3,224.96, partially reversing sharp falls earlier this week. The benchmark 30-year long bond also rose sharply, pushing the yield down to below 7.85 per cent. Earlier yesterday, the Japanese stock market fell for the fourth successive day, taking the Nikkei average below the 17,000 level and raising renewed fears about the soundness of Japanese financial companies. The Nikkei fell 577.38 to 16,598.15, the lowest level since late 1986. Mr Tsutomo Hata, Japan's finance minister, said there was no need for concern about the financial health of Japanese banks, adding that there were signs 'that lost confidence in the stock market will be regained'. Wednesday's nerves on European stock markets steadied yesterday ahead of the news from Washington. While London was preoccupied with the general election, some continental bourses managed to regain lost ground. The quarter-point cut in Fed funds was not seen as big enough to prompt significant reductions in the cost of borrowing for US consumers and businesses. It may therefore spur speculation that the Fed will cut the discount rate again if the economy does not show greater vitality in the near future. The move followed further evidence yesterday that inflation was well under control. The producer price index rose 0.2 per cent last month and by only 0.9 per cent in the year to March. The easing of policy reflects growing apprehension about the momentum of the US economy. Employment figures for March released last week showed a gain of only 19,000, raising doubts about the sustainability of a recent rise in retail spending. The Fed has also been embarrassed by a sharp slowdown of monetary growth in recent weeks. M2, the main targeted measure of money, is just above the lower limit of its 2.5 to 6.5 per cent target range. In Tokyo, shares had held their ground for most of the day, prompting hopes that the latest plunge in prices was over. But in the last hour the market was hit with sell orders related to computer-driven, futures-linked trading. Turnover totalled was a moderate 350m shares. The heavy selling of bank shares, which have fallen by more than 30 per cent since the start of the new financial year this month, abated. Shares of Industrial Bank of Japan, the country's premier bank, rose modestly. Investors remain very gloomy. Mr Yukio Takayama, senior managing director of the Sakura Research Institute, an affiliate of Sakura Bank, said the Nikkei might drop to 15,000 or even lower. He was concerned that foreign investors might abandon the Japanese market. For their part, foreign fund managers in Tokyo looked forward to bargain-hunting, saying that blue-chip industrial stocks were now good value. Nevertheless investors, foreign and Japanese, are disappointed with the the modest level of the authorities' actions last week when the Bank of Japan cut the Official Discount Rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.75 per cent and the finance ministry announced plans to accelerate public works spending plans. The budget for 1992-93, which includes those public works, was passed by the Diet (parliament) last night. The decision clears the way for discussions on plans for a supplementary budget, which, if enacted, could boost the economy further. Options favoured by politicians include tax cuts and public works increases. Fed's determination, Page 5 Shock waves, Page 18 Lex, Page 20 World stocks, Page 39</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: How to fight evil of cellulite MENTION cellulite in medical circles and a look of quite exquisite vagueness crosses the countenance but I have not met a woman yet who does not know exactly what it is. It is fat that is more than fat. It is the fat that tends to gather round thighs and buttocks, that wrinkles and dimples and looks like orange peel. Most women dread its arrival as they might the plague. Its root cause is imprecisely understood but the consensus is that it is caused by a combination of hormones (which is why it is almost exclusively a female complaint), sluggish circulation, sedentary life- style and accumulated toxins. There is no simple way of dealing with it as so many factors are involved. A good diet, replacing tea and coffee with water, coupled with regular exercise is a start but most cases need more specific help. Here are some of the most encouraging solutions. Grayshott Hall's 'Stimulating G5 massage' (Pounds 17) was very aggressive and not very enjoyable and I was never going to have anything to do with it again until I looked at my legs. They were distinctly better. It made more difference than any other treatment. It is available in many health salons including the Hawkins Clinics in Putney and Wimbledon where a course of six treatments (and sauna) costs Pounds 72.50. Aromatherapy is, by contrast, marvellously enjoyable, involving a massage with heavenly-smelling oils. Aromatherapy Associates, 68 Maltings Place, Bagley's Lane, London SW6 has treatments aimed at shifting cellulite and the consensus is that it really does help by breaking up fat deposits, encouraging lymphatic drainage and improving the skin texture. A course of five costs Pounds 166.25. Most dramatic of all, most expensive and the only truly medical treatment is Cellulolipolysis. It is a non-surgical treatment involving transcutaneous electrotherapy. Although I haven't tried it I was much impressed by the evidence of an independent German doctor who says it is the only treatment that really deals with the problem. Six treatments cost Pounds 820.

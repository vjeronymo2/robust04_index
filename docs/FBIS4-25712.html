			<p>BFN     [Text] Listeners, we now broadcast excerpts of the  government work report delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at  the second session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional  People's Congress on religious work towards ethnic groups and  achievements in the construction of democracy, legal system, and  spiritual civilization in the first part of the report -- Review  of the Work in 1993.    The government work report noted: National unity was further  enhanced. Cadres from ethnic groups increased soundly. The  study, use, and development of written and spoken languages of  nationalities continued to receive attention. The construction  of the Great Stupa and Memorial Hall for the 10th Bainqen was  completed and a solemn inauguration ceremony was held. The  management of religious affairs was strengthened and the regime  and procedures on the administration of temples were worked out.  In the meantime, efforts were made to guide a large number of  people professing religious beliefs to contribute to social  stability and economic development. Thanks to the profound  concern and direct guidance of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council as well as the joint efforts of party and  government organizations across Tibet, work for carrying out  policies had been completed. During the period from 1980 to  1993, a total of 220 million yuan was spent for carrying out  various policies, including nearly 100 million yuan for temples.    The autonomous regional people's government has  conscientiously implemented resolutions adopted by the regional  people's congress and its standing committee and actively  subjected itself to supervision. It has earnestly handled  motions submitted by people's deputies and members of the  regional committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference as well as letters and visits from the  people.    The autonomous regional people's government has submitted  six  local laws and regulations to the regional people's congress for  examination and approval, and drawn up a number of  administrative regulations. It has extensively launched a  campaign for popularizing the laws; thus constantly enhancing  legal concepts of the broad masses of cadres and people. The  competition in creating model dual-support counties and cities,  the joint armymen-policemen-civilian activities of constructing  and creating spiritual civilization, and the work of resettling  and giving special care to dependents of revolutionary martyrs  and servicemen have made new progress. The education aimed at  nurturing a new type of citizen with high ideals, moral  integrity, a better education, and a strong sense of discipline  and characterized by patriotism, socialism, and Marxist national  and religious concepts was further popularized in depth. New  achievements have been made in constructing socialist spiritual  civilization.</p>

Karasin said that the Russian Embassy and Thai officials  have  taken the necessary steps to investigate into the circumstances  of the diplomat's disappearance and organise a search for him.  However, "the search has been unsuccessful so far," he added.    "The news about Makeyev's disappearance was a blow to his  next of kin. They were shocked by it," Karasin said.    "The feeling of sympathy and humaneness prompt us to take  urgent and more active steps to find the missing diplomat," he  said.</p>

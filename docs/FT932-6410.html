			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Letter: Clean break no option Sir, Your article ,'The cost of a clean break' (May 22/23) made no reference to the effect of the 1991 Child Support Act on such settlements when a qualifying child is involved. Absent parents who have made a one-off capital payment as a clean break settlement in divorce should be warned that they may still have to pay maintenance for their children. Consider the case in which the parent with care of the children after divorce is a working wife who accepted the family house as a clean break settlement. If she now loses her job and claims state benefits, then the Child Support Agency will use a standard formula to calculate the maintenance requirement for the children. Given the same income and allowable expenses, the father who has previously paid thousands in a capital sum will be required to pay the same maintenance as the father who has hitherto paid nothing. The Child Support Agency has widespread powers to recover this maintenance, making it a priority debt on a par with income tax and VAT. Where children are concerned a clean break settlement may well be a thing of the past unless the ruling is challenged in the courts. Pat Wittman, 22 The Chase, Reigate, Surrey RH2 7DH</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / IG Metall may strike if wage increase denied IG Metall, Germany's engineering trade union, yesterday said it would use the strike weapon 'as the last resort' if employers refuse a wage increase of over 10 per cent this year for its members in east Germany, Judy Dempsey writes from Berlin. The warning follows the start of arbitration talks in Saxony last week. Further talks will take place in the other east German states over the next few weeks. Previous talks broke down after employers had said they would not accept rapid pay increases to bring east German wages up to 82 per cent of west German levels, from the 70 per cent level at present. Yesterday, Mr Klaus Zwickel, IG Metall vice-chairman, said employers were 'reneging' on commitments to income parity between west and east Germany by 1994. He rejected criticism his union was pricing east German workers out of the market.</p>

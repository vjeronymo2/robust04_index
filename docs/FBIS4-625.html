			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC has released the final document of its  39-billion-rand Reconstruction and Development Program [RDP].  The organization brushed aside criticism that the program is  too ambitious and said problems of financing would be overcome  within the current national budget. Jennifer Wilson reports:    [Begin recording] [Wilson] A cut in the defense budget is  one  way the ANC is proposing to raise the 39 billion rands it says  the implementation of the RDP would cost over the first 5 years.    [ANC economic affairs spokesman Trevor Manuel] In the  current budget defense gets some 10.7 billion, against 1.6  billion for housing. The defense secret account alone is  two-and-a-half times larger than the housing budget, at some  3.83 billion rands. That's a contradiction that we can't  sustain in our country. If one looks at the combination of the  secret account for the current budget and the previous budget,  it adds up to more than 8 billion rands. That's about the figure  that we're looking for annually for the RDP.    [Wilson] Mr. Manuel said he did not foresee having to raise  tax levels, but would allocate more revenue to collecting taxes.  The ANC says the document has not changed significantly since  it was first published. It still promises to provide 1 million  houses, electrify 2.5 million houses, and provide 2.5 million  jobs over 5 years. [end recording]</p>

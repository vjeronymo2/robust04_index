			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Mitric] </F>   [Text] The cease-fire agreement continues to be more or  less observed on the Sarajevo battlefield, with the exception of  sporadic Muslim sniper provocations. The army of the Srpska  republic and UN Protection Forces are contributing toward the  establishment of peace in this part of former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, high military circles of the Srpska republic  emphasize. Thanks to Blue Helmet interventions, the Muslims  have somewhat reduced their engineering works in Sarajevo.    As Serbian military circles emphasize, the 2d Corps of the  so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army offered cooperation to the  111th Brigade of the Croatian Defense Council Tuzla, which has  been increasingly escaping the control of Alija's [Izetbegovic]  army. The same sources claim that Muslim-Croat clashes continue  in central Bosnia and in Herzegovina. The second successive  attempt to form a Croatian-Muslim alliance is only producing  results in the Sava Basin. Concurrent with the activities of  the regular Croatian Army from the region of (Rajevo Selo) in  the Serbian Sava Basin, which directly threaten the corridor,  the Muslims have been pounding Brcko and its surroundings with  artillery.    Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the Peoples' Assembly of the  Srpska republic, commented on the efforts to open Dubrave  airport near Tuzla at all costs as follows:    [Begin Krajisnik recording] We have never been opposed to  the opening of airports and delivery of humanitarian aid. We  would not be opposed to the opening of Tuzla airport either. Of  course, we would demand the opening of Banja Luka and other  airports as well as various other venues of communication, and  therefore, unhindered traffic. However, we suspect, that is to  say, we have fairly reliable information on plans to abuse Tuzla  airport in the same way Sarajevo airport has been abused, by  using the lines and routes for humanitarian aid distribution to  arm the Muslims. This is also the objective for Tuzla airport.  If we can protect our people from the plan that some Western  forces have concocted and prevent the armament of the Muslims,  we will have nothing against the opening of Tuzla airport. If  the superpowers nevertheless wish to open Tuzla airport we will  insist on certain preconditions to eliminate this danger. They  can definitely open Tuzla airport by force, which would be  nothing unusual at this moment, as neither law nor justice are  being observed. However, the Serbs will oppose by all means,  the opening of Tuzla airport without our side's consent. [end  recording]</p>

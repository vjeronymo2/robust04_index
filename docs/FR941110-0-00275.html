			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existence of only four populations consisting of approximately 125 individuals of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  increases the potential for extinction from stochastic events. The limited gene pool may depress reproductive vigor, or a single human-caused or natural environmental disturbance, a disease, or predation could destroy an entire population and a significant percentage of the known individuals of the species. In the steep areas where  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  grows, erosion and landslides due to natural weathering can result in the death of individual plants as well as habitat destruction. This process especially affects the continued existence of species or populations with limited numbers and/or narrow ranges, such as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and can be exacerbated by human disturbance and land use practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Competition by alien plant species is a threat to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Brought to Hawaii as a cultivated herbaceous plant, daisy fleabane has become naturalized in wetter regions of four islands (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). Daisy fleabane has invaded Kalalau, Koaie, and Waialae Valleys, three of the four areas where  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occurs (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992). Lantana, brought to Hawaii as an ornamental plant, is an aggressive, thicket-forming shrub that can now be found on all of the main islands in mesic forests, dry shrublands, and other dry, disturbed habitats (Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). Lantana threatens all known populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (D. Lorence and K. Wood, pers. comms., 1992). Prickly Florida blackberry, an aggressive alien species in disturbed mesic to wet forests and subalpine grasslands on four islands, is considered a noxious weed by the State of Hawaii (Smith 1985, Wagner  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1990). Prickly Florida blackberry threatens the Kalalau and Waialae Valley populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (K. Wood, pers. comm., 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fire is considered an immediate threat to the rare plants of the cliff faces and valleys of the Na Pali Coast, where the largest known population of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  occurs. Under dry conditions, human-set fires would spread rapidly and could destroy these plants, due to the strong prevailing winds and dry fuel load on cliff ledges. Fire could destroy dormant seeds as well as plants, even on steep cliffs (Clarke and Cuddihy 1980). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by this species in finalizing this rule. Based on this evaluation, this rulemaking will list  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as endangered. This species numbers only approximately 125 individuals in four known extant populations. Threats to the continued existence of the species include habitat degradation and/or predation by goats, competition from alien plants, fire, landslides and erosion, and lack of legal protection or difficulty in enforcing laws that become effective with this listing action. Small population size and limited distribution make the species particularly vulnerable to extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor from stochastic events. Because  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, it fits the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat is not being proposed for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Poa mannii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The publication of a map and precise description of critical habitat in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as required in a designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to this species from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to its decline. The listing of this species as endangered publicizes the rarity of the plant and, thus, can make it attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of rare plants. All involved parties and the major landowner have been notified of the location and importance of protecting the habitat of this species, which will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process. There are no known Federal activities within the currently known natural habitat of this species. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time, because such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and because it is unlikely to aid in the conservation of this species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

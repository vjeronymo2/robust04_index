			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments responding to the notice of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking were received. A public hearing was scheduled for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 26, 1994, pursuant to a notice of public hearing published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously with the notice of proposed rulemaking. The IRS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received one request to speak at the public hearing. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request was withdrawn before the hearing date. On April 14,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994, the IRS published a notice (59 FR 17747) cancelling the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public hearing on the proposed regulations. After consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the comments received, the proposed regulations are adopted as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised by this Treasury decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 42 provides for a low-income housing credit that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be claimed as part of the general business credit under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 38. In general, the credit is allowable only if the owner of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified low-income building receives a housing credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation from a State or local housing credit agency (Agency)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the jurisdiction where the building is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The aggregate housing credit dollar amount that an Agency may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocate for any calendar year is limited to the State housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit ceiling apportioned to the Agency for that year. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 42(h)(3)(C), the State housing credit ceiling of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State for any calendar year is an amount equal to the sum of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) $1.25 multiplied by the State population (the population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component); (b) the unused State housing credit ceiling, if any,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the State for the preceding calendar year (the unused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryforward component); (c) the amount of State housing credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ceiling returned in the calendar year (the returned credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component); plus (d) the amount, if any, allocated to the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Secretary under section 42(h)(3)(D) from a national pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of unused credit (the national pool component).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations set forth the rules governing the order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which credit is allocated from the various components of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State housing credit ceiling under section 42(h)(3)(C) (the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stacking rules). In general, under the stacking rules, credit is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocated first from the sum of the population and returned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit components, then from the unused carryforward component,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and finally from the national pool component. The final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations also reflect the statutory rule that unallocated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit attributable to the national pool component cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carried forward, and, therefore, is not included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carryforward component for the following year. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations provide that no credit allocated prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year 1990, and no credit allowable under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 42(h)(4) (relating to the portion of credit attributable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible basis financed by certain tax-exempt obligations under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 103), may be returned for reallocation. Thus, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit is not included in the returned credit component for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator requested clarification of the rule in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations that if the terms of the allocation violate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any requirement of section 42, the allocation is not valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the commentator expressed concern that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misrepresentation by a taxpayer to an Agency would result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation being treated as not valid and as if it had never been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made and ineligible for treatment as a returned credit. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final regulations do not include this statement. First, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of whether an allocation is valid is not within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope of these regulations. Second, given the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that an allocation must be valid to qualify as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned credit, it is unnecessary to include the additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement that, if the terms of the allocation violate any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement of section 42, the allocation is not valid and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as if it had not been made. However, for all purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 42, including qualification as a returned credit, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocation must be validly made. See, for example, &sect;&sect;1.42&hyph;1T and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.42&hyph;6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final regulations adopt the provision of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations requiring that if a credit is returned within 180  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days following the close of the first taxable year of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building's credit period and a Form 8609,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Low-Income Housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Credit Allocation Certification, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has been issued for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building, an Agency must notify the IRS that the credit has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned. One commentator requested that the procedure for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifying the IRS be clarified. Accordingly, the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations clarify that if all of the credit is returned, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency must follow the procedures in &sect;1.42&hyph;5(e)(3) for filing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Form 8823,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies Report of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Noncompliance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In situations where the credit is only partially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned, the Agency must follow the procedures prescribed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> filing an amended Form 8610,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annual Low-Income Housing Credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agencies Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations permit an Agency to treat credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned from a project to the Agency after October 31 of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year and not reallocated by the Agency by the close of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the year as returned at the beginning of the succeeding calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year (the two-month rule). One commentator suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-month rule of the proposed regulations be changed to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more time to reallocate credits before the close of the calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year. Accordingly, the final regulations provide that credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned to the Agency after September 30 of any calendar year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and not reallocated by the close of the year may be treated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned at the beginning of the succeeding calendar year. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to another comment, the final regulations clarify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an Agency, in its discretion, may treat a portion of a credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is so returned and that is not reallocated before the close  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the calendar year as returned in the next calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, to the extent any portion of a credit returned after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 30 of any calendar year is allocated by the close of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the calendar year in which it is returned, that portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit is included as part of the returned credit component of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State housing credit ceiling for the year in which the credit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is returned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulations provide that, if an allocation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancelled by mutual consent, a signed and dated written agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the Agency and the allocation recipient (or its successor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in interest) must indicate the amount of the allocation returned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the date on which the credit is returned. Commentators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that, if the terms of an allocation state that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unused amounts are automatically returned to the Agency by mutual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement, the regulations should not require a signed and dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written agreement. If this suggestion were adopted, neither the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IRS nor the Agency would know with enough precision the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credit returned and the date on which the credit is returned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This information is necessary to determine with certainty the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned credit component of the State housing credit ceiling and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to avoid discrepancies in the amount of credit allocated to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular project. Thus, the final regulations do not adopt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this suggestion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

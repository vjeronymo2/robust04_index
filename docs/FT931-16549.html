			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: BNFL confident that Thorp plant will be unwrapped Sir, In your leader, 'Thorp in trouble' (December 31), you state that British Nuclear Fuels must fear that its Thorp plant is a Christmas present it will never unwrap. Not true. BNFL would only have such fears if we doubted the professionalism and integrity of the regulatory bodies concerned, namely Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or if we did not believe in Mr Major's government's commitment to economic growth, which is incompatible with turning Britain's second largest industrial project into this country's largest white elephant. As we entertain neither proposition, we remain confident that we shall obtain the necessary authorisations from HMIP and Maff to enable this environmentally sound project, with its Pounds 9bn of firm advance orders, to start up. Could I correct three factual points in your editorial. First, contrary to the misinformation put out by Greenpeace, which it has agreed not to repeat, there is no credible risk of our German or Japanese customers withdrawing from their contracts. On the contrary, the chairmen of the two German utilities claimed by Greenpeace to be considering their position have written to me to confirm that they intend to honour their contracts. Second, BNFL has not suggested the decommissioning costs of Thorp will be Pounds 1.2bn, but rather Pounds 750m in 1989 money or about Pounds 900m in January 1993 money. Third, we have repeatedly made it clear that these decommissioning costs will be fully written off over the first 10 years of Thorp's life. We expect the plant to be in operation for at least 20 years and, as in the case of BNFL's Magnox power stations, it could well be profitably extended further.

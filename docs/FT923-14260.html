			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Recs gain on price leniency THE regional electricity distribution companies ('Recs') surged after news that the electricity industry watchdog, Offer, is to impose a more lenient price formula on the National Grid Company (Gridco) than had been forecast by some analysts. Offer announced yesterday that, as from April 1993, electricity price rises would be allowed to rise by the retail price index (RPI) minus three percentage points. As recently as last week there had been rumours in the market that a much stricter formula of RPI minus five points would be introduced. Gridco is owned by the 12 Recs which derive some 10 per cent of profits from their holdings in Gridco. 'This is a good result for the electricity distribution sector,' said Mr Kevin Lapwood, a utilities specialist at Nomura. Other analysts said the review was certainly not as bad as had been expected, with a pricing formula of RPI minus four points said to have been the general consensus figure. 'It doesn't choke off the Recs' dividend policy which is targeted at seven or eight per cent real growth,' said one observer. The Offer news coincided with good results from Seeboard and Yorkshire Electricity, with Seeboard's 17 per cent dividend increase 'trumping the rest of the pack', according to Mr Lapwood. East Midlands delivered the best individual performance, closing 20 up at 315p, closely followed by Manweb, 373p, and Norweb, 363p, both up 18, and Yorkshire, 17 firmer at 383p. The Electricity Package, which ceases trading on September 16, when the packages are split up, raced up 150 to Pounds 3,148. BAe active Speculation early in the session that Italy or Spain could soon follow Germany out of the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA), put the skids under British Aerospace (BAe), the UK's lead contractor on the project, sending the shares tumbling to a new low. At the day's worst, the shares were off 29 at 208p, though few shares changed hands at that stage. Concern about the dividend and provisions that may have to be made for the regional aircraft division also continued to affect sentiment. But later reports from Spain that it would remain involved in the project, combined with 'bottom fishing' by what one analyst called 'those brave enough to be in this stock', helped the shares rally off the day's low point to end a net 6 down at 231p, a three-year low. Wellcome bounce As the bear raiders begin to lose their influence and the global book-building exercise gets under way, Wellcome bounced 17 to 900p. One investment house was talking of bids between 750p and 800p a share for the 330m shares scheduled to be released by Wellcome Trust, the charitable trust which holds 75 per cent of the stock. However, Robert Fleming, the private investment bank which is leading the global flotation, is believed to be confident that the strike price will be significantly higher. One source close to the company said: 'I would just draw people's attention to the share price at 900p.' ICI recovered 6 to 1145p despite a profit forecast cut by securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. UBS reduced its 1992 estimate by Pounds 50m to Pounds 800m and its 1993 figure by Pounds 120m to Pounds 880m. However, the house maintains a buy recommendation. The oil majors moved ahead strongly, as did British Gas, but the second-liners were significantly lower. There were hints around the market that one of the UK's biggest institutional investors in the oil sector had been unloading large lines of stock in the smaller exploration stocks such as Premier, 1 1/2 off at 18 1/2 p, Goal, 2 lower at 49p, Monument Oil &amp; Gas, a penny easier at 31 3/4 p and Clyde, which dropped 3 to 43p. But Enterprise Oil improved 6 to 400p despite rumblings around the oil sector about the resignation of Mr Peter Kingston, Enterprise's technical director, seen by some analysts as a potential successor to Mr Graham Hearn, the current chairman and chief executive. Vodafone was keenly sold, closing 5 off at 326p on 5.5m shares traded amid fears of much keener competition from Cellnet. Securicor 'A', which has a 40 per cent stake in Cellnet with BT owning 60 per cent, jumped 15 to 571p after the near-doubled profits. BT moved up 5 1/2 to 346p. Glaxo bounced 28 to 677p as UK buyers returned. However, one trader said the stock needed a kick start from some genuine good news before it would see a return to former levels. Rumours of a profit forecast cut were said to have prompted a slide in Fisons. The rumour never materialised into fact but the damage was done and the shares fell 5 to 210p. Dollar-sensitive Rothmans International lost 23 to 1076p reflecting a weak US currency. Shares in Vickers fell 6 to 135p after two brokers weighed in with savage profit downgrades. Carr Kitcat reduced its current forecast by Pounds 21m to Pounds 10m, blaming continued weakness at the company's Rolls-Royce subsidiary. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was also reported to be expecting profits of around Pounds 10m. The building sector tended to absorb another string of profits downgradings. A big seller moved in on Taylor Woodrow, leaving the stock 5 off at 80p. Tarmac dropped to 89p after BZW and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew chopped their profits estimates, but then responded to a flurry of stories suggesting that Charter Consolidated was still taking a hard look at acquiring the group and settled 3 up at 96 1/2 p. BZW also lowered its estimates for Blue Circle, finally 3 firmer at 210p. With recriminations still flying over the collapse of talks to sell its catering division, Forte remained friendless. The shares slipped 5 to 173p. After its recent poor run, Rank Organisation bounced ahead of figures tomorrow, the shares rising 5 to 628p. After outperforming the market by some 15 per cent in the last month, Northern Foods found itself out of favour. Investors took a subtle shift from Smith New Court as an excuse to take profits. The shares tumbled 14 to 608p MARKET REPORTERS: Peter John, Christopher Price, Joel Kibazo, Steve Thompson.

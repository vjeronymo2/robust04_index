			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / International Company News: Veag to invest DM20bn ahead of sell-off Veag, eastern Germany's largest utility, will invest more than DM20bn (Dollars 12.1bn) in modernising and upgrading the region's electricity infrastructure, Mr Karlheinz Steiner, a board member, said yesterday. Much of the planned investment programme will involve building brown coal-fired power stations and installing emission-reducing equipment. Over 11,450 MegaWatts of Vega's total 14,225MW, are generated by brown coal. The company, which is still under the Treuhand privatisation agency, increased turnover last year by 2.4 per cent, to DM6.5bn compared with the previous year, despite the continuing fall in energy consumption throughout eastern Germany. However, profits last year were reduced to zero from DM7m in 1992 because of heavy restructuring costs, including redundancy payments, high investment commitments, and the transfer of DM4bn in liquid assets to the Treuhand. Primary energy consumption in the region had been traditionally dominated by brown coal: it held 68 per cent share of the energy market. However, with the collapse of manufacturing, primary energy consumption fell from 128.3m tonnes in 1989 to 83m tonnes in 1991. Mr Steiner said the company would have to tap capital markets to finance its investment programme, a move supported by the advisory board, which approved borrowings of up to DM2.3bn for 1994. The workforce has been cut from 29,000 in 1990 to 13,513 last year, and a further 2,000 jobs are expected to be lost this year. Mr Steiner said the company, which has a monopoly in the generation and distribution of electricity throughout eastern Germany, would be finally privatised 'around the middle of the year'. It will be sold for an estimated DM8bn to West Germany's largest utilities, headed by RWE, PreussenElektra and Bayernwerk. However, the successful privatisation of Veag remains dependent on the Treuhand completing the sale of Laubag, the large brown coalfields which will feed the Veag electricity grid. Laubag will be sold to a consortium led by Rheinbraun, the coal subsidiary of RWE.</p>

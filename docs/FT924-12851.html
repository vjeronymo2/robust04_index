			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Time to nationalise private sector debt IT IS all very well to say that the best time to kick a man is when he is down; but the mob round Mr John Major is now so dense that it is hardly worth joining in. It is only a few weeks since President George Bush was hoping to emulate Mr Major and win an election from behind;now it looks much likelier that Mr Major will join Mr Bush in retirement. Time, then, to think about the task which will face his successor. (even if that successor proves, improbably, to be called John Major). The place to begin is the latest analysis from the invaluable Professor Tim Congdon*, which examines the current state of British banks, savings institutions and insurance companies. In any but these extraordinary times, it would have been the main talking point in the City in the 10 days since it appeared. In a few bleak charts, it describes a catastrophe waiting to happen. You think you know it all already? In a sense, we all do. The banks have too many bad loans, thebuilding societies too many stretched borrowers, the insurance companies have been meeting claims out of shareholders' funds; no surprises there. But the words could describe anything from a nasty head cold up. It is the numbers which tell the real story, which is no doubt why we try to ignore them. Here are the Congdon numbers. First bankruptcies - the inevitable result of squeezing a heavily over-borrowed economy with record real interest rates. The pain should convince even Mr Major that his policies are working. Company failures have risen nearly fivefold since the Conservatives took office in 1979. They have doubled since Mr Major arrived at the Treasury. Corporate borrowings are still five times cash holdings (double the normal level), while profits are falling again. The workout has hardly begun. Personal bankruptcies have risen fivefold in the Major period. The main trouble, of course, is in housing. The real cost of mortgages - interest minus house price deflation - is 14 per cent even after Friday's rate cut. Small wonder that mortgages in arrears are quickly approaching total building society capital. This begins to look like a black hole. The banks look in better shape, at first sight: provisions at the end of last year only accounted for 35 per cent of capital. But remember that provisioning is restrained by the need to appear creditworthy, and write-offs by the necessity to maintain minimum capital ratios; remember, too, that many industrial companies are now on the debt-watch list, and that property companies, the most indebted group, are losing money year by year. Small wonder that balance sheet shrinkage is the rule among banks: it is not a question of prudence, but survival. Leaving aside insurance (it should be enough, on a gloomy morning, to remark that solvency ratios are heading straight through their 1974 trough), this crisis of the financial intermediaries rules out any domestic recovery for years, even assuming that it can be contained. Congdon puts the earliest date at the late 1990s. That could be optimistic. The private sector's boot-straps are broken. There is one tried and proved remedy: bank nationalisation. This can be short-term and highly profitable, like the Federal Reserve takeover of Continental Illinois; it can be medium-term and costly, like the US savings and loan bail-out; or it can be long-term, like European bank nationalisation in the 1930s, which is still not fully unwound. This was highly effective economically. The cure is essentially a write-off of past errors by converting private into public debt, and provides a kind of geared-up reflation, by putting lending institutions under clean-slate management. There is a theoretical market alternative: sell our weaker banks to Europe at give-away prices. However, this would be bad value for Britain, and probably politically impossible. The sensible answer is nationalisation. It might serve Mr Major right to survive to be the man to do it. *Gerrard and National Review, October</p>

This was  subsequently supported by the Soviet Union's demise.    Perhaps Winston Churchill, who definitely marked the  initiation of the Cold War following his 5 March 1946 speech at  Fulton University, Missouri, United States of America, would not  have been so optimistic if he could see several current  conflicts now.    The Korean case: For almost 40 years, the United States has  virtually maintained an occupation force in South Korea.  Currently it maintains 30,500 soldiers and 140 diverse types of  combat planes in addition to the forces it maintains in Japan  and other areas of the Pacific. These forces could also be used  in case of a conflict in the region.    On 12 March 1993, the DPRK decided to withdraw from the NPT  [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], under pressure to have its  territory unconditionally inspected by IAEA officials. This  occurred after it was accused of making preparations to  construct a nuclear weapon. Although there are ongoing  negotiations, the situation in the peninsula continues to be  tense.    The anti-Korean campaign started at the beginning of 1993.  The London SUNDAY TIMES affirmed the DPRK was on the verge of  constructing the atomic bomb in an extensive April report.    In its 28 November 1993 edition, the U.S. magazine NEWSWEEK,  adding fuel to the fire (or maybe a little more "ice" to what  was left of the Cold War), labelled the DPRK as "public enemy  No. 1." The publication affirmed that the United States, the  IAEA, and South Korea are "convinced" the North Koreans are  dangerously close to constructing the atomic bomb.    The Russian case: When the one-time powerful Soviet Union  ceased to exist in December 1991, the consolidation of  friendship and relations between Russia and the United States  reached unprecedented levels in the military field. In addition  to disarmament agreements, on 8 September 1993 a memorandum of  understanding was signed between the U.S. Defense Department and  the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. This was,  according to the document, within the framework of "leaving  behind forever the years of nuclear confrontation and superpower  rivalry."    Some U.S. officials have reiterated that Russia is no longer  an enemy of the United States, and therefore the possibility of  a nuclear attack being initiated against the United State from  Russian territory has been reduced    Nevertheless, the U.S. combat forces' training program  maintains a high level of periodic offensive actions. According  to the so-called strategists, their main adversaries are the  former USSR republics that have nuclear weapons, particularly  the Russian Federation. Their activities include several nuclear  rocket targeting tests and the implementation of massive  strategic bombings.    The report labeled "Total Revision: Forces for a New Era,"  presented by Les Aspin, U.S. secretary of defense, dated 1  September 1993, after reasserting that the Cold War is over,  acknowledges:    "The dangers that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass  destruction represent, including the dangers associated with the  proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons,  associated with the high levels of those weapons that are still  present in the former Soviet Union." [sentence as received]    General George L. Butler, chief of the U.S. Armed Forces  Strategic Command, in statements to THE NEW YORK TIMES at the  beginning of March, in referrence to the "target" of U.S.  intercontinental rockets, said: "We do not only concentrate on  the former Soviet Union but also on any potentially hostile  country that possesses or that is attempting to possess weapons  of mass destruction.    It appears the Cold War is not over... definitely not for  the  Russians either.    The Cuban case: The Cuban-U.S. conflict gained a new  dimension following the revolution's victory on 1 January 1959.  Nevertheless, its roots date back many years before Churchill's  speech, and even before the springing up of socialism as a  system. It is rooted in the imperialists' appetite for the  "sugar island," their theory of a "ripe fruit," and based on the  Monroe Doctrine (America for the Americans) and other similar  theories.    The U.S. Administrations has attempted to isolate, weaken,  and defeat the revolution through invasion, the well-known  assassination attempts, the economic blockade (taken to its  highest levels ever), hostile propaganda, and all types of  harassment.    During the "Cold War," the United States considered Cuba a  USSR satellite and, therefore, a threat to its national  security. This is the reason for those Sunday nuclear targeting  tests against the small island, while the majority of its  resident slept or were getting ready for their daily voluntary  work in the countryside and the cities.    Although for some theoreticians, the Cold War was officially  over in December of 1991, the empire's policy toward Cuba has  turned more dramatic since then.    The stepping up of the economic blockade with the so-called  "Law for Democracy in Cuba," know as the "Torricelli Law,"  represents one more escalation in this "specific cold war" the  U.S. Government is waging against Cuba. This comes at a time  when the world is rapidly expanding measures that encourage free  trade.    But revolutionary Cuba, the Cuba that has always been ready  to help everyone, does not have rights. Cuba must be  persecuted; it must be cornered, strangled, and starved if it  does not surrender; this is how things are in the economic,  political, and military fields. The U.S. Armed Forces will use  any pretext to maintain a permanent presence in areas near Cuba  -- whether the struggle against drugs or the situation in Haiti.  Several U.S. Navy warships and Coast Guards ships are always  kept a short distance from our coasts.    The U.S. Armed Forces have continued to carry out extensive  exercises and maneuvers around our nation, despite the alleged  end of the "Cold War."    In 1992, for example, the U.S. Armed Forces were engaged in  the Ocean Venture Exercise that included the landing of  amphibious craft on Puerto Rico and the passing of large naval  convoys, including aircraft carriers and amphibious ships, near  Cuba. This coincided with the Trade Winds Exercise carried out  in the eastern Caribbean, which included a mock naval blockade  on a Caribbean island.    Also, after the "end of the Cold War," the Unites States  maintains on Cuba territory -- against the will and wish of our  government and our people -- Guantanamo Naval Base in the  southeastern part of the country. The United States was able to  impose this base under leonine conditions on the budding pseudo-  republic more than 90 years ago.    From this base -- a base that costs U.S. taxpayers  approximately $821,917 a day -- they annually engage in  violations of our airspace and national waters by combat  aircraft and ships that visit the base. In addition, since its  installation, scores of provocations have been staged against  our border brigade guards. Their soldiers in this military  enclave periodically carry out military exercises in which even  the alleged massive arrival of Cuban refugees from nonoccupied  territory has been simulated.    The immigration issue is another factor that "could make one  think" that the "Cold War" has not concluded. While the United  States puts up a three-meter metal wall (similar to the one they  brought down in Berlin), to prevent the crossing of "illegal  aliens" from Mexico into U.S. territory, they encourage illegal  departures from Cuba. They do not care who these individuals  are, be they mere traitors or common criminals; all are received  with open arms in Miami.    At Guantanamo Naval Base they also encourage illegal  departures, without taking into account the danger this  represents. Those who attempt these departures run the risk of  perishing because of the mines placed on either side of the  fence. Nevertheless, a high percentage of those Cuban citizens  who officially request an entry visa at the U.S. Interests  Office are refused.    After reviewing these specific facts, any reader, even  though  he may not be an expert in international politics, could at  least question whether the Cold War is truly over.</p>

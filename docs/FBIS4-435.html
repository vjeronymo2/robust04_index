			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by MDR President Faustin Twagiramungu in </F> Kigali on 11 April; read by announcer]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] We must come together and help  those fighting the regime. You should know that you are sons of  Rwanda. The Republican Democratic Movement [MDR] cannot accept  people using their grief as a pretext to kill indiscriminately  and for this to be accepted by senior officers. We cannot just  stand by and watch. The MDR and other parties that favor change  in Rwanda cannot accept decisions made by those who had no power  to do so within their parties. This is one of the reasons why  the self-styled coalition government is unacceptable. The MDR  does not accept the government of Jean Kambanda since it exists  in violation of the country's constitution and other known  agreements related to the formation of a government. [passage  omitted]    The MDR calls on the group of soldiers and their supporters  who are [words indistinct] not to plunge the country into an  abyss of endless misery. If these people aim to preserve their  personal interests, they should know that this is no longer  possible since the current times and the country cannot accept  it. They should abandon the policies of (?selfishness) and  adopt the policy of multipartyism, since it is the one accepted  by the Arusha agreement.</p>

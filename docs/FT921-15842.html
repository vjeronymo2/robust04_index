			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Opening hours Sir, Barry Hyman got his facts wrong when he wrote to you last week concerning bank opening hours. NatWest has been opening full branches from 9.00 am until 4.30 pm since last summer, with some 420 outlets staying open until 5.30 pm. Some 220 branches are open from 9.30 am until 3.30 pm on a Saturday. I believe that the combination of opening hours and number of outlets concerned compares very favourably with that offered by Mr Hyman's shops. H M V Gray, general manager, UK branch business, National Westminster Bank, 41 Lothbury, London EC2</p>

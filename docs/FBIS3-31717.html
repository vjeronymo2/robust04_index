			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jiri Stastny: "According to the Chairman of the </F> Czech Union of Freedom Fighters, the Final Compensation Must Be  Paid by Germany"]    [Text] Czech Union of Freedom Fighters [CSBS] Chairman  Jakub Cermin yesterday expressed the union's point of view on  compensation for former political prisoners during the Nazi era.    The CSBS agrees with compensation in advance from the Czech  Republic's funds; however, it thinks that the Federal Republic  of Germany should pay the final compensation. It emphasizes that  the matter must be dealt with quickly in view of the advanced  age of the resistance fighters. Representatives from the CSBS  and the Association of Freed Political Prisoners have stated  that the sums proposed do not correspond to the sums paid in  other countries (5,000 German marks per person per year of  imprisonment). At present, this concerns some 8,200 people. It  is a fundamental issue of international relations. "We are still  the only state that has not been compensated," said Union Deputy  Chairman Jan Paroutek.    In 1973, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany  was willing to pay compensation to Czech political prisoners  according to the same principles as for other European  countries. Its goodwill, however, did not meet with a proper  response because the German side insisted on payment in German  marks targeted on individuals, while our government demanded an  overall sum that it would distribute in accordance with its own  rules. The German Government did not accede to this solution.  Association of Domestic Resistance Chairman Slavomir Klaban has  briefed reporters on an open letter to the chairman of the Czech  Republic Supreme Court in which he called upon Otakar Motejl to  resign immediately. In March 1970, Motejl rescinded the  acquittal of nine citizens sentenced in a political trial in  1954 for alleged treason.</p>

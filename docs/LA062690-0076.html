			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Cable System Seeks CBS Affiliation: A Concord, N.H., local cable television  system is seeking to affiliate with the CBS TV Network.  </P> <P> CBS has no affiliate in New Hampshire. The request by the local cable system,  owned by Continental Cablevision, fourth-largest operator of cable systems in  the country, steps up pressure on the program exclusivity debate in Congress.  Cable systems want broadcast networks to yield on exclusive contracts with  local affiliates as long as networks press for non-exclusive access to cable  program services such as HBO.  </P></p>

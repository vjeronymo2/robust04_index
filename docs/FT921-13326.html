			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Gold Fields flat amid softness in markets GOLD FIELDS of South Africa (GFSA), one of the country's largest mining houses, recorded roughly unchanged results in the six months to December. The result came against a background of continuing weakness in world commodity markets. Attributable profits fell to R133m (Dollars 47.6m) from R134m in 1990. The 1990 figure, however, was a low base, as it was 30 per cent down on the R190m earned in the equivalent period in 1989. Revenue was R231m, down from R339m. Of this, R123m came from investments, compared with R136m, and R108m from fees, interest and other sources, against R103m. Expenditure was virtually unchanged at R77m, leaving pre-tax profits of R154m, down from R163m. Mr Alan Wright, executive director, blamed the drop in investment income on lower commodity prices, particularly for lead and copper, which contributed to a decline in income from GFSA's unlisted investments, Black Mountain and O'Okiep. Income from gold was flat. Mr Wright said about 65 per cent of GFSA's income came from gold, with 65 per cent of this figure coming from dividend income and the balance from fees obtained for services rendered to the mines in the group. GFSA is the most gold-oriented of South Africa's mining houses. Driefontein and Kloof, which GFSA manages, are two of the richest mines in the world, with market capitalisations of R8.8bn and R4.3bn respectively. Mr Wright said GFSA's activities outside of South Africa had 'gone a lot faster than we anticipated. We have been well received around the world as joint venture partners'. He said prospects in the second half depended upon how quickly world economic growth picked up, with commodity prices normally following an upturn by six months. Even in the best circumstances, any such upturn would be too late to affect results in this financial year. The dividend was maintained at 70 cents per share, on earnings of 138 cents per share compared with 140 cents.</p>

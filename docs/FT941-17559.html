			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The man who keyed IBM into computers: The impact of Thomas Watson Jr who died on New Year's Eve By his own account, the course of Thomas Watson Jr's life changed irrevocably in the spring of 1945. He had invited General Follett Bradley, whose aide-de-camp he had been during the second world war, to dinner. The two men were close friends and Bradley asked the 31-year-old Watson what he intended to do in peace-time. A natural and enthusiastic flyer, Watson replied that he had a job lined up as a pilot with United Air Lines. Bradley, puzzled, replied: 'Really? I always thought you'd go back and run the IBM company.' It was a reply that surprised nobody but, it seems, Watson himself. The eldest son of Thomas J. Watson, the self-willed, self-educated, hard-driving businessman who created International Business Machines in his own inflexible image, everybody around him knew he was destined from birth to run one of the world's most significant business empires. As a gawky 13-year-old, he was photographed with his father on their way to an IBM sales convention, both wearing the staid and sombre garb that Watson Sr encouraged his armies of salespeople to adopt. When himself a junior salesman, aged 26, he filled his entire year's quota on the first day of the year thanks to a single order from US Steel Products . But Watson Jr knew his progress at IBM was a consequence of his father's position rather than his own ability and his early years with the company were marred by anger, humiliation and frustration. Throughout his life he was haunted by the belief that he would never fill his father's shoes, nor match the old tyrant's expectations of him. The story of his battle for independence and self-fulfilment is movingly told in his autobiography 'Father, Son &amp; Co' published in 1990. Tom Watson's lasting memorial, however, and one that owes nothing to his father, is that IBM is today acknowledged as the world's largest computer company; it was due to his foresight that IBM moved in the 1950s from electromechanical punched-card tabulators to electronic computers. It was his courage and resilience which held the ring while IBM was fighting the hugely expensive battle in the 1960s to establish the System/360, later to become the world's most successful family of mainframe computers. Those who knew the Watsons well believe that IBM would inevitably have moved into computers - Watson Sr could not bear the thought that any other company could build machines better than his own - but that without Tom Jr's perseverance, the company would have had to recover ground lost to the likes of Remington Rand and would never have been able to dominate the market through the 1970s and 1980s in the way it did. With hindsight, indeed, it is likely IBM would not have lost its way so badly in the early 1990s if it had had a leader of equivalent vision and courage prepared to cut ties with the past and invest in the future to exploit fully the personal computer revolution. Tom Watson was born in 1914 when his father was already 39. He was followed by two sisters, Jane and Helen, and a brother, Arthur, known for most of his life as Dick. Watson Sr planned for his two sons to inherit his empire and Dick was eventually given control of IBM World Trade, IBM's operations outside North America. He died in 1974 aged 55 after a fall when recuperating from a heart attack. Tom Jr's youth and early manhood were spent in hedonistic attempts to escape the inevitable. Tall and handsome, he was a poor student but a good sportsman with a special aptitude for yachting and skiing. Shortly after arriving at Brown University in Rhode Island he learned to fly. Some might see psychological significance in Tom Jr's enduring love of aircraft and his skill as a pilot. His father had a pathological fear of flying. It was an area that was Tom's alone. Money was no object. He recalled: 'I had plenty of money for fooling around. My monthly allowance was Dollars 300 - about double the income of the average American family in those years.' While still a college junior in 1935, he bought his first aircraft, a Fairchild 234. His father was, at the time, at the the head of the list of highest paid Americans. Inevitably, any assessments of Tom Jr's achievements have to be seen against this background of extreme advantage. He had nothing in common with the ordinary businessman progressing through a company. Every step was preordained and overseen by his father. Tom Sr wanted to see his children do well so he could bask in the reflected glory; at the same time, he had no intention of allowing them to take away any of his own prestige. When, in 1955, Tom Jr appeared on the front cover of Time magazine - something his father had never achieved - to mark the gathering pace of the computer revolution, he felt forced to write an apologetic note to soften the blow. 'It was a sincere but clumsy attempt to reassure him, though I doubt it made him feel any less upstaged. He didn't talk to me about the article at all. He never said 'Great going' and I never brought it up,' Tom wrote later. He became a military pilot despite having been turned down for the Air Corps because of defective eyesight. Here the Watson stubbornness made itself felt. Tom bought an eye examination machine and practised until he had trained himself to pass the test. He was called up in autumn 1940, eventually seeing service in Europe and flying hundreds of hours across Russia and China. He returned to IBM in 1946 after the end of the war. In the interim period, he had cast off his playboy image, married Olive Field Cawley and was showing serious signs of wanting to fulfil his destiny. It was a critical time for the nascent computer industry. The Eniac, one of the first electronic digital computers, had been built at the University of Pennsylvania by Presper Eckert and John Mauchly. Tom Jr, was impressed by the giant machine with its 18,000 vacuum tubes, but hardly captivated. What caught his imagination was a suitcased-sized electronic calculator dreamed up in IBM's own laboratories to tabulate a payroll - and doing it 10 times faster than IBM's electromechanical tabulating machines. Marketed as the IBM 603 and then 604, it sold in thousands. Watson had the vision to understand that there would be a tremendous market for computers, used in shops, offices, and banks as well as scientific institutions. He believed that technology produces new markets and new business opportunities; his father found the new concepts hard, but was prepared to indulge his son. What neither of them could have realised was the huge amounts of investment required by the new technology. The company began hiring electronics engineers in thousands. A 'Defence Calculator' (eventually the IBM 701) costing Dollars 12m to develop, the most expensive project in IBM's history, was initiated. 'We were essentially learning a whole new trade,' Tom Jr wrote. 'You had only to visit Poughkeepsie (an IBM laboratory still important today) to get an idea of the fundamental change taking place in engineering.' Tom Jr was appointed chief executive in May 1956. His father died later the same year at the age of 82. Watson was on his own as he prepared to lead IBM through its biggest gamble, the development of System/360, the most influential computer system the world has known - until the development of the personal computer. It almost broke the company in development, but its success guaranteed IBM's astonishing growth and development through the 1970s and 1980s. Tom retired as chairman and chief executive in 1970 following a heart attack. He cut his formal links with IBM, spent time sailing Palawan, his 68-foot ketch, and indulged his passion for flying. A spell as US ambassador in Moscow followed; he had come full circle, recalling in his autobiography that the squalor of the city reminded him of the four months he had spent in Russia as a pilot and aide to General Bradley. It was not, however, a happy time for him - he was no diplomat - and he was relieved to return to the US 10 years after he stepped down from the top job at IBM. He once said: 'The secret I learned early on from my father was to run scared and never think I had it made. We got highly excited over things that were not that important. I never felt I was completely adequate to the job and always ran scared. In June 1957, a year after my father died, I said 'By golly, Olive, I've made it through 12 months'.' During his period at IBM, he changed the company's organisation, technology, even its sense of corporate design, all for the better. He was a decent man who worked hard to carve out an identity and purpose for himself; it is no fault of his that his achievements and his father's will always be bracketed together. Thomas Watson Jr, born January 8, 1914, Dayton, Ohio. Died December 31, Greenwich, Connecticut, aged 79.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer after erratic session CRISIS DAY in the foreign exchange markets inspired wildly erratic trends in UK equities, which closed firmly as predictions of an imminent sterling devaluation mitigated the effects of the two announced increases in Bank of England minimum lending rate. News that the second rate rise, from 12 per cent to 15 per cent, had been cancelled, along with the suspension of sterling from the ERM, came well after the market close. Strength in the US dollar boosted overseas earning stocks. The turnround in the stock market from an early fall of more than 78 points on the FT-SE Index to a net rise of 8.3 for a close of 2,378.3 reflected the stock market's conviction that, since the day's increase in British interest rates had failed to rescue sterling, some form of European currency revaluation would be introduced. The first half of the day passed with equity traders glued helplessly to their money market and foreign exchange trading screens. The Footsie opened 28 points down and plunged to minus 78.7 after the Bank of England annnounced its first, two-point, rise in interest rates. This took the index down to 2,291.3, at which level the market rallied, hoping that the rate rise and the Bank's intervention would save sterling. But a partial recovery of about 24 Footsie points was quickly reversed at midsession when London money markets virtually ceased trading ahead of the Bank's second increase in rates, this time of a further three points. Share prices turned down again, but only for a while. When equity strategists saw that the pound was still weak, they suggested that the UK authorities might now be forced to shift to a devaluation policy, albeit at some cost in political credibility. A good recovery, supported by increased although selective institutional demand, received a further boost when the dollar's strength brought buyers in for oils, pharmaceuticals and similar international stocks. Losses in interest-related sectors such as construction and retail stocks, as well as in banks, which would suffer from increased bad debts, were reduced towards the close. The swing in confidence was reflected in the revival of several bid features, including Fisons, the drugs group. Somewhat to the surprise of market traders, one securities house operated a trading programme across the range of the market, with second-liners prominent. Seaq volume, slow at first, jumped to a total of 640.3m shares for the day, compared with 507.3m or Pounds 895m retail business on Tuesday. Ian Harnett at Strauss Turnbull commented that the stock market might be 'assuming an awful lot' on the political and investment scene in looking for a sterling devaluation, which would probably have to be greater than 5 per cent if it was to achieve its purpose. Mr Nicholas Knight, long term bear at Nomura Research, switched to the bullish tack yesterday, commenting that adjustments to higher base rates and possible sterling withdrawal from the ERM were now in place.</p>

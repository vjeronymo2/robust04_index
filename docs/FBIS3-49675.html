The  bakers demanded they be paid in keeping with the defined minimum  wages, the striking committee said. Bread deliveries were made  only to hospitals and the Army. Negotiations were underway with  the representatives of the authorities and if an accord was  reached during the morning hours, the bakers would normalize  production in the course of the day.    The strike of bakers, something even the oldest Belgraders  do  not remember, was only one in a series of strikes that hit the  Yugoslav capital late last and early this year and which came as  a result dissatisfaction with extremely low wages. Severe  sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council in late May 1992  against Yugoslavia over its alleged involvement in the civil war  in Bosnia-Herzegovina threatened the living standard of some  10.8 million people with galloping hyperinflation which  literally devalued any wages by the hour and on the other hand  invited spiralling price hikes.</p>

Vets are recommending that susceptible animals be vaccinated  pre-sale and certified accordingly. This approach would add to  the sale value of animals and reduce the incidence of pneumonia.    The IVU has approached a number of marts on the issue and  they are fully supportive. According to a statement, the primary  viruses responsible are IBR, P13 and RSV.    While these viruses have been at low levels in the cattle  population, the IVU maintain that the current high levels of  imports is adding to the problem.    A preventative vaccination programme is recommended as there  are no drug therapies to combat these viruses, although  treatments for secondary infections are available.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FAVORED PROFIT KEY DRAWS RAIL FOR $500,000 HASKELL  </P> <P> Profit Key, the recent winner of the Dwyer Handicap in New York, drew the rail  post position Thursday and was established the early favorite for the $500,000  Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park.  </P> <P> The 1 1/8-mile, Grade I stake for 3-year-olds Saturday drew a field a seven  colts.  </P> <P> The main challenge to Profit Key should come from Rhythm, last year's  2-year-old champion and the runner-up in the Dwyer.  </P> <P> Profit Key, who was not nominated to the Triple Crown races, has been the more  consistent of the horses. The 3-year-old son of Desert Wine has never finished  worse than second in eight lifetime starts and has won five of six this year,  with his only loss coming to Housebuster in the Withers at Belmont in May.  </P> <P> Jockey Jose Santos again will have the mount on the Wayne Lukas-trained runner.  The colt was assigned 122 pounds and was made the 9-5 favorite.  </P> <P> Rhythm was assigned one pound less than Profit Key and again will have Craig  Perret in the saddle. The Mr. Prospector colt drew the No. 5 post and the odds  are 2-1.  </P> <P> The rest of the field in post position order: Secret Halo, Pat Day, 119, 3-1;  Baron de Vaux, Jean Cruguet, 117, 12-1; Restless Con, Tim Doocy, 118, 6-1;  Rhythm; Tees Prospect, Rick Wilson, 114, 20-1; and Yonder, Jerry Bailey, 118,  10-1.  </P></p>

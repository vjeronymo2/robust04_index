			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Damascus, 7 Mar (SANA)-- A delegation of Palestinian  Arab personalities, led by [Member of the Israeli Knesset, MK]  'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah arrived in Damascus from Cairo this  afternoon to offer condolences on the death of Staff Major Basil  al-Asad.    The delegation was received at the Damascus International  Airport by Khalid al-Fahum, head of the Palestinian National  Salvation Front, and Muhammad Walid Hammamiyah, the governor of  Damascus.    In a statement to journalists, Darawshah expressed happiness  to be in Syria, his second homeland, this Arab country known for  its history, deep roots, heroism, and sacrifices for the  Palestine question and the Arab nation.    He said: We have come to offer sincere condolences to His  Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad and his family, to the Syrian  Government, and to the fraternal Syrian people whose positions  we greatly appreciate. This is the main objective of the visit  to Syria, and we thank the Syrian Government, led by President  al-Asad, for allowing us to enter the Syrian land. This is  something we are proud of.    Answering a question, Darawshah said: We are not carrying  any political message and we do not represent any official  stance in Israel. We represent the Palestinians in the Galilee,  in the Negev, and other cities. We are proud to be a part of  the Palestinian people. Our visit to Syria today entrenches our  affiliation to this deep-rooted nation. We have not bowed and  our heads remain high, and we are proud of our homeland and of  our Arab and Palestinian affiliation.    Answering another question, Darawshah said: We have not come  here for negotiations but to offer condolences. This is our  noble objective.    In reply to another question, Darawshah said: The horrible  massacre that took place in the Ibrahimi Mosque, and the  subsequent suppression and atrocities, have increased the number  of Palestinian martyrs and injured, and aggravated the  situation. The Israeli Government is responsible for this  escalation. The Israeli Government should embark on practical  measures to prevent the continuation of settlers' aggressions  against the Palestinians by disarming these settlers and  removing the settlements from the occupied Arab territories.    Concluding his statement, Darawshah said: Our position has  always been the same as the position of the Palestinians, and  this position is identical with the Syrian position and the Arab  position in general. We want to end the occupation and we  support an independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil,  and we call for full withdrawal from the occupied Arab  territories and from the Syrian Golan, which we consider an  inseparable part of Syria.    Before leaving Cairo, Darawshah said: We, as part of the  Palestinian people and the Arab nation, decided that it is a  pan-Arab and humanitarian duty to offer condolences to President  Hafiz al-Asad on the death of his son Basil.</p>

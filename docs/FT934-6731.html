			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls on fears of global correction Wall Street Losses on overseas equity markets and concern about rising long-term interest rates depressed US stock prices across the board, although many shares finished off their lows for the day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 23.76 at 3,670.25. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 3.47 lower at 459.13, while the American SE composite fell 7.10 to 460.88 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 13.43 to 738.13. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 280m shares. Stock prices opened lower in the wake of heavy losses incurred on foreign markets, notably Tokyo, where the leading index fell 3.1 per cent as investors expressed fresh concern about the outlook for the Japanese economy. The selling overseas raised fears that a major correction in worldwide equity markets, many of which are overvalued by historical standards, may be under way, or imminent. On the domestic front, US investors remained troubled by rising long-term interest rates. After posting a sharp loss on Friday, the benchmark 30-year government bond fell again yesterday, pushing the yield up to 6.37 per cent, it's highest level in three months. The deepening concern about interest rates, mingled with profit-taking in the wake of recent gains, and the growing feeling that share prices have risen too far, contributed to yesterday's selling. On several occasions the Dow fell more than 40 points, but each time it bounced back from its lows. The Nasdaq composite, however, kept on falling. Secondary stocks have taken a hammering recently, primarily because they had been the beneficiary of a lot of speculative buying over the summer and early autumn. Auto stocks were hard hit by profit-taking. The sector has had a strong run recently, and investors chose yesterday to book some of the profits earned during that rally. General Motors weakened Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/4 , Ford Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 59 1/2 and Chrsyler Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 . Merck ran into heavy selling, falling Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 33 3/4 in volume of 5.6m shares in spite of a ratings upgrade from broking house Smith Barney Shearson. Selected technology shares posted big declines, with Hewlett-Packard finishing down Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 71 1/2 , Motorola off Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 93 1/2 and Digital Equipment Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 35 1/2 . Other big stocks in the sector, however, were in good form, with Texas Instruments ahead Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 61 and IBM up Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 52 1/8 . Cyclical issues were also mixed. Aluminum Company of America rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 71 3/4 , but Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing gave up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 109. On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft fell Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 77 but Intel added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 57 1/2 . Canada TORONTO stock prices were lower in heavy trading as the market resumed its recent slide. The TSE 300 index finished 38 points down at 4,200.2 and declines outscored rises by 545 to 251 after volume of 76.3m shares valued at CDollars 738.2m. After reaching a record high close of 4,302.8 on November 12, the composite index has fallen in five of the past six sessions, amid renewed worries about government debt and the state of the Canadian economy. Twelve of the 14 sub-indices fell, led by transportation, off 2.4 per cent. Media retreated 2 per cent.</p>

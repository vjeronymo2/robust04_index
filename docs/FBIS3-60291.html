The experts prepared their report on the results of the  recent missions of ASSET (groups for appraising events at atomic  power stations from the standpoint of their safety) which  carefully studied the work of four of the five stations with the  RBMK-type fast reactors: The Kursk, Leningrad, Smolensk (Russia)  and Ignalina (Lithuania) stations. The experts' field of vision  did not include the Chernobyl Atomic Power Station inasmuch as  Ukraine planned to bring it to a final halt (in October the  Ukrainian parliament decided nevertheless to keep the ChAPS  alive).    The experts also took a look into the March incident at the  Leningrad APS (destruction of the gating valve in the third  unit). As a result, such valves at all the stations with RBMK  reactors were replaced with the mechanisms of the latest design,  and the methods for detecting defects were improved.    The IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] experts  stated:  the steam coefficient of reactivity (a parameter determining the  reactor's inner safety not dependent on personnel) had been  lowered tenfold since 1986. They spoke highly of the work of  operators, saying that the culture on most safety was growing.  An appraisal which is not only flattering but even most  unexpected (considering the destructive processes in industry  and power engineering), yet its objectivity is beyond all doubt.    Their conclusion--there is no need to stop the RBMK reactors  (given, of course, the timely implementation of ASSET's  recommendations for ensuring the safety of each APS).    In parallel with the work of ASSET's missions revising  primarily the reactors' safe operation, an effort is currently  underway to implement the international project of the  Commission of the European Communities whose participants  investigate the dependability of the RBMK's design solutions.  With this aim in view a consortium of Western countries was set  up with the participation of Finland, France, Germany, Italy,  Sweden and Britain (who were later joined by Canada and Spain).  As many as nine joint subject groups were formed and have  carried out active since the spring of 1993.    By the end of the year they must prepare a report containing  an appraisal of the existing APS with RBMK reactors and  recommendations for enhancing their safety. But already now John  Tyror, chairman of the committee in charge of the project, has  found it possible to say that "the experts have found nothing  serious which would prevent people from sleeping quietly." This  statement by one of Britain's leading nuclear scientists sounds  all the more meaningfully since previously Mr Tyror believed  that the RBMK reactors were not consistent with European safety  standards. A more detailed acquaintance with these reactors made  him change his mind, whereas the generally positive and  sufficiently optimistic appraisal of the RBMK by two independent  international groups of experts makes it possible to hope that  the accident, provoked by the gross mistakes of the personnel of  the Chernobyl Atomic Power Station, has not finally discredited  the idea of channel reactors.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Pirelli reduces loss and expects profit in 1994 Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday reported that its net losses narrowed in 1993 to L96bn (Dollars 57m), compared with L154bn in 1992, and reinforced its earlier forecasts of a return to net profit in 1994. The more positive attitude at Pirelli follows three years of net losses, and more than two years of painful restructuring. In 1992-93, Pirelli set aside L550bn to pay for rationalisation, including 10,000 redundancies and the shedding of one of its three divisions. Yesterday's statement said the return to profit would still depend on the level of recovery in the company's principal market, but the group reported that it was making profits at the operating level - L32bn in 1993, compared with a loss of L93bn in 1992. Group sales in 1993 rose 12 per cent to L9,210bn from L8,252bn. The group was pushed into net loss last year by extraordinary charges of L128bn. It expects provisions over the last two years to cover all foreseeable restructuring.</p>

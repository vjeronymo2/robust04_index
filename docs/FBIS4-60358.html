			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 22 May (MENA)--The state's general budget for  fiscal year 1994-1995 has allocated about 35 billion pounds to  investments necessary for development and production and  procuring needed equipment. This represents one of the primary  bases of the economic plan to help increase production.    Finance Minister Dr. Muhammad al-Razzaz said that from the  allocated amount 7 billion pounds have been designated for  services agencies--the administrative body, local  administration, and service authorities--and that 5.8 billion  pounds have been designated for economic and similar agencies.  He added that 22.2 billion pounds have been allocated for  investments in the public and private business sectors.    He said that the new budget includes some 12.8 billion  pounds  as investments for the state's service agencies and economic  bodies representing approximately 37 percent of the total  investments contained in the state's general budget. He  emphasized that this increase in investment allocations will  help complete necessary projects in very important sectors  achieve the goals of economic development. Foremost of these,  he said, are the projects of infrastructure and public  utilities, such as water, sewage, and development of slum areas,  in addition to educational and health requirements, such as  schools and hospitals.    He said the share of public and private business and  cooperative sectors, which amounts to 22.2 billion pounds and  represents 63 percent of the 1994-1995 plan investments,  reflects the prospective pivotal role of these sectors in  increasing production and employment.    He noted the new budget's reliance in funding the  development  plan's projects on intrinsic financing, as well as financing  from local savings without resorting to banks to avoid  inflationary effects detrimental to the national economy.    The finance minister said that foreign loans will be sought  on a limited basis and only for production projects, hence the  foreign loans included in the general budget do not exceed 2.3  percent.</p>

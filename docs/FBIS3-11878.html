There were dramatic moments that  jeopardized it throughout the process. Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin had to use all of her strengths to win the OAS Secretariat  General for Colombia:    [Begin Sanin recording] There was a time when Foreign  Minister Niehaus was leading. There was tension all the time.  We, however, remained confident we would win, and finally, we  garnered an absolute majority. [end recording]    The days leading up to the election also featured dramatic  moments that were witnessed by many, from President Gaviria at  Narino Palace to the Colombian delegation in Washington headed  by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin.    [Begin Sanin recording] We contained our anxiety while we  confronted challenging moments over the past few days. We held  countless talks on a daily basis. There were concerns,  questions, and ideas; there were... [pauses] We had to outline  our policies on countless occasions. [end recording]    Now that Gaviria has been elected, the question is whether  he, as the new OAS secretary general, will work to lift the  suspension that this organization imposed on Cuba in 1962  because of its political system.    [Begin Sanin recording] Colombia's current policy toward  Cuba  is sovereign and independent and is solely in keeping with  Colombia's interests. President Gaviria's OAS policy should not  follow Colombian policy but a policy common to the 34 nations  that comprise the organization. [end recording]</p>

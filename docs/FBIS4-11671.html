			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the Washington peace talks with Israel, by Samir  al-Masri in Jerusalem; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Masri] The Hebron massacre revealed large gaps  in the Oslo agreement. Some of these gaps are related to the  subject of protecting the Palestinian people. What prevented  this issue and others from being discussed in Oslo?    ['Urayqat] I am surprised some local and Arab voices are  trying to exploit this horrible massacre to project the weakness  or impotence of the Palestinian leadership. I do not think this  is the fault of the leadership. What is required is that all  efforts should be pooled to besiege the terrorist Israeli  action, not to blame the Palestinian leadership. Gaps in the  Oslo agreement stem originally from the Madrid conference and  the Israeli terms that were accepted prior to participation in  the conference. The terms were very unfair to us, although we  were the last to join the negotiations on the basis of the  Madrid formula. Accordingly, the unfair terms in Madrid were  reflected in the Oslo agreement, which revealed pretty obvious  gaps, including the issues postponed to the final phase. Among  them is the issue of settlements, which are considered time  bombs that can explode anytime, anywhere, in the university,  street, farm, or market.    Naturally, agreement to postpone the settlements issue was  something Palestinians accepted reluctantly, not willingly. The  massacre proved what we said before: The issue of discussing  the protection of Palestinians from settler attacks cannot be  postponed. It has become clear that Israel cannot prevent the  settlers' terrorist operations. We hope the world will realize  no negotiations can lead to a successful conclusion of the peace  process unless the issue of settlements is on the agenda.    Once again, we warn against the current campaign that seeks  to take revenge or disparage the Palestinian leadership. The  newspapers are devoting 10 percent to the massacre and 90  percent to Palestinian rift. Concentrating on and deepening the  Palestinian rift is not in our interest. We take pride in the  fact that we are the only people in the region who can directly  criticize the president. This does not exist in any other Arab  state. I stress that efforts should be pooled toward providing  protection of the Palestinian people and exposing Israeli  terrorism after it has developed in an unprecedented manner.    [Al-Masri] In the light of the Hebron massacre and based on  what you said in your reply to the first question, is the Oslo  formula still valid for negotiations, particularly after the  criticism of this formula by a big power like Russia, which  called for a new conference that would supersede the failed  formula?    ['Urayqat] The question to ask is if the peace process based  on the Madrid formula is valid. This formula was based on the  principle of land for peace. Thus far, Israel has not abided,  even formally, by the principle of withdrawal from the  territories occupied in 1967, with the exception of talk about  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Israeli practices on the  ground indicate the continuation of settlement activity,  intransigence, and terrorism. There is also Israel's failure to  implement any international legitimacy resolutions. This  largely overshadows the entire peace process. The question now  is if the current peace process between the Arabs and Israel has  any future. The matter is no longer connected with a  Palestinian-Israeli agreement. The have endured the major  burden of the peace process because they were in the forefront.  The question now concerns all. It does not have to do only  with Oslo, but the entire peace process on all the tracks. I  think Israel's failure to abide by withdrawal raises serious  questions about the feasibility of the peace process.    [Al-Masri] How do you view the recent Russian initiative?    ['Urayqat] It is very good. I am glad Russia has begun to  get out of its seclusion and its complete subservience to the  United States. When we began the Madrid conference there were  two loud voices. A few months later, the Soviet Union collapsed  and the United States was alone in the arena, drafting and  deciding world policy. The Russian initiative signals the  beginning of Russian disengagement from the United States.  Russia has begun to realize that the peace process in its  current form cannot succeed. Consequently, Russia has begun to  demand a new mechanism. This is a good step that should be  studied thoroughly and carefully. It should also be supported  even if Israel and the United States reject it.    [Al-Masri] But Russia is still politically dependent on the  U.S. Administration. Some believe the Russian initiative is  nothing but a tactical move made in agreement with the United  States to put indirect pressure on Israel. This is because  Russia's need for aid renders it unable to lay out a foreign  policy that is independent of U.S. policy, at least under the  current circumstances. How do you view that?    ['Urayqat] In light of its economic and political problems,  I  cannot tell what Russia can or cannot do. However, no one  should underestimate Russia's regional, continental, or  international weight. Therefore, Russia's noncompliance with  U.S. decisions is a step that must be encouraged and blessed by  all Arabs. As for the U.S. stand on the Russian initiative, I  believe decision makers at the U.S. State Department still think  in accordance with the Likud's mentality. Clinton's objective  is to emerge before public opinion with a procedural, formal  solution aimed at saving Israel, not the peace process. It has  been proved to us that the U.S. decision making circles are  controlled by the Likud mentality. They are more Israeli than  Israel itself. Therefore, the U.S. reservation about the  Russian initiative raises doubts about the fate of the peace  process.    [Al-Masri] Palestinians had linked the resumption of the  negotiations to the return of the Marj al-Zuhur deportees. We  know what happened later. Afterward, Palestinians insisted on a  certain position regarding the crossings issue. However, later,  they approved the Cairo agreement. Will the same thing happen  regarding the Hebron massacre? Or will the Palestinian  leadership learn from its previous policies?    ['Urayqat] We cannot judge this issue in isolation from the  prevailing circumstances. If we want to deal with politics, we  cannot raise the same slogans all the time. Politics is a  continuous process through which the politician seeks to achieve  the best of what can be achieved. But such attempts do not take  place in isolation from the various parties's conflicting  interests and the pressures that are being exercised. One day,  we will disclose how the Palestinian delegation returned to the  negotiations and the circumstances and pressures that are  exercised against the delegation on all levels. The question is  not that of making concessions or not. It really has to do with  people's lives and security. If the peace process does not  protect human lives, then what use does it have? Therefore, the  Palestinian delegation cannot hold negotiations with Israel if  there is no agreement on international protection for the  Palestinians.    [Al-Masri] The White House announced that it did not want  Palestinian preconditions for the resumption of the negotiations  and that it would exercise the veto at the UN Security Council  if the PLO insists on its conditions. Does this mean that the  PLO will return to the negotiations without preconditions? Or  will it ignore the U.S. position?    ['Urayqat] The U.S. position is totally biased toward  Israel.  The Palestinian leadership is coming under tremendous U.S.,  Israeli, and domestic pressure. I believe the time is not right  for inciting inter-Palestinian differences. It is time for  Palestinian agreement on the demand for international  protection. The Palestinian leadership's impasse has been going  on for years. It is taking various forms and dimensions. I  hope attempts to strike at the unity of our people will be  unsuccessful. I hope the Palestinian leadership will be able to  circumvent this impasse. We are sure the Palestinian leadership  is well aware that Palestinian demands are not conditions, but  legitimate demands to ensure the success of the peace process.    [Al-Masri] Do you think there is a possibility of Israel  abandoning the protection of Israeli settlements in the West  Bank, especially since Rabin's legal advisers counseled him not  to make a hasty decision to evacuate the Hebron settlement  because the court might reject the government's decision?    ['Urayqat] The ball is now in Rabin's court. He must make  the courageous decision. If they want peace, they cannot  continue the settlements. It is either the settlements or the  agreement. We call at the outset for dismantling the settlement  in the heart of Hebron and the one in the heart of Nabulus,  because they are elements of tension and pressure for the peace  process.    [Al-Masri] What issues were on the Washington talks agenda?  Is it true they were confined to negotiations on election  arrangements and forming the transitional council?    ['Urayqat] The discussion was not confined to what you  mentioned, but included several other geographic issues  concerning the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The Oslo agreement  covers less than 10 percent of the occupied territories.  Therefore, the Oslo agreement is one of many required steps  that would cover all the occupied territories. The Washington  talks center on the other issues that have not been discussed.  In addition to the issue of elections and the formation of the  legislative council, we placed on the agenda issues such as the  redeployment of Israeli forces in the West Bank and a review of  military orders applied on the Palestinian side, and then the  complete transfer of authority in the occupied territories. An  agreement was reached on a discussion of these issues in  Washington. However, the terrorist Israeli operation in Hebron  cast a shadow on the negotiations. As a result, we suspended  the talks.    [Al-Masri] What use are the bilateral negotiation in  Washington now when other negotiations are taking place under  'Arafat's leadership and supervision in Paris, Taba, Cairo, and  other places? Don't you think the negotiations here have a  formal nature, given that other secret talks have always been  held behind the scene?    ['Urayqat] We do not differentiate between the leadership  inside the territory and the leadership outside. At the  beginning of the negotiations there were unfair conditions, such  as the postponement of the settlements issue, preventing the PLO  from directly participating, and not allowing delegation members  from Jerusalem. Now I am proud of the fact that there are no  restrictions concerning membership in negotiations. The PLO is  negotiating directly and is freely selecting the negotiating  delegation.    [Al-Masri] Why have the links with the Palestinian  delegation  to the bilateral been cut, given that they have political weight  in the occupied territories and they participated in long rounds  of negotiations during which they gained enough experience in  talking to Israeli negotiators. Moreover, they know many  details because they live in the occupied territory.    ['Urayqat] The delegation is not an establishment or a  permanent company. It is formed in accordance with missions.  These members carried out definite tasks. Before the Hebron  massacre we talked about reforming the Palestinian delegation  for the bilateral peace talks. Many of these names are  candidate members. I assure you that the question is not linked  to individuals. Nobody is allowed to prefer his own political  stands in accordance with his own place in the political  formula. The delegation is composed of individuals tasked with  a certain mission by the PLO central command. The command is  capable of deciding their continuation or otherwise.    [Al-Masri] Why the delay in forming the Palestinian  establishments or naming their heads or officials?    ['Urayqat] The United States leveled these accusations at us  twice: once in a meeting with Christopher in Jerusalem and once  in Amman. In fact, we formed establishments such as the economic  council for construction and development and appointed its  technical staff, which has been working for years. I don't know  why, but whenever the Palestinian side attains the capability to  work independently, we come under attack and criticism as though  the specter of trusteeship never leaves us.    [Al-Masri] The subject of elections raises an argument  between proponents and opponents who are afraid that these  elections will produce elements that have no links with the PLO  and are probably opposed to the settlement. Other voices  believe that it is important to protect the Palestinian  community through democracy. How do you see this?    ['Urayqat] Elections are one of the most important  guarantees  for the existence of the Palestinian people, but this democracy  should be real and should not be a mere facade to satisfy the  authority's objectives. I am pleased to say that the first  decision signed by President 'Arafat after the Oslo agreement  was the formation of a committee assigned to deal with elections  and local government, and that he appointed me as the head of  this committee. I believe that the time is ripe for elections  because elections not only give legitimacy to the continuation  of the new state regime, but also give it a power that protects  the Palestinian people. I think that elections should be held  as soon as possible. Some people, who have vindicative aims,  may raise the pretext of instability. The strategic point of  view says real democracy is one of the pillars for the  continuation of the Palestinian people.    [Al-Masri] What is the elections and local government  committee doing to make these elections a reality? Are the  elections you speak about local or legislative elections?    ['Urayqat] The elections committee is comprised of brothers  Faruq al-Sarraf, 'Ali al-Safarini, Rami 'Abd-al-Hadi, Muhammad  'Ishtayah, and Zahirah Kamal. This committee, which I chair,  operates on several horizons, including the legal horizon, with  the aim of attaining a unified law for municipal and council  elections in the West Bank, and laying down the basic law for  council elections and the electoral system.    We have 480 population centers in 29 municipalities, 82  rural  councils, and 26 camps, in addition to 347 population centers  that do not have any councils. This situation has prevailed  since the time of Ottoman rule, and this emphasizes the need for  reorganizing the structural map of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  The only three existing governorates cannot continue to work  without setting up new governorates such as Tulkarm, Janin,  Qalqilyah, and Bethlehem governorates. New municipalities  should also be formed, and rural councils should be set up in  some villages. This does not mean that development will be  carried out from above, but rather should include all levels.  Some 72 percent of the rural areas suffer from the absence of  councils, and are run by mukhtars. This is a dangerous defect  that should be tackled by setting up municipal or rural councils  to carry out the required construction projects. In addition to  this, the committee is working to carry out censuses, and cadres  are being trained to run elections. The elections will be held  on various levels; the national, legislative, local, municipal,  and rural levels as well as other levels.    [Al-Masri] Will the elections be delayed because the  Palestinian side is not prepared yet, or will they be held on 13  July in accordance with Oslo agreement?    ['Urayqat] The holding of elections is not a decision to be  made by 'Arafat or Rabin alone, it is a process that has long  procedures that should be taken into consideration. We need 150  voting centers and about 6,000 supervisors and trainers on  supervision. There is a need for a UN committee that represents  Europe, the cosponsors of peace talks, Canada, Australia, Japan,  and China to observe elections. All this requires time, and now  we are in late March. This means that it is impossible to hold  elections on July, but we will do all we can to hold the  elections as soon as possible.</p>

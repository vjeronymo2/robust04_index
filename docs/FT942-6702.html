			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steady ahead of holiday weekend Wall Street US stocks weathered a downturn in the bond market yesterday as investors squared their positions ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend, writes Frank McGurty in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3.68 higher at 3,757.14, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.27 at 457.33. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite added 1.32 to 440.94, and the Nasdaq composite 1.50 at 733.14. In view of an early sell-off in the Treasury debt market, stocks held up well. Bonds turned bearish after the Commerce Department confounded economists with an upward revision of its estimate of first-quarter economic growth to 3.0 per cent. Analysts had expected the government to trim its estimate of gross domestic product from 2.6 per cent to 2.4 per cent. The surprise sent the benchmark 30-year government bond tumbling, though it recovered somewhat during the afternoon. Share prices dipped, steadied and then returned to their opening levels, remaining there for the rest of the session. In the morning, Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, testified before Congress but his remarks elicited no discernible reaction in the markets. He left open the possibility of further tightening of monetary policy during the summer. Many equity investors apparently decided to relax and get an early start on the weekend. Volume was light, with only 186m shares exchanged. When Wall Street gets back to business on Tuesday, however, it faces a barrage of economic data next week, culminating with Friday's employment report. Trading activity is likely to pick up pace as the week progresses. A mostly dull session yesterday was highlighted by active trading in Upjohn, the pharmaceuticals house considered ripe for takeover. The stock gave back Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 31 1/2 after Hoechst of Germany denied speculation that it was considering a merger or strategic alliance with the US group. Upjohn's share price had jumped Dollars 3 7/8 in the previous session. McKesson, the largest US drug distributor, also provided some fireworks. Its share price jumped 11 per cent during the previous session, on speculation that a foreign buyer would emerge for its drugs-benefit business. But when Glaxo denied interest in such a deal yesterday morning, McKesson dropped Dollars 2 1/2 but later reversed direction to close up Dollars 3 at Dollars 84. Meanwhile, Philip Morris continued to suffer from its board's decision to take no action on a proposal to split the company's tobacco and food operations. The stock shed a further Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 50 after dropping Dollars 3 on Thursday. Oil stocks were mixed, with Arco gaining Dollars 2 to Dollars 102 and Mobil shedding Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 81 3/8 although Oppenheimer lifted its estimate of the company's 1995 results because of a restructuring of its chemical operations. Canada Toronto ended flat in quiet dealings. The TSE 300 composite index slipped 1.83 to 4328.88 in volume of 60.9m shares, up about 31 on the week. Ten of the 14 stock groups fell, with mining and consumer products slightly down, banking and industrial products flat, and energy and golds up a little.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Arts: BBC Symphony Orchestra/Hilliard Ensemble - Barbican Hall/Westminster Abbey As the Barbican continues to pat itself on the back for the triumphs of its first ten years, the BBC Symphony Orchestra made a second visit to the celebrations. Their immaculately delivered programme on Thursday, conducted by Oliver Knussen, was fresh, enterprising and not really festive at all; it sandwiched the premieres of works by Colin Matthews and Knussen himself between Sibelius's Luonnotar (sung with perceptive fluency by Lucy Shelton) and Skryabin's overripe Prometheus (with David Horne as solo pianist). Broken Symmetry, the BBC commission from Matthews, proves to be a 20-minute orchestral scherzo, a virtuoso musical machine of threatening power which is continually primed and propelled by the percussion section. That Matthews has managed to sustain such a span of fast music with scarcely a pause for breath is a feat in itself; its sequence of trios and reprises, drastically foreshortened when they re-emerge in reverse order, careens through the musical landscape in a sequence of vivid, violent images. The gestures are constantly varied, arresting - eruptions of jagged rhythmic unisons, Rite of Spring stampings complete with braying horns, intricate, tightly geared clockworks spread through the full orchestra; just occasionally also poised, lyrical melodic lines are threaded in and out of the teeming textures. Knussen's Whitman Settings first emerged in a version for voice and piano, which Lucy Shelton introduced at last year's Aldeburgh Festival. None of the four songs lasts more than a few minutes, yet they pack in an astonishing range of emotional and vocal nuance. The orchestrations (made especially for the Barbican concert) enhance that sense of concentration, with wonderfully lucid colours drawn from a vast ensemble; each song seems to define its sound world within a couple of bars, compressed into a phrase or a couple of chords. They are beautifully achieved little songs, brought off with the lightest of touches. On the same evening, a huge audience was drawn to Westminster Abbey to hear the Hilliard Ensemble, plus additional choir, organ and small instrumental ensemble under Stephen Jackson, offer their celebrated account of Arvo Part's Miserere (1988-89). These same performers first gave the work its premiere, and then made of it an internationally best-selling record (on the ECM label). It was instructive to hear the Miserere in the abbey spaces, and to note the unforced eloquence, security and devotion of all its singers and players. This is music of fearfully exposed spareness, providing no bolt-holes for sloppy intonation or escape-routes for rhythmic looseness, and it was here delivered with that peculiarly impressive confidence which carries an air of absolute naturalness. Part's mature music, of which this is an important example, defines a new post-modernist category - 'faith-minimalism'. The message is uttered entirely in musical gestures, delicately shaped and often repeated: in this case, vocal lines (solo or concerted) stuttering off into despairing silences, then timorously re-launched, often with equally hesitating instrumental punctuation. Contrasts of timbre are slowly layered; an atmosphere of agonised meditation suffuses the long sequences and large block-shapes of the structure. For those able to fall prey to Part's muse, the experience must be an enthralling one; for anyone, like myself, who remains resolutely unengaged, the Miserere proves a hollow package - almost entirely devoid of content, both admirably sincere and desperately enervating. Thursday's concert, the second of a current seven-stop Hilliard tour (organised by the Contemporary Music Network), also featured music by another of today's leading Eastern European faith-minimalists, Henryk Gorecki. John Casken's new, short madrigal for four voices, Sharp Thorne, provided a moment of blessedly welcome relief from the prevailing mood of elevated repetitiousness. An interweaving of a modern poem (by Sylvia Townsend Warner) and one from the 15th century, it poses hard-edged questions about the Christian faith in music at once richly harmonised and packed with harshly vivid detail in each vocal line.</p>

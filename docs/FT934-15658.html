			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Mail group interested in buying Independent 'for a song' ASSOCIATED Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday, yesterday said it was interested in acquiring The Independent, but only for 'a song'. Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers, said on the BBC's The Money Programme: 'It would be run at a loss for a very long time before you could turn it round. 'We are interested, I suppose,' he said. But the acquisition would not be worthwhile unless 'you could virtually get The Independent for a song'. His comments came on the day the price of The Independent on Sunday was raised from 90p to Pounds 1 and the paper was redesigned and enlarged. The Independent will be enlarged tomorrow, when its price will rise from 45p to 50p. Mr Andrew Knight, chief executive of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International which publishes The Times, said on the programme that The Times' weekday price cut from 45p to 30p had affected other papers more than The Independent. He added: 'The Mail and the Express are very different newspapers from The Times, but nevertheless the top fractions of the readership are very high-quality readers. I think we have seen a good number of those from the Telegraph, the Mail and the Express going to The Times.' Lex, Page 16</p>

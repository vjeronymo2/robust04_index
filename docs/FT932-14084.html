			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Fears for fate of coalition if Demirel stands TURKEY'S prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, has emerged as the leading candidate to succeed the late President Turgut Ozal who died at the weekend. However, his candidacy could have serious consequences both for himself and his True Path Party (DYP). There are fears that such a move would cause the break-up of the 17-month-old government coalition between the centre-right DYP and the Social Democrat Populist Party (SHP) led by Mr Erdal Inonu. Mr Demirel is widely seen as the strongest candidate, and in an interview with the Financial Times, he admitted he was 'going to be under pressure, not just from my party, but from public opinion, the press and other places' to put his name forward in the first ballot which must take place before May 7. Now in his seventh term as prime minister, Mr Demirel is determined to avoid the constitutional deadlock which left Turkey without an elected president for nearly six months before he was ousted as premier by the military in 1980. However, commentators point out that his departure would leave his party without a strong hand on the helm and at risk in next year's local elections and at the general election due in 1996. He is probably the only candidate for president capable of securing the votes of the necessary two-thirds of parliament's deputies. There seems little consensus behind the other two names being mentioned yesterday - Mr Husamettin Cindoruk, parliamentary speaker, and Mr Inonu, who is also deputy prime minister. Mr Cindoruk, who has been increasingly critical of government policy in recent weeks, seems certain to be opposed by Mr Demirel's supporters. Equally, a decision to stand by Mr Inonu, the physicist son of Turkey's second president, would deprive his party of leadership at a time when it is faces defections to the newly-revived People's Republican party. Mr Demirel's election as president would pave the way for Mr Cindoruk to become the DYP leader who seems likely to favour a coalition with the right-wing Motherland Party (ANAP). There will then be a question as to how to accommodate ANAP's leader, Mr Mesut Yilmaz, a former prime minister.</p>

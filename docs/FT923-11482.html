			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia's state mining corporation to make hundreds redundant COMIBOL, BOLIVIA'S loss-making state mining corporation has embarked on a big redundancy programme prompted in part by the World Bank. The move is widely expected to trigger widespread industrial action. The corporation currently employs some 6,158 workers. To date, 304 have been issued with redundancy letters, all of them in administration. Mining minster Alvaro Rejas said further redundancies could take place within Comibol's administration 'because it is a huge bureaucracy'. However, 526 miners in San Jose, formerly a tin mine, but currently producing uneconomic amounts of silver and lead, are also expected to go. The threatened San Jose job losses have been described by the COB, the Confederation of Bolivian Unions, as 'unacceptable'. COB is currently organising a 48-hour general strike due to begin on Monday. Comibol was partly forced into announcing the redundancies by the World Bank, which has been withholding a Dollars 22m credit to restructure the corporation in protest at the slow pace of change. The World Bank credit was first extended in 1989. Its aim was to revitalise and modernise the Bolivian mining sector, which had been hard hit by the collapse in tin prices in 1985. Rather than opt for full scale privatisation, which remains unconstitutional, the Bolivian government instead saw Comibol's future in joint ventures with private enterprises. The corporation was to concentrate on overseeing exploration, exploitation and leasing contracts and curtail its loss-making mining operation. Over 21,000 employees have been shed since 1985. However, the move towards joint ventures since 1991 has been slow. Although the first joint venture agreement was signed last December with Compania de Minerales Especializados (Cominesa), a number of mining companies interested in joint ventures with Comibol backed off. These include the Bolivian company Bartos and Anglo-Irish group PanAndean. Perhaps even worse, the latest joint venture deal, signed by Mineraco Taboca, a subsidiary of the Brazilian group Paranapanema, resulted in strike action by the local miners. An assessment is being made of Comibol's restructuring needs and a full report is expected by the end of this year. The process has been slowed by long strikes at the end of last year, in January, and localised action recently. Comibol blamed its first quarter loss this year of Dollars 2.7m on industrial action. However, the mining picture in Bolivia as a whole is far from bleak. The Medium Mines Association, an umbrella organisation which includes a number of US subsidiaries, has diversified away from tin and invested in modern machinery and methods. Inti Raimy, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold, is to invest Dollars 710m in its gold and silver operations here. Cyprus Minerals is hopeful about signing exploration deals with Comibol covering the huge Los Lipez region. RTZ recently uncovered Pucionorte, a gold deposit which will be exploited by Comsur, Bolivia's largest private mining enterprise. Bolivian mining in general has enjoyed growth of between 14 and 53 per cent from 1987 to 1990. Perhaps due to the worldwide recession, growth last year was down to 2 per cent. Comibol's production actually rose by 20 per cent in 1991, but its share in Bolivia's overall production continues to slip - from 63 per cent of the total in 1980 to 27 per cent last year. There is no escaping the fact that Bolivian mining still faces serious labour, bureaucracy and infrastructure difficulties. Comibol in particular has been unable to adapt, as the Medium Mines have done, to new market conditions quickly enough. The government, however, remains committed to the restructuring of Comibol. The question is: how quickly should it be done? As Mr Rejas, the mining minister, explains: 'You have to understand that this period of transformation requires time. Our country has had a very static mining culture since mines were nationalised in 1952. But we are aware that the state can no longer afford to invest in even productive operations.'</p>

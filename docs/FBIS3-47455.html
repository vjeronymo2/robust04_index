			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Eriko Kawaji] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 9 Jan -- Plans will be worked out for  scheduling Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to China on  20- 21 March, according to a source accompanying Tsutomu Hata,  deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister, in the  latter's Chinese visit. The source made this disclosure on 9  January. Concerning Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China,  Hata and Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, had earlier  agreed at their 8 January meeting in Beijing on working out  plans for Hosokawa's visit at an early date.    In the backdrop of the prime minister's making firm his  intention to visit China as early as March is the fact that  although he has visited the United States and the ROK since his  inauguration, he still has not visited China, which, along with  the United States, is a focal point of Japanese diplomacy.  Furthermore, Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to work out details  regarding the total value of the planned yen loan to China --  the fourth such loan program -- which Foreign Minister Hata put  on the rails during his visit there.    Regarding the schedule of Hosokawa's visit, Chinese  officials  have requested a 3-day visit starting 19 January. Japanese  officials, however, are working primarily around a plan for a  visit on 20-21 March, taking advantage of consecutive holidays.  This plan also takes into consideration the schedule of Diet  sessions, among other matters.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] BUSINESS TIMES [BT] Editor Patrick Daniel thought  up his defence that he had believed it was not against the law  to publish official information if it came from a private source  only after BT published the secret data, the prosecution said  yesterday.    This was when he was told by Mr. Lam Chuan Leong, permanent  secretary of the Trade and Industry Ministry, that the report  may have breached the Official Secrets Act [OSA].    It was only then that he looked up the act and came to his  conclusion that BT had not committed an offence, said the  attorney general [AG].    Mr. Chan Sek Keong said he saw no evidence which showed that  the editor had thought about this before publishing the data.    Nor did Daniel know where BT journalist Kenneth James had  obtained the data from at the time it was sent to him over the  BT's electronic message system, he added.    Daniel, one of five men charged with breaching the Official  Secrets Act, had said that he considered the possibility that  publishing data obtained from the private sector was an offence,  but dismissed it. This was because the data would already be in  the public domain and could no longer be considered secret.    He is charged with receiving the official flash estimate of  Singapore's economic growth in the second quarter of 1992 and  communicating it to BT readers on June 29, 1992.    Submitting the prosecution's case against Daniel, Mr. Chan  noted that ISD [Internal Security Department] officers had found  a copy of the OSA in the BT offices with sections of the Act  highlighted.    This showed that Daniel had been studying the Act between  the  time the article was published and his first interview with the  ISD.    It also explained how Daniel was able to query the ISD  officer recording his statement for more than an hour on aspects  of the Act, he said.    Earlier, Mr. Chan had told the court that Daniel had  admitted  to the ISD that he knew that publishing the flash estimate  "could possibly be a breach of the OSA," but had done so to give  BT readers an accurate picture of the economy.    The AG urged the court not to believe Daniel's testimony  clarifying this point, saying it was "merely an attempt to  qualify his admissions to the ISD."    Taking up the defence's argument that Daniel did not know  that the 4.6 percent figure was the actual flash estimate, he  said that whatever the editor thought about the figure, the fact  was that he had published it.    Besides, he had referred to the figure as the official flash  estimate in his statements to the ISD and in the June 29 report,  he noted.    During the AG's two-hour long submissions, he was  interrupted  several times by Mr. K. Shanmugam, lawyer for Daniel. The  lawyer wanted to state his client's position and seek  clarifications.    He said that Daniel did not know the figure was the flash  estimate when he received it. It was only after it had been  bounced off chief statistician Paul Cheung that he thought the  figure might be close to the flash estimate.    On Daniel's belief that it was not an offence to publish  official data if it came from a private sector source, he said  that his client had operated with a"mental map," which included  this belief, he said.    Besides, he argued the prosecution's submission was  inconsistent with its earlier arguments.    "If Mr. Daniel did not even consider the OSA either at the  time of receipt or at the time of publication, it seems to me  logically inconsistent to argue that he knew that it could  possibly be a breach of the Act," he said, asking the AG to  clarify his position.    Mr. Chan replied that he would consider this point and  respond today when the prosecution is expected to wrap up its  submissions.</p>

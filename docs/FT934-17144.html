			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Piggy in the middle: The law professor steering the reforms Professor Roy Goode, chairman of pension reform committee that bears his name, will join the vast majority of Britons who retire with something less than a full pension. The precise amount, he says, will be thirty-five-and-a-half-eightieths of a full pension under his occupational University Superannuation Scheme, he said, when he retires five years from now at 65. This fact did not tempt him to urge more generous treatment of people who change jobs in the committee's final recommendations on pension reform this week. Of all the issues covered in the weighty (about 7lb) blueprint for a new occupational pensions framework, the treatment of those who quit schemes early proved one of the most divisive within the committee, he said. The group finally decided against requiring employers to increase their former employees' deferred pensions in line with earnings, which would have helped those who switch jobs freqently to retire on something more like a full pension. 'Most of us felt that such a move would put the early leaver in the same position as those who stayed,' Prof Goode said, adding that the committee felt that employers simply do not feel committed to providing the same level of benefits to ex-employees as to those who stay to receive their full pension entitlement. Also, all members agreed that the costs of such a requirement would be enormous. Many of the committee members and their views are well known inside the pensions industry. On the consumer activist end of the spectrum, industry sources say, was Ms Sue Ward, a freelance writer and researcher, former member of the Occupational Pensions Board and a campaigner for greater pension democracy. At the other end, observers place Mr Stuart James, partner at solicitors Rowe and Maw and, those who know him say, a holder of equally firm views. The gentlemanly Prof Goode, now Norton Rose Professor of English Law at St John's College, Oxford, said debate over the planned reforms was heated. 'The important thing was that everyone was willing to listen to arguments,' he said. A professor of commercial law, Prof Goode's particular expertise is in the area of consumer credit. He has written several books on the subject, including a three-volume set of case law. But before entering academia, he specialised in civil litigation, becoming a partner in what was then the firm of Victor Mishcon and Co. Among his cases was one involving the former Livestock Marketing Company. 'It was called armchair pigfarming. Instead of shares, you had rights to a pig, and instead of dividends, you had rights to its litter,' Prof Goode said. The company eventually went into receivership and Prof Goode's client wanted to collect her four pigs. However, they could not be identified without being washed first. 'The official receiver said it was not in his job description to be required to wash a pig,' he said. So the client collected a dividend cheque for one and sixpence (about 7p) and Prof Goode departed shortly thereafter for academia.</p>

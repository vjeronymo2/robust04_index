Western radio stations have reported that the expert  economists -- Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University and  his Swedish colleague Anders Aslund -- have ostentatiously given  up the posts of advisers to the Russian Government.    Several BBC programs have carried the farewell interview of  probably the most famous of the monetarist puppeteers, with  whose name the economic schemes of our own Russian "Chicago  boys" were linked in the past. Jeffrey Sachs reported that he  now deems it impossible to teach reason to the Russian  authorities, which are ossified in antimarket dogmas, since with  the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov it is no longer a government  of reforms.    World news agencies have simultaneously disseminated a  report  that the Russian Government has decided to enlist as experts two  economists from the entourage of USSR ex-President Gorbachev --  Nikolay Petrakov and Leonid Abalkin, who have already embarked  on elaborating a "more moderate economic policy."    The change of scenery and prompters on the Russian political  stage probably gives second wind to a popular anecdote from the  times of perestroyka, which in its time was even heard from the  rostrum of the Congress of People's Deputies. This amusing  parable maintained that the U.S. president's 100 bodyguards  included one who, to put it mildly, was insufficiently reliable,  but the U.S. president did not, alas, know precisely which one.  If the anecdote is to be believed, the French president, to  whom, as to all other Frenchmen, rumor ascribes particularly  ardent feelings for beautiful women, has somewhat similar  problems: How is he to divine which of the 100 most charming  ladies is infected with AIDS? But, according to the anecdote,  the great reformer Gorbachev had the gravest thoughts: There  are 100 expert economists in his entourage, and just one of them  knows the path to market prosperity, but Gorbachev cannot guess  precisely which one.    The events of recent years, however, even make us seriously  doubt that the ex-president really did have even one expert  seer! At any rate, the majority of his advisers gambled on the  salutary and miracle-working self-regulating role of the market,  which Gorbachev, although not an economist, had perfectly  reasonable grounds to doubt -- back in 1989, with righteous  irritation, he made the following comment on the prescription of  Vasiliy Selyunin, also an economist, who has now become one of  the leaders of "Russia's Choice": "He says that the market  itself will put everything in place within a month.... I know  just one thing: Within two weeks such a 'market' will bring the  entire people out onto the streets and sweep aside any  government, however much they swear loyalty to the people!"    The ex-president somewhat underestimated our people's  legendary long-suffering, but the recent elections show  perfectly well that the people's angry reaction will, in the  final analysis, be precisely like that, sweeping aside the  government.    As is known, the experts surrounding Gorbachev included  exemplary, assiduous apprentices of Jeffrey Sachs. Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy and Stanislav Shatalin did not promise the country  market prosperity as quickly as Selyunin did, but nor did they  defer it for too long -- just 500 days. That spirited program  elicited caustic comments from world-renowned specialists.  Hisao Kanamori, chairman of the Japanese Economic Research  Center, called the scheme "an impossible dream, totally  incompatible with the real state of affairs in the Soviet  Union." In his conviction, "the very fact that this kind of  program has been advanced proves that Soviet people do not know  what a market economy is."    Four years ago, in the same interview with the KYODO News  Agency, the leading Japanese economist also did not spare  Petrakov and Abalkin, whose "moderate plan" for market  transformations was ultimately approved by Gorbachev: Hisao  Kanamori concluded that this program also did not contain "even  short-term economic goals." Most of all the Japanese economist  warned against the very "shock therapy" that was imposed on us  in recent years. In response to the radical reformers'  complaints that their plans had been "completely emasculated" he  gave a truly prophetic warning: "...If the reforms had been  implemented at such a fast pace, the muddle (in the Soviet  economy) would have been still further exacerbated. The Soviets  have no choice other than to advance gradually, implementing  phased economic reforms."    In connection with the demarche of Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fedorov and then that of their foreign guides-advisers, the  debate in the mass media over whether there was "shock therapy"  in Russia has once again become lively. Jeffrey Sachs himself  maintains that there was not.    Of course, everything is relative. Russians, who have been  subjected to total impoverishment as a result of the "Gaydar  reforms," must bear in mind that a yet harder fate would have  awaited them if our Russian monetarists had paid still more  attention to Jeffrey Sachs' promptings. The Russian economy, to  use the figurative expression of WASHINGTON POST commentator Jim  Hoagland, would have "floated belly up" much sooner.    The true aim of Jeffrey Sachs' prescriptions is precisely to  turn Russia's economy "belly up."    An interesting analytical document has been disseminated by  researchers at the well-known Schiller Institute. They neatly  set out, as it were, the whole package of "obligatory  recommendations" from the IMF and the Harvard school of  monetarists. The scheme provides theoretically for a reduction  in inflation and in the budget deficit to 5-10 percent a month,  but the chief aim of the "reforms" is to open the borders to  Western goods and to devalue the national currency in order to  increase profitable (for the West!) exports of raw materials.  The opening of the borders to Western capital investments and  the closure of the majority of loss-making Russian enterprises  are aimed at the same thing. "At the same time," the  researchers state, "the nature of the reforms is not so  important in itself (the only stipulation is for a reduction in  the share of ownership). The chief thing is self-restriction  and openness. But such a policy will lead in practice to the  closure of almost all Russian enterprises and, accordingly, to a  production slump, unemployment, and then also inflation."    So it makes sense to give the matter some serious thought:  Will Russia gain a great deal if it approaches these "yawning  market heights" not in one month or even 500 days but much later  -- on the basis of "mild reforms" according to the latest  recommendations of Petrakov and Abalkin?</p>

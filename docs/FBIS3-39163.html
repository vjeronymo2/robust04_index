The provincial commanders in Zhalah [northern  Iraq and western Iran], Botan [region around Hakkari], and Amed  [region around Diyarbakir] have already been replaced. The only  area in which changes will not be made is Dersim [region around  Tunceli], one of the eight provinces. KURD-A will issue a  statement once the commanders in the remaining provinces are  also replaced.    It has been reported that soon after the replacement of the  provincial commanders, the PKK will make a "call for peace" on  the eve of local elections.    The PKK has thus far replaced the commanders in three  provinces. Numan Celik replaced Osman Ocalan [brother of  Abdullah Ocalan] in Zhalah. Murat Karayilan was appointed to  Botan. "Munzur" replaced Semdin Sakik in Amed. From among the  replaced provincial commanders, only Munzur is "more moderate"  compared to the commander he replaced.    Doctor Baran, the commander of Dersim Province, remains in  his post. It was reported that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan gave  the following reason for these changes: "Younger provincial  commanders are being appointed. A rejuvenation operation has  started inside PKK."</p>

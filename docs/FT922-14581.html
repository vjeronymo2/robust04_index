			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: Issues at stake Sir, Your article on the political demise of Gerhard Stoltenberg, Germany's defence minister ('Germany shoots itself in the foot', April 1), is surprising. Several issues are at stake. First, a senior minister in the federal government has not obeyed the will of parliament concerning the supply of the balance of 15 tanks to Turkey. This is apparently the second time that this has happened. Is it not welcome that a minister, admittedly after long delay, has finally taken political responsibility for his ministry's action or lack of action? The second issue is why it is wrong to condemn Iraq for dealing with the Kurdish problem but right for Turkey to do the same. Third, the whole issue has nothing to do with the question of coalition government. G Imig, 58 Borough High Street, London SE1 1XF</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ford's German arm sees return to black Ford-Werke, the German subsidiary of the US motor group, said it would move out of the red and make at least DM100m (Dollars 62.5m) profit this year, but warned that the German car market was making only a tentative recovery. Mr Albert Caspers, chief executive, said new registrations in Germany were likely to increase by just 2 per cent compared with very bad figures the year before. His comments about the German market reflect those made by Adam Opel, the General Motors subsidiary, which reported a loss of DM503m earlier this week and said only that it hoped for a 'dramatic improvement' this year. Ford-Werke is the largest subsidiary of the US group and includes the Belgian works at Genk. It exports to 60 countries and lost DM132m last year compared with a loss of DM469m in 1992, but said it made 'an impressive three figure million profit' in the first six months of this year. Mr Caspers blamed the 1993 losses on lower sales and foreign exchange losses. Turnover in 1993 fell 3.7 per cent to DM21.2bn and was set to increase 10 per cent in the coming year. Impressive sales of the Mondeo had helped and exports to France, the UK and Spain had increased by around 10 per cent. Ford increased its share of the European car market in 1993 to 11.5 per cent, from 11.2 per cent, and had maintained a German market share of 9.3 per cent. The company last year set aside DM300m to fund restructuring and said it was unlikely to use all of the sum even after laying off several hundred more of its 43,800 workers this year. However, the Cologne-based group warned that the good first-half results could not be repeated in the second half, and there was little prospect that the two German factories in Cologne and Saarlouis could increase their capacity above the 80 per cent being worked at the moment.</p>

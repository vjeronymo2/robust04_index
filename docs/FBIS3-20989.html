They break down a multitude of  undesirable compounds like ammonium and highly ecologically  harmful, problem-creating substances. Simulation of the growth  processes in these tanks is necessary in order to study the  decomposition processes. Wolfgang Tappe of Juelich Research  Center, Ltd., (Institute for Biotechnology [IBT3], 52425  Juelich) has now developed a bioreactor system that is suitable  for these tasks.    As Tappe informed us in Juelich, bacteria grow in the soil  and in water, as well as at sewage plants, at very low rates of  growth. The supply of nutrients is frequently so limited that it  is only enough for bacteria to survive, but not sufficient for  growth. The study of these processes is important in view of the  services bacteria render in breaking down harmful substances.  With conventional bioreactor systems, however, simulation of  these kinds of growth conditions is impossible or only very  limited. With a continously operating laboratory bioreactor, a  specific amount of fresh nutrient solution per time unit is  supplied and the corresponding amount of consumed medium  removed. In the process, biomass is also lost, which has to be  replaced by the growth of the bacteria in the reactor. Now if  the organisms' maximal rate of growth is very low, the danger  exists that the lost biomass can no longer be replaced.    Since the average generation periods at activated sludge  plants range from 150 to 500 hours, they are comparatively long.  In simulating these growth conditions, conventional bioreactor  systems are frequently overtaxed. Since the nutrient supply in  this case is only very little, an even distribution is in part  no longer attained in the reactor. The result is that the  bacteria population is no longer homogeneous. Some bacteria grow  faster than others.    The solution to the problem lies in the Juelich reactor with  biomass support. The principal difference between it and the  conventional, continuously operating reactor is a separately  ordered filtration module. In it the consumed medium is filtered  out while the bacteria are held back. The filtraiton process is  not simple since the round filter has a tendency to get blocked.  Tappe has solved this problem with the cross-flow technique. A  magnetic agitator that creates a flow that moves at right angles  to the direction of filtration (cross-flow) rotates right above  the membrane. With this system, blockages can be successfully  prevented.    The molecule is surrounded by a high-grade steel housing and  is connected with the reactor container by hoses and pumps. In  this way a continous supply of nutrients can be obtained without  any loss of biomass and bacteria with very low rates of growth  can be studied. These growth conditions come very close to the  actual conditions in activated sludge tanks. The Juelich  system's filtration module can also be used for on-line  monitoring of sewage plants. It delivers a biomass-free sample  from which chemical parameters can be determined.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Commercial Union launches environmental trust COMMERCIAL UNION, the composite insurance group, is launching an investment trust which will aim to take advantage of increases in environmental protection expenditure. CU is the second insurance company, and the first composite, to launch an investment trust. Unlike other recent trust launches, which have been aimed at the retail market, the Commercial Union Environmental Trust will be placed almost exclusively with institutional shareholders. Shares will be available for large intermediaries, if they are interested, but CU is making no attempt to market the shares directly to the public. The company is also considering further investment trust launches. The trust will have no geographical limitations, and will invest primarily in smaller specialised companies which stand to benefit from increased expenditure on environmental protection. It is aiming to raise up to Pounds 30m during its launch period which lasts until March 25. Dealing will start on April 3. The ordinary shares will be priced at 100p each, with warrants attached on a 1-for-5 basis.</p>

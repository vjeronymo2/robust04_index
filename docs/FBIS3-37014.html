			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with UK Prime Minister John Major by </F> correspondent Aleksandr Gurnov on 10 February in London]    [Text] [Gurnov] The next Russian-British summit is becoming  a reality. The British delegation, led by John Major, will  depart for Moscow on 14 January [as heard]. The main objective  of the talks with our leadership is obvious: to assess the new  balance of forces in Russia after all those reshuffles -- on the  spot. After that, there will be a visit to Nizhnyy Novgorod,  which the British view as a model for creating market  infrastructure with Western help.    What about British interests? After all, if they are coming  to us, they must also want something. We came to Downing Street  to ask this question.    [Begin recording] [Gurnov] Mr. Major, there is a lot of talk  now about helping Russia, but is there anything Russia can do to  help Britain?    [Major, in English with superimposed Russian translation]  Russia is an enormous and strong power, and it is in British  interests to have good relations with you. Therefore, we are  ready to help you try to overcome your difficulties, but you are  right. Russia has something to offer, not only to Britain but  to the whole world. The president, the prime minister, and I  will be discussing this during the summit.    [Gurnov] The British prime minister will be the first  Western leader to visit the Kremlin after the NATO decision on  Yugoslavia, which was adopted today and which now threatens to  mar Russia's relations with the West. In the light of this,  what will be John Major's main task in Moscow?    [Major] I would like to stress that NATO is not taking  anyone's side in this conflict. We want to find a way to stop  the bloodshed while negotiations continue. We have no other  option. I am sure that Russia's objective is the same. Because  we have similar aims, we have a basis for dialogue. [end  recording]    [Gurnov] Moscow's task will be to give Major a message for  the Western world at a moment when both our home and foreign  policies certainly need explaining; that is, if Russia still  wants to continue being a part of this world.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Col V. Cheban, doctor of philosophical sciences: </F> "Some Lessons From Armed Conflicts"]    [Text] In various regions of the former Union,  pockets of armed conflicts die out and then flare up with new  strength. They sow death and destruction; thousands of refugees  end up without a roof over their head and without the means of  existence.    Why have these tragic events become possible? What are  their lessons? How do they reflect on the security of the  Russian Federation?    Colonel V. Cheban, doctor of philosophical sciences,  discusses these problems on the pages of the journal.    Armed conflicts in Nagornyy Karabakh, Moldova, Tajikistan,  Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia differ in scale, nature, and  intensity, but have one thing in common. They are accentuated by  the death and grief of many thousands of totally innocent  people. The process of disintegration of the former Union and  the sovereignization of individual republics is taking place  considerably more painfully and tragically than initially  seemed. There was no civilized division of the territory and  economic, scientific-technical, and military potential of the  once powerful superpower.    Just what are the bitter lessons of the armed conflicts  taking place on the territory of the former Union?    Lesson One. Above all, what is striking is the  fact that the creation of independent states is taking place on  the basis of absolutization by certain social forces and  sections of society of their interests exclusively, while  completely ignoring the quite just interests of other people.  Nationalism, political ambitiousness, and separatism have one  common denominator--egoism. It is this that blinds leaders,  social trends, and social forces when vitally important problems  are being resolved. Inability, impatience, and unwillingness of  leaders, social groupings, and government circles to resolve  unsettled problems by a civilized method naturally bring egoism  and ambitiousness to a most extreme and dangerous form of their  manifestation--to armed violence. Here the assumption is made on  using fear as the main instrument of socio-psychological control  of society or its individual groups. A shifting of priorities of  dominating or imposing one's will on others in the direction of  moral and physical terror is indicated by the inability or  unwillingness to handle the situation by other unarmed means.    Lesson Two. Destruction of statehood, the lack of  a legal system of coordinates, the arising legal nihilism of  citizens, aggravation of social contradictions, decline in the  standard of living, endless wide-scale social experiments  exhausting the patience of the people, and the limit of trust in  the leadership at all levels create favorable conditions for  armed conflicts.    In addition, extreme in criticism of law enforcement  agencies, institutions of state security, internal affairs  bodies, and the army, along with searching for real  shortcomings, not only makes it difficult for these institutions  to perform state functions but also undermines their authority  as a barrier in the path of destructive forces and criminals.    The hasty and accelerated division of the armed forces and  the rash "privatization" of combat equipment and armament  resulted in weapons not only becoming a terrible tool in the  hands of extremists and criminals but also one of the most  popular instruments of "big-time politics."    Lesson Three. The long struggle with the "center"  and the charged state of lower power structures and  administrative formations for confrontation with higher  authorities resulted in the boomerang effect: the initiator of  criticism of the center is itself becoming the object of  criticism "from below." The republics' struggle against the  Union center turned into a struggle of autonomies against the  former republics. For example, Georgia's persistent desire to  leave the Union and the endless accusations against Moscow of  "interference" and "imperial ways" led to Georgia itself being  on the verge of collapse. Abkhazia and Osetia have tried to  "swallow" sovereignty as much as they wanted, and the Georgian  government sent military there. Now charges of "imperial ways"  and "genocide" have been made against Tbilisi.    Moldova acted similarly with respect to the former Union.  The  desire to move a little farther away from the "totalitarian  regime of Moscow" was encouraged in every way at the state and  public levels. However, it took the Dniester region to declare  its right to independence (particularly after a discriminatory  law on a state language was passed in Moldova), and the  leadership of Moldova began to restore "constitutional order" by  force of arms. The struggle with "separatists" developed into a  real war against its own people.    Ukraine also has not been spared from the boomerang of  sovereignization. If you consider that the Crimea, Western  Ukraine, and its eastern areas have an eye on independence, the  future is not problem-free in this respect.    The development of events in the Dniester region is also  similar to the Baltic region. Here there is an absolutization of  only the national interests, with complete ignoring of the  interests of the Russian-speaking population.    The epidemic of sovereignization has also infected Russia.  Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, Chechen, and also regions of the  Urals, Siberia, and the Far East are hatching not only  theoretical but also practical plans for establishing their  independence from the Russian center. So, the formula "trouble  comes to him who makes trouble for others" is most appropriate  for illustrating the current method of sovereignization, when  the egoistic, aggressive method is the most popular.    Lesson Four. Armed conflicts have shown that  despite the proclaimed end of the Cold War and the loud  statements about the de-ideologization of international,  interethnic, and other social relations, they are still tied to  the old normal routine of the past of confrontation between  social systems and ideological biases. Gravitation toward the  old method of resolving unsettled problems leads to the fact  that something fundamentally new is not emerging, but something  old and well-known is being revived.    Thus, for the Baltic region, the "renewal" developed into  the  restoration of laws from the 1940's.    For the Transcaucasus, the 1920's have been taken as the  reference point, when the violent processes of sovereignization  took place against the background of a general transformation of  the Russian Empire.    In Central Asia, renewal was directed even deeper into the  past, out of loyalty to old medieval traditions, beginning with  absolutization of religion and its role in the spiritual life of  society and ending with the unprecedented honoring of the "great  people": the bays, khans, emirs, and the like.    Renewal in Ukraine includes resuscitation of  nationalistic-type trends, movements, and organizations, which  in the past fought against the Soviet Union on the side of  Hitler.    Armed conflicts also are not isolated from geopolitical  relations and the interests of foreign states. Turkey, Pakistan,  and Iran, not to mention the United States, Germany, Japan,  France, and Great Britain, are closely observing events on the  territory of the former Union. And observation is developing  into an active military policy.    For example, a violation of human rights in the Baltic is  not  noticed by either the United States, Germany, Japan, France, or  England, since they are traditionally impressed by the "bold  actions of small states" against the "Russian Empire." They do  not conceal the plans for armed intervention in the event  "Russia attacks Lithuania."    Lesson Five. The same pattern of the outbreak and  development of armed conflicts is repeated. Initially, one of  the belligerents makes an unambiguous threat to use weapons.  Then shots actually ring out, which "fortunately" do not result  in casualties. Then exchanges of gunfire between "unknown  persons" begin, this time resulting in casualties.    At this time, various versions and assumptions emerge and  are  circulated in public opinion, and the initiators of the conflict  closely monitor the nature of the reaction to the armed clashes.  If a wave of indignation rises over isolated incidents of  terror, the armed actions temporarily die down. When they pass  by the "angry vessel" of public opinion, the next step is taken:  an armed attack of a wider scale is made.    It is natural that retaliatory measures immediately follow  with such a development of events, and new victims appear. The  initiators of the conflict present these victims as a reason for  further escalation of tension and confrontation. A new spiral in  the bloody fighting begins.    As an analysis of events shows, the flywheel of armed  conflicts unwinds according to this sinister scenario largely  because one of the main conditions for ending them is not met:  the public does not receive a timely and specific answer to the  question. Who is to blame? The concept of "aggressor" has  virtually disappeared from diplomatic and political affairs.  Meanwhile, the analysis and prevention of any conflict also  begin with the clear definition of this "character." Dissolution  of the "aggressor" in a mass of abstract factors gives him an  incentive for further aggressive actions and makes the victim  even more defenseless.    Lesson Six. Armed conflicts are noted for special  cruelty with respect to the totally innocent population. This  largely explains the great losses among residents of cities and  villages.    The reason is that the use of weapons is intended not so  much  for destroying the armed enemy as for intimidating and  frightening the unarmed person.    For what purpose is this done?    As fact indicate, in order to achieve success in their  plans,  the participants in armed conflicts strive to intimidate the  population supporting the opposing side. However, the fear of  being killed and the element of revenge for family and friends  who have died even further deform people's psyche, already  overloaded with negative emotions. All this leads to even  greater bitterness in the merciless fight. Hence the  guerrilla-like actions, hostage-taking, sporadic exchanges of  gunfire, and the lack of a rigid centralization in the  subordination of various paramilitary formations due to the  "independence" of the fighters.    Lesson Seven. All the capabilities of the ties  between themselves, both for vertical structures of the opposing  sides (government--army--local authorities--local internal  affairs bodies--individual citizens) and for contacts between  them horizontally (government to government; army to army;  social movements to social movements; local members of  parliament to local members of parliament from the other side;  fraternization of persons involved directly in the conflict),  are far from being fully utilized for blocking and ending the  armed conflicts.    The distinctive protective functions of the "monasteries,"  which virtually all military garrisons have and where  peaceloving citizens can take shelter from terrorism, are also  being used insufficiently.    A serious obstacle to putting a stop to armed conflicts in  the initial stage is the false shame of ruling circles and  social movements in taking decisive measures for fear of being  categorized as "undemocratic," "uncivilized," "imperial,"  "hegemonic," "totalitarian," and the like. As a result, in  striving to preserve political virginity, the governments of  neighboring countries free the hands of the aggressor though  their inaction.    Lesson Eight. In an interrelated and  interdependent world, armed conflicts do not pass without a  trace. They are transformed and influence many states and  peoples through a system of economic, political, and  geopolitical ties. Disruption or severing of economic and trade  ties adversely affects the economic life of countries far from  the conflict. In turn, discrediting, violating human rights,  persecution, and genocide create a migratory wave that is  capable of tearing down the social foundations in neighboring  states, aggravating the internal situation in them, and causing  new conflicts.    It is never someone else's problem. It is necessary to treat  all conflicts with heightened attention. That is why one should  master lesson nine. It is necessary to fight armed  conflicts, as well as wars, long before them break out. For this  purpose it is necessary to have a developed system of blocking  armed conflicts and an effective mechanism for preventing and  stopping them.

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Fair shares for the savvy investor - The growth of a stock index for small US companies In the past, small American companies had to rely on word of mouth among brave stock analysts if they wanted to see much trading in their shares. But today, if a small firm can be included in the Russell 2,000 Index, the benchmark index of small capitalisation companies, it stands a better chance of riding the wave of popularity that small shares are currently enjoying on Wall Street. The Russell 2,000 Index is composed of 2,000 companies with an average capitalisation of Dollars 100m. The largest company in the index, the National Pizza Company, has a market capitalisation of Dollars 338m, and the smallest, Intertrans Corp, of Dollars 15.7m. The Russell 2,000, created by the Frank Russell Company, a Seattle-based pension fund advisory firm, is attracting increasing attention as the values of small company shares have shot up. Last year the index outperformed the larger and more important Standard &amp; Poor's 500 by more than 15 percentage points. The total annual rate of return on the Russell 2,000 was 46.05 per cent, while the S&amp;P 500 posted just 30.5 per cent. The vogue of small capitalisation companies appears to be continuing this year as well. The index has become something of the darling of indexers - those mostly institutional investors who match their portfolios to a particular market index. An index offers several advantages: if the portfolio is matched perfectly - that is, it contains proportionately the same stocks that are in the index - it assures a return at least as good as the index. This helps to eliminate the risks of bad stock picks and reduces the amount of trading in a portfolio, and thus its transaction costs. Money has flooded into the Russell 2,000 in the last few years. According to Katie Weigel, vice president for product development at the Frank Russell Company, the amount of assets indexed to the Russell 2,000 has risen from zero in 1985, the year after the index was launched, to Dollars 1.3bn at the end of 1989 and to more than Dollars 2bn today. Money managers expect that it will continue to rise. With that kind of money being pumped into small capitalisation shares, the companies can enjoy the advantages that rising stock prices confer, such as greater ease in raising money, converting debt to equity or substituting bonds for bank debt. In addition, since in many small companies top managers are owners of shares, their own net worth increases. Part of the reason why so much investment has flowed into the Russell 2,000 recently is that in rising markets, small stocks have better chances for growth and investors have been lured by high returns. But Sandip Bhagat, manager of the small capitalisation stock fund for Travelers Investment Mangement Company, a unit of Travelers Insurance, said he believes that in a slow-growth, maturing economy, as the United States is now, small company shares have greater possibilities for growth. Money managers also say that the index will continue to prosper because large institutional investors and other savvy individuals are now seeing some benefits in having a proportionate exposure to the spectrum of the market. For example, at PanAgora Asset Management - an investment firm with Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.6bn) under management and offices in London, Boston and Tokyo  -David Beckedorff, who manages a small capitalisation fund that tracks the Russell 2,000, says that the index represents roughly 8 per cent of the US stock universe and that there are some clients who wish to invest proportionately. Along with the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P MidCap 400 of medium-sized companies  - which respectively represent 75 per cent and 15 per cent of the stock universe - the Russell 2,000 is a building block for an index-investing strategy, said Beckedorff. PanAgora's fund, which is open to pension funds, began last summer and has Dollars 25m in assets. It does not attempt to purchase all 2,000 of the index's shares because of a lack of liquidity in small stocks. Instead, it selects 820 stocks from the index, picking for a spread among industries and the greatest liquidity. A similar type of selection from the Russell 2,000 is made by the Vanguard Group of mutual funds for its retail public fund that is based on the index. Gus Sauter, the fund's manager, says that his Small Capitalisation Stock Fund has mushroomed from just Dollars 18m in 1989, when it converted to track the Russell 2,000, to Dollars 170m today. Although liquidity problems make the Russell 2,000 the most difficult index Vanguard tracks, Sauter said: 'In the long run, we expect it to be a big fund'. Bhagat of Travelers is also convinced the shift into small stocks is for the long-term. 'These will be the better performing sub-asset class' at least until the mid-1990s, he says.  ------------------------------------ RATE OF RETURN  ------------------------------------ Year to       Russell       S &amp; P Date          2000 %         500 %  ------------------------------------ 1992           8.1          -1.85 1991         46.05           30.5 1990         -19.5           -3.1 1989          16.2           31.4 1988          24.8         18.501 1987          -8.7            5.1 1986           5.6           18.2 1985          31.0           31.5 1984          -7.3            6.1 1983          29.1           22.4 1982          24.9           21.5  ------------------------------------</p>

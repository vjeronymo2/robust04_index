			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Vodafone advances Vodafone shares continued their recovery, and were given a push yesterday by Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, who said the stock would respond very quickly to sharply increased subscriber numbers for the third quarter, expected on October 3. Hoare's telecoms team is looking for Vodafone to announce a customer base of some 120,000, more than twice that of the same time last year. The broker described Vodafone shares as 'very cheap' and said it expected the stock to respond vigorously to an expected bout of buying intertest from UK institutions. US selling, which has been strongly evident in recent weeks, has largely dried up, dealers said. Vodafone shares edged up 3 to 186 1/2 p, after 188p, with turnover reaching 4.6m. Northern Electricity was the star turn in a generally strong Recs sector, the shares racing up 19 to 813p after the company activated its share buy back programme. BZW, Northern's broker, was said to have bought in around 10m shares but was acting as an agent for the group in a move seen by dealers as a tender offer. The Northern buy back offer, was viewed by marketmakers as a big switching operation and especially lucrative for the market's big gross funds. Other buy back moves yesterday included South Wales acquiring 225,000 shares at 817p. Barclays Bank shares took a drubbing in the general market malaise, sliding 10 1/2 to 567 1/2 p; stories circulating in the stockmarket suggested that the bank had moved recently to curtail its lending to property and building companies, a move which prompted fears that the bank may have suffered a further wave of losses in those areas. Standard Chartered was one of the few strong performers in the sector, with dealers talking of a chart break out for the stock. Big falls in international bond and equity markets across the globe triggered a fresh spate of concerns that many of the UK's big trading houses could have come unstuck during the turbulent trading period. SG Warburg, always viewed as the UK's leading integrated securities house, dropped 20 to 711p. Smith New Court, the London market's premier marketmaking firm, slipped 8 to 416p. Lingering fears that Commercial Union's rights issue might have run into problems dragged CU shares down 13 to 488p and the nil-paids 13 to 15p. A move to stem speculation over its interest in Scott Paper subsidiary SD Warren pushed up market confidence in Arjo Wiggins and the shares improved 12 to 263p. Arjo said that it would only be interested in acquiring a part of the company in a joint venture with a US company rather than the whole. After recent weakness in the stock, investors were pleased that any large-scale dilution, which would be caused by a big purchase, was no longer a concern. Merger and acquisitions speculation continues to preoccupy the pharmaceuticals sector, with most analysts concurring that in several years there will be fewer drugs companies. Compatibility between Zeneca and Wellcome, and the fact that there would be little product overlap, is fuelling market talk of a merger between the two, according to one analyst. Zeneca lost 9 to 833p and Wellcome gave up 10 to 689p. Contract distribution shares were the feature of the transport sector with Tillett and Britten tumbling 42 to 768p following a bleakish half-year report. A slip of 16 sent shares in Thorn EMI down to 972p as talk circulated of a large line of stock hanging over the market. A seller was said to have tested the water but marketmakers were reluctant to take on the block and the price marked down. The unwinding of a bull position was said to have been partly responsible for a tumble in the price of BOC Group. The shares lost 14 to 709p. Against prevailing weakness in the chemicals sector Courtaulds managed to close the day unchanged at 471p albeit in thin volume as sentiment begins to grow that the shares have been oversold. The share price upset at BAe washed over on to Aerostructures Hamble, the former BAE unit floated in June at 120p. The company gets around 80 per cent of turnover from BAe and the shares crashed 50 to 73p. Other statistics, Page 43</p>

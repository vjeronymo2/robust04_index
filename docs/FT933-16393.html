			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Umbrellas, how safe are they? - Philip Coggan examines funds with big appeal to offshore investors IS AN UMBRELLA fund the right home for your rainy day money? The idea behind an 'umbrella' is that a large number of different types of funds  - US equities, international bonds and so on - are grouped together. This is nearly always done in some offshore administrative centre, such as Luxembourg or the Channel Islands. While the tax advantages of an offshore centre for UK residents are fairly limited, this does allow umbrella funds to appeal to investors world-wide and, in particular, wealthy expatriates. The idea behind the umbrella structure is to make it easy for the investor to move his funds from one asset category to another without excessive costs. A good umbrella fund ought to allow free switching (or, at best, a nominal charge). The smart investor, for example, could have moved out of equities and into bonds (or cash) before the crash of October 1987. It also makes for administrative convenience for the fund manager. Technically, investors usually are shareholders in the overall group, rather than in the individual funds. This means that only one annual report has to be issued, and only one prospectus launched with the relevant regulator. Fidelity's Luxembourg range of funds, for example, is an open-ended investment company with 23 classes of share, each relating to a separate portfolio of securities. For a while in the mid-1980s, umbrella funds mushroomed because of a tax advantage for UK investors. Switches between funds were free from capital gains tax. Investors faced a CGT liability only when they took money out of the umbrella altogether. That loophole was removed in 1989; now, a UK resident who switches from, say, Japan to the US could face a CGT bill on any Japanese fund profits. Offshore funds are, for UK tax purposes, divided into distributor and accumulator funds. Distributors must pay out 85 per cent of their income as dividends. UK investors must pay income tax on the dividends but any other profits are taxed as capital gains. Accumulators do not pay out income but 'roll it up' within the fund. Neverthless, all gains are taxed as income, not capital gains, although only when investors sell their holding. They can, therefore, be useful for postponing a tax liability. If an investor knew he was going to retire and move into a lower tax bracket, he could invest in a roll-up and take profits at the most tax-efficient moment. Furthermore, the roll-up can enhance performance. Since tax is postponed, investors can compound their investment gross rather than net. Offshore funds can also pay income gross. This gives them an advantage over UK unit trusts, albeit one which should partly be eliminated in the next Budget. Expatriates, or those who move regularly between countries, may well find it convenient and tax-efficient to keep their investments within an umbrella. The down-side, of course, is that you are relying on the investment skills of one management group, which might be excellent at managing bonds but not equities. Also, many funds are dollar-denominated, which means that non-dollar investors face an extra layer of currency risk. In the wake of scandals such as Barlow Clowes, how safe are umbrella funds? Many can be found in the back pages of the FT's first section under the heading 'SIB recognised.' This means the Securities and Investments Board has accepted that regulation in the offshore administrative centre is equivalent to that in the UK, and the funds have satisfied SIB they are run in a proper manner. Some funds can be marketed only through intermediaries; but if they fall into the EC's approved UCITS category, they can be sold across European borders. Guinness Flight has umbrellas covering both the accumulation and distribution types of fund. There are 14 separate roll-up funds and 30 separate distribution funds. Normally, roll-up funds tend to invest in the money markets (ie, mainly bank deposits) or in bonds, where income is high enough to get the full benefit of the roll-up process. Guinness Flight, however, has two equity funds (international and European) within its range. It cites good performance for the funds, with Finstat showing 11 of 14 having above-average perfomances over the year to June 1, and 11 of 12 above average over three years. Fidelity's range of distributor funds has a minimum investment of Pounds 1,500, initial charges of 5.25 per cent for equity and 3.5 per cent for bond funds, annual charges of 1.5 per cent for equity and 1 per cent for bond funds, and switch fees of 1 per cent. Fleming has both distributor and accumulator Luxembourg funds under the Flagship label. Minimum investment is Dollars 2,500; charges are 5 per cent initial on the distributor funds, nil on the roll-up funds. There are no switching fees. Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark has a Luxembourg-based Global Opportunities umbrella range. Its initial efforts are concentrated on six sub-funds, three in bonds (US Mortgage Backed Securities, Global Bonds and Emerging Markets Income) and three in equities (US Quality Growth, Global Equities and Emerging Markets Growth). The funds are not SIB-recognised but Scudder, Stevens is a well-established US investment firm with Dollars 70bn under management.</p>

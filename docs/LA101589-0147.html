			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DONAHUE DOESN'T OVERHEAT IN BIG DEFEAT;  </P> <P> UCLA: BRUIN COACH IS DISAPPOINTED, BUT HE CONTROLS HIS TEMPER IN LOSS TO  ARIZONA.  </P> <P> The temperature on the field reached 102 degrees Saturday during UCLA's 42-7  loss to Arizona, but Terry Donahue kept his cool.  </P> <P> While he watched repeated cases of windburn among his defensive team as Arizona  runners passed by, Donahue's face was about the same color as his lemon yellow  shirt.  </P> <P> His expression changed little when David Eldridge squeezed through the line,  sped to the sideline and turned a pitchout into a 54-yard touchdown in the  first quarter.  </P> <P> After all, Donahue had seen something like it before. Only 5 minutes earlier,  Eldridge had scored on a 19-yard run.  </P> <P> Then, in the fourth quarter, when 5-foot-8 freshman running back Errol Sapp,  flowed straight up the middle of UCLA's defense for a 14-yard touchdown,  Donahue folded his arms in front of him, like a man resigned to his fate.  </P> <P> "We had a chance to be a clear-cut leader for the conference championship and  we get totally outclassed," Donahue said. "You have to evaluate that. You can't  sweep it under the rug.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a close game, we didn't lose a heartbreaker. We got thrashed. Our  team isn't very good now. We're trying to get better, but we didn't get any  better today."  </P> <P> For UCLA, it was a defeat of stunning proportions. The Wildcats, coming off an  upset, 16-10 loss to Oregon, led 14-0 after two possessions, 28-0 at the half  and 35-0 after three quarters, rushed for more yards (480) than any opponent in  UCLA history and thoroughly baffled their coach in one of the most memorable  performances ever.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure I can remember a more inept performance by one of my teams,"  Donahue said.  </P> <P> It was also "a nightmare," and "a thrashing," which are the normal descriptive  passages used on such occasions as these.  </P> <P> In the process, the Bruins watched as Eldridge rushed for 205 yards in 20  carries, the most yards a UCLA team has yielded to someone since Marcus Allen  had 219 in a 22-21 USC victory in 1981.  </P> <P> This could be the only time that Eldridge, who missed spring drills with a  broken ankle, has ever been mentioned in the same sentence as Allen.  </P> <P> What made the whole thing possible for Arizona was a newly installed offense,  the I-formation, for which UCLA seemed totally unprepared. The Bruins countered  defensively with the "What?-formation."  </P> <P> It appeared as if the only hope UCLA's defenders had was that Eldridge might  break his ankle again, possibly as he tripped over the stripe at the goal line.  </P> <P> Arizona, which came into the game last in the Pacific 10 Conference in total  offense, scored one more touchdown against UCLA than they had the rest of the  season.  </P> <P> With Arizona leading, 35-0, quarterback Ronald Veal gave way to backup George  Malauulu late in the third quarter, which meant that 51,562 witnessed the  tongue-twisting passing combination of Malauulu to Olatide Ogunfiditimi.  </P> <P> Little worked for the Bruins. Quarterback Bret Johnson gave way to Jim Bonds  with the score 21-0 and UCLA on its 12 yard line. Two passes later, it was  about to become 28-0.  </P> <P> Chris Singleton intercepted Bonds' pass and returned it nine yards to the  seven-yard line, from where Veal scored on the first play he called.  </P> <P> The Bruins were outblocked, outrushed, outdistanced and outscored by an Arizona  team that just wasn't expected to be able to do those things.  </P> <P> But there was split end Ogunfiditimi way downfield, throwing a clearing block  for Eldridge on his 54-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Later, it was Eldridge leveling Bruin Marvcus Patton on a cut by Veal, which  turned out to be a key play in another touchdown drive.  </P> <P> There were seven touchdown drives by the Wildcats, although Arizona Coach Dick  Tomey tried for more. Leading 35-0, Tomey twice called time in the last two  minutes.  </P> <P> Although Donahue seemed to have total recall of his feelings about every other  situation in the game, he blanked out when asked about Tomey's strategy.  </P> <P> "I was just in the game . . . and we were getting our . . . kicked," Donahue  said.  </P> <P> Said Eric Turner: "That's OK, that's their style, if you want to call it a lack  of class or whatever, we knew they'd be trying to score as many points as they  could."  </P> <P> And who can blame them? The Bruins had trouble enough of their own in that  department, their 210-game scoring streak jeopardized until the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> But with Bonds at quarterback again, the Bruins scored with 4:18 to go and  Donahue found something good in that.  </P> <P> "We could have just quit, but at the end of the game, our football team  scored," he said. "It wasn't enough, but it surely beats the alternative."  </P> <P> In the quiet UCLA locker room, players showered, changed, picked up their bags  and were out the door as quickly as possible. No need to linger around this  one.  </P> <P> Punter Kirk Maggio, one of the few Bruins who did not have an off-day, said he  had no idea why the team could be so flat.  </P> <P> "I always thought we were going to come back, even at halftime," Maggio said.  "Coach Donahue kept reminding us of how Maryland was behind Miami, 30-0, at the  half and won (31-30 in 1985).  </P> <P> "We thought were were going to do it," Maggio said. "It was a great halftime  speech. After the game, Coach just told us that sometimes things go our way and  sometimes they don't. Coach Donahue is just a very, I would say, quiet coach.  He keeps his cool, kept his cool today.  </P> <P> "But he's feeling sick right now," Maggio said. "A lot of us are."  </P></p>

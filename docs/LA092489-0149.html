			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAR-POOLING'S POINT  </P> <P> Eileen Rose-Busby's commentary on opening car-pool lanes to all traffic ("Why  Car-Pool Lanes Should Be Opened to All Vehicles and Not Just a Select Few,"  Sept. 17) ignores the operating principle behind car-pool lanes and the  fundamental problem of planning for growing traffic in Southern California.  Freeways, and car-pool lanes especially, are designed to move people, not cars.  Car-pool lanes are particularly efficient at this as they allow more people to  travel an equal-width freeway segment at peak hour than a congested freeway  without such a lane.  </P> <P> Ignoring car-pooling and other measures to manage our traffic demand places  excess reliance upon building new freeways. Traffic is simply growing too fast  to build our way out of the problem. There are simply not enough dollars nor is  there a popular will to raise enough of them for such an approach to work. San  Diego needs more car-pool lanes and more incentives to use them, not retrograde  actions generating more trips and air pollution, which only guarantee that our  freeways mimic our congested cousin to the north.  </P> <P> BYRON M. BUCK  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLIPPERS' OWNER WANTS NEW STADIUM  </P> <P> The owner of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball franchise, Donald T. Sterling,  said Wednesday after a meeting with Mayor Tom Bradley and Coliseum Commission  President Richard Riordan that unless an $85-million new indoor arena is built  to replace the Sports Arena, the Clippers will move to "a new facility  elsewhere in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Sterling did not specify which site he had in mind.  </P> <P> For his part, Riordan said he and the mayor had shown Sterling a new remodeling  plan for the Sports Arena that was less expensive than those previously  developed. Riordan characterized the meeting, which took place in Sterling's  Beverly Hills office, as an informal exchange of views.  </P> <P> The Coliseum Commission has been trying to get Sterling to sign a new, 30-year  lease for the Sports Arena. Promoters of a proposed new indoor arena in Anaheim  have also held discussions with Sterling.  </P></p>

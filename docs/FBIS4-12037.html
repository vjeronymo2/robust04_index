			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Talal al-Hasan, minister of state for </F> foreign affairs, by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from  the "Arabs' Home" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Hijazi] Following Israel's appalling massacre in  Hebron and the issuance of Security Council Resolution 904, His  Majesty King Husayn had a certain opinion about the massacre and  on the resolution. Could you tell us about his opinion?    [Al-Hasan] After the massacre that Israel committed at the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron during the month of Ramadan, His  Majesty King Husayn made several contacts about this subject  with his brother Arab leaders in Morocco, Syria, Egypt, and with  President Yasir 'Arafat. He also contacted U.S. President Bill  Clinton to keep the resolution intact and to avoid any  abstention or veto against this resolution. The resolution was  indeed passed with a U.S. abstention on two paragraphs in the  preamble related to the occupied Arab territories and Jerusalem.  Thanks to the efforts made by his majesty and the Jordanian  Government in this regard, we believe that the resolution  contained a series of positive points that satisfied the demands  of the Palestinian side, particularly with respect to the  protection of the Palestinian people, the disarming of the  settlers, and providing international protection in the occupied  territories. It is true that the matter needs to be followed  up. We believe that the implementation of this resolution  requires Arab and international efforts to enforce the executive  measures contained in this resolution, which includes a  paragraph urging the UN secretary general to follow up the  matter and calling upon the cosponsors of the peace process to  implement the measures contained in the resolution.    [Hijazi] Do you believe that the recent Israeli arbitrary  practices are harmful to the Gaza-Jericho agreement signed  between the PLO and Israel? And could this agreement be  implemented on schedule on 13 April?    [Al-Hasan] First of all, we in Jordan condemn any terrorist  or arbitrary practices by Israel, because this does not serve  the peace process. As for the Gaza-Jericho agreement, our  position is clear. Although we were not a party to this  agreement and had no prior knowledge of it, Jordan backed this  agreement, in support of the Palestinian brothers, out of a  desire to highlight the Palestinian identity, and out of respect  for the independent Palestinian decision as well as of the  historic responsibility undertaken by the PLO, in its capacity  as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian  people. Our backing for this agreement constitutes a real  contribution to giving impetus to the peace process. We have  always said that the Palestinian track is the core of the peace  process. Despite the fact that we had almost reached an  agreement with the Israeli side, we preferred to wait until the  Palestinian brothers managed to make progress along their own  track. When the Palestinian and Israeli sides reached an  agreement and the PLO and Israel mutually recognized each other  and the Declaration of Principles was concluded on 13 September  1993 in Washington, the next day we endorsed the agenda [of  talks with Israel]; that is, on 14 September.    [Hijazi] So do you expect that this initial stage will be  implemented on 13 April despite the Israeli practices?    [Al-Hasan] We hope that Israel will refrain from undertaking  such practices to make room for peace. We hope that the brother  Palestinians will accomplish their goal; namely, to find a  solution acceptable to them. Then, we will have done our duty  of respecting the Palestinian decision and will, as reflected by  their legitimate leadership.</p>

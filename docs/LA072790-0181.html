			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PHALLIC SYMBOL ON 'MERMAID'?  </P> <P> A supermarket chain has pulled copies of the animated movie "The Little  Mermaid" off its shelves because a customer complained that artwork on the  cover contains an offensive phallic symbol.  </P> <P> "Because of the complaint, we've pulled the tape pending investigation," said  Becca Anderson, a spokeswoman for Bashas' grocery stores.  </P> <P> The tape remained off the shelves Thursday and it was uncertain when it would  return, she said.  </P> <P> The complaint was lodged by Michelle Couch of Mesa, who said her husband  pointed out the offending artwork to her last week. She said she complained to  Bashas' only after being ignored by Disney. No other stores had removed the  tape from their shelves.  </P> <P> Couch said on a radio talk show Thursday that "pulling tapes off the shelf is  not my objective."  </P> <P> What she wanted to accomplish, she said, is to have Disney reprint the labels.  </P> <P> Tanya Steele, vice president of publicity for Buena Vista Home Video, a Disney  subsidiary, said nearly 8 million copies of "The Little Mermaid" have been  sold.  </P> <P> About a dozen people have complained about a phallic symbol they believe is  part of a golden castle drawn on the cover of the videotape, she said. Steele  said it is not likely that the drawing will be changed. "It's hard to decide if  12 calls warrant changing the entire artwork, " she said.  </P></p>

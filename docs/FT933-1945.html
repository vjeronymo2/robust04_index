			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (14): Expectations are high - Multimedia MULTIMEDIA is becoming a hot topic in the computer world, although its applications are mainly limited - for the moment - to training and point-of-sale information. Multimedia combines animated, high-resolution graphics and video, hi-fi sound, computer data, communications and - most important of all - interaction between the system and the user. Today's multimedia market is pre-eminently about training, although presentations and kiosk applications - usually taken to mean point-of-sale (p-o-s) displays or point-of-information screens in galleries, shopping malls, airports or exhibitions - are fast-growing. The research consultancy Ovum has estimated that the US and European market for multimedia products and software would grow from just Dollars 500m in 1991 to over Dollars 9bn by 1997. The expectation was that the training market, for example, would grow from some Dollars 326m in 1991 to Dollars 422m by 1994 and Dollars 536m by 1997. But even within that relatively conservative prediction, there are potential pitfalls for vendors and those that invest in them. For while software revenues are expected by Ovum to rise at an average of 13 per cent per year, hardware revenues were only expected to rise by 5 per cent a year, reflecting a decrease in hardware prices that is only likely to be partially offset by ever-increasing volumes. Training, distance-learning, open-learning (a slightly different concept) and further education are inseparable within the multimedia canon. To understand why, it is only necessary to quote one example - provided by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications which, during its 'World Class Britain' conference, last year, said that it wanted to see 1.2m workers achieve NVQs by 1996. At a time when all budgets for training and further education are under pressure, that high target is unlikely to be met by conventional means. It is, instead, being met by the use of new multimedia products such as CD-ROM, CBT packages and multimedia's primogenitor, interactive videodisc. Lloyds Bank, for example, has installed around 100 multimedia systems (based on Wang computers, VideoLogic boards and CD-ROM) which supplement its 1,500-machine interactive video network and its use of computer-based training (CBT). The use of the multimedia systems propels Lloyds distance learning into the management arena. 'Distance-learning' is cost-independent of the number of students - and there is considerable evidence that distance-learning reduces the overall costs of training, says the senior manager of Lloyds training development group, Howard Hills. Further examples of this are evident elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, the Deutsche Bundespost Postdienst has saved DM14.2m in time and travel costs during the first four months of its multimedia training project. Based around VideoLogic systems allowing the integration of video, audio and still images on to 2,000 PC-based learning stations installed in German post offices, more 100,000 employees have already undergone training. Even more important, the market for generic materials, which had to some extent been held down by the cost of interactive video replay systems, is beginning to take off in the UK. It is already burgeoning in the US. New companies, such as the Gloucestershire-based Xebec, which has just signed to produce six packages a year for distribution in the US; CD-I Training; Lasermedia; IIS, Maxim, Skillchange and Pitman (which acquired a multimedia production house, Convergent, last year), are emerging to rival the film and video training hegemony of companies such as Video Arts, Longman Training and Melrose Films. There are signs that the generic market for training is fast spilling over into the education and what is termed the 'edutainment' sector, as well. Educationalists have already toyed with a variety of systems while more than Pounds 10m of government funding has been spent in the last five years on attempts to bring interactive media into the classroom or the lecture theatre. Suddenly, things have started moving again, with products like 'The World of Numbers' videodiscs and a CDTV-based project called 'Global Maths,' targetted towards the National Curriculum. Education and the blend between education and entertainment ('edutainment') also form the core of many consumer-orientated CD-I and CDTV catalogues. Point-of-sale multimedia has been slower to take off in the UK and Europe, as was the use of more conventional media, such as video. Mr James Roper, director of the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) believes that potential customers have been confused by the technology - 'there has also been a horrendous failure rate with pilot projects, because people didn't realise the complexity of what they were getting into,' he adds. With more than 500 interactive retailing pilot projects started worldwide, but a handful of success stories, Roper is, if anything, understating the problem. But there are success stories. In the UK, Zanussi has increased sales (up by 30 per cent over three years), and boosted brand awareness and market share by using interactive p-o-s in nearly 600 white goods stores. In Denmark, the estate agency, Home, has increased its market share from 15-23 per cent since installing an IBM-based system in 120 of its outlets. In Germany, 550 pharmacists are plugged into the Tele-Apotheke through-the-window marketing system; and in the US Sears Roebuck has publicised the fact that it expects to make annual savings of Dollars 50m by cutting 7,000 staff and replacing them with p-o-s systems and interactive multimedia ordering kiosks. All this activity so far represents only the tip of an iceberg. If the analysts' predictions are to come true then more than Dollars 5bn worth of new applications will need to come on stream in the next four years. That seems unlikely, but may not be impossible, for the latest multimedia communications systems being experimented with by high-flying corporations are multi-faceted, very large and relate to businesses' operational cores. It is worth considering one case in point: in California, Pacific Bell recently experimented with a networked multimedia information and training system, linking 10 sites. Designed to replace 'old' information delivery systems using video and printed materials, the new Employee Knowledge Link used a Sun fileserver and workstations connected by ISDN telecom lines to carry voice, music, sound effects, text, animated images and stills. The technology used was significant - 'we considered using CD-ROM,' the project leaders told a US conference held in April, 'but because the time and cost-concerns with creation, distribution and storage, we decided it was not the ideal solution.' Yet the core nature of the experiment was, if anything, more significant. Having already started to break down geographic, temporal and cost boundaries, multimedia communications could soon make an impact on the barriers erected between corporate departments, changing the way businesses are run, as well as the means by which they communicate.</p>

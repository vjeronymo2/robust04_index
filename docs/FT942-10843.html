			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Mortgage lenders warn Portillo Mortgage lenders could tighten their lending criteria, putting recovery in the housing market at risk, unless the government makes it clear it does not intend to restrict further the availability of mortgage support to people on social security benefits, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has warned. In a letter to Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary, the council says that further curbs on the benefit would lead to higher levels of arrears and repossessions.</p>

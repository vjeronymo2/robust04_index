			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / International Company News: Italian engineer slumps to L23bn PRE-TAX profits at Sasib, the Italian precision engineering company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir group, collapsed to L23.3bn in the first half of this year from L61.1bn in the same period of 1991. Sasib, which has expanded rapidly through acquisitions, often of loss-making companies, blamed the fall on a 11.4 per cent drop in turnover to L322.8bn (Dollars 252.4m) and the fact that a higher proportion of sales in the period comprised low-margin items. The company claimed the plunge in first-half earnings was not indicative of prospects for the full year. By the end of last month, turnover had reached L449bn, thanks to strong sales in July and August, leaving the total for the first eight months down by only 3.3 per cent against the same period last year.</p>

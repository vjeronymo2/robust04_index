			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Frenkel, doctor of economic sciences, under </F> the rubric "Forecast": "Russia's Industry in May"]    [Text] The year 1994 saw the most profound decline in  production in industry in the postwar era. According to  analysis, cuts in the output of industrial production for the  first four months of 1994 should come to 26 percent. In May, the  situation will not change: the decline in production is going to  continue. Dropping especially sharply will be the output of  production in most branches of the machinebuilding complex (in  many cases by 50-60 percent), the timber, woodworking, and  cellulose-paper industry (by 30-40 percent), the production of  building materials (by 30-40 percent), the output of complex  household technology (by 40-50 percent), and light industry (by  25-50 percent). The least significant cut will occur in the  branches of the heating and energy complex (by 5-6 percent,  except for oil production). A production decline will be  observed for more than 90 percent of the types of production put  out.    The index of the physical volume of industrial production  output in May for Russia as a whole will be 0.721, i.e., the  decline in production in comparison with May 1993 will reach  27.9 percent. The number of worker days in May 1994 will be 1  more than in 1993--19. The average daily volume of output of  industrial production will decrease in May by 29.7 percent.    To a significant extent, the drop in production in the first  quarter took on a structural character. Production output was  basically determined by solvent demand, which depended almost  entirely on the financial status of the enterprises. That  status, which has continued to deteriorate due to the ongoing  payments crisis, has been conditioned by the production glut,  prolonged halts in production, social tension that arose as a  consequence of delayed payment of salaries to workers, etc.  Thus, according to data from Russia's Goskomstat [State  Committee for Statistics], as of 1 March 1994, overdue  indebtedness to suppliers on the part of purchasers totaled  14,049 billion rubles [R], having increased in one month by 27.8  percent. In May, overdue indebtedness will increase once again.  Overdue indebtedness for the payment of funds for wages and  other monetary payments to workers in the enterprises and  organizations of industry increased in March by R266.9 billion  (25.6 percent) and as of 1 April had reached R1311.1 billion. In  May, this indebtedness is unlikely to decrease.    The drop in production in the branches of the heating and  energy complex as a whole will be insignificant; moreover, in  many ways it can be explained by the influence of the seasonal  factor. The manufacture of electric power in May will decrease  overall by 0.3 percent and will reach 66.4 billion kilowatts  (kw) per hour. The decline in production will be conditioned by  manufacturing cutbacks on the part of atomic energy power plant  by 14 percent and hydroelectric power plants by 4 percent. At  the same time, the production of electric power at thermal  electrical power plants will increase by 4 percent.    The situation in the coal industry will remain complicated.  In May 1994, coal mining will drop in comparison with 1993 by  1.4 million tonnes (6 percent) and will reach 23.7 million  tonnes; the mining of coal for coke 4.5 million tonnes (83  percent).    Gas production will increase for May by 3 percent and come  to  53.2 billion cubic meters. The relatively prosperous state of  affairs in this branch is connected, on the one hand, with the  significant gas reserves in deposits being exploited and, on the  other, with the increase in gas exports.    The coal mining industry finds itself in the most difficult  situation. Use of the oil well exploitation fund has  deteriorated. The proportion of nonactive wells in the total  exploitation fund increased from 15 percent in December 1993 to  18.5 percent in March 1994. In the first quarter of 1994,  serious difficulties arose for oil-producing enterprises with  respect to the sale of crude oil to oil refineries, which led to  a partial halt in production or even a complete halt for more  than 14,000 oil wells. According to analysis, for this reason  the cuts in oil production in the first quarter amounted to  about 4.5 million tonnes, or 34 percent of the total decline in  production.    Oil production in May will drop in comparison with 1993 by 5  million tonnes (17 percent) and will be 24.1 million tonnes. The  decrease in oil production and the cut in purchases of it by  oil-refining enterprises is causing a lowering of its primary  processing by 18 percent, which in turn will lead to a decline  in the production of gasoline by 11 percent, diesel fuel by 18  percent, and furnace fuel oil by 17 percent.    The well-established trend of dropping production in ferrous  metallurgy will not change in May. The basic reason for the  invariability of this trend is the decline in solvent demand for  most types of metallurgical output. A complicated situation is  taking shape around providing the branch with raw materials and  fuel. The mining of iron ore in May will be cut by 9 percent.    In machinebuilding in May the decline in total production  will strengthen and exceed 50 percent. There will be cuts in  production output for 93-95 percent of the types of output  included in the periodic statistical accounts. For nearly half  of them, the decline in production will exceed 60 percent. As  before, the branch is in an extremely difficult financial  situation: as of 1 March the overdue indebtedness of purchasers  for machinebuilding output acquired totaled R2,517 billion,  having increased in one month by 10 percent. The chief influence  on the cuts in production in the branch is the decrease in  purchasers' solvent demand.    On the brink of a complete halt are enterprises in  agricultural machinebuilding. In the first quarter, tractor  output amounted to all of 18 percent of the 1993 level, 16  percent for tractor trailers, and 4 percent for grain-harvesting  combines, primarily due to a lack of solvent demand. As a  result, tractor output will come to only 12 percent of the 1993  level, 3 percent for tractor trailers, and 4 percent for  grain-harvesting combines.    The situation will not improve in transportation  machinebuilding. The output of long-range diesel locomotives  will be cut by 50 percent, long-range electric locomotives by 40  percent, long-range freight cars by 73 percent, long-range  passenger cars by 28 percent, and trolley-buses by 44 percent.    The short-sighted price policy of automotive construction  enterprises led to a sharp drop in demand for domestic-made  automobiles. As a result, since December 1993, there has been a  monthly drop in the output of passenger cars. Nor will May be an  exception, when their output will drop in comparison with May  1993 by 11 percent. The output of buses will drop by 3 percent.    A significant cutback in production output is expected for  machine-tools (by 45 percent), forging-pressing machines (67  percent), spinning machines (52 percent), looms (80 percent),  bulldozers (63 percent), excavators (37 percent), and roller  bearings (36 percent).    In the chemical and petrochemical industry the drop in  production will continue in May. Enterprises' financial  situation will deteriorate. As of 1 March 1994, the overdue  indebtedness of purchasers of chemical and petrochemical  production totaled R1,962 billion, having increased in one month  by 29 percent. In May the growth in indebtedness is unlikely to  decrease.    In the timber, woodworking, and cellulose-paper industry the  drop in production will continue in May. Equipment in the branch  is extremely worn out, and a shortage of manpower is observed in  timber cutting. Meanwhile, the available raw material and  productive potential is being used inefficiently. The load on  production capacities does not exceed 35-40 percent, and in  connection the equipment at most enterprises stands idle as much  as 60-70 percent of working hours. Like other branches of  industry, this branch finds itself in a difficult financial  situation: as of 1 March 1994, overdue indebtedness of  purchasers totaled R547 billion, having increased in one month  by 15.4 percent.    In the building materials industry no revival is forecast in  May. As in the previous months of 1994, solvent demand will  continue to decrease for many types of output of the branch. As  a result, cement production will drop by 37 percent, asbestos  cement by 61 percent, asbestos cement pipes and couplings by 17  percent, building brick by 29 percent, prefabricated reinforced  concrete by 33 percent, soft roofing materials by 50 percent,  and window glass by 46 percent.    In forecasting volumes of output of complex household  technology, it is essential to bear in mind that toward the end  of 1993, on one hand, there was market saturation by  domestic-made goods put out and, on the other, a rapprochement  between prices for them and the prices for higher quality  imported goods. This led to a drop in demand for domestic-made  household technology in 1994, which caused a sharp decline in  production. Thus, the output of refrigerators and freezers will  drop in May by 21 percent, washing machines by 40 percent,  vacuum cleaners by 54 percent, tape recorders by 64 percent,  radios by 58 percent, televisions by 25 percent, sewing machines  by 64 percent, and bicycles by 70 percent.    The output of detergents will decline by 51 percent.    In May for the first time in the last half-year, there will  be a drop in the output of cotton fabric by 26 percent. This  will be connected with the fact that many enterprises in the  cotton branch have processed almost all the reserves of cotton  fiber that had been held in reserve in the country and for which  no payment had been made. As a result, cotton suppliers have  halted their supply to most enterprises.

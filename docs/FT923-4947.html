			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Psion shares tumble as advance to Pounds 1m fails to impress City ENCOURAGING sales of its new series 3 electronic organiser helped Psion lift profits from Pounds 270,000 to Pounds 1.05m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. However, the market had been hoping for Pounds 1.2m and expressed its disappointment with the USM-quoted portable computer manufacturer by knocking its share price down 21p to 93p. The City was also disappointed with a 43 per cent improvement in first half sales to Pounds 16.5m - Pounds 18m had been expected. Earnings per share rose to 3.16p (0.08p) and the interim dividend is held at 1p. Mr David Potter, chairman, blamed the lower-than-expected profits on the recession which is still depressing UK sales - especially among corporate customers. As a consequence, the HC range of portable data capture devices failed to live up to best expectations. Pre-tax profits were only 6.5 per cent of sales while 10 per cent had been anticipated. However, Mr Potter announced two potentially significant deals. The group is to supply Motorola of the US, the world leader in radio telephone systems, with HC computers fitted with integral radio modems. The devices will be able to transmit data over public data networks enabling, for example, sales executives to maintain contact with headquarters while travelling. It will also supply Acorn, the UK leader in schools computers, with the series 3, modified for use by secondary school students. Mr Potter thought the contracts would result in sales of only a few thousand machines to begin with, but that the potential for portable data communications devices was large. Analysts are predicting full year sales of Pounds 35m with pre-tax profits of about Pounds 2.5m.</p>

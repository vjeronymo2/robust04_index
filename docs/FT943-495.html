			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / IMF World Economic Outlook: UK told to cut public spending targets The IMF last night told Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, that he should cut public spending targets in his November budget to increase the credibility of Britain's economic policy. Mr Michael Mussa, director of the IMF's Research Department, also warned that further UK interest rate increases would be needed at some point following this month's half percentage point increase in bank base rates. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the Fund said expenditure restraint was critical to the government's objective of eliminating public borrowing by the end of this decade. It said that the decisions taken in last year's two budgets to consolidate the UK's fiscal deficit had already brought a sizeable reduction in both actual and structural deficits this year. 'Reducing nominal spending ceilings in the upcoming budget to reflect lower-than-expected inflation will be important to enhance policy credibility,' it added. The IMF's comments suggest that the government's control totals in 1995/96 and 1996/97 should be cut from the Pounds 263bn and Pounds 272.3bn agreed last November. The remarks could prove helpful to Mr Jonathan Aitken, the chief secretary, who is currently negotiating with spending departments to keep public spending for 1995/96 and subsequent years inside the government's limits. It is unclear how far the chancellor will be inclined to follow the IMF's advice. So far he has maintained that hitting the spending targets in this year's public expenditure round would be tough. According to IMF estimates, the government's consolidation plans should stabilise the UK's ratio of net debt to gross domestic product at about 40 per cent by 1997. The IMF painted a generally upbeat picture of the UK economy. It forecast it would grow by a real 3.3 per cent this year and 3 per cent in 1995 - well above the government's forecast of 2.75 per cent growth for each year. It said that output growth in Britain began recently to outpace potential. It estimated the output gap - a measure of spare capacity expressed as a percentage of GDP - at a relatively high 4 per cent, adding that it would be eliminated only in the medium term. However, it also predicted that inflation, measured by the government's 'underlying' measure of retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments, would average 3.1 per cent next year. That would be higher than the 2.5 per cent anticipated by the IMF for this year, and in the top half of the government's 1-4 per cent target range. In predicting a future interest rate rise, Mr Mussa told a news conference he was not talking in terms of weeks or months. However, some form of tightening of monetary conditions would be needed in the course of the expansion.</p>

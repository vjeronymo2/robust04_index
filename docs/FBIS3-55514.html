The prosecution is studiously silent about the defendants'  real "guilt" -- their participation in the protection of polling  places in Chisinau during the March 1991 USSR referendum banned  by the local authorities. In the two years they have been kept  in custody these three officers and one private have been  punished worse than for murder. They have been kept in Chisinau  detention centers in health-endangering conditions. On 6 June  1993 they were even put before the court with traces of beatings  on their faces.    During his imprisonment Major Vladimir Teterin has lost 20  kg  and has caught tuberculosis in its open form; several times he  has coughed up blood. The effects of the skull and brain injury  and contusion he received in Afghanistan are manifesting  themselves in Captain Vladimir Gram, the other paratrooper; he  is plagued by terrible headaches. The health of Major Sergey  Cherkasov and Private Andrey Khorkov has been wrecked.    It would be a mistake to think that the slow killing of  Russian officers and soldiers was carried out only at a time  when their fate did not attract public attention. In June the  court cynically refused to allow Chisinau's N. Pirogov  Association of Medical Workers to carry out an independent  medical examination of the detainees. Instead of stopping the  beatings and giving treatment for tuberculosis and the effects  of contusion they were sent for psychiatric observation, which  culminated in a finding as to their sanity. As regards Teterin,  the detention center doctor issued a piece of paper saying that  he is healthy and that it is apparently only a question of  "residual fluctuations in the lungs after a previous bout of  tuberculosis," as though what was staring him in the face was  not a man virtually on the brink of death. No appeals to the  law are of assistance. When asked 23 December by the judge  whether he had any complaints or statements to register, Maj.  Cherkasov replied in the negative: "No. Complaints are useless  because they don't give a damn about them here."    Representatives of public human rights organizations  continue  to be amazed by the cynicism of the people staging this court  spectacle. First, for some reason a military tribunal is trying  people who have never served in the Moldovan Army. Second, the  judge, Captain Vladimir Timofti, is clearly trying to drag out  the court examination. On 22 December the court session was  canceled on a humorous pretext: The judge deemed the tribunal's  corridors too narrow to allow such dangerous criminals as the  alleged car thieves to be led along them. The next day the  corridors evidently seemed wider to the judge, but the  defendants -- each of them -- were brought under an escort of  two men armed with submachine guns and dogs. The entrance to  the tribunal was guarded by an entire platoon with assault  rifles. Who was the judge trying to impress?    At the session Maj. Teterin refused to give evidence,  demanding medical aid. The court's aim, Maj. Cherkasov stated,  is to discredit the Russian Army and portray the Russian  military as criminals. He bluntly accused the court of carrying  out the government's orders and refused to recognize it.    Capt. Gram expressed his solidarity with Cherkasov. He  demanded that an expert medical examination be made and accused  the detention center organs of treating the defendants brutally.  Every time I make statements the court does not like, he said,  I am transferred to conditions fit only for cattle, to a cellar,  to a cell in which 30 instead of 10 people are kept. Citing his  grave state of health, the captain refused to give evidence to  the court. It is hard to think of the military prosecutor as a  person who has not been initiated into the covert essence of the  "case," but having seen the defendants even he echoed the  defense's demand for them to be medically examined. The judge  refused on this occasion too, placing the attorneys in a state  of disarray. Viktor Magnushev, a Russian jurist and  representative of the Congress of Russian Communities, expressed  doubt about the advisability of his participating in the trial  given such an attitude by the court toward the defense's  arguments.    The Chisinau press is full of tearful bleating about the  trial in Tiraspol of a group of Moldovan Ministry of National  Security terrorists which killed two Dniester region  politicians. In two years no information about Moldovan  Justice's outrage against the persons of Russian military  personnel has found its way onto the pages of local newspapers.  The Russian Defense Ministry and the Russian judicial organs,  not to mention the Foreign Ministry, are apparently concerned  only with searching for a reason to cast four Russian soldiers  to the mercy of fate and Chisinau officialdom. The Dniester  region press has already expressed the suspicion that the  Chisinau leadership regards S.A. Cherkasov, V.Ye. Teterin, A.M.  Khorkov, and V.A. Gram as hostages, intending to exchange them  for the murderers convicted in Tiraspol. No denials from  Moldova have been forthcoming.    "Anything goes in relation to Russians! The West will  approve of everything we are going to do against Russians!"  These slogans, which for five years now have been quietly  voiced in editions of pro-Romanian newspapers and sometimes in  local corridors of power, can be read between the false lines of  the indictments and the admissions obtained by the investigation  by recourse to threats and violence. Only a firm word from  Moscow can stop what are in many respects reprisals which have  already been carried out against Russian military personnel.  Are the Russian power structures capable of doing this? The  Russian soldiers in the Chisinau torture chamber continue to  hope so.</p>

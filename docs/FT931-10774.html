			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Clifford shares leap on approach SHARES IN Clifford Foods, the dairy products, fruit juice and food group, yesterday soared 93p to 513p before settling back to 505p on news that it had received an approach that might lead to an offer for the company. Analysts speculated last night that a hostile bid would have to find support among the family, board members and their associates who control some 56 per cent of the shares. However, the news of the approach comes at a time of much activity in the dairy sector in the run-up to the abolition of the Milk Marketing Board in 1994. Also, Clifford announced in October a 60 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 2.55m) for the first half of 1992. According to analysts, there are several companies which could be courting Clifford. The favourite appears to be Unigate: the dairy products and food group is said to have made little secret of its desire to expand its liquid milk manufacturing operations. Clifford's Home Counties base would strengthen Unigate's underweight position in the market in the south-east of Eng-land. Other names being suggested in the London market yesterday included Avonmore Foods, the acquisitive Irish dairy group, and the Danish concern MD Foods. Other UK companies mentioned included Northern Foods, although such a move would probably trigger monopoly problems. Analysts suggested a price tag of about Pounds 50m for Clifford.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Santa Fe Gold undergoes transformation - A look at the changes which have promoted the US gold producer Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation was virtually unknown to international investors a year ago. But since then it has emerged as the sixth-largest producer of primary gold in North America. In addition, it has listed 14.6 per cent of the company on the New York Stock Exchange on terms which gave it a total value of nearly Dollars 2bn, and immediately became an important element in the new Financial Times Gold Mines Index. Its parent, Santa Fe Pacific, the railways group, is to distribute the remaining 85.4 per cent of the gold company to shareholders on September 30. From then on Santa Fe Gold will have no big controlling shareholder but its equity will be widely held in North America and Europe - about 7 per cent of the company was snapped up by European investors in the recent share sale. Santa Fe Gold includes some of the assets Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, acquired with Consolidated Gold Fields of the UK and swapped in June last year for Santa Fe's coal and aggregate operations. That deal transformed Santa Fe Gold into a producer with an anticipated 1994 gold output of 900,000 troy ounces. It also has among the lowest costs in the world: Dollars 187 an ounce cash costs and Dollars 267 total costs in the last reported quarter. In North America only American Barrick, the Canadian group, has lower costs. And, like American Barrick, Santa Fe Gold has one of the biggest gold reserves in North America, amounting to 14.1m ounces. However, these were estimated using a gold price of Dollars 400 an ounce, which some analysts feel was optimistic. With gold at Dollars 350, Santa Fe Gold's reserves fall to about 12.3m ounces. Santa Fe Gold, with headquarters in Albuquerque, New Mexico, has about 1,500 non-unionised employees and three mines. These are: Twin Creeks (a combination of Hanson's Chimney Creek and Santa Fe's Rabbit Creek merged to produce the third-biggest primary gold mine in the US) and Lone Tree, both in northern Nevada, and Mesquite in southern California. It is one of the biggest holders of mineral rights in the western US, controlling more than 6.8m acres of private mineral rights, including more than 1.8m acres in northern Nevada where most US gold is produced today. Mr Dick Zitting, Santa Fe Gold chairman, recognises that investors in gold companies look for growth and measure that growth by ounces produced. He can promise no immediate large increase and says output will be static for the next year or so. There are projects in the pipeline but it is taking longer to bring them into production - the permitting process in the US is now a long, drawn-out affair, he points out. Santa Fe Gold intends to grow mainly by its own exploration efforts, Mr Zitting insists. Both the old-style Santa Fe Gold and Gold Fields had good exploration records and the merger produced an experienced exploration team of 140 people. 'You get so much more added value when you find your own gold rather than buying it from someone else,' he points out. Nevertheless, 'we recognise that to maintain output or grow we will have to make acquisitions'. Santa Fe spent Dollars 22m on exploration last year and will spend between Dollars 25m and Dollars 30m in each of 1994 and 1995. About 75 per cent will be spent in the US and the rest in other countries where the group is searching for gold, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Uruguay. Mr Zitting says exploration efforts outside the US will gradually build until spending there accounts for about half the budget. Santa Fe Gold has agreed a joint venture with Codelco, the state-owned Chilean group, on the Cerro Coya gold property near El Salvador. This project, high in the Andes next to Homestake's El Hueso mine, will be drilled when the spring weather comes to Chile. Back in the US, Mr Zitting suggests Santa Fe Gold will by the year-end decide whether to go ahead with the Mule Canyon advanced exploration project, acquired in the Gold Fields exchange. This is 12 miles east of Battle Mountain, Nevada. Last year Santa Fe Gold spent Dollars 11.3m developing its mines and this will rise to Dollars 12m in 1994. The 1994 capital budget is about Dollars 75m, including Dollars 14.2m to complete the Lone Tree mine expansion. Since 1992 the company has spent Dollars 112m on this scheme, which enables it to extract gold from refractory (difficult) ores at Lone Tree. Most of the money went on an autoclave - similar to a huge pressure cooker - used to oxidise ore. Mr Zitting says the autoclave, completed in February, is 'going like a jewel' and already processing at 110 per cent of rated capacity. The project lifted Lone Tree's annual gold output to 200,000 ounces and increased the mine's life by nine years to 14 years. Santa Fe Gold is now considering putting a similar autoclave into operation at the Twin Creeks mine at an estimated cost of Dollars 200m over two or three years. Mr Zitting points out that Santa Fe Gold might not be able to recover up to 57 per cent of the reserves at Twin Creek without the autoclave so 'it would have to be very harsh circumstances for us not to go ahead'. The Dollars 235m net proceeds of the recent share sale have been used primarily to repay Santa Fe Gold's debts. It was left with Dollars 22m cash. Pro forma accounts for 1993 show net income of Dollars 43.2m or 34 cents a share. The company produced 847,000 ounces of gold and sold 825,000 ounces at an average realised price of Dollars 377 an ounce. A gold hedging programme enabled the company to do better than if it had sold its metal on the London Bullion Market where the average last year was Dollars 360. Hedging will continue, 'when deemed appropriate', says Mr Zitting. At March 31 it had sold forward 646,000 ounces at an average price of Dollars 395 an ounce and also bought 'put' and 'call' options on another 127,500 ounces. Mr Zitting says Santa Fe Gold's capital outlays this year can be covered from operations. And it intends to pay a regular dividend of 5 cents a share.</p>

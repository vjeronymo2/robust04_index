			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F> Karin Beindorff; Kinkel's location unspecified -- live]    [Text] [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali has asked NATO to prepare air strikes. What do you  think this means in practical terms?    [Kinkel] This means that we will probably have a NATO  session  tomorrow or Wednesday [9 February] at which we will discuss what  can and should be done. If you don't mind, I would like to say  first of all that what has happened in Sarajevo is really  terrible and cannot be justified in any way. We do not know who  fired this dreadful shell. It was very probably Serb aggressors,  but no one knows for sure. Now we do indeed have a situation  where the whole world is demanding that action of a military  nature be taken. However, this must be considered very  carefully, and I assume that we will be doing this in Brussels  today.    [Beindorff] In your view, Mr. Kinkel, do the UN resolutions  passed to date cover military intervention?    [Kinkel] It is true that in asking NATO to make preparations  for air strikes on artillery positions around Sarajevo,  Butrus-Ghali is basing his action on Resolution 836, according  to which force may be used to safeguard protected zones.  Sarajevo is such a protected zone.    [Beindorff] Yesterday, Mr. Kinkel, you are reported to have  telephoned your counterparts about policy toward Bosnia. I  asked at the start what was the prevailing mood?    [Kinkel] That's right, I was on the telephone until the  early  hours speaking to virtually all my European colleagues and, in  particular, to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. I  cannot go into detail here about everything that was discussed.  However, there were still differing views. Those with troops  on the ground, the French and the British, are naturally  concerned that air strikes could be a danger to their own troops  and we all anxiously ask the question: What happens afterwards,  after the air strikes? Might the whole situation deteriorate  even further? The military leaders are in fact more inclined to  warn against air strikes. We will be discussing all this in  Brussels and, of course, in all this we Germans are, as in the  past, not the best ones to give advice with regard to the former  Yugoslavia and not the ones who should be particularly pushing  for action, because if things get serious, the way things look  we probably won't be involved.    [Beindorff] Does this mean, Mr. Kinkel, that it is to be  expected that for instance London, a NATO member, will prevent  military intervention by NATO by using its veto?    [Kinkel] No we cannot say this at the moment. I have spoken  to Douglas Hurd and I know his view very well. They are above  all concerned, and I say this again, about their own soldiers.  Let us wait. I know all this looks unsatisfactory, and people  think that one could resolve the situation overnight with air  strikes. If it was easy, it probably would have already  happened.    [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, will you support military  intervention aimed at selected targets in Brussels today?    [Kinkel] I will be as cautious as I have been so far, simply  because naturally the partners will be asking: Will you Germans  be involved? They know our constitutional situation, they know  the political situation, which will probably not produce a  majority in the German Bundestag in favor of intervening in the  former Yugoslavia, even if we are able to do so  constitutionally. I mean we will not obstruct things. We will  help wherever we can within our possibilities. I am happy that  we are contributing in the humanitarian field, that injured  people have been brought to us.    I assume, I'll say it again, that there will be a NATO  meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. The final command for an  intervention has to come from Butrus-Ghali. Everyone agrees on  this. It is interesting for me what the U.S. President said and  also what the U.S. secretary of defense said in Munich yesterday  and the day before. President Clinton has pointed out again  that everything should be tried to make progress by peaceful  means. He once again committed himself to an arms embargo. He  did, however, also hint at air strikes or military intervention  and committed himself to American support in such possible  military action.    [Beindorff] Does this mean in your view that lifting the  arms  embargo as requested again by President Izetbegovic is  impossible?    [Kinkel] I think this will be impossible for as long as  there are ground troops out there, simply because the Europeans,  some of whom -- like the French -- are there with several  thousand men, are concerned that the hostilities will spread if  the arms embargo is lifted. We, the Germans, have always been  very close to the American position, because we were  particularly concerned with protecting the weakest, the Muslims,  and possibly giving them the chance to defend themselves.    However, I understand very well the concern of my European  partners who have ground troops there, and who say they will be  in danger. Generally, in the case of air strikes, the use of UN  ground troops would become very doubtful. This is what the  French and the British in particular are concerned about. The  French have around 6,000 men out there. We should exercise  restraint with our advice, we have no one out there.    [Beindorff] How great is, to your knowledge, the actual  danger to the ground troops, the blue helmets in Bosnia?    [Kinkel] This is an issue that has to be judged from a  military point of view. I cannot judge this very well myself.  I take advice on this, and the military people warn us. They  say that the Serbs will probably react even more brutally if air  strikes were carried out, no one knows. So it is a double-edged  sword. If you read the German press today then, as far as I  know, you see divided opinion. One side says something must  happen, the other side says for God's sake be careful. Respice  finem -- look before you leap -- what will happen afterward?    It is very easy to say military intervention is needed, but  the matter is very difficult and the consequences need to be  considered very carefully. I can only say again and again: If  it was as easy as all that the international community, the UN,  NATO would have reacted in the past and met what has now become  an an emotionally understandable demand by many people. Indeed  people are angry and sad at the same time that it has not been  possible to bring this problem under control.    [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel you say this needs to be carefully  considered, but there has been sufficient time to consider  whether military measures are an option or not. Why is this  decision being put off again and again, always with the same  justification?    [Kinkel] It is very simple. Those who do not have ground  troops there are in favor of air strikes, and those who do have  ground troops call for caution. Those who have ground troops  there are the ones whose interests have to be taken into  account. After all they have so far been the bravest of all,  they have demonstrated commitment. We cannot let them down now,  their military interests and their concerns need to be  considered above all. And those who do not have ground troops  there, like ourselves, should be cautious. The Americans know  why they are being cautious, because they are not prepared to  send ground troops there, which I understand. They want to use  air strikes alone. It is all not that simple.    [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, Bosnia mediators Owen and  Stoltenberg  are now calling for a separate peace plan for Sarajevo. Do you  support this idea?    [Kinkel] Of course, I support anything that can lead to  peace  including such a separate peace plan. I wanted to point out  earlier, Ms Beindorff, that at the same time -- and I refer back  to what the U.S. President has said -- we must try to do  everything possible to reach a peaceful settlement based on the  European plan of action which was, in turn, based on the  proposal put forward by [French foreign minister] Juppe and  myself. I do not know whether this will succeed.    We must not give up hope here either, and I am pleased that  despite this awful attack in Sarajevo Izetbegovic intends to  come to the talks to show that they obviously haven't given up  either. However, I am disappointed, and I'm making no secret of  this, that there has been no solution to date, although  positions are relatively close on most issues. This is  obviously because the warring parties presently are not willing  ultimately to make peace. However, nothing will happen if there  is no willingness on the part of the warring factions.    [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, you know that there is growing  international criticism of the role of Lord Owen in particular  in the peace negotiations. Do you share this criticism? Is  Lord Owen still representing the interests of the European Union?    [Kinkel] Yes, I do not consider it just and right to condemn  Lord Owen one-sidedly for his extremely difficult work and his  mediation attempts. He is doing an extremely good job --  together with Thorvald Stoltenberg who is representing the  United Nations in this regard -- and he is trying his very best.  All I can say here is who can do it better? It is terribly  easy to have a go at the mediators, the plans and everything  else, but levelling criticism from outside and having to find a  solution in practice are two very different matters and the  latter is by far the more difficult.    [Beindorff] Mr. Kinkel, the last question. What do you think  will happen when there are again no deeds but only statements?    [Kinkel] I hope that there will be more than mere  statements.  By the way, in this difficult area where, as I have seen myself  for months now, things inevitably go back and forth, I would not  like to answer hypothetical questions, but I would be pleased if  we can make decisions in Brussels today which would be useful  for the meeting of the NATO Council.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / After the peace, the fight for jobs: Northern Ireland has much riding on its investment conference More than 40 per cent of Northern Ireland's workforce is employed by the British government. Many of the jobs in the security sector - up to 20,000 - will be lost if the IRA and loyalist paramilitary ceasefires prove durable. The province's unemployed total of 100,000 would jump 20 per cent unless jobs are replaced. That is why so much is riding on the success of the international investment conference which takes place in Belfast on Tuesday and Wednesday next week. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is hosting the event and will be backed by US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown. Invitations have gone out to leading international companies, organisations which have contributed funds in the past, local political leaders and leading EU trade officials. Northern Ireland has an urgent need to attract inward investment and it is prepared to pay generous incentives - as the controversial Pounds 61m grant to help the textiles group Hualon set up a plant has highlighted. The Industrial Development Board, which dispenses grants, has a powerful array of lures to attract foreign companies. A Northern Ireland incentives package can, in theory, amount to between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of total costs - though in practice it is usually far less. The IDB claims that in 1993-94 the government contribution to new investment was 21.5 per cent for both domestic and inward investment. The IDB says that since 1986 overseas investment has totalled Pounds 1.6bn, involving 265 projects and creating 22,702 jobs. The gross cost per job assisted in inward investment promotions in 1993-94 was Pounds 27,424 - meaning Northern Ireland has one of the most expensive job creation programmes in the UK. The IDB argues that it is necessary to spend money. The image of violence has been a powerful deterrent to new companies, but the province is also perceived by many outsiders as having a peripheral position in the UK. It has a population of 1.5m and therefore a small domestic market. Its economy is poorly integrated with that of the republic and the Irish Sea separates it from the mainland UK market. In trying to sell the province to investors, Northern Ireland officials argue that there are other factors apart from grants and incentives which make it attractive and offset its remoteness. Industrial land costs Pounds 40,000 an acre compared with Pounds 185,000 in the English Midlands and upwards of Pounds 400,000 in London. Construction costs are much lower. According to European Commission figures an index of office construction costs puts Northern Ireland at 65 compared with 100 for Britain and 113 for Belgium. Residential property is cheaper too. A detached house costs Pounds 57,202 in Northern Ireland compared with an average UK price of Pounds 94,315. The workforce is educated: Northern Ireland has excellent schools, with a higher rate of A-level passes than any other part of the UK. Wages are 16 per cent lower than in mainland Britain. The province can offer 50 per cent cash grants for buildings - more generous than either Wales or Scotland. It can also offer cash grants for machinery and equipment, training and job creation. If a company wants to rent rather than build a factory there are grants for up to 100 per cent of rental costs for up to five years. There are also product development grants, marketing grants, and grants for relief on loans. Although the province is handicapped in comparison with the Irish republic by having to levy corporation tax at the UK rate, companies making taxable profits of less than Pounds 250,000 pay a 25 per cent rate. There are allowances for depreciation on machinery and equipment and for the construction costs of industrial buildings. However, next week's investment conference is likely to be hampered by the haste with which it has been organised. An official at the British consul general's office in the US said: 'When we got the guest list our first reaction was 'Wow] - we haven't got time.' US companies are drawing up boardroom budgets and preparing for Christmas at this time of year. We think it is too short notice.' A guest list of US corporate 'possibles' was sent to the consul general only in early November by the Industrial Development Board and invitations began to be sent on November 18. When the speeches are over, those who have been able to accept the invitation will be invited to visit factory sites and companies which have already chosen to set up in Northern Ireland. They will be bombarded with statistics on why Northern Ireland rather than the Irish republic, Scotland or Wales is the best place in the British Isles to invest. And their hosts will be hoping they have done enough to overcome the problems that peace will bring.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Competitors for inward investment  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- There are variations in the level of assistance available.

RSA is discretionary, but                  in development areas grants can                  amount to 30% of project costs.                  The average is 15 to 20% in                  development areas and 10 to 15%                  in intermediate areas.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wales            Regional selective assistance               9.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- North of         Regional selective assistance              11.3 England  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Wage levels*            Cost of industrial land                 (average weekly earnings)            (per acre)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Northern         Men Pounds 313                    Pounds 40,000 Ireland          Women Pounds 232  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Scotland         Men Pounds 330                    Pounds 130,000                  Women Pounds 237  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Wales            Men Pounds 308.3                  Pounds 100,000                  Women Pounds 231.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- North of         Men Pounds 321.8              In non economic zone England          Women Pounds 225.2            areas, with planning                                                permission for office                                                blocks Pounds 50,000  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * UK Average: men Pounds 352.5, women Pounds 252 Sources: Regional Trends.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel today appointed Pavel Varvarovsky the fifteenth and the  last justice to the Czech Constitutional Court. Justice Minister  Jiri Novak and Constitutional Court Chairman Zdenek Kessler  attended the ceremony. In his address Havel voiced satisfaction  that the Constitutional Court had been filled. He said the  Court was a guarantee that the state would serve all its  citizens and would exercise its power in the framework of the  law. Through its decisions about the constitutionality of laws  and other legal norms the Constitutional Court significantly  influences the legislative process of their preparation and  drafting, Havel said. The Constitutional Court helps to ensure  that the law in the Czech Republic is brought into harmony with  the legal norms of the European Union, he added. Minister Novak  also expressed satisfaction that the Constitutional Court was  complete and could start working within its full complement.  Under the Czech Constitution the President appoints justices to  the Constitutional Court with the agreement of the Senate, an  upper house in the Czech Parliament. As the Senate has not yet  been filled, its functions are carried out by the Chamber of  Deputies.    Varvarovsky was born in 1945 in Ceske Budejovice, south  Bohemia. He worked as a judge in the Supreme Court Trade  Division. He is a permanent resident of Brno, where the  Constitutional Court is situated. In the Constitutional Court  he will be acting as an expert in administrative law, the field  he was engaged in while working in the Supreme Court.    The law on the Constitutional Court took effect last June.  The first 12 justices were appointed by Havel in July, after  their candidacies were approved by parliament, and the other two  in November. Havel submitted a proposal to Parliament this  January for appointing the fifteenth and the last justice.    The Constitutional Court is designed to protect the  Constitution. It is composed of 15 justices who are appointed  for the time of 10 years. The Constitutional Court justice  starts exercising his duties after swearing an oath to the  president.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall on extended weakness in US THE EXTENDED weakness of Wall Street, and further worries over Maastricht left bourses generally weak yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS lost another 1 per cent as the CAC-40 closed down 24.89 at 1,928.84 in good turnover of FFr3bn. News that St Gobain was not planning a capital increase failed to filter into the market before the close, and the shares finished down FFr12.00 at FFr554.00. Michelin had a poor day, off FFr7.60 at FFr207.40, having earlier touched FFr204. Some analysts said that this may have been due to the poor performance of Goodyear's stock in the US overnight. The dropping of Eurotunnel from the FT-100 index in the UK depressed the stock, which closed FFr1.50 lower at FFr34.20, with the warrants 5 centimes down at 23 centimes. Meanwhile the theme park operator, Euro Disney, had a slightly better day, gaining 20 centimes to FFr114.20. Schneider was again hard hit, losing FFr16.00 to FFr666.00, with the authorities saying that the recent sharp fall in the shares was to be investigated; and Casino's acquisition of therival stores group, Rallye, continued to weigh on sentiment as its shares dipped FFr7.80 to FFr157.90. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez was one of the few stocks to buck the trend, gaining FFr6.00 to FFr543.00 following positive remarks at its annual meeting and news that it was to sell its stake in Havas. FRANKFURT drifted lower again, the DAX ending down 7.95 at 1,781.81 after a 0.84 decline to 710.99 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose to DM5.3bn from DM4.9bn. Big losers on the day included Lufthansa, Karstadt and MAN, down DM4.50 to DM125.50, DM15.50 to DM623.50 and DM4.80 to DM395 respectively. Karstadt produced the main news, including lower profits, flat DVFA earnings and optimism on 1992 prospects, but this came to nothing as Deutsche Bank's research unit lowered its earnings expectations for the retailer. Lufthansa has been weak on the North Atlantic airfare price war and MAN, said dealers, was a victim of the futures market. Meanwhile, the flurry in Continental ended again, the tyremaker's shares falling DM5.50 to DM272.50. MILAN suffered further embarassment as its computer-based trading system, on which 35 issues are listed, was turned off for the rest of the week by the regulator, Consob, following repeated breakdowns in the past few days. Activity was further disturbed by a partial power failure, which switched off the automatic price transmission system. The Comit index fell another 3.70 to 477.37. ZURICH was led down by financials again, the SMI index of leading shares losing 19.2 at 1,868.8, but the pharmaceuticals group, Roche, stood out against the trend with its bearers steady at SFr4,750 and its certificates only SFr10 lower at SFr3,310, ahead of a meeting with analysts today. Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs said that the broker had put Roche certficates on its recommended list, liking a 1992 p/e of 15.7 against an estimated eps growth rate of 20 per cent per annum over the next five years. Mr Tracey says that Roche has the new products to give it double-digit volume growth prospects,and scope for an improvement in profit margins. STOCKHOLM's banks recovered by 1.4 per cent as the Affarsvarlden General index fell another 6.3 to 953.5. Handelsbanken, whose results are due next week, rose SKr2 to SKr52.50. The forestry group, SCA, closed SKr2 lower at SKr113 on profits lower than expected. However, the real estate and building sector was the main loser with a drop of 3 per cent. OSLO saw various degrees of disappointment in the results from the insurer, Uni Storebrand, the holding company, Orkla, and the shipping company, Bergesen, which fell NKr2 to NKr45.50, NKr2.50 to NKr160.50, and NKr1.50 to NKr106 respectively as the all share index closed 2.32 lower at 437.86. COPENHAGEN hit a new low for the year, writes Hilary Barnes, the all share index falling 2.60 to 325.29. The index has lost 6.5 per cent since Denmark's referendum last week. Dealers said that banks led the fall yesterday, because of the steady drop in bond prices. However, gloom over insurers after UNI Storebrand's bad first-period results sector pushed down Baltica, which fell DKr55 to DKr525; and Hafnia, an earlier target for Uni's pan-Nordic ambitions, fell another DKr5 to DKr115. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index closed 0.8 lower at 129.6. Over-capacity in aluminium saw Hoogovens and Hunter Douglas both registering falls, of Fl 1.10 and 20 cents respectively to Fl 57.10 and Fl 68.80. A large sale of Philips stock by a foreign investor left the shares 50 cents down at Fl 37.70, while KLM weakened 60 cents to Fl 39.30 as the transatlantic price war begins to bite.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - Jun 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1169.60  1169.59  1166.57  1165.18  1164.63  1161.69  1161.78  1162.52  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1170.14    Day's Low  1161.15  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Jun 10     Jun 9     Jun 8      Jun 5     Jun 4       1174.58   1174.96   1177.48++  1181.18   1184.92+  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). ++Partial +Indicative.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

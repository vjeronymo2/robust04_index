			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Japanese trust bank to cut staff by 10% MITSUBISHI Trust and Banking, the Japanese trust bank, plans to cut its workforce of 7,200 by 10 per cent over the next three years in an attempt to improve core profitability. The country's seven trust banks, which face mounting problems with property-related lending, have just reported an average 26.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended in March. Mitsubishi Trust said the bank wanted to cut administrative costs by about 10 per cent over the next three years, when trust bank profits are likely to be under pressure unless there is a sudden turnround in the ailing property market. However, Yasuda Trust and Banking said yesterday the banks had not yet begun to include interest due on loans from their trust account in calculating interest revenue, and insisted that its most recent profit statement included only interest already received. For the first time, the banks announced their non-performing loans, which ranged from Y73.1bn (Dollars 664.5m) at Nippon Trust Bank to Y561.8bn at Mitsubishi Trust. However these figures do not necessarily provide an accurate measure of the relative pressures on the institutions. Mitsubishi Trust is regarded as one of the stronger trust banks, and the Japanese definition of non-performing loans gives banks a lot of flexibility in calculating their totals.</p>

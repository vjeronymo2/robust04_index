			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the NTV newscast] </F>   [Text] South Africa's imminent incorporation into the  Nonaligned Movement [NAM] and Cuba's election to one of the vice  presidencies of the summit were two of the main results of the  meeting for experts which concluded on 30 May, prior to the  ministerial meeting. Diplomatic sources report that the  meeting's agenda was approved and that its essential points  include an analysis of the international political and economic  situation and of the NAM's role for the immediate future.  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak will officially open the 11th  NAM summit on 31 May. The summit will conclude on 3 June.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina had a very busy  agenda  while the summit was taking place at the Cairo Conference  Center, meeting several officials including the Arab League  secretary general and the Zimbabwean, Vietnamese, Iraqi, and  Burmese foreign ministers on the need to strengthen the NAM and  the principles that gave birth to the Movement. The common  denominator at these meetings was to give continuity to the  positive results the NAM has experienced under Indonesia's  presidency since the Jakarta summit.    Just minutes ago, Robaina met Honduran Foreign Minister  (Ernesto Rojas), who conveyed a friendly greeting from President  Reina. (Rojas) announced during the meeting his forthcoming  visit to Havana in response to Robaina's invitation.</p>

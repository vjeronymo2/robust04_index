			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA DISSIDENTS REPORTED TO FLEE VIA 'ESCAPE TUNNEL'  </P> <P> Declaring that an underground "escape tunnel" has been established for Chinese  dissidents, local and Western media sources here reported today that  pro-democracy student leader Wuer Kaixi and two key Chinese intellectuals have  been smuggled out of China and into this British colony.  </P> <P> Wuer, who emerged at the forefront of China's crushed pro-democracy movement  after criticizing China's hard-line Premier Li Peng on government television at  the height of the protests, fled to safety four days ago through the nearby  Portuguese colony of Macao and then into Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Standard  newspaper reported.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old leader from Beijing Teachers University is among 21 students on  the government's most-wanted list, which was created after the government and  army suppressed the protest movement in the capital on the night of June 3-4.  </P> <P> The newspaper also reported that hundreds of soldiers from China's People's  Liberation Army were moved to checkpoints near the Macao border last week.  </P> <P> In a separate report, the Associated Press in Hong Kong said that three other  dissidents also have fled China through the "underground railroad."  </P> <P> One of them is Wan Runnan, a businessman who heads an innovative Chinese  computer firm and who has close links with reformers centered on former  Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang. No public charges had been leveled at Wan,  but he was believed to be on a list of Zhao supporters targeted for arrest. The  report said he had left for the United States.  </P> <P> Another is Yan Jiaqi, leader of the Beijing Independent Intellectuals Assn.,  which also joined in the movement. He escaped through Hong Kong and is now in  France, the AP said, quoting a student activist and an unnamed diplomatic  source in the colony.  </P> <P> The third, AP said, is Li Lu, a student from Nanjing University who is also one  of the 21 student leaders being sought.  </P> <P> Hong Kong officials, who have allowed huge weekly demonstrations supporting the  Beijing student movement and permitted the placing in a downtown park of a  replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue that served as a rallying point in  Beijing's Tian An Men Square, had no official comment.  </P> <P> Hong Kong's usual practice for those fleeing the Chinese mainland for the  island citadel of capitalism is to seek to prevent their entry. Military and  police patrols, aided by listening devices, try to catch those crossing the  border. If caught, the would-be emigrants are detained -- about a dozen are  arrested daily -- and returned to China within 24 hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Peace Corps Delayed  </P> <P> In another development, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Beijing said this morning  that China has decided to postpone the start of a U.S. Peace Corps program in  China.  </P> <P> Twenty Americans had been due to arrive this summer to prepare to teach English  at Chinese institutions in the fall. The agreement had been seen as a  breakthrough marking growing friendship between the two nations.  </P> <P> Those ties are now strained by U.S. criticism of China's fierce crackdown on  pro-democracy protesters and by an American decision to grant refuge in the  U.S. Embassy in Beijing to astrophysicist Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent  pro-democracy advocate, and his wife. The postponement of the Peace Corps  program appeared to reflect these tensions.  </P> <P> "We got a letter from the China Education Assn. for International Exchanges  (the Chinese host for the Peace Corps program), and they've told us that for  the time being, they want to postpone the program," U.S. Embassy spokesman Andy  Koss said. "It's not canceled. . . . We don't know how long this will be  postponed."  </P> <P> Koss declined to comment on whether the action was linked to the Fang issue.  "We really don't have any indications of what's behind it," he said. "We just  got a very straightforward note that they want to postpone it. Anything else is  conjecture."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the official New China News Agency announced Monday evening that the  Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's nominal  legislature, will meet beginning June 29 to endorse the decisions taken by the  party leadership.  </P> <P> In the first few days after the bloody June 3-4 crackdown that ended seven  weeks of escalating pro-democracy protests, some reformist students and  intellectuals in China had hoped that the National People's Congress could  serve as a power base for a reformist resurgence.  </P> <P> Monday's announcement, however, made it clear that delegates to the Congress  will operate under severe restrictions. "It is decided that the Standing  Committee meeting will be guided by the principles adopted" at a Saturday  meeting of the Party's 170-member Central Committee, the agency reported.  </P> <P> The Congress, according to the report, is scheduled to:  </P> <P>  -- Endorse the various decisions taken by the Communist Party on Saturday,  including the elevation of Shanghai party chief Jiang Zemin to replace Zhao as  general secretary.  </P> <P>  -- Listen to a report on the quelling of the student-led pro-democracy  protests, which are officially referred to as "the counterrevolutionary  rebellion."  </P> <P>  -- Pass a law on rallies and demonstrations.  </P> <P>  -- Listen to a report on the final accounting of the country's finances in  1988.  </P> <P> In its campaign to push its version of events, the government invited some  foreign correspondents to a tour of Tian An Men Square directed by Gen. Li  Zhiyun, one of the commanders of the June 3-4 assault. Li said he had "no  regrets" about any deaths and injuries inflicted during that night.  </P> <P> In a pair of seemingly contradictory comments, he said, as he had on a previous  tour for correspondents, that "the whole process was nonviolent -- no one used  guns" -- but also that "when our troops moved to the square we received  persistent resistance." He added: "Individuals even used guns to kill our  warriors. We were forced to defend ourselves. This group of people got what  they deserved."  </P> <P> He agreed that some innocent people "may have been wounded" when troops battled  their way to reach the square, but he said people had been warned not to go out  on the streets that night.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Americans  </P> <P> Chinese authorities also took action against two Americans -- one a teacher and  one a student -- who have been at Nankai University in the coastal city of  Tianjin, east of Beijing. The two have been ordered to leave China by Friday  because of alleged involvement in the recent wave of demonstrations, a U.S.  Embassy spokesman said this morning.  </P> <P> Mark Radicia, a teacher at Nankai University, and Helen Qubain, a student  there, were questioned several times by police before the expulsion order was  issued, according to the embassy spokesman.  </P> <P> "It seems to boil down to that they were expelled for 'disturbing social  order,' " said Koss, the spokesman. "What it really means is they're accused of  being closely involved in the student demonstrations."  </P> <P> Koss said the two came to Beijing and spoke with consular officials at the  embassy on Monday. He said he did not yet have information about their ages or  hometowns.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, an explosion aboard a train late Monday killed 20 people and  seriously injured 11 in the suburbs of Shanghai.  </P> <P> The official New China News Agency said early today that an-on-the-spot  investigation showed that the explosion, in a passenger compartment, was caused  by dynamite. A Shanghai official called the incident an accident, but few other  details were available.  </P> <P> Fineman reported from Hong Kong and Holley from Beijing.  </P></p>

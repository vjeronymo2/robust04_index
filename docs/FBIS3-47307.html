			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Pheuanchai: "32 Years of Bravery of the </F> Anti-Aircraft Corps"]    [Excerpts] Faced with an ever more chaotic situation  because of the air war of the imperialist invaders, the  anit-aircraft unit--although at that time it was still not  organized as an official unit--still provided a way of putting  up an ever fiercer resistance while responding to the situation.  It countered enemy attacks in a timely fashion and defended the  skies and green mountains.    In the 1960's the neo-colonialists developed a secret scheme  to invade Laos. They rashly tried to escalate the war against  the patriotic Lao people hoping to wipe out the Lao people's  revolutionary forces completely. Therefore the unit carried out  the orders of the supreme headquarters of the Free Lao [Neo Lao  Itsara] Army and on 18 October 1961 the first anti-aircraft  battalion cleared the skies using bullets against the iron of  the imperialist invaders. This unit was established at Ban Nong  Nam Village in Pek District of Xieng Khouang Province. It was  commanded by Comrade Chan and Comrade Simeuang. It was organized  in three companies. Two companies were armed with 37 mm guns,  and one company was armed with 12.8 mm guns.    After the battalion was established, it was assigned to  fighting the enemy in the air. The first company fought the  enemy in the air over Khang Khai (Xieng Khouang). Every bullet  hit the aircraft and penetrated the enemy iron. The F-101, which  was a very modern aircraft just produced by the Americans,  immediately turned over and over and fell to the earth in Xieng  Khouang. This was the first aircraft shot down in Indochina.  When this first aircraft spun to earth, it created a great deal  of fear in their air force. The LPA in contrast was very proud  and decided resolutely to follow the leadership of the party. On  24 June 1994 [as published] the battle to liberate the Plain of  Jars started. The anti-aircraft battalion worked with the  infantry to block the enemy's routes for retreat from the Plain  of Jars at Meuang Soui, Lat Ngon, Phou Ba, Khoua Lek and Khoua  Nam Yen. In November 1964 the enemy attacked Phou Kout with its  air force, artillery, and infantry. The enemy force was many  times larger than ours. The battle to defend Phou Kout was  fought back and forth fiercely with the two sides less than 25  meters apart. The Lao revolutionary combatants were very  patriotic.    Comrade Phimmason, a young combatant, used a 12.8 mm gun to  hit a T-28 and then used a light machine gun to fire into the  enemy columns advancing on the ground. This comrade fighting  alone delayed a great number of the enemy in order to allow his  entire platoon to attack enemy aircraft. In the end this comrade  sacrificed his life bravely on the battlefield. When the battle  was over, this brave unit had shot down five T-28's and damaged  seven. They had also destroyed three armored vehicles and killed  28 of the enemy.    In the course of its duties which included constant fighting  from 1961 to 1973, the unit took part in the liberation of the  nation as follows: it fought against aircraft 1055 times, shot  down 285 aircraft of all types, fought 49 battles on land, and  captured, killed and caused to surrender many hundreds of the  enemy. They destroyed many weapons and much military equipment.  They defended more than 4,000 people in Pek District and Khoun  District. They built a revolutionary support base in four  villages and built a 160 member guerrilla network. For these  accomplishments the unit received 14 unit decorations and 41  individual decorations. One comrade was named a national hero,  and two comrades were decorated for diligence. [passage omitted]    During the period from 1973 to 1993 the battalion achieved  more successes to further mark its 32 year tradition. It fought  against aircraft two times hitting five aircraft and shooting  down two. It captured two pilots and killed five of the enemy.  Now the cadres and combatants in this battalion are impressed  with these traditions of bravery and are prepared to dedicate  their lives to their revolutionary duty in the new era.</p>

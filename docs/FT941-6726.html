			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Bonn increases pressure on Elf to build refinery The German government and privatisation authorities yesterday stepped up pressure on Elf Aquitaine, the French energy group, to honour a contract to build an oil refinery at Leuna, east Germany. Failure to go ahead could cost Elf DM1.5bn (Pounds 580m) in breach-of-contract penalties, and oblige it to give back a chain of more than 600 east German petrol stations, warned a senior official of the Treuhand privatisation agency. Although a spokesman stressed Elf had not been given an ultimatum, and that discussions were continuing, interventions by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, underlined Bonn's anxiety. The passing of the deadline yesterday for starting construction brought the row to a head. Government officials confirmed Mr Kohl had written to Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, while Mr Rexrodt said the government insisted Elf should fulfil its contractual obligations. Mr Rexrodt said the risk of losses in the start-up phase was not enough reason for withdrawal since Elf seemed to believe the project would be profitable in the long term. The French company, committed to two-thirds of the DM4.5bn construction cost in a joint venture with the German Thyssen group, wants to cut its interest to 35 per cent. It is understood to have unsuccessfully asked BP, Shell and Esso to take a stake. Thyssen has also said it will not increase its holding. 'It is turning into a war of nerves,' one French analyst said. 'Elf has clearly found it hard to find any takers for a stake and German patience has run out.' BP was one of the disappointed bidders in the July 1992 sale of the existing, run-down Leuna refinery, which was made more attractive by the inclusion of the profitable Minol petrol station chain, with its estimated 25 per cent share of the east German petrol market. While the British group was prepared only to refurbish the old 11.5m-tonne-a-year refinery, Elf, in a pact with Thyssen's engineering interests, won the day with an offer to build a new 10m tonne plant. Mr Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand were both personally involved in the agreement, which was hailed at the time as a triumph. However, Mr Philippe Jaffre, Elf chairman since August who steered the group through privatisation last month, is determined to reduce his company's participation as part of cost-cutting measures. Elf's profits fell more than 80 per cent last year to FFr1.1bn (Pounds 120m) and Mr Jaffre plans the sale of non-core assets and tighter financial controls on investments. Elf said yesterday it was still seeking industrial partners, but refused to comment on the state of negotiations or on the threats of sanctions.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> CHARTING A PILGRIM'S PROGRESS IN THE '60S  </P> <P> Godspeed: Hitchhiking Home by Laurel Lee (Harper &amp; Row: $15.95, 251 pages)  </P> <P> Sometimes Ann and I try to tell our 12-year-old son, Adam, what it was like in  the '60s. We talk about our generation's restless but earnest striving for good  values and good works -- but we are circumspect about the sex and the drugs.  Now I can safely hand him a copy of Laurel Lee's "Godspeed" -- an antiseptic  account of the life and times of a searcher after beauty and truth in Berkeley,  Haight-Ashbury, Venice, Mexico, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska during those  tumultuous years.  </P> <P> Lee reminds us of the silliness, the vanity and the sometimes dangerous  promiscuity -- moral, spiritual and intellectual -- of the '60s. She is  generous in opening herself and her foibles to our scrutiny, a gesture that is  childlike both in its innocence and its self-absorption. And she is successful  at capturing some of the absurdities of the hippie ethos.  </P> <P> "Why do I need to remind you of our agreement?" asks her companion, a bad poet  and a rather fainthearted student of enlightenment, as they seek out a forest  retreat where they will fast and meditate. "Look, Laurel, it's no drugs or  food, and we stay here until we blast through all these things that our flesh  is always demanding."  </P> <P> "I want you to know that I am dying and all the significant meals of my life  are now passing before my eyes," replies Lee, who depicts herself as funnier,  more alert and vastly more articulate than the mythic "hippie chick."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Reverence for Language  </P> <P> Indeed, we are continually reminded that Lee is not a hippie chick at all. For  one thing, she carries a joint in "the natural pocket in my bra between my  breasts" -- an article of clothing that one did not often find in the Haight in  1967. More important, she has a reverence for language -- and especially the  language of spiritual revelation -- that prefigures the work she will do as a  writer. (She is the author of several well-regarded inspirational books about  her own struggles against disease and despair: "Walking Through the Fire,"  "Signs of Spring" and "Mourning Into Dancing.") Even as a young woman on the  road, she is given to bursts of overwrought metaphor and overheated simile that  reveal her powerful literary ambitions.  </P> <P> "Getting a restaurant job is a lot like hitchhiking," she tells Richard Lee,  the man she will eventually marry, after they embark on a plan to make money  for a pilgrimmage to Alaska. "I just step into the slow-moving vehicle of a  cafe and make words like an extended thumb asking for employment."  </P> <P> "Godspeed" is assembled from the diaries that young Lee kept during her  odyssey. Her prose is ornate, lyrical, sometimes overwritten; her focus is  firmly fixed on herself, her husband and their spiritual progress. We are  given, too, an assortment of her rather too whimsical line drawings and a  scrapbook of grainy black-and-white snapshots that confirm our impression of  Laurel and Richard as happy wanderers of the hippie era who happen across God.  </P> <P> Indeed, we are not terribly surprised when Lee idly picks up a Bible -- her  customary reading, a book of Zen aphorisms, is fortuitously out of reach --  and, after glancing at a few passages from the Sermon on the Mount, she is  moved to a moment of spiritual revelation.  </P> <P> "I feel the garment of Christ being pulled over our shoulders," she says of her  husband and herself at that moment. "I am new, and what we are together can be  a new configuration of a couple too."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'May I Make the Angels Smile'  </P> <P> Her calling does not dampen her sense of whimsy, her rhetorical excesses, or  her preoccupation with herself: "I'm your daughter, at duty," she prays. "Put a  dove on my shoulder. May I make the angels smile." Indeed, we hear very little  more about her beliefs, or the impact of her faith on her lfe, as she and  Richard persist in wandering up and down the Pacific Coast.  </P> <P> In a sense, all of "Godspeed" is a latter-day pilgrim's progress, although I  never really understood what Lee and her husband were seeking. Alaska is their  destination and their cherished goal -- they imagine that they will homestead  in the frozen wilderness -- but, along the way, the Lees encounter drug dealers  and "Jesus freaks," Salvation Army missions and hippie encampments, and their  own illusions.  </P> <P> "We are both candidates for never-never land," she reflects. "I remember it's  the second star to the right, and Peter Pan took the boys there who never  wanted to grow up."  </P> <P> "Godspeed" is, of course, only one tiny fragment of the collective generational  crisis that we call the '60s -- and a rather odd fragment at that. Lee largely  neglects the other variations on her theme of self-discovery and  self-expression in the '60s -- radical politics, for example, are wholly absent  from "Godspeed," and so is any encounter with the sexual and chemical excesses  of that era. Even her treatment of self-revelation through faith is somehow  unsatisfying. To Adam, and to any reader of Lee's book, I would say, yes,  "Godspeed" is part of the story of what it was like in the '60s, but it is not  the whole story.  </P></p>

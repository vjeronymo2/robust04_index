			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Unigate in Co-op milk deal UNIGATE, the dairy, food processing and distribution company, has agreed to purchase for Pounds 17m some of the milk businesses of the Co-operative Wholesale Society. The businesses cover 348 milk rounds in London, the south-east and Cornwall together with a processing dairy in Penryn, Cornwall, with four depots. The purchase will add about 1 percentage point to Unigate's share of the liquid milk market in England and Wales, taking it to just over 13 per cent. Assets involved are valued at about Pounds 6m and there are 217 employees. The deal follows a previous in-fill acquisition by Unigate of Sussex Dairies last August. Mr Gordon Summerfield, managing director in charge of milk related activities, said the acquisition was in line with Unigate's strategy of 'buying dairy businesses which fit in with our existing operations'. He pointed out that said such acquisitions 'allow for greater efficiency both in processing and distribution'.</p>

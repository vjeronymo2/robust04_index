			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / World looks away as a sea vanishes: The environmental catastrophe of the shrinking Aral Sea On most summer nights three decades ago, a barge would dock at a tiny Uzbekistan fishing village, called 'Tiger's Tail' by the locals because of the way the spit of land arose in the southern Aral Sea. A makeshift screen would go up aboard the vessel, and bored fishermen would take a seat under the stars to watch a nightly offering of Soviet and foreign films. Today, ships like the old film barge stand askew, rusting in a dry harbour. Mangled fishing nets lie half-buried in the sand while the fishermen weave carpets, make bricks and tend livestock. The reason is simple: the village, whose real name is Uchsay, is now 50 miles from Aral's former southern shore. In a region of 3.7m people, Uchsay's 32 families are victims of an environmental disaster, one that scientists now believe may not begin to abate until the middle of the next century: the slow disappearance of the world's fourth largest inland body of water. The scale of the disaster has become so acute, and the local and international response to it so meagre, that once-hopeful western scientists are now looking merely to treat a resulting regional health crisis. Meanwhile, the soil in important surrounding farm regions of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan has become so saline that the vital local cotton harvest - whose rapid increase was a main factor in causing the problem - has itself been shrinking. 'There's not enough water to stabilise the sea,' says Professor Philip Micklin of Western Michigan University, the west's leading expert on the Aral. 'Maybe some time 50 years from now there may be enough water to bring it back. But I don't see them making the economic changes necessary in the next several decades to rehabilitate the sea.' The Aral sea began shrinking in the early 1960s, when the Soviet Union irrigated a hugely expanded Uzbekistan's cotton crop by diverting the feeder Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers from the Aral, whose length then measured about 220 miles. Uzbekistan did become the world's third-largest cotton producer, growing 5m tonnes a year, but then local people began noticing the Aral's shores receding. Today it covers half its former area, and has divided into northern and southern seas. By the end of the decade, according to forecasts, the sea will shrink to one-third its historic size and split again, creating northern, eastern and western bodies. 'We still had the sea at the beginning of the 1970s - it was navy blue,' says Ms Marinika Babanazarova, director of a cultural museum in the Uzbekistan regional capital of Nukus. 'Then it began disappearing, very quickly. We lost it before our very eyes.' The health consequences have been severe. Doctors say lung disease and tuberculosis are rife. 'One hundred per cent of our pregnant women have anaemia, and most give birth prematurely,' says Dr Andrew Vervihost, director of the mother and child unit at the Karakulpak Institute of Clinical Medicine, in Nukus. Infant mortality in Uzbekistan's region of Karakulpakstan, bordering the Aral, has soared. The scrawny cotton fields in the Uzbekistan village of Qaxiakiyakla illustrate the agricultural impact. 'Twenty years ago, the cotton came up to here on me,' says Mr Arzamurat Arzanov, placing a hand even with the centre of his shirt. Now the crop on Mr Arzanov's farm rises only to his shins. Uzbekistan appears to have shifted more planting to other areas as Karakulpakstan's yield has plummeted, so its cotton harvest has been stable in recent years at about 4m tonnes. But the Aral fishing industry - the former northern port of Aralskon on the Kazakhstan coastline once accounted for 10 per cent of the Soviet Union's entire catch - has been eviscerated. International attention to the Aral began during the Gorbachev era, but little organised assistance has come. Central Asia's governments, meanwhile, have behaved as though they have written off the sea. In March 1993, all committed themselves to depositing 1 per cent of their state budget into the 'Aralbank', a fund they created to resolve the disaster, but western and local officials say no money has yet gone into the account. Environmentalists now are focusing on cleaning up the Amu Darya, which, though little of it now spills into the Aral Sea, still provides most regional drinking water. The idea is to stop current practices in which raw sewage is dumped into its waters, along with tonnes of pesticides. Mr Khojamurat Khoshimov, whose father operated the former film barge up and down the Aral coast, stands on a bluff overlooking the old fishing village of Uchsay. He says most of his neighbours have moved away. Though he does not expect the waters soon to return to Uchsay's shores, he will stay put. 'No one wants to say his city is dying,' he says. So, with few alternatives, Mr Khoshimov has gone into his father's business, with one small adjustment - his mobile cinema plies local villages in a car.</p>

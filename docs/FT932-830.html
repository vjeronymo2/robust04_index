			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Campbell &amp; Armstrong loss warning SHARES in Campbell &amp; Armstrong yesterday fell 4p to 17p after the shop and office fitting group warned that it expected to incur after-tax losses of Pounds 3.5m for the year ended March 31. After omitting the interim dividend, no final will be paid. Last year's total was 2p and reported net losses came to Pounds 595,000. The company said that although the core shopfitting business returned to profitability, turnover and margins for the construction-related activities were seriously affected by the recession. Action had been taken to reduce overheads and the disposal and closure of some businesses should mean a return to profitability as economic conditions recovered, it added. Current order book was in line with budgeted expectations. The company said it intended to publish the 1992/93 results - which have been prepared under FRS 3 - on July 22. Also it planned to change the company's year end to December 31.</p>

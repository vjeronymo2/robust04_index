			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / GKN to resume supplies to Daf GKN, one of the biggest component suppliers to Leyland Daf, yesterday struck an agreement with the receivers to resume deliveries of all components to the beleaguered truck and van maker. GKN is the source of axles, prop shafts and other main components. Without them the truck plant in Leyland, Lancashire, and the van plant in Birmingham would have no prospect of resuming steady production to meet orders for several thousand vehicles which some customers, such as Royal Mail and Parcelforce, have so far refrained from withdrawing. Leyland Daf executives were hoping last night that the decision by GKN, one of the UK's biggest industrial groups, to resume deliveries would act as a catalyst to other suppliers to follow suit. About two dozen other suppliers have suspended deliveries. Hours before the agreement with GKN, employees from the Birmingham plant had travelled to Dunstable, Bedfordshire, where they staged a protest outside an AC Delco components plant in an effort to persuade the General Motors subsidiary to resume supplies of wiper motors. A spokesman for the receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of accountants Arthur Andersen, said hopes were now rising that 'something resembling full production' would be resumed at the van plant by the end of this week. The situation at Leyland is more difficult, however, with little prospect of more than completion of vehicles already on the assembly line. Meanwhile the receivers made redundant 80 of the 270 Birmingham-based staff still assigned to the Excel project, a joint venture between Renault and Daf to create a new range of vans. The move was expected to be the first stage in winding up the Birmingham end of the project, with Renault likely to announce shortly - possibly today - that it plans to proceed with the project on its own or that it has found a replacement partner.</p>

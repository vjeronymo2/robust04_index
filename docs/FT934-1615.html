			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / International Company News: Swedish health group's loss less than forecast ARJO, the Swedish healthcare group floated in Stockholm and London in October, has turned in a slightly smaller than forecast pre-tax loss for the year ended September 30. It lost SKr139.1m (Dollars 16.5m) against an estimated SKr140.9m and a pre-tax profit of SKr15.2m a year earlier. Turnover was SKr1.1bn against SKr809.1m. If the company had been floated for the full year, thus saving on interest and foreign exchange costs, it would have reported a pre-tax profit of SKr178.7m.</p>

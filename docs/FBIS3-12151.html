In the aftermath of the firing by one or more settlers at  the  Tomb of the Patriarchs, Israeli troops shot dead three  Palestinians in Hebron, three in the Gaza Strip, one in Nablus,  one in Jerusalem and a settler killed another man in the  Bethlehem area, Palestinian sources said.    Police said a Palestinian hacked to death an 80-year-old  Israeli with an axe near Tel Aviv and made off with his gun.    Maurice Eisenstadt was patrolling the streets of Kfar Saba  as  a volunteer in the civil guard. Several Palestinians in the  vicinity were arrested.    Doctors in Hebron and Jerusalem hospitals reported 113  people  treated for bullet wounds, most of them hurt in the mosque  carnage. The killer either turned his automatic rifle on himself  or was shot by someone else, the army said.    About 100 Palestinians were shot and wounded by soldiers in  the Gaza Strip, about a dozen them seriously, as trouble erupted  throughout the occupied territories.    In the Old City of Jerusalem hundreds of Palestinians staged  running battles with police and soldiers. Palestinian sources  said 47 were injured, most by rubber bullets or tear gas  inhalation.    Police said 13 members of the security forces were hurt by  the showers of rocks which rained down on them from the walls  and Temple Mount after some 80,000 Moslems attended prayers at  Al Aqsa mosque.</p>

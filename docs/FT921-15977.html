			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / North Korea takes steps to ease nuclear tension NORTH Korea yesterday told the International Atomic Energy Agency that it would sign a nuclear safeguards agreement this month, clearing the way for a significant reduction in tension on the Korean peninsula. Signature of the safeguards accord would involve opening nuclear facilities to inspection by IAEA experts. Earlier yesterday, demands for international inspections had been repeated in Seoul by US President George Bush, who said the US and South Korea would call off annual military exercises if Pyongyang took positive steps on the issue. Mr Bush, on the third leg of an Asia-Pacific tour which will end in Japan, where he arrives today, also emphasised the endurance of the US security commitment to South Korea and the Asia Pacific region. A statement from the IAEA in Vienna said Mr Chon In-chan, North Korea's ambassador to Austria, 'today informed the director general of the IAEA that his government will sign the Safeguards Agreement . . . pursuant to its obligation under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.' He said the agreement would be signed before the end of January and that early ratification of the agreement would follow. South Korea and the US believe North Korea is developing nuclear weapons. This is denied by Pyongyang. Belief that a nuclear bomb could be built at a plant at Yongbyon, 100km north of Pyongyang, within two years - far sooner than was previously thought possible - has made the issue a top priority for the western governments in recent months. South and North Korea last month signed a pact of reconciliation and non-aggression after 40 years of Cold War hostility. Seoul wanted the nuclear issue settled before both prime ministers meet in Pyongyang next month to sign a treaty banning nuclear weapons from the peninsula. The US has withdrawn all battlefield nuclear weapons from South Korea, but has said it will not withdraw some of the 40,000 US troops stationed there until North Korea ratifies the IAEA pact. Mr Bush reaffirmed his administration's commitment to the security of South Korea. He congratulated Mr Roh Tae Woo, the South Korean president, for the progress which has been made in easing tensions with Pyongyang. He said that while the emerging post-cold war era presented an opportunity for the US to restructure its defences, such as the closure of US bases in the Philippines, the US would remain 'a visible, credible security presence in the Asia Pacific region'. President George Bush yesterday called on South Korea to remove all non-tariff barriers to trade and liberalise its financial system, saying that doing business in Korea is still more difficult than it should be, John Ridding writes. Trade liberalisation has been a principal objective of Mr Bush's Asia-Pacific tour. He said Korea had made 'great progress in removing visible trade barriers over the last five years.' However there were still 'fundamental problems that stifle the ability of foreign firms to compete in Korea.' Mr Bush cited 'cumbersome customs procedures' and 'unjustified standards and regulations' as some of the difficulties facing US exporters. He also urged Korea's co-operation in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Korea's refusal to allow rice imports has been one of the obstacles to a successful conclusion of the negotiations. Anti-riot police stopped farmers from marching to parliament to protest at US pressure to open rice markets. The scattered protests were among several by students, farmers and dissidents demanding that Washington end pressure on Seoul to improve trade.</p>

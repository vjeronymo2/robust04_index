			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Rates soften PERIOD interbank rates eased marginally on the UK money markets yesterday after the  1/2 percentage point cut in the US discount rate affected traders' sentiment. A trader commented: 'I think the Fed rate cut has brought home the pure frustration of the fact that UK rates are far too high for the UK economy at the moment.' The key three-month interbank rate finished at 9 29/32 per cent, down from a previous close of around 10 1/32 per cent, while six-month money declined to the same rate. The easing was encouraged by a comment from Mr Horst Kohler, Germany's sherpa to the G7, that he was confident the government would create the conditions necessary for an early cut in German interest rates. Mr Kohler said government budget measures, the July 1 expiration of the solidarity tax, and a positive development in wage settlements had created the impulse needed for a slow-down in the rise of inflation. Sterling futures contracts were traded actively. The September contract was squeezed back up to levels last seen 2 1/2 weeks ago. It opened at 90.16, against Wednesday's 90.13 close, and rose in heavy trading to end 11 basis points ahead at around 90.27. This suggests the market is looking for another half-point cut in base rates sometime over the next 2 1/2 months. The December contract closed 11 basis points up at around 90.49. Money market operations with the Bank of England were relatively quiet. The shortage was eventually taken out, although traders were a little reluctant to part with too much paper, forcing the overnight rate to creep up to around 10 1/4 per cent. The Bank's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 950m but this was revised to Pounds 1bn in the early afternoon. The Bank operated once in the morning, buying bills totalling Pounds 42m. Later it purchased Pounds 275m of bills and provided late assistance of around Pounds 350m. The Federal Reserve added temporary reserves to the banking system with four-day system repurchase agreements. Economists said the action signalled a 50 basis-point reduction in the Federal Funds rate target to 3 1/4 per cent following the half-point discount rate cut earlier.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): S African worries lift platinum Platinum was the main beneficiary of a wave of buying that lifted precious metals prices in early trading on Thursday following the declaration of a state of emergency in South Africa. The London afternoon price fixing for the white metal - 70 per cent of which is produced in South Africa - was at Dollars 418 a troy ounce, up Dollars 8.50 from Wednesday and only Dollars 1 short of the 2 1/2-year high reached last August. The price was later trimmed by profit-taking but traders thought the bull run still had some fuel in the tank. 'We are powering towards Dollars 420, although we may not see it today,' one dealer told the Reuter news agency. He added that there was no sense in going short of platinum ahead of the elections being held in South Africa later this month. The gold market also responded to deepening concern about the situation in South Africa, but with the same lack of conviction that characterised its attempt on Monday to break resistance above Dollars 392 an ounce. Having faltered again on Thursday morning at Dollars 390 the price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 389.20 an ounce and closed at Dollars 389.75, up 35 cents on the week. Silver fared rather better. The 15-cent retracement that followed the abandonment on Tuesday of speculators' attempts to drive the price to Dollars 6 an ounce was all but recouped on Thursday morning; and at the London close it still stood at Dollars 5.71 1/2 an ounce, up 1 cent from last Friday but 3 3/4 cents below the 4-year high that it had reached earlier last week. At the London Metal Exchange speculators turned against the copper market in mid-week, eliminating most of the recent Dollars 80-plus rally. The metal's three months position closed on Thursday at Dollars 1,888.25 a tonne, Dollars 8.25 off the day's low but still Dollars 68.50 down on the week. The fall, most of which was suffered on Wednesday, came as little surprise to big copper consumers and merchants, who had been waiting for a 'technical correction', said Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. 'They were hoping the market would cool down a bit during the summer,' he explained, 'and were anxiously waiting to buy any and all price dips down from 86 cents a pound (Dollars 1.895 a tonne) to 80 cents (Dollars 1,763).' With demand for copper strong in the US and picking up in Europe and supply becoming 'something of a problem', he doubted that the price would go much below the latter level in 1994 and thought it should be back at 95 cents by the end of the year. Aluminium's supply/demand balance has also been improving and that helped the LME market to show more resilience to speculative sales this week than copper. The three months price closed on Thursday at Dollars 1,314.50 a tonne, down Dollars 18 on the week. US sellers sparked a big shake-out in the cocoa market, although there were no significant fundamental developments to justify the fall. At the London Commodity Exchange the May futures position touched Pounds 882 a tonne before ending at Pounds 893, down Pounds 40 on the week. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision last weekend to leave its output ceiling where it was appeared to be taken as the signal for traders to unload the cover they had taken against the outside possibility that the ministers would this time grasp the nettle of over-production. In consequence the June delivery position at London's International Petroleum Exchange was quoted at Dollars 13.38 a barrel in late trading on Thursday day, down 58 cents on the week.</p>

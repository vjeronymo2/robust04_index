			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY'S PROPOSED JAIL BOOKING FEE OF $183 DRAWS ANGER FROM CITIES;  </P> <P> BUDGET: STATE SLASHES FORCE THE COUNTY TO RECOVER THE 'FULL COST' OF JAILING  PRISONERS. BUT CIVIC LAYOFFS AND POLICE CUTS MAY RESULT.  </P> <P> Representatives of several Orange County cities emerged from a tense session  with county budget officials Thursday complaining that a proposed jail booking  fee would force layoffs and serious cutbacks in city services, including police  protection.  </P> <P> "It would be a financial disaster," said Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, who  did not attend the meeting but was told of the county proposal. "It would  result in complete chaos in our Police Department and would force layoffs at a  time when we've been adding officers."  </P> <P> "This would not only be a financial disaster for the city of Santa Ana, but it  would create a public safety crisis in Orange County," added Young, whose  concerns were echoed by outraged officials in other cities.  </P> <P> If the fee is approved by county supervisors in January, city and school  district police will for the first time have to pay for booking suspects into  county jails. And though city and county officials have discussed such a fee  for months, the county has developed new cost estimates that have increased the  proposed fee from $75.50 per inmate to $183.  </P> <P> Santa Ana, which would be hit hardest by the proposal, would lose more than $3  million over a full year, according to the county estimate presented to city  officials Thursday.  </P> <P> But Young said the cost would be more than twice that because county officials  underestimate the number of suspects Santa Ana places behind bars.  </P> <P> Santa Ana's police budget for this year is about $40 million. Young said the  city would lose about 20% of that if a $183 booking fee is imposed.  </P> <P> Even before the $183 figure was developed, city officials were in uproar and  had banded together to resist the new fee under the banner of what they called  Operation Budget Freedom.  </P> <P> Thursday, after they received official word of the proposed higher figure, some  city officials were angered and demanded answers for how the cost estimates had  jumped so dramatically.  </P> <P> Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. said: "I'm not going to stand still for  losing police officers or cutting services in our community because the county  has been hit with a cut in its budget from the state. I can't understand this.  They need to justify this to us."  </P> <P> Robert F. Dinsen, a councilman from Garden Grove, said layoffs, salary cuts and  the loss of a fire station could be the price that his city would pay if  slapped with the fee.  </P> <P> "It would have a devastating effect on the city," he said.  </P> <P> County officials have been sympathetic to those concerns, but they face huge  budget problems of their own, many of them caused by the state. Without some  sort of fee, the county could be forced to consider layoffs, the postponement  of a long-sought earthquake safety renovation or other cutbacks.  </P> <P> The jail booking fee arises from this year's budget debate in Sacramento.  Desperate to make up a huge shortfall, the state government dramatically  slashed funding for counties in its 1990-91 budget. To make up for the funding  it took away from counties, the state allowed them to begin charging fees for  jail booking and other things.  </P> <P> Under the new state law, counties are allowed to recover the "full cost" of  booking. Orange County officials, who have spent the past several weeks  studying the cost of placing inmates into the jail system, now estimate that  $183 per inmate would represent recovery of full costs, including medical  expenses.  </P> <P> "I understand that they (county officials) have a budget problem, but this is  crazy," said Bill Hodge, executive director of the Orange County division of  the League of Cities. "We want to try to help out, but first we were talking  about $75.50, and that was bad enough. Now staff's saying that the real number  is 2 1/2 times that."  </P> <P> Hodge added that city officials are confronting many of the same fiscal  problems faced by the county.  </P> <P> "They talk about the slowdown in the economy and the rising price of energy,"  Hodge said. "But we have the same problems. It's not like city cars don't run  on gasoline."  </P> <P> Vicki Stewart, an official in the county administrative office and one of those  who represented the county at Thursday's meeting, declined to comment on the  session.  </P> <P> "We're negotiating with them, and I'm not at liberty to release any  information," she said.  </P> <P> Other officials who attended the meeting, however, provided a copy of a county  document estimating the revenue that could be generated from imposing the fee.  All told, the $183-per-inmate levy would raise $9.7 million for the county over  one year, according to county projections.  </P> <P> If imposed in January and not made retroactive to July 1, the fee could add  $4.8 million to this year's strapped county budget and could help save several  embattled programs. But while that money would help the county out of a  difficult impasse, city officials say that the cost to their programs could be  devastating.  </P> <P> For some city officials, particularly troublesome is the concern that the  county may be artificially inflating its costs to give supervisors bargaining  room when they consider the matter in January.  </P> <P> "That's a possibility we have contemplated and that we have met to talk about,"  Brady said. "All I can say is I hope they're not playing games with us."  </P> <P> Times correspondent Jon Nalick contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> IMPACT OF JAIL BOOKING FEES  </P> <P> County budget officials want to charge cities for every suspect they place in  the Orange County jail system. To recover all costs, the fee would be $183 per  inmate, county officials say. City officials said that would cripple their law  enforcement budgets. At $183 per booking, fees for 22 county cities would  amount to:  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:2.00IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL

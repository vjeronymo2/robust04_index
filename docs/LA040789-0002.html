			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> S A N D I E G O AT LARGE  </P> <P> Boom Boxes Make for Bad Vibes in National City  </P> <P> National City has declared war on boom boxes -- those temple-throbbing portable  stereos that are the latest fad among the mobile and music-obsessed young.  </P> <P> Police are busily writing noise citations for boom-boxers who delight in  cruising through commercial and residential areas while raucous music blares  from theater-size speakers in the back of their mini trucks.  </P> <P> Fifteen young men pleaded guilty last week in South Bay Municipal Court and  were fined $71 to $118 each. More cases are pending, and four unrepentant  boom-boxers are set to begin trial May 12.  </P> <P> "We're not just talking about loud stereos," said Asst. City Atty. Linda  Harter. "We're talking about speakers that can be heard for blocks and blocks  and can actually cause hearing damage."  </P> <P> The crackdown, the first in San Diego County, began after residents begged  National City officials for action.  </P> <P> "We want the word to get out that you can't destroy the tranquility of our city  and get away with it," Harter said.  </P> <P> Police do not carry sound meters but instead use a three-block standard: If the  stereo can be heard from that far away, it's illegal. "Usually we hear the  music before we can even see the truck," said Lt. Craig Short.  </P> <P> After police write a citation, the stereos are seized as evidence. Only after  the court case is resolved are they returned. That, says Judge James Edmunds,  provides incentive for defendants to plead guilty.  </P> <P> A second conviction could lead to the stereos being destroyed as a public  nuisance, much like a rabid dog or a rickety building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Just Kidding, Folks  </P> <P> No one at San Diego City Hall is surprised that Councilman Ed Struiksma is  retreating from his previously staunch support for the planned 3,360-home  Miramar Ranch North subdivision.  </P> <P> A poll done by UC San Diego Professor Sam Popkin found that 68.5% of likely  voters in Struiksma's district oppose the project, 18.5% support it, and 13%  are undecided. No wonder Struiksma is not eager to have a referendum on the  same ballot on which he's seeking reelection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Land of Milk and Honey  </P> <P> More evidence that living in San Diego County can be quite rewarding:  </P> <P> * Local cow makes good: Moo-Moo the Cow, resident of Poway Stables, has been  selected as the new Cow Leatherton, the lip-syncing "spokes-cow" ("Go see cow,  go see cow . . . ") for the Leather Factory, a San Marcos and Kearny Mesa  furniture store.  </P> <P> She succeeds No. 1000. And no, No. 1000 has not been made into a sofa. She has  returned to the herd at Hollandia Dairy in San Marcos.  </P> <P> * Local atheists make bad, which is considered good: San Diego atheists Stephen  Thorne and Howard Kreisner have been named Most Hated Atheists of the Year by  the 19th annual Convention of American Atheists.  </P> <P> Thorne and Kreisner were given the award for suing the city of San Diego over  the Christmas displays in Balboa Park and opposing the presence of a cross on  Mt. Soledad. The award is given annually by the proprietor of an atheist  cemetery in Virginia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How About a Toga Party?  </P> <P> These are tight financial times for higher education, so colleges and  universities are increasingly looking to their alumni for help. And a little  pizazz at the alumni gathering can go a long way to keep the alums loyal to  dear old alma mater.  </P> <P> This Saturday, the Louisiana State University Alumni Assn. will hold its first  Crawfish Boil and Cajun Fais-Do-Do at Hospitality Point on Mission Bay.  Football coach Mike Archer and 2,000 pounds of live crawfish will be flown in  for the fest.  </P> <P> A week from Saturday, the Stanford Club of San Diego will meet at the La Jolla  Country Club for a luncheon and a lecture by Dr. Herant Katchadourian,  professor of psychiatry and behavioral science.  </P> <P> Katchadourian, selected four times as an outstanding professor and Class Day  speaker by Stanford seniors, will deliver his specialty: "Keeping Sex and Love  Alive."  </P></p>

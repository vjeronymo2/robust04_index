Protection shall be afforded to the operator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hydraulic equipment against falling or swinging objects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or cargo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Controls for hydraulic equipment must be so arranged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the operator is able to quickly disengage the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in an emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Hydraulically operated machinery must be fail-safe or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipped with a holding device to prevent uncontrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> movement or sudden loss of control due to loss of hydraulic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system pressure. A system is considered to be fail-safe if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> component failure will result in a slow and controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release of the load so as not to endanger personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Nonmetallic flexible hose assemblies must only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used between two points of relative motion, limited to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> least amount of length that would afford maximum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multidirectional movement of the equipment served.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Hose end fittings must comply with SAE J1475,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Hydraulic Hose Fittings For Marine Applications).

These letters and figures are to be in contrasting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colors to the background and at least one inch in height.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SWL is construed to be the load the gear is approved to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lift, excluding the weight of the gear itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) All wire rope, chains, rings, hooks, links, shackles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> swivels, blocks and any other loose gear used or intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used in cargo loading or unloading must be commensurable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the SWL rating in paragraph (a) of this section. This gear shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visually inspected by the vessel's captain or his designee at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequent intervals, and in any event not less than once in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each operating month.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In addition to the inspection required in paragraph (b) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a biennial thorough examination and proof load test, at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum of the SWL rating, shall be performed and witnessed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by competent personnel. The proof load applied to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> winches, booms, derricks, cranes and all associated gear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be lifted with the ship's normal tackle with the boom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or derrick at the lowest practicable angle. When the load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been lifted, it shall be swung as far as possible in both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) After satisfactory completion of the tests and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examinations required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, all results and notations together with the date and location of each shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be maintained and available to Coast Guard representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

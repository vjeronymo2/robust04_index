			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: NVQs one of best hopes for training in UK Sir, Your report, 'Bogus NVQ claims raise alarm' (June 1), is illuminating in that it highlights some of the stresses and strains in a national vocational qualifications system that has grown fivefold in volume terms in the last four years. With our many partners, we will weed out any alleged wrongdoings against us. We will also continue to improve the already elaborate systems that are in place for paying for NVQ achievement. We must not throw that baby out with the bath water, though. Paying for NVQs is a sensible approach. The idea that no results equals no money must be right. NVQs signify competence-based learning and are a vast improvement on the more subjective arrangements that preceded them. As such, NVQs represent one of the UK's best hopes for improving skills levels to allow us to catch up with our industrial competitors. Alleviating unemployment can only be achieved by raising Britain's competitiveness, and NVQs are an essential calibration of that process. They thus unify the economic and social challenges that all Training and Enterprise Councils are tackling with gathering success. Your report failed to mention the pivotal role of the awarding bodies. They give out the NVQ certificates and they need to take steps with the Tecs and others to ensure the legitimacy and bona fides of the NVQs. We must not allow the hard work of more than 500,000 trainees nationally who are aiming for NVQs to be corroded by the alleged activities of less than a handful of people.

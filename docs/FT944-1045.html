			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / A model in need of overhaul: UK privatisation policy, admired internationally, is under fire at home A decade after the flotation of British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom, the German state-owned monopoly, is lumbering towards the stock market. The DM15bn Telekom sale, one of the largest in the world, reflects the eagerness with which much of Europe and Asia is now embracing the UK model of privatisation. The transfer of state companies to the private sector, widely regarded as the essence of Thatcherism, remains one of the UK's most popular exports. The collapse of communism, which shook faith in the virtues of state ownership, has helped its international propagation. But in the UK, where sales of state-owned companies have raised nearly Pounds 60bn for the government since 1980, the philosophy is under attack. Customers of the privatised utilities feel that shareholders have been the real winners, with sharp rises in profits and dividends. That grievance has been deepened by steep hikes in directors' pay, notably the 75 per cent rise awarded last month to Mr Cedric Brown, British Gas chief executive. In the face of public and backbench criticism of privatised utilities, the government has recently shelved proposed sales of the Forestry Commission, Scottish water, and the Post Office. It is under increasing pressure to demonstrate that past privatisations have delivered the promised benefits. Some privatisations are now less controversial - including British Steel, British Airways, the Rover car-maker and Cable &amp; Wireless, the telecoms group. These all face competition in their markets, and have greatly improved their performance (while many of their international rivals are loss-making). However it is on the performance of the utilities - telecommunications, gas, electricity and water - that privatisation is judged by the British public. With some or all of their businesses effectively monopolies, they have not faced competitive pressures in the private sector. The UK privatisation model relies on independent regulators to curb their monopoly power and encourage economic efficiency through price controls. These controls have taken the form of capping annual price rises according to a formula linked to the retail price index (RPI); in most cases, these are 'RPI-X' formulae that hold rises below the rate of inflation. Of the four, British Telecom provides the most convincing case that the UK model works. A decade ago, BT warned 250,000 customers waiting for new telephone lines that it would not even suggest an installation date; now, it says it will install a new residential line within 48 hours. Before privatisation, telephones had to be rented from BT; now there are hundreds of models on sale in shops. Since 1984, the price of calls has also dropped by an average 40 per cent in real terms. Meanwhile, turnover has doubled to Pounds 13.8bn in the year to March 1994; the 90,000 fall in staff numbers to 150,000 has allowed pre-tax profits to treble to Pounds 2.8bn. The spur has been competition, largely from Mercury, the Cable &amp; Wireless subsidiary, as well as technological change and the price controls. But growth of competition was slower than expected, with some would-be rivals arguing that they were inhibited by the terms of access to BT's network. Privatising electricity presented greater challenges, in the absence of competition in the industry. Radical structural reform during the sale separated transmission and generation. The 12 regional electricity companies (Recs) that supply power to consumers were allowed to compete in generation, to a limited degree. That competition, together with price capping imposed by the regulator, has caused staff numbers and operating costs to fall sharply. But Mr Dieter Helm, director of Oxera, the forecasting group, argues that the savings should have been greater since the price of coal, gas, oil and uranium has fallen since privatisation. 'There is little evidence to show that customers are much better off,' he says. Moreover, the industry's restructuring proved unexpectedly controversial when it triggered a 'dash for gas', as generators built power stations using cheaper gas to replace coal as a fuel. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, backed the switch on the grounds that it cut costs and increased competition in power generation. But it also hastened the decline of the coal industry, creating a row over pit closures that harmed the image of privatisation. Despite those concerns, the restructuring of the electricity industry has spared its regulator many of the problems that have confronted his counterpart in gas. The government chose to privatise British Gas with an intact monopoly in transportation and supply of gas. The company was also the only UK buyer of gas from producers. While it has been forced to cut gas prices for smaller customers, initially it faced no price cap in the market for larger customers. The light regulation and unchanged structure were heavily criticised at the time of privatisation. Professor John Vickers, an Oxford economist, says the price controls on British Gas required 'lower productivity gains than those British Gas had previously achieved while in public ownership'.* The government has since introduced curbs on British Gas, including limits on its market share and a requirement to sell gas to competitors to allow them to supply customers. But these fall short of the changes recommended by the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which have both criticised the terms on which competitors can gain access to the British Gas network to deliver their gas to customers. The problems of gas regulation dwindle, however, when set beside those of water where it is impossible to introduce direct competition without creating competing networks of water pipes. The weight placed on the regulator to curb abuse of this monopoly is consequently higher. A complication in his task is that companies have embarked on a Pounds 40bn capital spending programme, to modernise pipes and sewage plants after decades of under-investment and to enable the the UK to comply with European environmental directives. Under the price formula set at privatisation, the costs are passed onto customers, and have pushed bills up by 5 per cent a year above inflation since 1989. Mr Ian Byatt, the water regulator, has criticised the Brussels standards, particularly those on drinking water, for being unnecessarily tough. He has also attempted to lighten the consumer's burden by restraining real price increases for the next 10 years to an average of 1 per cent. But as Professor Colin Mayer, an Oxford economist, comments, it has 'been difficult' for the regulator to determine the industry's cost of capital and to compare companies' efficiency. 'There are no easy answers', he adds. The mixed record of utility regulation indicates that insufficient ambition in creating competition when privatising utilities creates a troublesome legacy for the regulators - even if it helps sell the shares. As Prof Littlechild says: 'However well-intentioned and well-informed price control (is), effective competition is better.' Prof Littlechild originally believed that regulators would be able to introduce enough competition to allow regulation to wither away. However, as Prof Vickers argues, it is 'over-optimistic to view regulation as a stopgap until sufficient competition arrives'. In his view, the regulatory framework and pricing formula have 'so far survived reasonably well'. In recent reviews, regulators have tightened the price curbs, helping customers, at shareholders' expense (although they have satisfied neither customers nor companies). But problems remain. In particular, the terms on which competitors use the telecommunications, gas and electricity networks are hotly disputed. As Professor John Kay of London Economics, the consultancy, says, in the context of telecoms: 'It has been evident since the first stirrings of competition . . . that the terms on which entrants would be allowed access to the incumbent's network were critical'. It is clear that inadequate attention to such problems at the time of privatisation is the cause of many of the complaints about the privatised utilities. The forthcoming privatisation of British Rail is the next chance for the government to show whether it has learned that lesson.

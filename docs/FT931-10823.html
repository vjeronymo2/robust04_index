			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Heseltine laments oversupply of accountants MR MICHAEL Heseltine last night took a swipe at the priority Britain gives to accountants and lawyers - rather than encouraging craftsmen or technicians in the wealth-creating manufacturing industry. 'There is more to life than financial accounts,' the trade and industry secretary told the Scottish branch of the Institute of Directors in Edinburgh. Wealth creation meant encouraging engineers and scientists as well as entrepreneurs, he said. 'I wonder, however, whether the UK economy has got the balance right, between the teeth and tail of wealth creation. And among those offering support services I would include, for example, accountants and lawyers.' The comments from Mr Heseltine, who failed his final accountancy exams, prompted a response of weary indignation from Britain's bean counters, who have long been reputed to be boring and unimaginative. He said: 'In the UK we train only one third the number of craftsmen and technicians as in France and one quarter of those in Germany. And German industry is now worried that it cannot attract enough trainees.' His speech marked the increasing emphasis being put by Whitehall, including by Mr John Major, on a revival in manufacturing - a stark contrast to the focus on services under Mrs Margaret (now Baroness) Thatcher, the former prime minister. He described manufacturing as offering 'a key to our future success' and to international competitiveness. The bulk of world trade was in manufactured goods. Financiers needed to understand businesses and 'to look for rewards in the future, rather than the day after their investment'. Accountants were not unnecessary, 'but in the UK the classic route to the top has been via the City, parliament, and above all accountancy. The result? One study in the mid-1980s suggested Britain had over 120,000 qualified accountants - 20 times more per head of population than Germany or Japan. 'Valuable though the services of lawyers and accountants can be, they cannot survive in a vacuum,' he said. 'They need clients; clients that are successful.' In fact, Mr Heseltine's number-crunching abilities fell short yesterday. There are more than 200,000 accountants registered with the five principal professional bodies in the UK and Ireland alone. 'So speaks a failed accountant,' said Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, one of the UK's largest accountancy firms, referring to the fact that the trade and industry secretary did not qualify in the 1950s. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary and chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, who spoke cautiously as the institute reports to the DTI on regulatory matters, said comparisons with other countries were difficult. He said accountants controlled many highly successful companies such as BTR, Glaxo and Grand Metropolitan.</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEADLINE NEARS FOR PROPERTY TAX  </P> <P> Procrastinators, take note: The second installment of your annual property tax  bill is due at the Los Angeles County Tax Collector's office by 5 p.m., April  10. If you're mailing your bill, it must be postmarked by midnight of the same  day to avoid a 10% penalty.  </P> <P> Sandra M. Davis, the Los Angeles County treasurer and tax collector, said the  downtown branch of the tax collector's office -- at 225 N. Hill St. -- will be  open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. weekdays through April 10. It will also be open 9  a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Davis said taxpayers can get telephone assistance from 8 a.m.  to 9 p.m. weekdays through April 10 by calling (213) 974-2111. He said property  owners can call during off-peak hours for faster service.  </P> <P> Taxpayers who haven't received a tax bill or have lost it can call the same  number and leave a tape-recorded message. Davis said a substitute bill will be  mailed within 24 hours.  </P></p>

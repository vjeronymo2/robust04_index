			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "East Europe: EU Proposes Regular </F> Contacts at All Levels for Associate Countries"; as released by  Brussels TEXTLINE database]    [Text] The European Union [EU] intended proposing Tuesday  [8 March] evening at its first meeting under multilateral  political dialogue (whose principle was established by the  Copenhagen Summit of 21 and 22 June 1993) among itself and the  six "associated" countries of Central and East Europe, a series  of practical modalities enabling dialogue to develop with them  on questions of foreign and security policy. The Council of the  Union, responding to the call by the European Council of  Copenhagen with a view to establishing a "structured  relationship" between the Union and Central and East European  countries, suggests that:     -  in principle once a year, a  meeting between the presidents of the European Council and  Commission be arranged with the Heads of State and Government of  the associated countries;    -  the Union presidency should inform the  ambassadors of the associated countries after each European  Council;    -  as envisaged by the European Council of Copenhagen,  there be a special Council convened with the Foreign Ministers  of the associated countries once per presidency of the Union to  look at problems involving the CFSP [Common Foreign and Security  Policy]. The agenda will be thoroughly prepared in order to  cover matters of common interest with a view to arrive as much  as possible at common operational conclusions and to accommodate  specific concerns of the associated countries. Further meetings  in Troika format may also be held at the discretion of the  presidency;    -  once a presidency, as envisaged in Copenhagen, there  be a meeting between the political directors, in the form of a  special session of the Political Committee, preferable before  each regular European Council. At this level too, the  presidency will be able to convene meetings with the Troika on  specific issues of an urgent character;    -  the convening of  meetings at expert level with the associated countries, once a  presidency, including groups active in security, terrorism and  human rights. These meetings could also be held at Troika  level, and the agenda concentrate on questions of common  interest;    -  meetings at expert level with the Associated countries  once per Presidency will be extended to other groups including  security, terrorism, planners and human rights working groups.  These meetings may be in Troika format, or with all partners  present immediately after regular sessions. In every case the  agenda should be organised so as to focus on matters of common  interest;    -  in appropriate cases, the Associated countries will be  invited through an agreed mechanism publicly to align themselves  jointly with European Union declarations on a particular  subject;    -  when certain demarches are made by the Troika,  Associated countries could be invited to support them;    -  the  Associated countries could be invited to associate themselves  jointly with the implementation of joint actions, if  appropriate;    -  cooperation with the Associated countries in  international organisations and in the run up to and during  international conferences should be intensified. They will be  invited to coordinate their position with the European Union  whenever appropriate;    -  to facilitate coordination between  themselves and the European Union, the Associated countries are  invited to appoint Shadow European Correspondents. In addition  they should be invited to nominate contact points for CFSP  issues in their missions to the European Union which should  establish regular contacts with their counterparts in the Member  States' missions and the Commission as well as with the Council  Secretariat;    -  regular contacts between the EU missions in third  countries and at headquarters of international organisations and  conferences and missions of the Associated countries shall be  encouraged;    -  the European Union shall examine the possibility of  further cooperation between the administrations of the  diplomatic services of Member States, the Commission and of the  Associated countries. The European Union notes that in some  cases the modalities of cooperation between the Associated  countries and the European Union might require the Associated  countries to nominate a single representative. In particular,  the Associated countries are invited to establish a system  providing for a single representative on rotation for  coordination purposes. The European Union considers that the  meetings provided for should focus on specific questions which  need an in-depth discussion.</p>

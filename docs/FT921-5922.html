			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Hillsdown canner deal referred to MMC THE ACQUISITION last September by Hillsdown Holdings of Anglia Canners from Associated British Foods was yesterday referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The MMC has until May 27 to report. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry can refer a merger up to six months after it goes through and can order it to be unravelled if it is found to have created a situation against the public interest. Meanwhile Hillsdown will continue to run the business which has been merged with its own canning subsidiary. Hillsdown has already closed the vegetable canning activities of Anglia Canners because of overcapacity in the market. Hillsdown's canning operation was the largest in the UK before the deal. Sir Harry Solomon, chairman, said it would be complicated to unravel the merger now. He said Anglia Canners had been losing money when acquired and had been rationalised. The deal was worth Pounds 20.6m at the time, with the price paid in Hillsdown shares. The operation also makes ready meals and canned fruit, but these are not under investigation. The canned vegetable market is worth Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m a year, and Hillsdown is now thought to have about a third of it. The Office of Fair Trading, which recommended the reference, appeared particularly concerned about canned garden peas, carrots and potatoes where it is estimated that the merged group has more than half the market. It was felt growers might suffer if there were too limited an outlet. Much of the production of the merged business is for supermarkets' own-label canned vegetables, making it difficult to assess market shares.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Eastern inspiration - Appetisers WHEN PHILIP Harris, proprietor of the Bahn Thai restaurant in Frith Street, London W1 (tel: 071-437-8504), sought to mark its reopening after a major refit he looked for inspiration from the far east and the south west. From the east came a 900-year-old statuette of Buddha, incense, candles, orchid and a Thai goblet filled with holy water with which to annoint the restaurant's staff. From the south west - the Thai temple, Wimbledon - came nine Buddhist priests who prayed for the restaurant's well being and blessed the staff. Then to lunch: two different Thai curries, spiced crispy fried mackerel, a salad of minced pork and pigskin with whole red chillis, mint and peanuts, raw vegetables and glutinous rice washed down with fresh orange juice and tea. The restaurant is now restricted to the upper floor. On the ground floor Bahn Thai now serves what can only be described as Thai tapas for those wanting a quick snack. Dishes include: Thai-style fried dry salt beef (Pounds 6.45), stuffed chicken wings with a plum sauce (Pounds 4.65) and spicy Thai pork sausages (Pounds 4.80). There will be a festival of Thai Food and Culture in the grounds of the Thai Temple, 14 Calonne Road, off Wimbledon Parkside, London SW19, on Sunday July 18, 10.30am-7pm. Leith's will be running a five-month Credential Course, starting next January, designed for those looking for a change of career, for women returning to work after having children and for those who who may be seeking a professional catering career but who do not need to start with basics. Cost: Pounds 5,125 per person. (Details: 071-229-0177). For those touring England this summer there are some good value breaks on offer from hotels with distinctive restaurants. At Buckland-Tout-Saints Hotel, Kingsbridge, on the south coast of Devon (0548-853055), a two-night break including dinner, bed and breakfast is Pounds 75 per person. Further north in Skipton, Yorkshire, near Bolton Abbey, the same deal is available for Pounds 67.50 per person at the Devonshire Country House Hotel (0756-710441). In the New Forest, Hampshire, one of the original country house hotels, Chewton Glen, is offering a 'green shoots package' - Pounds 99 per person for dinner, bed and breakfast. Sunday-Thursday nights only (0425-275341). A survey of childrens' cooking skills in this country revealed depressing results - one in two interviewed could not even boil an egg. And, with domestic science disappearing from the curriculum in many schools, this trend is likely to get worse. Last week the House of Commons saw the launch of 'Get Cooking]' a project aimed at reversing the trend. An information pack giving advice and recipes aimed at teaching children the foundations of wholesome cooking is available, price Pounds 12.50 plus 1.50 p&amp;p, from Get Cooking], National Food Alliance, 5-11 Worship Street, London EC2A 2BH. In Giles MacDonogh's article last week on Belgo, 72 Chalk Farm Road, London N1, the restaurant number was given incorrectly. It should be 071-267-0718.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank acquires 30% stake in Gerling DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's largest bank, has taken a 30 per cent stake in Gerling, Germany's largest privately-owned insurance group which in the current year is expected to generate group gross premiums of around DM11bn (Dollars 7.2bn). The bank gave no clue as to the price of the purchase, although Bob Yates at London stockbrokers Fox-Pitt Kelton said the likely outlay for a transaction of this size would be between DM1.5bn and DM2bn. Deutsche Bank said simply that it was buying the stake in order to ensure that the Cologne-based insurance company retained its character as the sole family-owned internationally-active German insurance company. It added that the transaction would allow Gerling to strengthen its role as an independent partner to German industry, a hint at the problems the insurance company has been experiencing in the fiercely competitive German industrial markets. From the sparse text of the announcement, it seems likely that Deutsche Bank will in the short-term treat the shareholding as a financial investment. The bank set up its own life subsidiary, DB Leben, in 1989, saying that such personal business was a natural extension of its investment services. But so far, Deutsche Bank has steered clear of combining a fully-fledged insurance business with its banking activities. For several years, Deutsche Bank has participated in a joint venture with Gerling, selling life products via industrial companies. It has traditionally directed reinsurance business to Gerling. Analysts speculate that Deutsche Bank could hope to sell Gerling's products to its own industrial clients; they do not rule out a full takeover in the long-run be ruled out. The Gerling group is at present wholly owned by Rolf Gerling, the son of the late Hans Gerling, the insurance entrepreneur who built up the business before the Second World War, rebuilt it after the war, lost control as a result of the company's involvement in the collapse of Bankhaus Herstatt in 1974, and bought back majority control from Friedrich Karl Flick, the industrialist, in December 1985. Mr Hans Gerling died last year. Gerling itself made no comment as to why the stake was being sold. In 1990-91, the Gerling group generated gross premium income of over DM8bn and net profit was DM65.9m.</p>

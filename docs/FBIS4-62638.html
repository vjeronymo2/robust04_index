			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- "The Libyan republic is in no  way involved in the so-called `Lockerbie case'. It condemns  manifestations of terrorism in all their forms and is prepared  to take part in the investigation of this tragic incident in  order to punish the guilty," ITAR-TASS was told today by Libyan  Ambassador to Russia Muhammad 'Husni Sha'ban.    The ambassador dwelt on the charges advanced against Libya  the United States and Great Britain. Two Libyan citizens are  known to be suspected of organising an explosion on board a  Pan-American liner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in 1988.  France accuses Libyan agents of blowing up a French liner,  belonging to the UTA air company, in Niger in 1989. These  incident claimed the lives of 449 people.    The ambassador noted that Libya had insisted on a "fair and  just" investigation of the charges brought against its citizens,  who should be first tried by a Libyan court. Later it had  softened its stand and agreed that the investigation should be  conducted by The Hague International Court. The United Nations  and the Arab League could find an appropriate legal basis for  this. It had also offered to conduct a joint investigation by  representatives from the United States, Great Britain, Libya and  several other states. According to Sha'ban, all these proposals  were rejected by Washington and London. They continue to insist  on the unconditional extradition of the suspects, to which Libya  cannot agree, of course. The Arab League even offered to try  the two Libyans by a court of Scottish judges and according to  Scottish laws at The Hague International Court, but this  compromise was turned down by the British side. On the whole,  the Libyan leadership holds that the two Libyan citizens, whose  crime has not been proved, are merely suspects, not even  defendants. Hence, the demand for their extradition is legally  ungrounded. "We decided to put off the case indefinitely,  because we have exhausted all our arsenal of reasonable  proposals and are now looking forward to constructive steps from  the other side," Sha'ban said. The Arab League, the African  Unity Organisation, and the Islamic Conference Organisation,  accounting for the majority of the U.N. membership, have  condemned the U.N. sanctions against Libya, imposed on Western  insistence."    Asked by ITAR-TASS to describe the current state of  Libyan-Russian relations, the ambassador noted that, in his  opinion, the U.N. Security Council Resolution 748 of May 31,  1989, imposing international economic sanctions on Libya, was  primarily intended to cause material and moral damage to  Tripoli. Moreover, it was a deliberate blow, inflicted by the  masterminds of the resolution on Libyan-Soviet relations, and on  relations between Libya and the USSR's successor -- Russia.    "The carefully worded boycott resolution," he said, "is  spearheaded against the delivery to my country of armaments and  other military hardware, which mostly came from Moscow. The  embargo on air traffic was also mainly directed against Russia,  with which we were then conducting talks on the improvement of  air carriages. At the same time, the oil, which is being used by  the West, remained outside the embargo. As a result, the damage  caused to Libya and Russia amounted to several billion U.S.  dollars. The treaties, agreements and contracts are to expire  in all the spheres they cover only in 1997, but they have  already been suspended, just as payments for Russian services in  the sphere of economic deliveries, personnel training,  maintenance of technical facilities, including military  installations. In other words, the process of cooperation  between the two countries was suspended.    The ambassador refused to give the exact figures of this  cooperation, but, according to information received by ITAR-TASS  from other sources, Tripoli's debt to Moscow totalled 21 billion  U.S. dollars in the period from 1970 until today. Approximately  18 billions have already been paid.    In conclusion, Sha'ban expressed regret that Russia was  voting in the U.N. Security Council for further sanctions  against Libya. At the same time, he expressed satisfaction with  the fact that Moscow was lately trying to mediate between  Tripoli and the other parties to the conflict, but so far its  initiatives have not evoked any response from the West.</p>

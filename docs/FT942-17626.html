			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Child agency faces new probe The operations of the Child Support Agency may soon come under fresh scrutiny by MPs less than three months after its working methods were changed. The Commons social security committee will decide shortly whether to investigate the controversial agency. Some Tories favour delaying such a probe until later in the year on the grounds that the new rules have not been in effect long enough for firm conclusions to be drawn. Mr Frank Field, the committee's Labour chairman, is thought to be keen to press ahead. With the issue continuing to generate a great deal of mail and many complaints at constituency advice surgeries, it is still high on most MPs' lists of concerns. Although Mr John Major, the prime minister, has underlined the government's determination not to be stampeded into ordering further changes to the rules governing the agency, there is a widespread acceptance in Whitehall that more fine-tuning may eventually be needed. The changes, introduced in February, enabled absent fathers facing big increases in maintenance payments to pay the bills in stages over 18 months and ensured that addresses of separated parents were not disclosed.</p>

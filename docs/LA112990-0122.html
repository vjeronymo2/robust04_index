			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LAGOMARSINO VISITS TROOPS IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> Touring among U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia, Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino  (R-Ventura) said Wednesday that the United States may be forced into war if  Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein does not remove his occupying force from Kuwait.  </P> <P> Lagomarsino said he hopes for a peaceful solution to the Mideast crisis but  suggested that the United States cannot abandon its military commitment to  Saudi Arabia and other nations in the region.  </P> <P> "If the only other choice is to walk away, then I think we should seriously  consider using military means," Lagomarsino said in a telephone interview from  Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. "If it is that or say, 'We quit,' I don't think we have  any choice."  </P> <P> Lagomarsino, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, is touring  the Middle East this week as part of a 20-member congressional delegation. He  said the delegation's meetings with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and U.S.  military leaders have reassured him that U.S. and foreign troops are prepared  for war in the region.  </P> <P> The congressman also said he was impressed by the high morale among the troops  he visited in the Saudi desert, particularly those closest to what could turn  into the front-lines of a war.  </P> <P> "None of them asked me what we are doing here in the Gulf," he said. Some  troops wanted to know how long they would be in the Persian Gulf region so they  could make plans at home, he said. "Some of them say we ought to get on with  it, one way or another."  </P> <P> Although temperatures have dropped to the high 80s, Lagomarsino said he could  imagine how miserable it was in the summer. A fine dust, with the consistency  of talcum powder, gets into everything.  </P> <P> "It isn't a very nice place to be, and there isn't much to do," Lagomarsino  said. "You can't drink. You can't hardly look at women." KENNETH R. WEISS  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-HUSBAND AWARDED SHARE OF JACKPOT  </P> <P> A man who sued his ex-wife for half of her $31.5-million Florida Lotto jackpot  is entitled to 25% of her winnings for his role in buying the ticket, a jury  decided Saturday.  </P> <P> Lewis Snipes, a mechanic who claimed he helped pick the six winning numbers and  had agreed to share the winnings before purchasing the ticket in October, 1988,  rejected his former wife's offer of $1 million before filing the suit.  </P> <P> One fourth of $31.5 million works out to roughly $7,875,000. Attorneys for Mrs.  Snipes, who said they would appeal the verdict, noted that lawyers for both  sides would have to meet to determine the exact cash amount.  </P> <P> The jury deliberated for 2 1/2 hours before ruling that while Mary Ellen Snipes  was the true owner of the ticket, the couple had arranged to share the winnings  and that Snipes was entitled to the one-fourth share.  </P> <P> The couple's marriage ended in 1982, but Snipes kept in touch and occasionally  paid part of his ex-wife's rent and mowed her lawn.  </P></p>

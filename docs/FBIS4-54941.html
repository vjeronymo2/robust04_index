			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP], who was in a serious car accident on Thursday  evening, is being treated in a hospital in Miskolc in northern  Hungary. The party chairman had not yet gone to bed after  midnight because of the election excitement, and our  correspondent managed to interview him on the telephone.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Good evening, Mr.  Chairman.    [Horn] Good evening. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] How satisfied are you with the election  results?    [Horn] I am very satisfied. They are very good and exceed  expectations; at least they exceed what I had seen and heard to  date. So I am pleased that we did not work in vain.    [Correspondent] The political analysts are considering to  what the success can be attributed. Two alternatives have  emerged. The first is that with very calm, very restrained  political activity, the party, which four years ago ended up in  the depths, was able to get back to its feet. Do you agree?    [Horn] I naturally agree with that. However, those who are  evaluating us should recognize that this meant very hard work  for us.    [Correspondent] According to the other opinion, four years  ago the people voted against something. Now, however, after  they have experienced the feeling of freedom and independence,  they are turning to social issues.    [Horn] That is not how I judge it. Of course, the question  at hand also involves the significance of social issues, but  economic policy is at least as important. So is the sorting out  of relations with the neighboring countries, as is the European  political culture which the Socialist Party has represented to  date. Finally, let me add: We did not express hatred toward  anyone, nor did we want to (?exclude) anyone. We also (?said)  that no matter how sharp the differences of view were, it was  necessary to seek the possibility of normal relations.    [Correspondent] We have spoken with a correspondent from  French television's second channel, and he said that this  sweeping victory, this confident victory, that the MSZP achieved  would be convincing for the West as well.    [Horn] I had no doubts that the West had confidence in the  Socialist Party. Indeed, allow me to add: More than one  Western statesman, big financial experts, and entrepreneurs said  that if the MSZP came to power two things would be certain. One  was that it would form a government using people with expertise.  The other was that its policy would be predictable. I believe  that the West can be pleased with these election results.    [Correspondent] Very many people are saying now, mainly  those  who have been in government positions until now, that they hope  the reforms that have been started will not come to a halt.    [Horn] They should have no doubts. It is completely certain  that reform and transformation will continue. The essence here  is that we must set ourselves to the task more cleverly in many  areas. It is always necessary to consider that this country in  many respects is taking the road not taken. Many things must be  tried out.    But one thing must never be forgotten: It is not the people  who are the guinea pigs. It is necessary to work in a manner so  that the people live better and can secure a normal life for  themselves and their children. I apologize for my voice, but it  is still not 100 percent after the operation.    [Correspondent] A final question. We now can ask, very  quietly, whether the chairman of the victorious party could gain  the position of prime minister based on the results of the  election.    [Horn] In the final analysis, the question of whether or not  I will be prime minister will be decided by the MSZP. I have  never been intimidated by the job, but I have never considered  this to be the primary concern. The important thing, rather, is  for this party to be able to realize a program covering  economic, social, and all other areas, one which takes reality  as its point of departure, one which is in harmony with the  interests of society and the great majority of the people.    [Correspondent] Many thanks for the conversation and I wish  you a speedy recovery. [end recording]</p>

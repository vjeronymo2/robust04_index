			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOMEOWNER GROUP ON MOUNTAIN ROADS  </P> <P> Our board of directors has decided to oppose the paving of Reseda Boulevard and  possibly Mulholland as well, as a way to improve traffic circulation in the  area.  </P> <P> While there might be some short-term improvements in traffic circulation, they  would soon be negated by continued growth and development. Valley residents  should oppose the cut-through and paving since they will lead to more density  in the Santa Monica mountains.  </P> <P> We support fire roads in the area. However, these roads should remain unpaved  and blocked to all vehicular access. We do not want fire roads to become  informal paths for off-road vehicles, motorcycles, etc. The Fire Department is  the appropriate agency to determine the number and placement of these roads.  </P> <P> One of the major causes of congestion on the Ventura Freeway is the absence of  cross-mountain roads. Roads such as the Laurel Canyon freeway, Reseda to the  sea and Hayvenhurst to Sepulveda would have relieved traffic on the Ventura  Freeway had they been built. Without them there is pressure to double-deck the  Ventura Freeway and build light rail, much to the detriment of those living  near the corridor.  </P> <P> If cross-mountain roads are to be built, then they should include the  Hayvenhurst cut-through, Reseda to the sea and more freeways through the  mountains. But we do not advocate this course of action, since it would have a  severe negative impact, changing the character of our communities. It would  spur additional growth in the little remaining open space left. This leads us  to the conclusion that we must live within our transportation means.  </P> <P> We need tough controls on development and must make improvements in the present  transportation system.  </P> <P> GERALD A. SILVER  </P> <P> Encino  </P> <P>  Silver is president of Homeowners of Encino.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Pension concerns prompt SIB review THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, yesterday issued a consultative document on the regulation of custodial companies, which hold the share certificates of investors for safekeeping. The SIB review was prompted by the theft of more than Pounds 440m from pension funds controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, in which the role of the custodians has been called into question. The consultative document says 'the case for making the provision of custody services an authorised activity (under the Financial Services Act) has not yet been made'. Custody is the one area of the financial services industry that has remained exempt from the act. Because most custodians are subsidiaries either of regulated firms or of banks supervised by the Bank of England, the existing structure could be modified to improve supervision of the business without having to resort to legislative change, the review suggests. However, the SIB says there is a case for developing explicit and higher standards. Among the questions raised is whether custodians should be liable for losses incurred by sub-custodians. The report also lays out the case for greater supervision of nominee companies - shell companies set up by fund managers to hold securities on behalf of customers. It notes that some fund managers have apparently set up such companies to avoid regulation. The SIB did not take a view on one of the most contentious issues in custodial practice - whether securities should be held in the name of the ultimate owner, such as a particular pension scheme, or in the name of the fund manager's nominee company. Fund managers say the latter cuts administrative costs. However, Maxwell pensioners were able to retrieve Pounds 27m of shares passed to National Westminster Bank as collateral for a personal loan to Mr Maxwell. They argued that, as the shares were registered in the name of the scheme, NatWest should have realised the shares did not belong to Mr Maxwell personally. Separately, a government advisory panel chaired by Professor Roy Goode is examining pension fund law. Recommended reforms could include stricter supervision of the custody business.</p>

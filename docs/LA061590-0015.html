			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL HOMELAND FOR SOVIET JEWS  </P> <P> American Jews should not be sending enormous sums of money to finance Russian  Jews and encourage them to move to Israel ("Homeward Bound," June 11).  </P> <P> These people have homes in a country that lost over 20 million of its people  fighting the Nazis. American Jews should be using their influence and money to  persuade Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians who are really in need of a  home.  </P> <P> There will never be peace in the Middle East until all people from that area  have a homeland.  </P> <P> MARGARET JULIANO  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] President Algirdas Brazauskas believes that the  process of delimitation and demarkation of the border between  Lithuania and Belarus "is unjustifiably dragged out" after the  change in the Belarussian government.    In an interview with Interfax in Bucharest where Brazauskas  arrived for taking part in the international forum on the  burning economic and political problems, the Lithuanian leader  noted that after the resignation of the chairman of the  Belarussian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich "meetings  suspended" between corresponding intergovernmental delegations  and experts of Foreign Ministries. The Lithuanian president  intends to discuss this subject with the head of the Belarussian  parliament Mechyslaw Hyrb now visiting Bucharest and hopes that  corresponding talks will resume in the near future.    Brazauskas made it clear that he intends to insist on the  division of the border railway station Adutiskes claimed by both  states and on its joint use.    Interfax has information that the dispute over this station  occurred during the delimitation of the Belarussian-Lithuanian  border at the level of experts.</p>

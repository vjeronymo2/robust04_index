			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Philippine minister offers to quit Mr Rafael Alunan, Philippine secretary of the interior and local government whose jurisdiction includes the scandal-tainted Philippine National Police, offered his resignation yesterday, writes Jose Galang from Manila. Mr Alunan's move came three days after Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine president, called for the resignation of police officers who had earlier been relieved of field assignments or accused of corruption or incompetence. However, Mr Alunan's offer is unlikely to be accepted.</p>

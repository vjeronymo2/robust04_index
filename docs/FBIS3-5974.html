Foreign Minister Ali Alatas  told reporters in Jakarta today that a trade law like Super 310  should not be imposed because it amounts to an unilateral act.  The U.S. policy of reenacting the trade law has also been  criticized by France. French Industry and Foreign Trade  Minister Gerard Longuet said the U.S. decision was unjustifiable  as it was directed against a certain nation like Japan.    According to Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, it is improper for  the United States to use political, military, and financial  influence to serve its business interests. Minister Ali Alatas  swore in the consuls general of the Republic of Indonesia for  New York and Berlin in Jakarta this afternoon. Accordingly, the  minister asked the Consulate General of the Republic of  Indonesia in New York to consistently monitor any problems in  relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the United  States, including the issue of workers, to maintain good  bilateral relations.</p>

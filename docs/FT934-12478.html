			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (3): Cordless market has big potential - Paul Taylor highlights advances in mobile communications THE invention of the telegraph in America in the 19th century enabled the office to be separated from the factory for the first time. Since then, the telephone in its traditional guise, has played a central role in most businesses. But while the fixed wire telephone freed the office from the production process, it has tied the office worker to the desk. Now the introduction and rapid growth of mobile and cordless telephony promises to untether the telephone and the telephone user. 'At the moment, telephones in the office are linked to desks, computers are connected together in local area networks and 80 miles of cable snakes round an average office building,' says Philip Ross, head of research at Business Design Group, a UK-based design consultancy. 'People work in the same location every day because communications are fixed between physical places.' However, radio telephony is beginning to challenge these restrictions. PABX manufacturers like GPT Communications Systems are already supplying systems which support cordless handsets within the office. GPT's iSDX 100 system, which was launched earlier this year, is based upon the same digital CT2 technology as telepoint systems like Hutchison's Rabbit service in the UK and is designed for small to medium-sized businesses. Canada's Northern Telecom has launched a similar system called the Companion 100 which is also available from BT. Aside from providing the benefits of mobile telephony within an office, these systems also enable new staff members to be accommodated with the minimum of inconvenience. However, rival systems based on a European cordless standard called Dect (Digital European Cordless Telecommunications) are beginning to appear from companies such as Ericsson, Phillips and Alcatel which claim that the system has advantages over CT2, particularly for heavy use within office buildings. Ericsson, which has just launched its Freeset system in Europe, acknowledges that the cordless PABX market has been slow to develop so far, but nevertheless expects the global market for cordless PABX extensions to be worth about Dollars 5bn a year by 1998, buoyed by the adoption of the Dect technology standard. 'Dect is by far the best technology for cordless PABX systems,' claims Hans van der Hoek, Ericsson's sales and distribution manager for Freeset, 'apart from being a mandatory standard within Europe, only Dect has the capability to create offices in which almost everyone uses a cordless phone.' While CT2 and Dect can provide mobility for voice telecommunications within the office, other solutions are required once the executive, sales representative or engineer travels out of the office. The past 18 months has seen the launch of the second generation of mobile telecom networks in Europe based on digital rather than analogue technology. These new digital networks promise to deliver a wide range of sophisticated new voice and data services for those on the move. By the end of this decade, half of all telephone calls worldwide are expected to originate or terminate on a mobile phone - and a growing proportion of those telephones will be operating on the new digital technology which boasts some advantages over older analogue systems. Among these, digital mobile telephones can provide more reliable, clearer and more secure telecoms - although at least for the moment these usually have to be offset by higher equipment costs. Europe has taken the lead in the switch to digital systems spurred by the adoption in the mid 1980s of a pan-European digital telecommunications standard called GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile). The first GSM networks were launched 15 months ago and all the leading European Community states apart from Spain now have them in operation. By the end of this year Dataquest, the market research organisation, has forecast that there will be 1.1m digital subscribers in Europe, growing to 8.31m by the end of 1996. In the UK, Vodafone's GSM network is already operational while Cellnet plans to launch its system early next year, initially on a regional basis. Vodafone has already has reached GSM roaming agreements with a number of overseas network operators which enables GSM subscribers carrying their personal smartcards which slot into GSM handsets to make calls using a GSM phone anywhere in Europe. Vodafone has also launched a second national digital service called MetroDigital which exploits GSM technology but provides lower cost local calls and could prove particularly popular with business customers in urban areas. Meanwhile, the first PCN (Personal Communications Network) service, dubbed One-2-One, was launched last month in the London area by a joint venture of Mercury Communications and US West. Initially its coverage is confined to the M25 area around London, but coverage will expand rapidly. Like MetroDigital, One-2-One is targeted mainly at urban customers who require a high quality digital service outside the office or home. Next April, a second PCN service is due to be launched in the UK by Hutchison Microtel, a subsidiary of Hutchison Telecom and elsewhere in Europe, PCN services are likely to be developed in Germany, France and Spain. Another advantage of these new digital mobile services is that they are also easier to integrate with fixed telecommunications and data processing equipment and enable network operators and others to provide a wide range of value added customer services like messaging services and data transmission. 'With their intelligent network architecture and nationwide digital networks, the mobile operators will soon be able to offer all the services that a (fixed network) telephone operator can, and more,' says Tim Harrabin, a principal consultant at the Cambridge-based Analysys telecoms, strategy and economics consultancy, in a recent report. Some like Chris Gare, Mercury's manager of systems technology, believe that at some stage before the end of the decade, office cordless and mobile digital technologies will be integrated in a dual mode handset capable of operating as a Dect handset in the office and a PCN phone outside. Business Design's Philip Ross in London believes mobile voice and data technologies are likely to be used alongside traditional hard wire cabling or new solutions such as ISDN in the short term. But he argues that once cordless technology has proved successful, there will be a move toward a completely cordless environment, although probably using a cabled backbone (either copper or fibre optic) as a link between floors in a building. In the longer term, some technology strategists believe individuals, rather than machines, will be assigned a personal number which, once they have 'checked in,' will enable telecom services to be routed to them wherever they are and irrespective of the equipment they are using. Olivetti, the Italian PC manufacturer, has taken this concept a step further believing that its future products will converge into a system which it calls the Active Office. Based on joint venture work with DEC at research laboratories in Cambridge Olivetti has developed a system which enables digital video and audio services to follow individuals around from room to room tracked via the infra-red active badges which they wear and which send a location signal every 15 seconds to a network of sensors.</p>

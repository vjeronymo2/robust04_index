			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Rental side boosts Warner Howard Warner Howard Group, the commercial laundry and warm air hand dryer supplier, lifted pre-tax profit by 11 per cent, from Pounds 5.14m to Pounds 5.71m, in the year to February 29. Turnover expanded 25 per cent to Pounds 22.2m. Mr Ronald Hooker, chairman, said sales of capital goods remained depressed, but were more than offset by a sustained rise - 17 per cent this time - in rental income. Derek Wright (Food Machinery) proved to be 'an excellent acquisition'. Profits were as expected and plans for growth included the introduction of new product lines. Earnings per share came to 17.16p (15.57p) and the final dividend is 3.975p for a total of 5.9p (5.2p).</p>

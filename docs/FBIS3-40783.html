			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, December 24--The election commission (EC)  has directed the chief electoral officer (CEO) of the Delhi  government to undertake a special intensive revision of the  electoral rolls with January 1, 1994, as the cut-off date.    This follows the commission being convinced that the  revision  of rolls in March and April this year by the Delhi  administration had been done in a "gravely unsystematic,  slip-shod and unacceptable manner."    The commission has thus placed on record its "severest  displeasure" against all those officers responsible for the  defective rolls and its intention to proceed against them  separately.    The fresh revision, which entails house-to-house  enumeration,  will be carried out under the detailed supervision of its  observers, and publication of the draft and the final rolls will  not be done without the commission's "specific written  clearance" for each of the 70 assembly constituencies.    It has also warned that any defect in the rolls so published  will invite the "most serious consequences."    The commission has said that the house-to-house enumeration  should begin on April 4, 1994, and the final publication of  rolls be completed by October 20, 1994. The CEO has been  directed to stick to the deadline.    The commission has pointed out that it had received an  "extremely large number" of complaints regarding defects in the  preparation of the rolls and these continue to "pour in every  day."    "The nature of these complaints regarding the electoral  rolls, as published on March 9 and April 2 this year are proof  that the work of revision has been carried out in a slip-shod  and unacceptable manner," it noted.    It lists them as:    --Omission of names of persons, who have been residing at  the  same address for the last 20 years or more, of whole localities  and blocks of buildings, continuance of names of dead persons  and related and multiple duplication of identical names in rolls  of several constituencies.    --Names included in the draft rolls had been left out in the  final rolls without any orders.    --Number of cases where the particulars of voters such as  name, age, father's name, sex, etc., are either wrong or  defective.    The complaints received were from representatives from all  walks of life, including but not restricted to ministers,  defence service personnel, associations of residents of  established colonies and political parties. Besides, newspaper  reports too had pointd out these omissions, the commission noted.    The programme for the revision of the rolls is:  house-to-house enumeration (from April 4 to May 18);  verification of citizenship status by the authorities concerned  and preparation of manuscripts and printing of draft rolls (by  July 18); publication of draft rolls (on July 19); period for  filing claims and objectives (from July 19 to August 19);  disposal of claims (by September 19); preparation and printing  of supplementaries (October 19); and final publication of rolls  (October 20).</p>

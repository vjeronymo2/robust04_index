I. Levchenko, A. A. Savinov, Institute of </F> Mathematics, Moscow; UDC 658.012.011.56]    [Abstract] This article proposes an approach to the  construction of diagnostic expert systems based on a special  matrix representation of fuzzy predicates in a test model of a  subject field. A sectioned matrix is a fuzzy analog of a  conjunctive normal form of predicate representation. One may use  rules, examples, and counterexamples to form the knowledge base.  Fuzzy rules are used to interpret elements of a common nonfuzzy  set. The most important assertions of the logic of predicates  can be generalized to the fuzzy case. The diagnostics problem is  understood to be the acquisition of information on possible  values of some indicator if there is data on the values of other  indicators. The basis of logical deduction is the operation of  fuzzy resolution, which is used to find sample disjunctions. An  expert system shell, EPID, is implemented on the basis of the  formalisms presented here. Figures 3; references 12: 6 Russian,  6 Western.</p>

The leaflets say that the plot was masterminded by the  leader  of the Russian Party of the Economic Freedom Konstantin Borovoy  and the leader of the Party's local branch, businessman Sergey  Manukyan.    Speaking over the Tiraspol cable TV "Asket," Lebed described  the leaflets as sheer nonsense. He said, though, that the  Transdniestrian leaders involved in what he said machinations  and corruption and cheating the ordinary people, are trying to  shift the blame for their mistakes and the deteriorating  economic situation in the region on the Russian military. The  commander has said that he was prepared to prove this and  cooperate in this respect with other bodies to establish the  truth.    Observers believe the authorship of leaflets belongs to the  Transdniestrian Security Ministry, whose leader Vadim  Shevtsov-Antyufeyev is in constant conflict with Aleksandr Lebed.    Addressing last Tuesday the Tiraspol parliament, he accused  in public the Russian general of plotting a coup.    Commenting in an interview with Interfax on the fact of the  leaflets appearance, the speaker of the Transdniestrian  parliament Grigoriy Marakutsa has said that he ordered to  conduct investigation into the case and establish real authors  of the leaflets.</p>

			<p>920111 FT  11 JAN 92 / Hurd rejects pound realignment in ERM THE GOVERNMENT'S determination to maintain sterling's position in the European exchange rate mechanism at a central rate of DM2.95 was underlined by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday. He dismissed as 'wrong' suggestions that a realignment of the ERM - 'the current euphemism for devaluation' - would stimulate the UK economy. Mr Hurd told the Walsall Chamber of Commerce: 'Almost certainly a devaluation against the D-Mark would not enable interest rates to be cut.' Warning that 'flap and fluster' would convince no one, he said even one devaluation would jeopardise the hard-won confidence which had been built in the markets. Already, he said, short-term interest rates in the UK were only about one point higher than those of Germany and France, well below the differential of more than 6 percentage points experienced in recent times. Mr Hurd stressed: 'No matter how modest the devaluation, holders of sterling would probably demand a higher differential to hedge against the risk of a further devaluation.' He dismissed as neither prudent nor sensible the arguments of those calling for a reversal of the decision to enter the ERM and their claim that even if it resulted in a plunge for sterling the ability to follow the example of the US by cutting short-term interest rates would make it worthwhile. Mr Hurd insisted: 'Our commitment to the ERM provides a firm foundation for sustainable, non-inflationary growth. It has already shown significant benefits. It would be deeply foolish to stray off this path into the marsh of an economic policy which relied on successive devaluations.' Ruling out this 'defeatist option' he said: 'We will hold fast to our course. It provides certainty and confidence for business and will benefit Britain.'</p>

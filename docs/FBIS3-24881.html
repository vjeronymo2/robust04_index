			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Conakry, 1 Feb (AFP) -- Guinean President Lansana  Conte announced in Conakry today that he will soon form a new  government that will be more "representative and composed of  more competent Guineans." He made the statement during a news  conference, the first since his investiture on 29 January as  president of the Republic. The Guinean head of state further  added that this government will not necessarily include members  of political parties.    Questioned on the possible participation of the Guinean  opposition in the next government, President Conte said: "I  will not beg anyone. It is up to the opposition to come to me  if they believe they have to contribute to the development of  their country." "If we form a government including people from  all political trends we run the risk of being taken hostage," he  added.    At the end of the first pluralist election in Guinea on 19  December, President Conte was elected for a five-year term with  51.70 percent of the votes. His election was contested by the  opposition candidates who boycotted the 29 January swearing in  ceremony.    Concluding, General Conte called on African countries to  "speed up" the economic integration process.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yegor </F> Gaydar by DER SPIEGEL; place and date not given: "A Shock Was  Needed"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Yegor Timurovich, under what  conditions would you have remained in office?    [Gaydar] If I had sufficient opportunities to keep a check  on monetary, loan, and financial policies. That is, the  political fields that our society, but also the whole world,  always believed to be my responsibility anyway.    [DER SPIEGEL] You said that the monetary union with Belarus  was one of the main reasons for your resignation. Why is it  dangerous?    [Gaydar] In general, the extension of the ruble zone and the  integration of other states, too, are conceivable. But only if  the coordination mechanisms work very well and the uncontrolled  printing of money can be ruled out for sure. If, however, there  are only vague formulations instead, this will, in the end, only  result in a competition for the faster printing of money. Why  should the Belarusians deliver something to Russia if they can  pay for our goods with freshly printed rubles?    [DER SPIEGEL] Is your resignation alone to blame for the  present, almost free fall of the ruble?    [Gaydar] It was caused by a negative change in inflationary  expectations.    [DER SPIEGEL] Can the new government do something against  it?    [Gaydar] Let us hope that the government will manage to keep  a check on inflation, without reaching a deadlock. At any rate,  Russia's complicated problems cannot be solved by new national  credit presents. However, there is the great risk that  precisely this course will be taken.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your parliamentary party colleague, Boris  Fedorov, who has been finance minister so far, also no longer  wants to participate in the new government. He had called for  the replacement of Central Bank chief Gerashchenko and Deputy  Prime Minister Zaveryukha, who is responsible for agriculture.  Are they the people who forced the change of course?    [Gaydar] These demands come from Fedorov. I am keeping out  of it. It is our joint hope that the worst can be prevented.  The worse, the better -- this is not our attitude.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will you go into the opposition with your  adherents?    [Gaydar] Our parliamentary group in the State Duma will do  everything to block irresponsible economic and budget decisions.  This is all the more important since Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin's statements have clearly shown that he is  succumbing to illusions that inflation could also be  counteracted by other than monetary measures.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you also assume partial responsibility for  having caused Zhirinovskiy's rise by shock methods of the market  economy?    [Gaydar] Failures in the implementation of reforms  definitely contributed to Zhirinovskiy's success. However, one  has to be precise regarding the causes of the failures.  Profound reforms aiming at privatization and price decontrol  were carried out. However, financial policies always remained  soft. But they are meant when people talk about a shock  therapy. As a result of pressure from the Supreme Soviet and  the regions, burdens that were impossible to fulfill were put on  the state budget again and again. What was precisely needed was  a shock.    [DER SPIEGEL] This sounds as if you had liked to drive even  more voters to Zhirinovskiy...    [Gaydar] ... our polls have shown that those who voted for  this man come from neither the impoverished nor from social  fringe groups, but from the middle class: better qualified  workers, people with handsome incomes.    They are not primarily dissatisfied with their material  situation, but with the lack of order, crime, which is getting  out of hand, and Russia's present situation in the world.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is there now the danger that, on the one hand,  Western help will be discontinued, while, on the other, Russia  will turn away from Western economic and political values?    [Gaydar] This is a very serious danger. I am convinced that  long-term relations of partnership suit Russia's strategic  objectives best. Here I have always proceeded on the assumption  that Russia has to solve its problems by its own. No financial  help from the West, however voluminous it may be, will be able  to save the Russian economy as a whole. However, Western help  can mitigate the social effects of our economic problems.    [DER SPIEGEL] The doubts of foreign financial backers about  whether their loans are appropriately used in Russia are  increasing.    [Gaydar] Transfers from abroad, however voluminous they may  be, cannot replace a reasonable monetary policy in one's own  country. At most, they will result in an increase of Russian  assets in Western accounts. As fast as the money would come to  Russia, it would it be transferred again as fast. This cannot  be prevented by foreign exchange control, but only by sufficient  economic stability.    [DER SPIEGEL] Will President Yeltsin become a prisoner of  the parliamentary majority of communists, centrists, and  right-wing extremists?    [Gaydar] I know that the president sees himself as a  reformer and wants to continue this course. Therefore, I hope  that he will spare no effort to achieve this objective.  However, we neither put him on the tsar's throne nor on God's  throne, but we only elected him president. He has to see how he  can cope with the new restrictions.    [DER SPIEGEL] And with his opponents...    [Gaydar] ...they will introduce draft laws, in order to  invalidate again all the market and property mechanisms that are  already effective today. The law on the rights of the work  collectives alone, which has been prepared by the communists,  would fully suffice to paralyze the market economy in Russia.  Moreover, they will resolve a gigantic expenditure that cannot  be financed. However, the new government will have to answer for  this.    [DER SPIEGEL] What is the next target of your ambition -- a  [university] chair of economic sciences or the chair of the  Russian president?    [Gaydar] The seat at my desk at home attracts me most.</p>

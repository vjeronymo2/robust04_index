			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong chemistry for president Sir, Democrat Jim Hightower, who described President Clinton as 'thixotropic' (Observer: 'Quality test', August 3), may know his politics but he doesn't know his chemistry. A thixotropic substance is fluid when it is stirred and solid when left to stand (not, as he apparently said, solid until heat is applied). But his analogy works. The message is: if you want a solid president, stop stirring. Daniel Alexander, 8 New Square, Lincoln's Inn, London WC2A 3QP</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GOOD SAMARITAN SHOT FOUR TIMES  </P> <P> Carpet installer Gary Smith had never met the University City housewife who  lived in a condominium next to where he was working. But, Wednesday morning,  when Smith heard her screaming and running from her home, he rushed to her aid.  </P> <P> His good deed cost him dearly.  </P> <P> The 35-year-old San Diegan, described as a part-time law student and "a real  decent guy," raced after the man suspected of burglarizing the woman's home.  </P> <P> For his efforts, Smith lay gravely injured in Scripps Memorial Hospital  Wednesday night after two operations, suffering from four bullet wounds fired  by the burglar as he ran from Smith.  </P> <P> "He's in very critical condition, and he will probably remain that way for the  rest of the night," hospital spokeswoman Dilene Pulsipher said shortly after  Smith came out of surgery at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> Smith was shot once below the right eye, once in the abdomen and once each in  his left arm and leg, said Michael Dabney, media coordinator at Scripps.  </P> <P> A team of three doctors operated on Smith for about six hours after the  shooting, which occurred shortly after 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> According to the woman's husband, she returned to her home in the 7900 block of  Camino Tranquilo from an errand when the gun-wielding burglar confronted her.  </P> <P> "My wife was just frozen solid for a minute or two," the husband said.  </P> <P> The burglar fled, and the wife ran outside calling for help after she recovered  from the shock, the husband said.  </P> <P> Smith heard the screams from the second-floor apartment where he was working,  and he either jumped or ran down to confront the burglar, San Diego Police  Officer Bob Chorney said.  </P> <P> Smith caught up with the fleeing man about a block away, and that's when the  shooting occurred, Chorney said.  </P> <P> "Supposedly, he had just been (carpeting) on the side and he was going to law  school," the officer said. "From everything I've heard, he was just a real  decent guy."  </P> <P> The husband said the thief had only escaped with "odds and ends."  </P> <P> "We didn't have much for them to take," he said. "There was nothing of any  great value. . . . I don't think we were a very good place to rob."  </P> <P> He described the crime rate in his neighborhood as "average."  </P> <P> "I've been here 4 1/2 years, and I've never heard about anything like this," he  said. "Robbing is one thing, but to shoot someone over something like this . .  . "  </P> <P> The wife declined to comment.  </P> <P> Police are still looking for the thief, described as white with a light  complexion and long, thin brown hair. The man is about 22 years old,  clean-shaven but with an unkempt appearance, is about 5-foot-9 and weighs 140  pounds, witnesses told police.  </P> <P> He was wearing a gray or blue Windbreaker and a pair of old jeans, Chorney  said. The weapon was described as a .22-caliber handgun.  </P> <P> Chorney offered a mixed message to other people who might become involved in a  violent encounter with criminals.  </P> <P> Smith may or may not have realized that the man he was chasing had a gun,  Chorney said.  </P> <P> "It's a good thing when people get involved in things, but we don't know what  information he had," Chorney said. "Sometimes, people don't realize the danger  they're getting into in those situations.  </P> <P> "Getting involved is a personal decision. But the world would be a better place  if we had more Good Samaritans like him."  </P> <P> When a group of neighborhood residents learned about the shooting, they began  organizing a fund-raising drive to benefit Smith, spokeswoman Pulsipher said.  The woman's husband said he would contact the man who had helped his wife.  "Definitely," he said. "But we'll do it privately."  </P></p>

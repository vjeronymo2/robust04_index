			<p>BFN     [Text] Kamchibek Shakirov has been relieved of his duties  as finance minister for office abuse, sources close to the  Kyrgyz leadership told INTERFAX.    The decision on Shakirov's dismissal was made at a  government  presidium meeting yesterday night. At the last session of the  Republic's parliament which ended on 16 April, Shakirov was  confronted with the accusation of having granted credits under  privileged conditions. The Kyrgyz mass media widely publicized  the fact that Shakirov had granted a soft credit worth 2 million  sums (Kyrgyz currency) to his son-in-law.</p>

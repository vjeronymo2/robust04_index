			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Testing time for middle men - The role of the referees Tucked away in the corners of US bookshops is a depressing collection of World Cup titles. There are shelves piled with beginners' guides that explain the world's game in the language of John and Janet. One of the better publications is by Pete Davies, a British author, called Twenty-Two Foreigners in Funny Shorts. Any American who has taken an interest in the matches so far will know that Davies gave his book the wrong title. This is a game for 25 foreigners in funny shorts. Fifa, world soccer's governing body, has changed the officials' uniforms from dull black to eye-catching patterns in yellow and red. Fifa wants lots of red and yellow from the referees, and has given instructions that were bound to increase the attention focused on them. Joao Havelange, Fifa's president, announced before the competition that any referee who did not show a red card - and thus expel a player from the game  -for a tackle from behind would find himself on the first flight home. There have been enough nasty tackles from behind to fill a segment which ESPN, the US sports network, has been showing at half-time during matches, but, after the first five days, only Miguel Nadal of Spain had been sent off for such an offence, and no referees had been spotted at the airport. One Fifa official told me that Havelange had been speaking figuratively. But this did not mean that the threat lacked bite. Referees who did not follow Fifa directives would not be selected to referee matches in the later rounds. It was even possible that a referee who especially upset the referees' committee might be pulled from a first-round match he had already been assigned to. In other words, referees who are seen to make mistakes cannot expect support from Fifa; instead, they will get a public humiliation designed to make clear that they, not Fifa, are at fault. In truth, Fifa wants black and white (and yellow and red) where there is often only grey. When top athletes tangle at high speed, with arms and legs all over the place, it is often impossible, even with slow-motion replays, to determine whether the tackler touched the ball or the opponent first. And players exploit that doubt. Defenders often try to make sure they connect with ball and opponent; the attacker's first reaction is often to fall to the ground as if shot. Understandably, referees have been inconsistent. American newspapers, which bow to no-one in the art of second-guessing referees, ran pictures showing that Thomas Dooley of the US played the ball in the crucial tackle from behind in the US-Switzerland game. The referee gave a free kick but did not send Dooley off. From the kick, Switzerland's Georges Bregy scored. Unsurprisingly, Fifa offered a clarification. Sepp Blatter, Fifa's general-secretary, said: 'If the tackling player does not touch the ball then he should be sent off. If he takes the ball away then obviously he has played the ball.' Nevertheless, waving a red card is still a drastic action from which referees flinch. Khalil Azmi, the Moroccan goalkeeper, escaped unpunished after a frontal assault on Belgium's Josip Weber which saved a certain goal. Azmi had the presence of mind to stay down injured and have himself carried from the field. It takes a degree of courage to wave a red card at a man on a stretcher. In general, referees have appreciated a little help. Marco Etcheverry of Bolivia barely poked Lothar Matthaus in the bottom with the toe of his boot. But the German captain, always willing to guide the referee, turned on Etcheverry in indignant fury. Result: a red card. The Russians pushed and wrestled the Brazilians all afternoon; it was only when they sent their opponents flying through the air that the referee, An Lan Kim Lee Chong of Mauritius, reacted. Referees have been inconsistent in handling the tackle from behind, and have largely refused to interfere when attackers back into defenders and defenders shove back. But they have been refreshingly steady on a couple of modern soccer's nastier fouls. A glimpse of raised studs when the ball is on the ground, or raised elbows when the ball is in the air, inevitably attract a penalty. The latter has not been a problem so far: unlike their British counterparts, most players at the finals do not seem to believe that they must raise and lower their elbows vigorously to jump for headers. Referees have also responded with a will to Fifa's demand for increased productivity. By Tuesday evening, 47 yellow cards and two red cards had been waved at players in the first 13 matches, up from 30 yellow and four red four years ago. And yet the soccer has been far superior. There have been a few cynical fouls, but games have not been dominated by foul-minded defenders. On the other hand, it is not clear yet whether the blizzard of yellow cards has helped produce the sparkling play, or resulted from over-reaction to what fouling there has been. Blatter is in no doubt where the credit belongs: 'It is such a pleasure, after what we have done to improve refereeing over the past three years, to see how good the refereeing is here.' However, nearly 20 per cent of first-choice players are one mis-step away from a suspension. If Fifa's decision to ban Etcheverry and Nadal for two matches, instead of the more usual one, is a sign of intent, many teams could find themselves with gaps in their line-ups in the knock-out stages. Since most of the missing players will be defenders, that will tip the balance even more towards attackers. No doubt that is what Fifa and the watching billions want.</p>

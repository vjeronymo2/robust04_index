			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 11 DIE, 50 HURT IN DOMINICAN STRIKE CLASHES  </P> <P> A two-day nationwide strike over sharply higher prices led to clashes between  police and protesters that left at least 11 people dead and 50 wounded,  authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The general strike virtually paralyzed this Caribbean nation of 7 million on  Monday and Tuesday.  </P> <P> Nearly all stores, factories and offices were closed, and public transportation  was scarce. Normal activity resumed Wednesday, however.  </P> <P> The anti-government strike, which was organized by nine major unions, led to  violent confrontations between protesters and security forces in the capital,  Santo Domingo, and several other cities.  </P> <P> Police said the 11 people who died were all killed as a result of shots fired  by police and soldiers to disperse unruly crowds.  </P> <P> It was earlier reported that a 10-year-old girl died after being struck by a  stone during looting, but police said Wednesday that she was accidentally hit  by a bullet. At least 50 protesters were wounded and 2,000 arrested over the  48-hour strike period.  </P> <P> Unions organized the protest in response to an austerity program introduced  last week by the government of President Joaquin Balaguer to shore up the  country's faltering economy.  </P> <P> Juan Jose Arteaga, presidential economic adviser, said Wednesday that the  strike would have no effect on the government's economic policies. The program  includes sharp increases in the costs of basic consumer goods. The price of  gasoline, for example, has risen 83.6%, from 55 cents to $1.07 a gallon.  </P> <P> The conservative Balaguer, 83 and blind, is to be inaugurated today to a second  consecutive four-year term. He narrowly defeated his longtime challenger,  leftist Juan Bosch, in a disputed election May 16.  </P></p>

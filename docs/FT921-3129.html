			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: How companies share in parties' political success THE FT will publish an index of politically sensitive share prices every day during the election campaign. It is as much an aid to thought as a serious stock market index, and consists of 10 stocks which might outperform in the event of Mr Neil Kinnock's arrival in Downing Street; and another 10 stocks which could benefit from a Conservative victory and the removal of the threat of a Labour government. The base for the index is the closing prices on the day the election was announced, Wednesday March 11. Both the 'Labour gainers' and the 'Conservative gainers' sections of the index are set to 100 at that date. On Thursday the Labour gainers fell 1.2 points - in line with the market - and the Conservative gainers dropped 2.3 points, nearly twice as far. The Labour gainers closed on Friday at 98.7, with the Conservative gainers at 97.4. The shares in the index are based on stock market analysts' expectations of shares that stand to gain or lose if there is a change of government. A detailed study by James Capel, the stockbroker, has been particularly useful in assessing these expectations. Shares that analysts reckon might gain, relative to other UK shares, from a Labour government include: Companies which derive most of their profits from overseas and thus suffer less from domestic political upsets, such as the tobacco company BAT. Companies in Labour's favoured manufacturing sector, such as ICI, the chemicals giant. Companies that might benefit from higher infrastructure spending, such as GEC, the electrical and electronics giant; BICC, another electrical business; and Taylor Woodrow, the builder and civil engineer. There is also Zetters, the pools promoter, which might gain if the Conservative threat to introduce a national lottery were lifted; and Land Securities, the big property company, which would see the value of its existing holdings rise if Labour adopted more restrictive planning policies. Analysts reckon that gainers from a renewed Conservative mandate would be those companies which would benefit from the removal of the threat posed by individual Labour policies. Labour's promised policies will not be known for certain until the manifesto is published this week, but on the basis of past party proposals, losers might include: Companies affected by Labour promises to reverse privatisation, such as the water utilities, or step up regulation of privatised businesses, such as BT. Companies likely to suffer from any discouragement of corporate takeovers, such as Hanson, the acquisitive conglomerate, or SG Warburg, the investment bank Companies with many relatively low-paid employees which might be affected by a minimum wage, such as BET, the business services supplier, or Courtaulds Textiles. Prudential represents life assurance companies likely to face tougher consumer protection rules for retail financial products under Labour. The index is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share Ordinary index  -which makes it highly sensitive to day-to-day share price movements and unsuitable for long-term performance measurement.

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Israel ends Jericho border closure Israel yesterday ended the 24-hour closure of its border with the Palestinian self-rule area in Jericho in the West Bank, imposed after Palestinian police disarmed three Jewish settlers, Reuter reports. The Israeli army said Israelis would be able to travel along the main Jordan valley road through Jericho but would not be permitted to leave the main road. Israel said it close the border on Tuesday to allow Palestinian police commanders to explain to their men the parameters of their authority. Israel insists its peace deal with the PLO enables Jewish settlers to carry licensed weapons in the self-rule areas of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Palestinians say Israelis coming to self-rule areas may not carry weapons.</p>

			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: Bad debt provisions hit net result at GiroCredit GiroCredit, the Austrian investment bank and clearing institution for the savings bank sector, expects a sharp rise in operating profits this year but net profits will be hit by bad-debt provisions. On the basis of results in the first 11 months, GiroCredit expects operating profits for the whole year to be around Sch2bn (Dollars 168m), compared with Sch1.3bn in 1992. But the bank will have to make provisions of Sch1.4bn to cover bad debts and costs related to the purchase of OCI, a small savings bank, in 1992. No dividend will be paid for 1993. After a supervisory board meeting on Friday, Mr Hanz Haumer, chairman, said he hoped 1993 would be the last year the bank has to draw on its hidden reserves to cover debts. Next year, GiroCredit is expected to start to benefit from a Sch3bn package of measures, approved by shareholders in November, designed to cut costs and increase revenues over a three-year period. Mr Haumer was also optimistic that a solution would be found in the next few weeks for the long-awaited reorganisation of the savings bank sector with a new ownership structure for GiroCredit.</p>

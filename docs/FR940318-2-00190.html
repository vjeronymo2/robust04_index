Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 (HBR), at a steady-state reactor power level not in excess of 2300 megawatts thermal. The facility consists of one pressurized water reactor located at the licensee's site in Darlington County, South Carolina. The license provides, among other things, that it is subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC) now or hereafter in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 50.54(q) of 10 CFR part 50 requires a licensee authorized to operate a nuclear power reactor to follow and maintain in effect emergency plans that meet the standards of 10 CFR 50.47(b) and the requirements of appendix E to 10 CFR part 50. Section IV.F.2 of appendix E requires that each licensee annually exercise its emergency plan. Section IV.F.3 of appendix E requires that each licensee shall exercise with offsite authorities such that the State and local emergency plans are exercised biennially. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC may grant exemptions from the requirements of the regulations which, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), are (1) authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security; and (2) present special circumstances. Special circumstances exist when the exemption would result in benefit to the public health and safety that compensates for any decrease in safety that may result from the granting of the exemption (see 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(iv)). In addition, special circumstances exist when the exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and the licensee has made a good faith effort to comply with the regulation (see 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On December 30, 1993, the Commission granted an Exemption to the H.S. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2, from the requirements of 10 CFR 50.47 and 10 CFR part 50, appendix E, section F.2, to conduct an annual exercise of the Emergency Plan in 1993, and authorized the rescheduling of the annual exercise of the HBR Emergency Plan from November 30, 1993, to the week of March 21, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated February 21, 1994, the licensee requested an amendment to the Exemption to allow the annual emergency preparedness exercise to be conducted on March 30, 1994. The licensee stated that the schedule to conduct the exercise during the week of March 21, 1994, conflicted with scheduled training being conducted by the affected State agencies. In addition, due to the extended forced outage the plant is undergoing, deferral of licensed operator requalification training and examinations has resulted in the unavailability of the plant simulator, which is necessary to support the exercise during the week of March 21, 1994. The Commission's staff has evaluated the information provided by the licensee to support the amendment to the Exemption and finds the 3-day delay of the annual exercise is acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Exemption Amendment as requested by the licensee's letter dated February 21, 1994, as discussed above, is authorized by law and will not endanger life or property and is otherwise in the public interest. Furthermore, the Commission hereby grants an Exemption Amendment to the Exemption granted on December 30, 1993, and authorizes a delay until March 30, 1994, of the annual emergency preparedness exercise which had been scheduled for the week of March 21, 1994. The amendment to the Exemption is subject to modification by rule, regulation or Order of the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission previously determined on December 28, 1993, that granting the Exemption would have no significant impact on the environment (59 FR 100). The Exemption Amendment does not alter that finding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Exemption Amendment is effective upon issuance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 11th day of March 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Steven A.

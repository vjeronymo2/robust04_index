			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLAREMONT OKS PLAN TO NARROW SANTA FE STREET  </P> <P> The Claremont City Council has voted to narrow part of Santa Fe Street to  provide parking spaces for a senior citizen housing complex.  </P> <P> The decision last Tuesday came despite complaints by merchants that the  narrowing would further restrict limited public parking on Santa Fe, and thus  increase traffic congestion on the street.  </P> <P> In approving the street narrowing, the council added a provision requiring the  developer of the housing complex to reserve 11 parking spaces for both the  public and residents of Heritage Village, a 154-unit, low-cost senior-citizen  housing complex scheduled to open in mid-1991.  </P> <P> Also, a city survey showed that many of those who park along Santa Fe are  Trans-America Insurance employees. City officials said they will ask the  company to encourage employees to instead use a parking structure in Village  Plaza, where their firm is located.  </P> <P> Santa Fe Street is currently 58 feet wide and is to be narrowed by 24 1/2 feet  between Indian Hill Boulevard and Olive Street, City Manager Glenn Southard  said.  </P> <P> Calmark Vice President Frank Cardone, whose company is building the housing  complex, said he was pleased with the council's decision.  </P></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Letter: A strategy for UK that may not be ideal, but is best alternative Sir, Your leader, 'A government on the run' (October 20), eloquently exposes the haplessness of the government's position and proclaims the need for an overall economic strategy. But what strategy? Like many of us, you supported membership of the ERM. This failed because Britain's economy, as well as its political leaders, were weaker than we had thought. Now we are heading for depression or slump. A radical new strategy is required which should be along the following lines: a rejection of Thatcherite economics, whether practised by Lord Howe or Lawson; a rapid reduction of interest rates towards the rate of inflation: the maintenance, if not expansion, of public sector capital programmes; a freeze on public sector wages; a target of no more than 2 per cent increases for private sector wages. This approach might well lead to a further weakening of sterling, with serious inflationary consequences. To counter this, the government must be prepared to restore personal taxes to the pre-1988 levels in order to help finance the public sector borrowing. It must also return to a policy of industrial consensus, by sitting down with business and union leaders and agreeing a common approach on wage restraint and the protections of jobs. Positively, these policies will have several immediate benefits: the reduction in interest rates will ease the discomfort of heavily borrowed house owners; the reduction will encourage industry to invest and create employment; the weakened currency will create opportunities both for exporters and for companies such as my own to tackle import substitution; in the short term the rising trend in unemployment will inhibit inflationary wage settlements. These are not ideal policies and are certainly difficult for a Conservative government to adopt, but in the prevailing atmosphere of despair and uncertainty there does not appear to be a coherent alternative approach.

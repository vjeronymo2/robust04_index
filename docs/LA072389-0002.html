			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Shame on Channel 5 for running horribly "colorized" versions of classic films  marred by Turner Program Services. I tried watching "The Big Sleep" and it  looked ludicrous, a true desecration of a piece of art. Black and white was  absolutely essential to the mood. Do the Spanish slop colored paint on  Picasso's "Guernica"?  </P> <P> I turned down the color on my set, but found it too bright and in need of  contrast adjusting. It still didn't look right. I've refused to watch  colorization before, but I really wanted to see this movie.  </P> <P> As for the advertisers, I saw their commercials in black and white. Their  impact was greatly diminished. I would have seen them as you'd intended if KTLA  had shown the film as its artists had intended.  </P> <P> Thanks to Television Times for printing no checks in front of the film's title  and noting (color) after it. I'll certainly avoid them in the future.  </P> <P> Bruce Kuehn, North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 17 March broadcasts the 10-minute  "Details" program presented by Nikolay Svandize, which discussed  international efforts to solve the problems of the Middle East,  as the UN Security Council prepares to adopt a resolution on the  Hebron massacre. The program consists of excerpts from an  interview with Igor Ivanov, Russian first deputy foreign  minister, a dispatch from Israel by correspondent Vladislav  Flyarkovskiy, and Svanidze's own comments.    The program begins with comments by Igor Ivanov, who says:  "The withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and the Jericho  region was due to have been completed by 13 April, after which  the process of establishing Palestinian self-rule would have  begun. You see, these were specific and practical steps. They  were not just talks, they were practical steps that would have  been the result of the complex talks that continued over two  years.    "It is difficult to say at the moment whether this murderer  was acting individually or whether he was an instrument in a  larger conspiracy, as both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides  have set up investigative commissions. As you know, there are  substantial disagreements about this question as well, and the  results of these investigative groups will show how things  really are.    "But independently of that, unfortunately this crime had the  most negative consequences on a wider scale."    Svanidze then introduces the theme of the program, noting  that the United Nations plans to adopt a resolution of principle  on the Middle East tomorrow, and that Russia and the United  States are named as the resolution's cosponsors. Ivanov's  interview continues:    "On the one hand, some people in the region tried  immediately  to interpret our activity as a kind of attempt, following our  diplomatic successes in the Yugoslav settlement, to develop this  success in the Middle East. Others also tried to interpret it  as an attempt to, as it were, in some way pass the United States  on the bend in that region.    "In our view, a very tough UN Security Council resolution  should now be adopted, which on the one hand condemns the crime  in Hebron and on the other, outlines specific measures that  would both promote the security of the Palestinian population in  the occupied territories and clear the way for the resumption of  the talks process. Why do we believe this? Because today those  tiny shoots of trust that had just appeared between the Israelis  and the Palestinians have been seriously damaged."    There then follows a three-minute dispatch from Jerusalem by  correspondent Vladislav Flyarkovskiy, who describes the  situation in the region three weeks on from the Hebron massacre.  Ivanov's interview continues:    "I would like to explain that this resolution contains a  condemnation of the Hebron crime, and an appeal to the Israeli  side to adopt measures to prevent more acts of violence toward  Palestinians. It contains an appeal for measures to be worked  out to ensure the security of Palestinians, including the  sending of this or that international presence. And it contains  an appeal to the two cosponsors -- the United States and Russia  -- to adopt the necessary measures to ensure that the resolution  clauses are implemented, and to promote the continuation of the  peace process."    The final two interview excerpts are interspersed with  Svanidze's own comments and conclusions:    Ivanov continues: "I am not expecting any opposition to the  resolution. There may be certain privately held views about  individual clauses in the preamble to the resolution,  particularly where the references to Jerusalem are concerned,  where the United States will probably abstain. There should be  full unanimity concerning the resolution proper.    "As far as our efforts in the Middle East are concerned, I  repeat that they are currently very carefully thought out, and  they meet our long-term interests."    Svanidze then ends the program with his own comments.</p>

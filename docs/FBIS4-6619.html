			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- The primary opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) criticized Friday [22 April]  policy accords by the ruling coalition parties as a "patchwork"  of different ideas, and declared the LDP and coalition will face  off in the Diet.    LDP President Yohei Kono said the coalition parties "cobbled  up agreements, putting aside policy differences. (The LDP) can  become an offensive... it is important for the party to  streamline its array and press hard on the process of the policy  accords."    Kono also blasted Friday's nomination of Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata, head of the coalition's mainstream party Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party), as its candidate to succeed departing  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation  on April 8. The Diet's prime ministerial elections are  scheduled for Monday.    Kono said if Hata is elected prime minister, his  administration will be "a Shinseito administration rather than a  coalition administration.... There still exists a dual power  structure."    The comment is an apparent criticism of key coalition  strategist Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito secretary general, who led  the grouping into selecting Hata as Hosokawa's successor.    The LDP president also predicted the coalition will founder  over policy discords sooner or later, saying, "it will be  clearer whether the policy accords are essential."    LDP Party Secretary General Yoshiro Mori echoed Kono,  saying,  "the coalition patched up a framework for the present but the  process and contents are complicated. (The LDP) will clarify  differences and inconsistencies of their policies in plenary and  Budget Committee sessions in the Diet."    Masayoshi Takemura, who heads the coalition's small bloc,  new  party Sakigake (Harbinger), had mixed reactions to the accords.    Although praising the policy framework as a whole, Takemura,  who is also chief cabinet secretary, noted ambiguities  concerning issues of national security and the Korean peninsula.    Regarding wording that Japan will actively join U.N. peace  activities, Takemura said, "It can be widely construed as making  it possible for Japan to participate in (combat) activities for  peace because the wording has not spelled out peacekeeping  activities." He also said all 15 Sakigake members will vote for  Hata in the prime ministerial election in the House of  Representatives.    Sakigake, which will reject posts in a new coalition  cabinet,  has pledged to support the new government from outside the  alliance.    The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) harshly criticized the  policy ties. Kazuo Shii, chief of the JCP secretariat, told  reporters the coalition's declaration on an indirect tax hike is  "extremely serious."    "It is irrational to push ahead without seeking the judgment  of voters in election," he said.    On North Korea's alleged nuclear development program, Shii  said, "there is no reason in punishing North Korea while  allowing the United Stated to have nuclear weapons."    In a predawn Friday meeting, seven coalition partners  reached  agreement on major policies after wading through gaps on the two  key issues -- tax system reform and Japan's stance on North  Korea's suspected nuclear development program. The agreement  was a precondition to the nomination Friday afternoon of Hata as  the coalition's official candidate for the premiership.    The eight-month-old coalition government of Hosokawa will  resign en masse Monday morning before the House of  Representatives and the House of Councillors convene vote-taking  plenary sessions.    The seven coalition blocs are the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan New  Party, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), the Democratic  Reform Party, and Kaikaku no Kai, a parliamentary group of LDP  defectors in the lower house.    Hosokawa is resigning to take responsibility for his alleged  involvement in financial scandals that stalled Diet business for  the past two weeks.</p>

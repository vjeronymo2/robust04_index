Moscow Thinks It Is  Time for Azerbaijan To Stop"]    [Text] The foreign ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and  Armenia are scheduled to meet early next week in Moscow. Your  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned this from sources  at the Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry. It is expected that the  negotiators will continue to discuss the Russian plan for a  peaceful settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. So  far, the Russian side has not managed to have all parties to the  conflict approve the plan: Yerevan and Khankendi (Stepanakert)  backed Moscow's initiative in principle, but the Baku  authorities set a precondition for approving the peace plan. In  particular, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov ruled out  a constructive dialogue with the Armenian side until the  republic's occupied territories are liberated. It is precisely  this demand that caused a postponement of the meeting of the  Russian, Azerbaijani, and Armenian presidents scheduled for 25  January. No new date for the summit has so far been announced.    Notably, Moscow's call on the conflicting parties  immediately  to cease fire along the entire front line came at a time when  the Azerbaijani Army regained the initiative for the first time  in many months and managed to advance significantly along the  northern and southern axes. In January, Azerbaijan  reestablished control over settlements in Agdara and Kelbadzhar  districts, which had earlier been occupied by Armenian units,  and also a highway from Agdara to Ter-Ter and Kelbadzhar.  Moreover, according to preliminary reports from the combat  zone, in the past few days Azerbaijani troops came close to the  Kelbadzhar-Lachin road. In the front's southern sector, an  offensive on Fizuli, a district center, continues. To all  appearances, Yerevan and Khankendi did not expect a large-scale  offensive from the Azerbaijani side. According to the  Azerbaijani Defense Ministry, military units made up primarily  of undertrained recruits were urgently moved from Armenia to the  combat area. Despite that, the Armenian side continues to  retreat.    Azerbaijan's military successes have drastically boosted  President Geydar Aliyev's approval rating, and currently it is  clear that Aliyev's New Year promise to the nation that all the  occupied territories will be liberated within a few months was  based on the head of state's firm confidence in the national  army's ability to carry out offensive operations. While  officials in Moscow and Yerevan keep speculating about how  Aliyev managed to strengthen his army within so short a time,  the Baku authorities keep silent and do not rush to deny reports  carried by a whole range of Russian publications that the bulk  of the revitalized army is made up of Afghan mujahidin.  Moscow's urgent appeal to stop combat operations has presented  the Azerbaijani leader with a difficult dilemma: Either to make  concessions and to agree to negotiate with the Armenian side, or  to ignore Russian diplomatic pressure. In the former case  Aliyev risks losing support of the republic's population; in the  latter he might force Moscow to look for different methods of  pressure on the current Azerbaijani leadership.</p>

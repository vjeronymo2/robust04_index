			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Strong UK industrial growth forecast UK manufacturing industry, battered by contraction and plant closures during the 1980s, may be entering its strongest period of growth for 30 years. Forecasts by the London Business School predict that manufacturing output will rise by 4.5 per cent this year and 5.6 per cent in 1995. Manufacturing production from 1994 to 1998 will, according to the school, show an average annual increase of 4.3 per cent. If achieved, that would make it the best five-year period of industrial growth since 1964-68. However, a more gloomy report published yesterday by the National Manufacturing Council - an arm of the Confederation of British Industry - suggests that some of British manufacturing's traditional difficulties, including poor productivity and low investment, may become a barrier to achieving the predicted output growth. Manufacturing productivity, the council said, still lags some 20 per cent to 40 per cent behind output per head in leading foreign economies, and it warned that the gap might grow as economies abroad recovered. 'We need more investment in our plants and people,' the council said in its annual report. It added: 'The rate (of industrial growth) is insufficient to allow Britain to catch up with its main competitors, such as Germany, Japan and the US.' The council added other concerns about a manufacturing recovery, including a historically sluggish rate of investment, slower turnover of stocks than principal competitor countries, a persistent trade deficit in manufactured goods and lower workforce skills than competitor economies. London Business School, taking a more optimistic view, says changes on the supply side of the economy meant that handicaps once dubbed the 'British disease' - low productivity growth, poor industrial relations and a declining share of world trade - were 'a thing of the past'. Improvements in those areas, combined with shifts towards investment and export-led growth and a lower exchange rate, were reasons for expecting that manufacturing industry would perform well. The view that the overall recovery in the UK economy remains strong is supported by Mr Alan Davies, chief economist of Barclays Bank, in the bank's quarterly economic review today.

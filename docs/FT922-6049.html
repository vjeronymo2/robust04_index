			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Spitting contest for grown men - Television Does soccer sometimes seem to you little more than a spitting contest for grown men? Does it strike you as absurd that they spend all that energy producing, typically, a one-nil score? Are you appalled at the way tackled players fling themselves to the ground and go through pantomimes of agony until they realise nobody is watching? Then, like me, your first reaction to the news that ITV was stitched up by BSkyB (or Sky as we shall call it) with the sly assistance of the BBC ('Yes let's sling a brick through their window why don't you') may have been quiet satisfaction. At last they are taking away this infantile exhibition and sticking it on a separate channel where we won't have to watch it. There are, of course, second thoughts. For a start, there is a lot of soccer outside the Premiere League and, as the BBC proved when it lost the athletics and boxing contracts which had previously given it the top contests, it is possible to make fairly impressive bricks with low grade straw, if you happen to be an outstanding programme maker with a lot of experience and a well established tradition of sustaining the sports infrastructure. So, even viewers without a dish are likely to find quite a bit of this awful game still on their screens. Secondly, though the consensus is that Sky has achieved a great coup, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating: Pounds 304m is a huge sum, and not all the big sports deals of recent years have proved profitable to television. Most significantly, perhaps, the deal is the most vivid example yet of what the Thatcherites meant when they talked about bringing free market economics to television. In the very week that the BBC's top management was told yet again that it would have to cut more staff and introduce further economies to justify its claim on the licence fee - Pounds 80 a year, or less than Pounds 6.70 a month for two television channels and five radio networks - we learn from Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sunday Times that, thanks to the Sky coup, 'by next year homes wanting to watch football are likely to be paying an average of Pounds 22 a month for the privilege' to Mr Murdoch's Sky TV. Thus what was, until recently, available as cheap viewing for everybody under the much derided BBC/ITV duopoly is to become a Pounds 22-a-month 'privilege' for those who can afford it. Is this really an improvement in British life? If the deal does work, dish sales do shoot up, and Sky does bring in that pay system, two groups will presumably benefit greatly: the clubs in the Premiere League, and Sky shareholders. . . which include those of us on the FT who took up share options in the parent company, Pearson, long before it became one of Sky's main shareholders. It would be short-sighted or dishonest, or both, to pretend changes of this sort are due exclusively to the actions of politicians. The days of wavelength scarcity with the resultant automatic domination of public service broadcasting are gone. It is possible today to have entire channels dedicated to sports: anyone with a Sky dish pointing at the Astra satellite is already receiving three. The relationship between viewers and, say, football clubs is affected as much by developing technology as by politicians. However, politicians can greatly help or hinder, and it is impossible to avoid the feeling the present lot are intent upon helping outfits such as Sky. I had hoped to be able to turn from soccer to the arts, specifically to BBC2's season under the awkward umbrella title 'Commissions And Collaborations', and declare 'There, you see? Thanks to its popular base that's what the BBC can do, and does do, and ought to be encouraged to go on doing, because nobody else has ever managed to do it better, and nobody else has done it (well or badly) at such low unit costs'. But of course life is rarely so simple: 'Commissions And Collaborations' turns out to be a decidedly odd mixture. Some of its items are certainly fresh and exciting. For instance Cross Channel, a half hour programme choreographed by Lea Anderson and directed by Margaret Williams, is one of the best television dance programmes (dance specifically created for television) that I have ever seen. The all-female Cholmondeleys go to Calais while the all-male Featherstonehaughs camp on the white cliffs of Dover, and around this Anderson creates a delightfully funny ballet of the banal: the men using all the gestures of the car packers on the ferry, the women reading newspapers on the boat, the men building human pyramids the way people do on beaches. Everything works, from the music to the brilliant ice-cream colours, and above all the way in which television is exploited to expand the potential of dance. Location shooting is a huge advantage. At one point the girls, for some reason in white debs' dresses from the 1950s, dance in a hotel corridor in Calais while the boys are performing on the English cliffs: the music is the sole common strand, but that is all that is needed to bridge the Channel. Nearly the same can be said for two or three of the five-minute programmes in the 12-strong Dance House which started last night and is currently appearing each night at 7.55. Programme 5 created by Belinda Neave and Peter Mumford makes good use of television's tricks: slo-mo, constant replay, a sequence in which a dancer goes tumbling down a passage, the invisible edits making it seem as though the passage and consequently the dance are endless. In No. 10 Kim Brandstrup and Ross MacGibbon offer a 5-minute Cinderella, reminding us (and, it must be hoped, some of the other programme makers) that narrative is not something to be ashamed about. Best of all is the last piece, by Aletta Collins which, like Cross Channel, has the advantage of location filming, good music and humour. Too many of the others were made by people who seem to have been unaware that they were working in television. Had they spent an hour watching the pop videos on MTV or Lifestyle's Satellite Jukebox, both available to owners of Astra dishes, they would have seen Wacko Jacko or his sister, or Mylene Farmer, and realised that there is already a lot of dance expertise on television. In The Mystery Of Dr Martinu, Ken Russell appeared to have retrogressed to some point before A Song Of Summer, his unforgettable programme about Delius made for the BBC 24 years ago. The Billboard Project seems downright contrary; it may make sense for a broadcasting organisation to support orchestras since they make programmes, but why pay artists to produce ersatz ads for street hoardings instead of working in television? If artists must be induced to ape advertisements why not television commercials? Artists' Journeys look like conventional art appreciation programmes, the quality depending largely on the charisma and articulacy of the presenter, Avigdor Arikha being inspiring on Velasquez but Jim Dine (next Sunday) somewhat gnomic and private on Munch. These programmes do not look like a carefully planned season, they look like an odd assortment shoved together under one umbrella as an afterthought in the hope of creating extra publicity. Some are good, some are poor, and the billboard exercise seems a questionable way to spend licence fees (assuming that is where the money came from). Despite all that, 'Commissions And Collaborations' contains programmes of a sort which it is difficult to imagine will ever be produced by the sort of organisation which intends to charge you Pounds 22 a month solely to watch soccer.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI WOMEN'S CENTER COUNTS ITS SUCCESSES  </P> <P> Her youngest daughter had just been graduated from high school in 1980 when  Carol Blanchard of Irvine decided to re-enter the work force.  </P> <P> Newly separated after 23 years of marriage, the mother of two children figured  the only option available to her was a return to teaching.  </P> <P> But Blanchard wanted to do something else.  </P> <P> So, like thousands of Orange County women before her and thousands after her,  she turned to the Women's Opportunities Center at UC Irvine, an educational and  personal-support organization designed for women entering the work force or  changing careers.  </P> <P> In the center's job-seekers workshop, Blanchard learned how to produce a resume  that focused on her strengths and talents -- assets that included 20 years of  volunteer fund-raising leadership and organizational work for community groups.  </P> <P> "I learned how to go out and do interviews in new areas of the work world,"  said Blanchard. She had interviews with the managers and account executives of  hotels, insurance companies, a paper company and various city governments.  </P> <P> Then she heard about an entry-level position as assistant director of  development at Chapman College in Orange, a job in which she could tap the  experience and contacts she had developed while doing volunteer work.  </P> <P> Blanchard was hired and eventually promoted to director of development. She  credits the Women's Opportunities Center for helping her make a successful  mid-life career change.  </P> <P> "It gave me direction and confidence to go out and look for something different  and bring out the best in myself," said Blanchard, who left Chapman College in  August and is now doing consulting work for a national nonprofit organization  and several local organizations.  </P> <P> She also has returned to the Women's Opportunities Center, where she is taking  a workshop for women in transition and another on career exploration.  </P> <P> And, as a way of paying back the center for helping her, Blanchard is now using  her fund-raising expertise as a volunteer on a committee planning a major  benefit for the center.  </P> <P> The dinner, scheduled for Oct. 19 at the UCI Bren Events Center, will honor and  celebrate the accomplishments of nine Orange County women who either serve as  role models or have created opportunities for women.  </P> <P> The event is part of a major capital campaign the Women's Opportunities Center  is launching to fund construction of a new 4,000-square-foot facility next to  the Alumni House in the University Extension complex. In support of the  project, University Extension has pledged $450,000, and UCI has allocated the  land. To raise additional funds, the center will sponsor several fund-raising  events throughout the year and is aiming for a ground-breaking ceremony next  winter.  </P> <P> Over the past 19 years, the Women's Opportunities Center has served more than  50,000 people. An average of 500 people a month participate in the center's  vast array of workshops and counseling services.  </P> <P> Success stories abound:  </P> <P> There's Judy Howard of Costa Mesa, who took the center's Managerial Skills  Certificate Program after staying at home to raise her children and is now  director of an adult retirement village in Irvine.  </P> <P> There's Karen Packer, who went through the job-seekers clinic and used her many  years of experience as a volunteer in Democratic politics to land a  middle-management job at Edward's Laboratory in Irvine. She then went into  advertising at Beckman Instruments in Fullerton and is now working in  advertising in North Carolina.  </P> <P> There's Kim Israelsky of Irvine, who was new to Orange County when she signed  up for the job-seekers clinic. When she went out on the required informational  interview -- the course requires participants to get their feet wet by meeting  with an employer in a field they may be interested in -- Israelsky was hired on  the spot by St. John Knits of Irvine. The company created a job for her selling  a line of matching accessories.  </P> <P> And there's the out-of-state woman, who was recently divorced from her doctor  husband and living out of the family station wagon with her two young children  when she entered the program. Given a scholarship to the job-seekers clinic,  she landed a job as a medical technologist and later found similar work in  Oregon.  </P> <P> After two decades of operation, the center is not only still going strong, it  is, as administrator and volunteer coordinator Gabrielle Hickling says,  "bursting at the seams."  </P> <P> Currently operating out of a cramped, 700-square-foot office in the University  Extension building, the center must hold its workshops and classes in  increasingly limited "borrowed space" at the university and in nearby churches  and libraries.  </P> <P> In a county rated as the 16th largest economy in the world and the fifth  largest high-tech complex in the United States, center officials say the demand  for career planning and job-training resources is burgeoning.  </P> <P> "On one end of the spectrum we help keep women off of welfare, and on the other  end we counsel women in top-management positions," said Elaine Hart, the  center's executive director. "Once we have larger facilities, we'll immediately  be able to triple the amount of clients we serve. We have the professional  staff, and we have the clients. Our problem is we are limited by space only."  </P> <P> Hart said the center has clients who come from as far away as Los Angeles,  Riverside and San Diego counties. She said they also have received inquiries  from around the country -- and even from Sweden -- requesting information on  how to start a similar program.  </P> <P> The Women's Opportunities Center was formed in 1970 after the late Alice (Lou)  Anderson, who was University Extension's program director for humanities, and  Sylvia Lenhoff (now director of the university's Office of Relations With  Schools and Colleges) noticed an increasing number of women returning to school  and trying to enter the work force.  </P> <P> "Both Sylvia and Lou felt these women needed support on the university campus  as they were returning back to school much older than the average student,"  said Hart. "They also needed counseling about the kinds of classes that would  give them the most direct route to what they wished to accomplish. And then, as  they became successful in their studies, these women realized they needed  career counseling as well."  </P> <P> Although the center's focus has always been on women, it is open to everyone.  However, only 2% of the clients are men, most of whom come to the center for  Career and Vocational Aptitude Testing, a 4-hour battery of tests that helps  determine job suitability.  </P> <P> The center is funded through membership fees ($25 a year), nominal fees charged  for workshops and seminars, community donations and corporate grants. Since it  is nonprofit, Hart said, fees are often reduced and waived at the request of  clients in need.  </P> <P> The center, which has no full-time staff members -- even Hart and Hickling work  part time -- boasts a staff of 76 volunteer professionals from a variety of  fields who run workshops, counsel clients and serve as support staff.  </P> <P> The center offers counseling on all levels -- from career and educational  awareness to the legal aspects of divorce, a course taught by Corona del Mar  attorney Pat Herzog. "We're just really blessed with having a lot of community  support from professionals who donate their services to us to help these  people," said Hart.  </P> <P> Among several dozen workshop topics offered throughout the year are:  self-esteem, self-awareness, assertion training, overcoming computer anxiety,  exploring new career options, "Women Who Love Too Much" and "Do I Want a  Divorce?"  </P> <P> Two of the center's most popular offerings are the job-seekers clinic and the  Managerial Skills Certificate Program, which Hart says helps women put  themselves in "a position where they will be able to break through into more  management type of responsibilities." The program requires taking six core  classes offered through University Extension in addition to 26 Saturday classes  dealing with practical issues of management taught by Joan Klubnik, a career  specialist with TransAmerica Occidental Insurance Co. in Los Angeles. The next  orientation meeting to explain the program will be held at the center from 6 to  8 p.m. on March 16.  </P> <P> In recent years, Hart has become aware of an increasing number of working women  who want to make career changes.  </P> <P> "We're seeing some of those women we saw in the '70s who wanted to go back to  school and get started in a career now wanting to change careers or go on into  higher management positions," she said. "Working Women magazine says 52% of the  work force now is women and only about 6% (of them) are top managers. We're  working to help those women maximize their potential, to reach as high in their  careers as possible. We do the same for men, but they don't seem to need us as  much as women do. It's a new game for women.  </P> <P> "I think the center has been really instrumental in Orange County in helping  women to network successfully. Those who have made it are reaching down to the  hands of their sister and helping her up the ladder, too."  </P> <P> Hart, who started at the center as a volunteer in 1974 and has been executive  director since 1983, said the feeling in the beginning was that the Women's  Opportunities Center eventually would be phased out.  </P> <P> "That's what we had hoped -- that we would meet a temporary need -- but with  the growing number of dual-career families and the high cost of living in this  area, more and more women have to work," she said. "The need will always be  there."  </P></p>

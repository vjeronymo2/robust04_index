			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Leading Article: So here it is, a merry Xmas This will probably turn out to have been the most economically depressed year for the world economy since the second world war, but that is not how it will be recorded in the economic history books. Just as 1973 has become the year of the oil shock, the beginning of a number of years of stagflationary misery, so 1993 may be remembered as the year in which the world economic community finally completed the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation, thus beginning a new era of free trade and rising prosperity. Of course, 1973 is not only remembered for the quadrupling of oil prices. It was also the year in which Poland eliminated England from the World Cup and Slade, a British rock group, cemented a tradition of seasonal hits by taking a Christmas pop song to the top of the charts. The power of Opec to influence oil prices has waned since then, but Slade's Christmas song remains as popular in 1993 as it was 20 years ago. Indeed, casual research suggests that it has been particularly popular at this year's City of London Christmas parties. No one can blame equity market dealers, as they celebrate the fruits of London's continuing bull market, from crossing their fingers and singing along: So here it is, merry Christmas Everybody's having fun Look to the future now It's only just begun Yet can the stock market really do as well in 1994 as in 1993, a year in which the FT-SE 100 Index has risen by 16 per cent, closing last night at 3,337.1? Or does the combination of relatively sluggish recoveries, rising taxes and high price-earnings ratios on both sides of the Atlantic spell danger? Mixed signals City opinion is split. Traders, and clients of Goldman Sachs, may take comfort from analysis provided by Sushil Wadhwani, the investment bank's equity analyst, who continues to point out that, using historical bond-equity yield ratios, UK equities appear 20 per cent under-valued. Others are much more pessimistic. 'It's all very uncomfortable,' says Robin Aspinall of brokers Panmure Gordon, 'but at least I can guarantee that 1994 will see a return to 2900.' Yet the bull market continues to roar. The FT-SE 100 gained 2.3 per cent this week alone, despite mixed signals about the pace of UK recovery from output and retail sales. Perverse as it may seem, the fact that 1993 has turned out to be such a disappointing year for economic growth across the industrialised world helps to explain why equity markets have performed so well. Slow growth and low inflation have pushed short-term interest rates down on both sides of the Atlantic, encouraging investors to move out of cash in search of real returns. Bonds have benefited most from this pool of income-seeking liquidity, but equity yields have also surged ahead in every major market except Japan. Big unknown Can it last? For the UK stock market, the big unknown is whether economic growth will eventually resume at historic rates without a surge in inflation. If so, the scope for higher dividends combined perhaps with a rise in bond yields as growth accelerates should be enough to return the yield ratio to its historic level. But an upturn in inflation alone would also lift the yield ratio by raising long-term rates and, if short rates also rise, could send shares falling. Then again, perhaps historic relationships between bonds and equities are no longer a good guide to the future. A prolonged period of low growth could rule out the kind of earnings growth which would be needed to justify current price-earnings ratios. In Britain, the immediate threat of a sudden rise in bond yields seems non-existent. Underlying inflation is falling and the labour market remains depressed. Short-term UK interest rates are more likely to go down than up. If there is an inflationary risk to UK equities, it comes from the US where growth is stronger and the Federal Reserve may soon raise short-term interest rates. A sharp US increase could dry up the flow of US money into Europe, while falls on Wall Street would also be felt across the Atlantic. But with US inflation still subdued, any rise in short rates is likely to be a statement of intent rather than a sign of imminent danger. US bonds could even rally as a result. Nor does slow growth on the European continent spell too much danger for UK equities so long as the Bundesbank continues to push interest rates lower. Not surprisingly, the pace of domestic recovery remains the greatest risk for UK equities. Britain's long-term economic weaknesses - low investment, decaying infrastructure and inadequate skills - have not gone away, despite the statistical fog which currently surrounds the trade figures. But the immediate threat is that growth will be too slow, not too fast, over the first half of this decade. Investors may well be persuaded that lower UK interest rates will offset the effects of tax increases, and that slow growth of disposable incomes will postpone recovery rather than abort it. But how far into the future are they being asked to peer?</p>

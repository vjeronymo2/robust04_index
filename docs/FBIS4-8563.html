The integration structures of Europe and America such as,  for  example, the Partnership for Peace project, the Organization of  American States, NATO and the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) were also discussed, Posada said, adding that  Columbia was interested in joining NAFTA.    The two ministers discussed bilateral Czech-Colombian  relations. Posada mentioned the prospects of concluding mutual  agreements, especially an agreement on investment protection.  The necessity of strengthening concrete cooperation between the  two countries' businessmen and cooperation in the cultural  sphere was stressed.    At the end of their meeting Posada presented Zieleniec with  Order of St. Charles, the civic distinction which the Colombian  Foreign Ministry awards to foreigners contributing to the  development of relations with Columbia.

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBILE-HOME RULING UPHELD  </P> <P> Carson City Clerk Helen Kawagoe's decision to invalidate an initiative petition  against the city's mobile-home rent control law has been upheld by a state  appellate court.  </P> <P> In the decision, handed down Monday, the judges ruled that Kawagoe was correct  in throwing out more than 200 signatures. Kawagoe's disqualifications left the  petition short of the 10% of registered voters needed to qualify a measure for  the ballot.  </P> <P> The measure would have retained existing rent control for mobile-home tenants  meeting federal poverty guidelines while phasing them out for others over a  two-year period.  </P> <P> Park owners, who supported the petition drive, argued that the city's rent  control ordinance prevents them from making a fair profit. Mobile-home owners  say they would not be able to pay steep increases in rent for their spaces.  </P> <P> Kawagoe, who lives in a Carson mobile-home park, said she felt vindicated by  the decision.  </P></p>

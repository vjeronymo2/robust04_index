			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP AND PHOTOGRAPHY'S 150TH;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER SERRANO AND MAPPLETHORPE WORKS OVERSHADOWS OBSERVANCES OF THE  FORM'S SESQUICENTENNIAL  </P> <P> Although no "Eureka!" accompanied the invention of photography, which literally  took centuries to evolve, commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the  medium's arrival probably seemed like a good idea. Even arbitrarily chosen  anniversaries or birthdays can serve as cultural speed bumps, usefully slowing  the daily rush of living to open at least a momentary space for thought. And  the selection of 1839 as photography's official starting date -- it was the  year Henry Fox Talbot, in London, and Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre, in Paris,  announced nearly simultaneous technological breakthroughs -- is certainly  reasonable.  </P> <P> Yet, as the highly publicized sesquicentennial year comes to a close, it's hard  not to feel that opportunities have been missed. Despite the seemingly endless  paeons to and probings of the subject, via exhibitions and books both here and  abroad, it turns out that the most memorable and revealing event of all was  wholly unplanned and virtually unanticipated.  </P> <P> I'm referring, of course, to the still-raging arguments over photographs by  Andres Serrano and, especially, the late Robert Mapplethorpe. As recently as  the beginning of this month, County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich fanned the  political flames by throwing his support behind North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms  and Long Beach Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who want to muzzle art, artists  and museums that receive federal funds. Ironically, this fetid dispute  discloses more about the complex revolution begun by photography's nominal  invention than have most any of the celebratory exhibitions specially organized  to tell the tale.  </P> <P> Nationally, four shows have sought to encompass the full sweep of photographic  history. Chronological surveys have so far been mounted by the J. Paul Getty  Museum, a team composed of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and London's Royal  Academy, and another that paired Washington's National Gallery with the Art  Institute of Chicago. The quartet will be squared off in February, when New  York's Museum of Modern Art will weigh in with its version of "Photography  Until Now."  </P> <P> The National Gallery and Art Institute show, "On the Art of Fixing a Shadow,"  has been traveling the year and opens Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum  of Art. I haven't yet seen the exhibition, but the capacious, profusely  illustrated catalogue leads me to expect a resplendent exhibition stuffed with  arresting images arranged in provocative and insightful ways -- until, that is,  its unbroken chain of Greatest Hits devolves into chaos and confusion somewhere  around 1965.  </P> <P> Why then? Here's a clue to understanding the mid-'60s crack-up in photography's  seamless story: "Andy Warhol: A Retrospective." Yes, Warhol, the Prince of Pop.  The painter.  </P> <P> Organized by MoMA, this mammoth exhibition was the single best historical show  of photography I saw during the sesquicentennial year, and it came out of the  museum's department of painting and sculpture, not its department of  photography. And that loopy dislocation is very much the point. While only  slowly being understood, intricate and far-reaching questions about the  relationships between painting and photography are crucial to grasp.  </P> <P> To make his paintings, Warhol built on the precedent of Robert Rauschenberg,  who had been using a variety of printing techniques in his work since the  mid-1950s. Warhol would begin by clipping an existing picture from a newspaper,  a magazine, a sales catalogue or another published source. In short, he would  begin by literally taking a photograph. Next, the purloined photo would be  copied, enlarged and transferred onto a silk screen, creating a kind of crude  negative. Finally, the image would be printed by hand onto the surface of a  canvas.  </P> <P> Marilyn, Elvis, the electric chair, race riots, car crashes -- from the 1960s  on, Warhol's art was about many things. Among the most important was the deadly  tension it embodied, a tension between our culture's hidebound commitment to  aristocratic ideals and our proud declarations of egalitarian democracy. In  Warhol's work these twin poles are often represented by the painting's subject  -- Elvis, say, who is both Southern white trash and "The King," or Marilyn  Monroe, the troubled orphan impersonating a goddess.  </P> <P> Yet, the poles are also represented by Warhol's conflicted choice of mediums,  which speaks eloquently of our conventional regard for painting as the highest  of High Art and for tabloid and publicity photographs as the Peoples' Junk.  Photography, always a second-class citizen in the stratified community of  artistic mediums, had long since occupied a seat at the back of the bus. And  Warhol, who had grown up the gay son of Polish-Catholic, working-class  immigrants in a rough, Pennsylvania coal-mining neighborhood, no doubt had  developed certain intuitive sensitivities to matters of prejudice and social  class.  </P> <P> Warhol's 1964 painting, "Sixteen Jackies," which repeats in nearly random  arrangement six different photographs taken by the press on the day of the  Kennedy assassination, has been included in "On the Art of Fixing a Shadow."  The show thus takes note of this odd fact of modern artistic life: In order for  its implications to be fully seen and taken seriously, photography, the most  pervasive form of imagery the world has ever known, necessarily had to  masquerade as painting.  </P> <P> Before Warhol, you couldn't see the photographic forest for the aesthetic  trees. After, there's not much point in trying. Given the cataclysmic bombshell  that was pop art, any neatly ordered history of subsequent photography could be  expected to crumble.  </P> <P> As well it should. From Julia Margaret Cameron and Nadar in the 19th Century to  Garry Winogrand and Diane Arbus into the '60s, not to mention the countless  important stops in between, a compelling case could be made -- has been made --  for photography as a distinct, self-enclosed medium marked by issues wholly  unique from any other tool an artist might use. Such a history of the first  100-odd years could plausibly be written because, right from the moment of its  inception, photography was branded an unfavored stepchild among artistic  mediums, as battles raged over whether or not it was really art.  </P> <P> As surely as any innocent kid disfigured by youthful trauma, photographic  history was marked. It's pretty late in the day to be pressing those formalist  arguments now, and I'm not saying that's what any of the four big surveys have  actually attempted. But neither has any one of them used the anniversary  platform for a full-scale overhaul based on post-formalist points of view.  </P> <P> Two shows that coincided with photography's sesquicentennial did indeed  recognize the full scope of this rupture. Both took an expansive view of  post-1960s developments in the revolution initiated by the camera and didn't  limit themselves by medium.  </P> <P> The Museum of Contemporary Art's big summer show, "A Forest of Signs: Art in  the Crisis of Representation," did a good job in sorting through the mixed-up  landscape of camera-images that has turned our culture into a mesmerizing hall  of mirrors. In New York, meanwhile, the Whitney Museum's current "Image World:  Art and Media Culture" gets hopelessly lost trying to traverse the tangled  field.  </P> <P> Still, in their difficult assessments of the nature of art in the age of  mechanical and electronic reproduction, both shows refuse to segregate  photographs and video from paintings and sculptures. The abundance of strong  work made each an embarrassment of riches.  </P> <P> "A Forest of Signs" was significant for another reason. It made a persuasive  case for the number of women who, as artists coming to maturity in the 1970s,  critically used the typically disenfranchised medium of photography as an  aesthetic parallel to their own second-class status as women. Cindy Sherman,  Sherrie Levine, Barbara Kruger and others have turned their art toward sharply  outlining certain ugly contours of our culture's deeply held, but nonetheless  enslaving, conventions. Men, we're still content covertly to believe, are  seminal producers, while women are rather like the lowly camera: Their chief  function is to reproduce.  </P> <P> Clearly, the revolution that surrounds the invention of photography is complex.  Among its more simple, and therefore more profound, transformations was a  radical alteration in the profile of precisely who could make and circulate  pictures. Before photography, most all images were made by working artists --  which is to say, artists who worked for patrons, and who made pictures  according to those patrons' tastes.  </P> <P> After photography, and especially in the "Instamatic" world we now inhabit,  anyone can (and does) make pictures.  </P> <P> The unruliness of post-1960s art, and of photography's place within it, is in  some respects simply a final echo of this earlier transformation. Peace and  prosperity reigned, at least for some, when imagery chiefly represented the  authoritative class that held the power. Photography opened the door to the  disheveled and unruly mob. Suddenly, the face of Everyman could enter into  art's exalted picture alongside representations of earlier Medicis and Popes.  So, one good way to keep the riffraff discredited and at bay was loudly to  proclaim: Sorry, but photography isn't art.  </P> <P> Things have gotten more sophisticated, or at least more cleverly disguised,  since then. Last summer, when the exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe's  photographs came under attack for including pictures described by Sen. Helms as  homoerotic, the neoconservative critic Hilton Kramer denounced the pictures as  pornography, then turned heel and upheld their status as art, albeit "failed  art, pernicious art." Kramer, who has assumed the burdensome duty of becoming  the Tipper Gore of modern art, is apparently convinced that these photographs  will scare the horses.  </P> <P> "What has made them a public issue," Kramer wrote in the New York Times, "is  the demand that is now being made to accord these hitherto forbidden images the  status of perfectly respectable works of art, to exhibit them without  restriction in public institutions, and to require our government to provide  funds for their public exhibition."  </P> <P> Forbidden, status, respectability, restriction ... of all the moralizing words  Kramer chose to define the social aspects of the issue, the most revealing, I  think, are in the closing volley, where our government is faced with funding  their exhibition. It's us against them, Kramer plainly suggests, and it's easy  to see who is who. The argument is political. It's neoconservative status vs.  forbidden liberalism. And, given Mapplethorpe's photographs, it's heteroerotic  respectability vs. homoerotic restrictions.  </P> <P> This latter battle is what lies at the heart of the appalling compromise  legislation in Congress, whereby the National Endowment for the Arts has been  barred from funding art they consider "obscene," including works depicting  homoeroticism. Drawing a legislative equation between obscenity and  homoeroticism is flatly repugnant and tantamount to a legal sanction for gay  bashing.  </P> <P> That passage of this legislation was greeted by the art world with some relief  is also a sign that, as 1990 looms, it's still perfectly respectable for at  least one group of American citizens to be the official object of public  prejudice. As photography's sesquicentennial party comes to an end, with the  Mapplethorpe scandal the most memorable event, it's not a pretty picture.  </P></p>

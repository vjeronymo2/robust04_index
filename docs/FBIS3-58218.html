Pangalos  briefed Niles on the positions of the Greek presidency of the  European Union [EU]. During the meeting, Pangalos and Niles  also discussed the upcoming meeting between U.S. President Bill  Clinton, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, and EU Commission  President Jacques Delors. In a statement after the meeting, the  U.S. ambassador stressed that there is complete agreement on the  issues Greece is planning to promote during the six months in  which it will exercise the EU presidency. Niles stressed that  the Yugoslav dispute is one of the priority issues, and he  expressed U.S. support for the ongoing UN efforts, through the  mediation of Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, for a peaceful  settlement. He also expressed the opinion that there will be no  disagreement between the United States and the EU on settling  the problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He added, however, that we  should also wait for the results of the tripartite meeting  mediated by Stoltenberg and Lord Owen.</p>

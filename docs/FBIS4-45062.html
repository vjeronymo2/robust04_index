			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Ala' al-Din Mustafa: "Investment Funds As A </F> Vehicle to Attract Small Savings"]    [Text] Investment [mutual] funds, which will play an  important and effective role in the Egyptian economy in the near  future, are currently the subject of wide-scale debate.    One of the many advantages offered by the funds is that they  channel their money into portfolios of securities such as  treasury notes, bonds, bank certificates, and stocks in order to  spread risk and guarantee suitable returns for investment fund  stockholders. The success of the funds depends primarily on  being managed efficiently and on the soundness of the economic  climate as well as on the availability of the "goods" in which  these funds trade--i.e., stocks, bonds, treasury notes, etc.  They are limited by the availability of securities in the  market. In other words, the supply of these "goods" should be  increased in order to help mobilize savings and channel them  into this new vehicle, just introduced to the Egyptian market,  in a manner consistent with Egyptian economic conditions at this  stage of economic liberalization.  <H5>  An Effective Tool of Prosperity and Affluence </H5>   Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz, president of the Federation of  Egyptian  Banks and chairman of the National Bank, sees investment funds  as new mobilization vehicles that address small investors who  lack experience or who are averse to risk and who are unable to  keep track of the capital market. Furthermore, such funds are  suitable for our conditions in Egypt because they allow their  investors to liquidate them when they wish. Investors are able  in the early stages to redeem their investment certificates at  their true value.    The funds are managed by experts who are fully knowledgeable  of market conditions. A fund, in return for investor money,  would issue financial papers in the form of investment  certificates of equal par value which may range from 10 to 1,000  pounds.    The banks, by creating such funds, play an important role in  attracting small savers to a new type of investment and in  preparing them to tolerate risk and invest in the capital market.    Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz believes that the funds would be able  to  increase the supply of goods in the market by purchasing the  stock of companies being privatized by the government, and  thereby broaden the trading base and help expedite the drive  towards privatization.    At this point in time, investment funds could effectively  help create a state of boom and prosperity by mobilizing small  savings and channeling them into the purchase of diversified  portfolios of stocks, bonds, and treasury notes, etc. That would  create a state of affluence within the framework of an  integrated banking strategy to invigorate the capital market.    The banks, in turn, would guarantee the securities,  publicize  companies wishing to issue financial papers, and assure the  liquidity of those papers to the extent of 80 percent of their  value. That would create conditions of prosperity and would make  direct investment attractive to small savers, thereby boosting  the capital market which is an important bulwark of any economic  liberalization policy.  <H5>  Investing With Calculated Risk </H5>   Dr. Hamid al-Sayih, former economic minister and chairman of  Egyptian-British Bank, said:    "The essence of investment funds is that they invest in a  variety of financial papers. Let us consider the capital market  in Egypt. Despite vigorous attempts at stimulation, it remains  practically barren of an adequate mix of financial papers such  as stocks, bonds, etc.    "That is caused by several factors such as compounded  factors  of the past, closed-door policies, and forbidding stock  companies to issue financial papers. Furthermore, the capital  market was closed for a long time before it re-opened. The end  result was not simply the loss of the capital, or investment,  market. We also lost the expertise needed to operate such a  market.    "But the open-door policy was officially inaugurated 20  years  ago with the promulgation of Law No. 43 of 1943 and it follows  that the capital market should have grown and prospered over  those 20 years, resulting in an expanding supply of financial  papers and other instruments. The capital market is concerned  not only with securities but also with numerous other  activities, such as financial leasing that could provide an  appropriate capital market for Egyptian securities.    "The concept of investment funds...funds are created because  a large segment of investors lacks the expertise to trade on the  exchange and to evaluate financial papers. A fund therefore  issues a single certificate that represents a portfolio of  financial papers that investors can then acquire.    "To do so, a fund must have access to large quantities of  various financial papers in order to allow it to spread its risk.    "Funds may deal in foreign financial papers but this calls  for a great deal of expertise and requires domestic licensing,  monitoring, and oversight. That is why the Capital Market Law  has closely regulated the funds wherever they may be created."  <H5>  Providing an Appropriate Investment Climate </H5>   Dr. Hamid al-Sayih added:    "The question now is whether the time has come to create  effectual investment funds. We must realize that few  corporations offer securities in the capital market and that  most stock companies are closed. This problem may ease in the  future as the propensity to invest picks up momentum.    "Secondly, the government should issue bonds rather than  treasury notes. Interest on the bonds could be either fixed or  variable. The bonds could be of medium term (three to five  years) or long-term of up to 10 years. The supply of goods on  the capital market would therefore increase whenever the  government acts but the options would still be limited, making  it difficult for the funds to find an appropriate mix of  financial papers in which to invest."    Dr. al-Sayih explained that the issue at hand is to create a  suitable investment climate, especially since the advanced  nations are competing for investments and since the countries of  Eastern Europe are considered advanced because of their ample  supplies of scientific and technical labor. The developing  countries and those of the Third World therefore face intense  competition in their efforts to attract foreign investments.  <H5>  Funds Offer Several Benefits </H5>   Misr Bank chairman 'Isam al-Ahmadi said:    "Many benefits and objectives may be realized through the  creation of investment funds. These benefits extend to the  sponsoring bank as well as to investors, to the capital market,  and to the national economy as a whole. The experiences of the  Americans, the British, and the French have proved the efficacy  of those instruments in helping create strong and vigorous  capital markets as well as in boosting individual wealth and  quality of life.    "But such funds can exist only in an appropriate investment  climate and that requires legislative and taxation groundwork as  well as capital market regulations. Steps in that direction have  already been taken and we are hopeful for even more  streamlining. This also requires public awareness and confidence  in the banking system and in the instruments it creates.    "Numerous benefits will accrue to those in dealings with  investment funds. We, on our part, will launch educational  campaigns to explain the relationship between fund and client;  how to purchase fund shares and how to sell them and redeem  them; how the return on investment will be computed; and the  manner in which the value of the financial paper is to be  calculated. This would help us attract clients to this new  investment vehicle by building their confidence in its quality."    'Isam al-Ahmadi added: "We would like to note that  investment certificates primarily target small savers since the  certificates are issued in increments of 1,000 pounds, allowing  any small saver or small investor to tap them rather than turn  to savings accounts, bank certificates, and other instruments of  bank deposits. Savers whose only choice has heretofore been bank  deposits would have available several investment options.  <H5>  Expanding the Trading Base </H5>   "A most important advantage of mutual funds is that they  make  it possible for small savers to enter the capital market which  has so far been a monopoly of large investors and the wealthy.  Investment certificates would reduce and spread investment risk  through diversification and through timing by investors.  Investor desires will determine which financial papers are to be  held by the fund. The higher the return investors seek the more  risk they would be willing to assume. Risk may be minimized to  the extent of diversification among corporate stocks, treasury  bonds and notes, and bank certificates. Investment in stock  usually involves higher risk.    "Investment funds provide other benefits and help achieve  other objectives, such as helping the Egyptian economy achieve  the important goal of privatization. By expanding and  invigorating the capital market and increasing its efficacy, it  would be possible to expand the ownership base for companies  whose shares are offered through investment funds. Companies  targeted for privatization will therefore find strong demand for  the shares they offer as well as a real market that would absorb  those shares at fair prices.    "As to the capital market--and this is another benefit of  mutual funds--invigorating the securities market is both an  objective in itself as well as a means. A strong capital market  would make it possible for the economic reform program to  achieve its objectives, particularly in the areas of  privatization, expanding the ownership base, and getting the  citizenry involved in the economic activities of the state.    "With that in mind, Misr Bank has created a mutual fund  capitalized at 25 million pounds and whose investments amount to  500 million pounds. Its investment certificates will be offered  to the public over time and it will maintain enough cash on hand  to cover redemption demands. As stipulated by law, the fund will  not put more than 10 percent of its investments in any one  company nor will it acquire more than 15 percent of any one  company's shares outstanding."  <H5>  Creating New Instruments </H5>   Dr. Midhat Hasanayn, professor of Economics and Banking at  American University in Cairo, opined that "mutual funds are  nothing new but go back at least 15 years. They are a  risk-reducing instrument. While more risky than bank  certificates of deposit, they offer the least risk of investment  instruments because they guarantee a return in addition to the  original capital.    "Mutual funds were conceived as a middle ground between bank  deposits and investments in equity and debt securities. Ranked  by degree of risk, bank deposits provide the least risk,  followed by treasury notes that guarantee investors a return in  addition to the principal but are illiquid and must be held to  maturity. In that sense, bank deposits are less risky.    "The third investment rank is stock company bonds that pay  fixed or variable interest but one must wait for that interest a  quarter to a year. Bonds attain liquidity through the stock  exchange.    "The fourth investment instrument, which entails the highest  risk, is company stock.    "Mutual funds were therefore conceived as a middle ground  between bank deposits and stock exchange securities. The  clientele of mutual funds are primarily small savers who may  lack expertise. Funds collect investor savings and thereby  accumulate the cash they need to assemble a diversified  portfolio of stocks, bonds, treasury notes, and bank deposits.  Funds provide their shareholders with liquidity but at net asset  value at time of redemption."  <H5>  Restructuring the Capital Market </H5>   Economist Dr. Muhsin al-Khudari said that "mutual funds are  one of the main tools of creating new securities in an operation  called "papering." This takes the form of bonds underlying  various types of revenue-producing assets whose returns  accumulate automatically or are paid out in fixed or variable  sums depending on the fund manager's orientation.    "Funds are attempts by financial systems to create  comprehensive and integrated service portfolios. Their returns  are higher than those offered by banks, but they are associated  with a degree of calculated risk managed with instruments and  techniques that are well-known to fund managers. Funds have  therefore been created to meet the needs of risk-taking  individuals who seek high returns and who are willing to accept  risks in the process."    Dr. Muhsin al-Khudari points out certain caveats that must  be  kept in mind when selecting fund managers. Above all else, they  should possess a high degree of skill and expertise, even  preceded by loyalty and esprit de corps. This would presuppose  scrutiny by various law and order apparats since these fund  managers will have access to great amounts of cash with which  they can manipulate the markets or do harm to them. This may be  averted by not allowing any individual to have single control of  a fund but to vest such control in operating teams with highly  developed patriotism, sincerity, and technical expertise."  <H5>  Diversified Portfolios </H5>   Banking expert Nazir Yusif said: "Investment funds are a  financial amalgam whose investors are issued shares or  certificates, as defined by law, that are valued at no more than  1,000 pounds each. There is no limit to the number of  certificates that may be acquired.    "A fund's management may invest its cash in a portfolio  composed of the stocks of existing companies or of those that  are being privatized. It may also buy bonds or treasury notes to  diversity the portfolio and therefore spread the risk since  stocks that appreciate will cushion the price declines of others  in the portfolio.    "Funds also maintain enough cash on hand in order to meet  redemption requests for the certificates they issue in case  investors want their money back. This is called open-investment  funds.    "Shares in other types of funds, the closed-end kind, are  traded on the stock exchange. This is the main difference  between the two.    "Funds were born in the Gulf countries despite their small  market size and their countries' lack of regulatory controls  such as those promulgated by the Capital Markets Law No.95 of  1992. However, there are attempts to regulate the Saudi market  against broker speculation and manipulation. It is imperative,  therefore, to begin monitoring the market and not to hesitate to  introduce adjustments or additional regulations in order to  control the capital market in Egypt and help it grow.  <H5>  Guarantees to Safeguard Fund Monies </H5>   Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki, former economic minister and chairman  of International Arab Banking Corporation, said that "investment  funds are a new activity in Egyptian markets and play a tangible  role in energizing financial paper transactions and in  attracting small investors to participate in financial activity  by subscribing to the certificates issued by the funds. The  funds relieve small investors of effort and worry resulting from  the lack of know-how or financial expertise to invest their  savings in financial markets. Fund managements will assume, on  behalf of their shareholders, the tasks of purchasing,  diversifying, and maintaining their portfolios as well as  distributing the quarterly or annual dividend, as the case may  be, in accordance with their holdings in their fund.    "Numerous controls have been promulgated by Capital Markets  Law No. 95 of 1992 in order to safeguard depositor monies. For  example, the Mutual Fund Creation Law stipulates that  establishers of a fund are prohibited from managing that fund.  The law also stipulates that the investment company investors  are the ones to create the fund. Certificate holders are the  ones to finance the fund. A fund owner, while buying securities  for other certificate holders, would probably buy certain  securities for himself. Therefore, the end-result would favor  the interest of fund owners.    "The law has devised a solution to this so-called conflict  of  interest between fund investors and fund depositors or  certificate holders. That solution is to prohibit investment  funds from managing the portfolios of fund subscribers. That is  the purpose of the law that regulates fund management companies.    "Banks that created investment funds have simultaneously  created companies to manage those funds. A company that manages  a fund is totally separate from it. An investment fund owns but  does not manage, whereas a management company only manages and  does not own."  <H5>  Creating New Financial Papers </H5>   Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki added: "Furthermore, investment funds,  by their nature, have the advantage of dealing in large  assortments of financial papers in order to spread risk. They  buy financial papers in various sectors such as agriculture,  industry, tourism, shipping, and other activities.    "In addition, the Egyptian capital market still enjoys an  advantage, in that it is, by its composition, free of  speculation in the sense that the so-called buy-and-sell  capability neither rests on the investor nor is a function of  future markets. That is an on-going external operation. The  reasons for security market collapses on international  exchanges, such as Black Monday and subsequent events, is  attributed to this type of trading activity. It is preferable  not to introduce this type of trading into the Egyptian market  in the future. I am constantly warning against copycatting  others in violation of our own nature, customs, and traditions.  This is the way to avoid creating elements that could cause  market turbulence or collapse.    "Several factors can shield the market against such risks  and  they constitute safeguards to protect the fortunes of those who  trade in the market."    Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki moved on to another point dealing with  the natural structure of the market. He said that the Egyptian  market is still limited in the quantity of papers in circulation  and that, of course, is a burden on the banks. By contrast,  bonds constitute a major segment of international markets. In  the United States, for instance, we find bonds of various types  and maturities ranging from six months to 30 years.</p>

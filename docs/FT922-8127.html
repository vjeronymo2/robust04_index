			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / BBC launches subscriber service BBC SELECT, the subscription television service of the BBC, may launch family educational programmes including language tuition for children. A pilot programme on French for children aged seven to 11 has been produced, and talks on collaboration have started with publishers. Ms Angie Mason, senior commissioning editor for education at BBC Select, said: 'It's a question of which publishers we decide to go with.' She was speaking after the official launch of BBC Select, which plans to use spare capacity on BBC 1 and BBC 2 transmitters in the early hours to broadcast specialist programmes to businesspeople, accountants, lawyers, farmers and yacht owners. Ms Mason believes BBC Select may have identified a gap in the market by delivering a range of educational programmes direct to the home. The first BBC Select subscription service - the Executive Business Club - will start broadcasting on May 27. Professor Graham Robinson, chairman of the service, said yesterday he expected to reach Pounds 2m turnover in its first year of operation. Prof Robinson said he had 131 clients including three high street banks and Prudential Assurance. The charge for a company intending to make copies of the training programmes available to 2,000 staff is less than Pounds 10,000 a year. Meridian Television, which defeated TVS in last year's competitive tenders for ITV licences, has lost its director of news and regional programmes. Ms Dianne Nelmes resigned yesterday and said that after setting up programme structures and hiring key people she did not wish to remain.</p>

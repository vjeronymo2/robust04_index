			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Detroit, March 14 (XINHUA) - President Bill Clinton,  opening the jobs summit of the Group of Seven nations here  today, urged Japan and Europe to stimulate their economies for  jobs creation.    In his speech, the President hinted that the restrictions of  domestic demand in Japan and the high interest rates in Europe,  especially in Germany, were part of the reason for the high  unemployment rates in the West.    "Have we balanced our fears of inflation with the need for  economic growth?" Clinton asked the G-7 delegates, which include  economic, finance, labor and trade ministers of the world's  major industrial nations.    "One lesson is clear," Clinton said. "There is no rich  country on Earth that can expand its own job base and its income  unless there is global economic growth."    In previous G-7 meetings, Clinton said, the U.S. was  criticized for its high budget deficit. And now, with deficit  on decline and 2.1 million new jobs created in the past 13  months, the U.S. should be proud, Clinton said.    The President, meanwhile, asked the participants to talk  together "openly and honestly" about the problems of growth.    "Every advanced nation is facing that choice between hope  and  fear, between stagnation and change, between closing up and  opening up," Clinton said. "America has chosen the path of  change."    He said that while the U.S. should continue to bring its  deficit down, Japan should increase domestic demand, Europe  should continue to work for lower interest rates "so that these  three things together can spark a new round of worldwide growth  which will create more economic activity and more jobs."    The President said that trade was not a zero-sum game. In  the U.S., the export-related jobs pay on average 22 percent more  than the jobs that have nothing to do with exports.    The President also asked the summit to address the three  challenges: training high-skilled workers to meet job changes,  increasing productivity without shedding workers, and ensuring a  social safety net for workers, from health care, welfare,  training to family leave and child care.    "We cannot turn away from the notion that modernization is  the key to employment," he said, adding that the trick for the  government and private sector was to keep finding new area that  productivity will succeed.    "If we allow ourselves for a minute to try to resist the  growth of productivity, we are in deep trouble," the President  said.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS / PAUL KRUGMAN: A EUROPE-WIDE CURRENCY MAKES NO  ECONOMIC SENSE  </P> <P> The idea of European unity -- the transmutation of the European Community from  a free trade area to a full-fledged economic union and eventually to a federal  political system -- has become virtually unstoppable, even in Britain.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher wanted to stop the process with trade; she has  been an ardent opponent of British entry into the so-called exchange rate  mechanism of the European Monetary System, which stabilizes exchange rates  within Europe. But she has effectively lost that struggle; Britain is now  expected to join the exchange rate mechanism in the very near future.  </P> <P> And this is a more pregnant move than a decision to join five years ago would  have been, because the European Monetary System has clearly become a way  station on the route to a common European currency. And as the Germans have  just reminded us, a currency union is not much different from a political  union.  </P> <P> What is ironic is that Thatcher, who gained a reputation for leadership by  putting her economy through incredible punishment in the 1980s, now looks weak,  foolish and silly for clinging to a position that makes considerable economic  sense. On purely economic grounds, the case against a common European currency  is actually quite strong.  </P> <P> Why should one ever want to have separate national currencies? Because  sometimes it is very helpful to be able to change the value of one currency  relative to another.  </P> <P> Suppose, for example, there is a sharp drop in worldwide demand for goods made  in Britain. To cope with such a shock, Britain must both make its goods cheaper  and attract new industries to replace the shrunken old ones. The only quick way  to do this is to reduce British wages, to make its labor more competitive.  </P> <P> But how can all British wages be reduced quickly? In the face of sustained high  unemployment, workers might be persuaded to accept lower wages, and the whole  wage structure could gradually be squeezed down to a competitive level. But the  economic and social cost of reducing wages by, say, 15% would be huge. In  contrast, a 15% devaluation of the pound on foreign exchange markets would  accomplish the same thing instantly and almost painlessly.  </P> <P> Conversely, imagine a surge in demand for British products. This would bid up  the prices of British goods and services, possibly building an inflationary  momentum that would later prove hard to stop -- unless Britain accommodated the  surge by allowing the pound, instead of the price level, to rise.  </P> <P> The point is that it can be very convenient to change the value of your  currency rather than experience painful inflation and deflation. Once Britain  has accepted a common European currency, as it may well do this century, that  option will be gone.  </P> <P> Of course the argument is not that one-sided. If it were, then not only should  every country have its own currency, so should each region within a country.  Why not a Southern California dollar, or even a San Diego dollar? There must be  some kind of trade-off. And there is. Having your own currency brings costs as  well as benefits.  </P> <P> Most importantly, it is more difficult to do business when the contracting  partners keep their books and pay their workers in different currencies. So  keeping your own currency acts as a barrier to potentially beneficial  international trade and investment.  </P> <P> The economic theory of the "optimum currency area" says this trade-off gets  less and less favorable as the size of the economic unit shrinks. An  independent currency for San Diego would not make sense. On one side, residents  of San Diego do so much business with other Americans that the costs of keeping  track of a separate currency would be huge.  </P> <P> On the other side, changing the value of a local San Diego currency would  probably be ineffective as a way of cutting or raising wages because workers in  such a tiny currency area would almost surely want to index their wages to some  outside standard. So it only makes sense to have an independent currency for an  economic unit large enough to do most of its business with itself, and to have  some prospect of an independent wage- and price-setting process.  </P> <P> But how large is this optimum unit? Nobody knows -- and it is not at all crazy  to imagine that Europe might be better off economically with four or five  regional currencies than with only one.  </P> <P> For example, it is all too likely that in the next several years Germany will  be a boom economy, as it gets most of the business from the reconstruction of  Eastern Europe. To fight inflation, the German central bank will keep interest  rates high; these high interest rates will depress other European economies,  notably Britain's. There will be a clear economic case for devaluation of  Britain's currency against the German mark. Yet this will be difficult under  the European monetary system and impossible once a common currency has been  established.  </P> <P> Against this one might use the example of the United States -- 260 million  people living with only one currency. We're doing fine, aren't we? Not  necessarily. During the first half of the 1980s, when the United States was  fighting inflation with high unemployment, the harshest burden of that  unemployment was concentrated in the Midwestern industrial heartland. Had there  been a separate Midwestern currency, it is arguable that inflation might have  been controlled at significantly lower cost. Right now, as the economy of the  Northeast fights a serious slump, one wonders whether we wouldn't all be better  off if Mario Cuomo could devalue a regional currency.  </P> <P> But of course the idea of separate currencies within the United States is  unthinkable, for the same reason that a common European currency is now  inevitable. Whatever the strict economies of currency union, a common currency  is a potent political instrument: a symbol of unity.  </P> <P> And this symbol may be most important when it makes the least economic sense.  In terms of economic geography, Canada makes no sense as a currency area: each  province's natural business linkages are with the U.S. regions to its south,  not with fellow Canadians. Yet Canada needs an independent, unified currency to  exist as a nation. (In the long run, it may cease to exist anyway; but, as John  Maynard Keynes said, in the long run we are all dead.)  </P> <P> As the 20th Century nears its end, the idea of European unity has finally  become real, and to symbolize that idea, Europe must have a unified currency.  The common currency may not do much economic good; it may even do some harm,  but that is beside the point.  </P></p>

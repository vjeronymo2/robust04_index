			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Deregulation wins conference cheers MR NEIL Hamilton, the minister charged with preventing business being cocooned in red tape from Whitehall and Brussels, won the biggest spontaneous ovation of the conference. He rounded off a jocular bid for the leadership of the 'bastard' faction in the government by ripping up an elongated sheet of detailed regulations. Unlike the other ministerial 'bastards' recently subjected to a prime ministerial rebuke, Mr Hamilton insisted that he was acting with the full approval of Mr John Major. He confirmed that a substantial deregulation bill would feature in the legislative programme for the new parliamentary session.</p>

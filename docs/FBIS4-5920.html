			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tran Quan] </F>   [Text] The anticorruption and antismuggling struggle, which  is a major policy of the party and state, is aimed at protecting  economic development and wholesomeness in social life. This is  also a need of the people in building a "prosperous people and  strong country." But enemies of the revolution and political  malcontents and deviates are using this struggle to weaken the  people's confidence and destabilize the country.    They are making use of the widespread corruption and  smuggling to "generalize," viewing all of our party and state  organizations as "corrupt," and encouraging the "most depraved  people, who can only cause destruction, to rebuild things." They  do not accept the anticorruption and antismuggling struggle  being carried on by the party and state. They are spreading  distorted information, smearing the leading cadres of the party  and state, and charging that those people are involved in  corruption and smuggling.    Unfortunately, their improper activities have temporarily  shaken a number of people who lack accurate information and  knowledge about the present situation and increased their  dissatisfaction with life today. Those black arguments, which  continue to be passed on "along the street," are causing  confusion in public opinion. But the black clouds cannot obscure  the sun. The entire world recognizes the important and positive  achievements scored by our country in the renovation movement.  There is no way that the enemy can refute that. Those  achievements prove that most of our cadres and party members and  most of our people are adhering firmly to the wonderful  traditions and, for the people and country, are exploiting the  advantages and struggling to overcome the shortcoming and  weaknesses in order to ensure that the revolution continues to  make great strides forward. Only a few cadres and party members,  including a number of high-level cadres, are degraded, and they  are gradually being purged. Because of this, we think that while  we must resolutely and urgently promote the anticorruption and  antismuggling struggle, we must also heighten vigilance and  promptly block the actions of the enemy and malcontents who are  making use of this struggle to destroy the country. To do this:    Maintaining political stability today must be regarded as  the  leading task in building a "prosperous people and strong  country." The main thing is to stabilize the feelings of the  people and not allow the enemy and malcontents to start a  "psychological war." When propagandizing the anticorruption and  anti-smuggling struggle, the mass means of information must also  give attention to exposing the actions of the enemy who are  misusing that struggle to stir up trouble and ruin things so  that they cannot make use of the loopholes in the contents and  methods of implementation.    The party committee echelons must monitor things and adhere  to public opinion in order to promptly implement suitable  propaganda policies and actively prevent the various types of  "psychological warfare" from doing any damage. Having doubts and  fearing that blocking the counterpropaganda arguments will  "hinder democracy" are misconceptions about democracy. Such  doubts and fears represent a failure to distinguish clearly  between the legitimate aspirations of the people and the plots  of the enemy and arguments of the malcontents.    The judicial organizations must promptly find and prosecute  those who are intentionally distorting the truth with the aim of  tarnishing the reputation of the honest people in the party  leadership and administrative organizations and disrupting the  building of the country or who are intentionally publishing  illegal materials. Disrupting the stability of the country and  destroying the people's confidence in the revolution can  sometimes do greater damage than the material value of many  cases of corruption and smuggling added together.    The party and state must constantly elevate the principle of  democratic centralism. Cadres and party members must make an  effort to maintain a concept of organization and discipline and  be on guard against the "psychological warfare" and other  destructive plots of the enemy. They must not speak in an  unprincipled manner or in ways that unintentionally aid the  enemy.    A number of people are still uncertain about the the term  unprincipled "freedom, openness, and democracy." They do not  realize that this is the weapon that enemies and reactionaries  are using to attack the party in power. We have many good  lessons to help us be aware of these plots and prevent them from  interfering with the implementation of the present struggle  against negative aspects.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES 100;  </P> <P> THE BEST PERFORMING COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> THE BOTTOM LINE;  </P> <P> ADOBE: REDESIGNING THE FUTURE;  </P> <P> SOFTWARE OUTFIT THAT VIRTUALLY INVENTED DESKTOP PUBLISHING ENJOYS EXPLOSIVE  GROWTH  </P> <P> Frustrated by the slow pace at which Xerox brought out new products, John E.  Warnock and Charles M. Geschke six years ago left Xerox's Palo Alto Research  Center and struck out on their own.  </P> <P> Backed by Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a high-tech venture capital firm, the two  technical wizards borrowed the name of the creek that ran in back of their  homes in Los Altos, Calif., and created a software company that has become one  of the wonders of Silicon Valley.  </P> <P> Adobe Systems, based in Mountain View, has nearly doubled its sales every year.  From $2.5 million in 1984, the company has grown to $83.5 million in revenue in  1988. On The Times 100 list, the company scored third with a two-year average  return on equity of 55.2%.  </P> <P> Like other high-tech counterparts at the top of the list, Adobe made its debut  on The Times 100. (The company, which went public in 1986, did not meet the  criterion for public ownership for inclusion on last year's list.) And like  Chips &amp; Technologies, which emerged as No. 1, Adobe's success has come  primarily from one product that dovetailed with a pressing need that had not  previously been met.  </P> <P> Simply put, Adobe's PostScript software made desktop publishing possible by  enabling laser printers, typesetting equipment and other such devices to  produce pages integrating text and graphics. The product has become  indispensable for advertising agencies, packaging designers, newspaper art  departments and businesses that publish their own brochures and reports.  </P> <P> Today, 80% of the company's sales come from royalties on the product.  </P> <P> "The printing solutions that we've brought to the market give you enormous  productivity over traditional typesetting," said Warnock, 48, Adobe's chairman  and chief executive. "It's a cost-benefit thing."  </P> <P> Customers include most big computer and printer makers, such as IBM,  Hewlett-Packard and Digital Equipment Corp., Ricoh, Canon and Fujitsu. An  important partner is Apple Computer, which uses the product extensively for its  Macintosh and Apple LaserWriter and accounts for 25% of Adobe's sales. It also  holds 17% of the company. Apple founder Steven Jobs has also licensed the  product for his Next line of computers.  </P> <P> Adobe is also finding markets for other software programs. With Display  PostScript, graphic elements can be rotated, scaled, skewed or otherwise  adjusted on the screen. The company also has put together collections of more  than 300 Roman typefaces, as well as two Japanese Kanji fonts that could prove  a boon to the company if Japanese demand explodes.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Q. T. Wiles, a 69-year-old general partner at Hambrecht  &amp; Quist, resigned as chairman of Adobe. But, analysts point out, he had  little hand in the day-to-day operations and, with Warnock and Geschke in  place, the management team is intact.  </P> <P> "Thus far, they've done an outstanding job," said Bruce M. Lupatkin, senior  technology analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Given their near-monopoly, however, they should be prepared for "assaults from  all sides" as other companies might try to seize some of their lucrative  business, Lupatkin said. "Copyright and patent law are never strong enough" to  protect intellectual property, Warnock acknowledged. The company is lobbying  with the U.S. Copyright Office to get some protection for typeface designs,  which have no protection under current laws.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Warnock noted, the annual doubling of revenue is undoubtedly a thing  of the past. Analysts project 1989 sales at $120 million or so, still a sizable  increase. But Adobe could be vulnerable as growth in the computer business  slows from the heated pace of 1988.  </P> <P> Warnock is mindful that high-tech success stories can sour in a hurry. "In the  computer business," he said, "if you ever think you have a formula for success,  you'd better figure out how to change it from year to year."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 2 ITAR-TASS -- The congress of the  Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] today adopted  resolution on the "impermissibility of use of any forcible  measures with regard to the republics of the former Yugoslavia".    The Zhirinovskiy party declared its intention "to render  assistance to the peoples of Yugoslavia, and first of all to the  Serbian people".    The LDPR group in the State Duma was instructed to work  towards the lifting of economic sanctions against the Yugoslav  republics.    Another resolution contains criticism of the "inconsistent,  passive approach of the Russian ruling circles to Iraq". The  party's deputies in the parliament were told to "raise the  question about lifting sanctions against Iraq and secure changes  in the policy pursued by the Russian diplomacy, including in the  United Nations".    The congress adopted a resolution in support of a single  monetary system of Russia and Byelorussia [Belarus]. The LDPR  thinks that "the cost Russia may have to pay is incomparably  smaller than the strategic benefits from a financial and  economic alliance with Byelorussia".</p>

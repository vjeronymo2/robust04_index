			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Carlos Camarena Medina] </F>   [Text] Panama City, 6 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Panamanian  President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares said today "certain  sacrifices" will be necessary to modernize the economy, and he  said joining GATT is "unpostponable."    During a meeting with the Association of Panamanian  Industrialists, one of the country's leading organizations,  Perez Balladares maintained that opening and modernizing the  economy must occur without "jolt" or "shock" measures, which  could have "unpredictable" social ramifications.    "We are not planning to use disguised subsidies or  indefinite  protective tariffs to motivate the private sector; much less  will we advocate excessive interference in its business  activities," he said.    He pledged to review those laws that discourage foreign  investment, including the Labor Code, and those that regulate  protection of the industrial sector, "because no legal  instrument is engraved in stone, not even the Constitution."    Perez Balladares said the opening of the market will not be  "synonymous with a lack of protection and will not constitute a  letter of marque for unfair competition." The opening of the  market should not be confused "with ambiguous rules of the game  or a tolerance of smuggling."    Perez Balladares added businessmen will have to assume a  large part of responsibility for the future of the country's  economy, but they will also reap the most benefits due to the  broad markets they will find.    He added that in light of the prevailing globalization and  rapid economic changes, the industrial sector will have to make  adjustments in order "to be up with the times and able to  compete in the international market."    Perez Balladares said the private sector will be responsible  for generating jobs while the government will have to provide  the country with adequate infrastructures that will enable the  normal development of industries.    Perez Balladares said if the costs that depend on government  legislation are not more arduous than those of other countries,  "there is no reason for the country not to be able to compete in  the international market in a relatively short time."    As for Panama joining GATT, Perez Balladares said that his  administration "will not allow any unnecessary delay or  whimsical haste" and that negotiations will continue to  integrate the interests of all productive sectors.    He conceded that, although the final decisions will not  satisfy everyone, "those who disagree will be in the minority."  Regardless, all sectors will be consulted so as to minimize any  adverse effects resulting "from this significant and  unpostponable move Panama must make."    Perez Balladares believes the "primitive and parochial" idea  of paternalizing government works must be abandoned, and he  urged private sector involvement in the construction of highways  and the improvement, widening, and management of ports.    The economic crisis the country is facing, he explained,  goes  hand in hand with the education crisis. There is no point in  creating jobs if there are no qualified workers; conversely, it  would be discouraging to have skilled workers if no jobs are  available.    In this regard, Perez Balladares urged private sector  involvement in the process of educational reform and the  training of labor, which will benefit industries in the future.    According to Perez Balladares, the political integration  advocated by Simon Bolivar "is a utopia," but economic  integration in small or large blocs "is indispensable for  development."    Redefining Panamanian delegations abroad to promote the  country's potential and publicize its advantages in close  cooperation with local businessmen is among his government's  priorities in attracting new foreign investment.    He said security is vital for attracting foreign investment;  consequently, "as a priority" he will professionalize the police  force, "but without the jolt of having military control in  public matters."</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Universities call for students to pay part of tuition costs UNIVERSITY vice-chancellors are calling on the government to introduce a new funding system requiring students to pay towards their tuition because a lack of money is denying places to thousands of young people. The Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals says many 18-year-olds are missing out 'because the government cannot find the money to fund the extra places needed to satisfy demand'. 'To achieve a mass higher education system we will need the co-operation of the government to establish a scheme whereby future graduates can contribute painlessly to the cost of their education,' it adds. In a report published today it outlines four possible new methods of raising funds and will decide on its favoured option next month. The options are: a 'graduate tax', where graduates would pay a higher rate of income tax for all of their working lives; A fee for tuition backed by a loan which would be repaid via higher income tax payments - graduates on lower incomes would thus take longer repaying; loans for living costs, at a level chosen by the student, which would similarly be repaid via the tax system, and; 'top-up fees', again backed by loans repaid via the tax system, which would allow universities to choose the level of funds they raised. The Department for Education has welcomed the report, which it says is a useful contribution to the review of government expenditure being carried out by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. However, it denies claims from universities that government funding decisions lie behind the disappointment for many 18-year-old university applicants this year. According to universities, they made more offers of places conditional on A-level results than they could afford to honour because the government delayed announcing a cut in funds - from Pounds 1,850 to Pounds 1,300 per student - for classroom-based subjects until December last year. Yesterday's A-level results, which were better than expected, added to university admissions tutors' problems, according to the CVCP, because a higher proportion of candidates than usual successfully completed their offers. But Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said there was no evidence that candidates would miss out. She said those who narrowly missed satisfying their offers should consider options in further education. The department says universities should have realised from the autumn statement that higher education was due for a period of consolidation and that no rises in funding would be forthcoming. The vice-chancellors' plans appear to have cautious backing from both lecturers and students. Out of pocket for making the grade, Page 12</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Industry looks abroad again to cut costs: Michiyo Nakamoto on company news THE relentless rise of the yen against the dollar has presented large sections of Japanese industry with a significant obstacle to recovery. Exporters, such as motor vehicles, electronics and industrial machinery manufacturers which have drawn up business plans for the first half of the fiscal year at a currency rate closer to Y115-Y120 to the dollar compared with the Y114.28 at which it closed yesterday, are staring at the prospect of substantially reduced revenues if the trend continues. Pioneer, the audio-visual manufacturer, says that it loses about Y800m with each Y1 rise in the yen's value against the dollar. In addition to lower dollar-based earnings, the impact of the yen's rise is already being reflected in some areas in the reduced cost-competitiveness of Japanese industry. Japanese vehicle manufacturers, for example, saw their share of the US market eroded in March by the need to raise prices to deal with the yen's rise. Sales of imported Japanese cars in particular fell 13.2 per cent. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries says that customers are becoming less willing to pay for its ships in yen as they have traditionally done. 'If Japanese manufacturers insist on yen-based payments, orders may go to the Koreans,' an IHI representative says. The adverse impact of the higher yen is thus focusing the minds of Japanese corporations on speeding up measures to cope with lower export revenues and reduced cost competitiveness. Companies talk of accelerating the transfer of production overseas, greater efforts to procure components locally where overseas production exists and a possible rise in imports of foreign products which are more cost effective than domestic products. The lessons of the previous period of endaka, or high yen, in the mid-to-late 1980s have already led most big companies that depend on exports to any large degree to move manufacturing overseas. Sega, the video games manufacturer, says that 80 per cent of its video games sold overseas are also manufactured overseas. The company is able to offset the impact of a weaker dollar by the fact that 50 per cent of dollar-based revenues go towards dollar-based payments. However, the trend to shift manufacturing outside of Japan is likely to see a renewed surge with the further rise of the yen, with China and other low-labour-cost areas increasingly popular choices for investment. Aiwa, which already manufactures 65 per cent of its products overseas, says that if the Japanese currency continues to strengthen it will have to consider moving more production out of Japan. Chiyoda, the plant manufacturer, procures 60 per cent of its components used in overseas manufacturing locally, but believes it will have to raise that level further. Meanwhile, the yen's rise could trigger a greater willingness to look overseas for components which raise companies' cost competitiveness at home. IHI said yesterday it would increase the proportion of imported components in its aircraft engines from 50 per cent to 70 per cent in an effort to reduce costs. These measures will no doubt serve to soften the impact of the yen's surge. But they are by no means aimed solely at dealing with it. Japanese companies faced with a persistent domestic slump and weak markets elsewhere have already been working on reducing overall costs. 'The main strategy is to have competitive products that will sell even if we have to raise prices,' says a representative of Nikon, the camera and precision instruments maker. The rise of the yen, he says, 'will put pressure on Japanese companies to invest more in technological advances to raise their international competitiveness. That is not only a response to endaka, but the way forward.'</p>

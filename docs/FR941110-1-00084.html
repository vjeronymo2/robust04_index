			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The current regulation requires that production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances for export to Parties meet the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for both consumption and production allowances. The current rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires producers to expend both production and consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances to produce class I controlled substances. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance is then exported to a Party, the producer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (or exporter) may request that EPA ``refund'' consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances equal to the amount exported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA considered not proposing any changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative procedures because only one year remains before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the phaseout of class I controlled substances begins on January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1996. However, EPA recognizes that the administrative process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of expending consumption allowances to produce class I controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances for export, with the subsequent request to have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances refunded for these exported substances, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cumbersome for the producer, especially at this point in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule of the phaseout. In the last control period before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phaseout (from January 1, 1995 to January 1, 1996), producers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing their production to a fraction of the quantity they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced in previous years (see schedule for phaseout in &sect;82.8).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes United States companies should be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respond in a timely manner to requests for controlled substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If United States companies are not able to respond to requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for controlled substances in a timely manner due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative procedures created by the current rule, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business opportunities will be lost to foreign competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to reports from producers, the time lag between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditure of consumption allowances during production and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the refunded consumption allowances for an export can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> often mean missing the opportunity to fulfill a request for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance. As a result, the Agency is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the time taken to refund consumption allowances for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exported controlled substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By changing the reporting requirements so companies report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier to the Agency, EPA proposes to reduce the time taken to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refund the consumption allowances expended in the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances that are exported. This proposal would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit a U.S. company to report the export of a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance to a Party at the time the export is initiated, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than requiring the producer to submit the completed bill of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lading and the invoice with the request for additional refunded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances. This change in the reporting procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would allow the company to submit a preliminary report of export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earlier. Therefore, EPA would be able to authorize the refund of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances earlier, contingent upon verification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the export when the company submitted the bill of lading and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> invoice. Today's proposal would permit companies to expend the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent consumption allowances to meet their production or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importation needs in a more timely manner. The contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorization of consumption allowances will accelerate the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which companies receive the allowances, allowing them to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests for controlled substances in a timely manner. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies will be less constrained by the time lag caused by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current administrative requirements. However, in the event that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation submitted by the company does not support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export, EPA will consider that the granting of the consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances never occurred, potentially putting the company in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of the requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also considered another option in making today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal. The option considered would exempt the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> class I controlled substances from the consumption allowance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, if the substance is exported to Parties during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one remaining control period before the phaseout (from January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995 to January 1, 1996). This option would include an exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for methyl bromide from the consumption allowance requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for exports beginning January 1, 1995, and extending until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 2001. Producers would be allowed to produce class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances for export to a Party with only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditure of production allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the second option described above, exports would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exempt from the requirements to expend consumption allowances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the producer is certain that a person purchasing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance in the United States would export to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Party, there would be no requirement to expend consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances in the production of that substance under this option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exporter would certify to the producer, either in the sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement or in a letter, that the controlled substance would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exported. When the producer has no guarantee that the substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would, or would not, be exported to a Party, they would expend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both production and consumption allowances in producing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current regulation, a person in the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may receive both production and consumption allowances from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Party to the Protocol in an inter-Party trade (under the Protocol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is called industrial rationalization). The U.S. company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that receives the allowances from the other Party expends the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production and consumption allowances to produce a controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance. The controlled substance produced with the traded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances is then exported to the Party from whom the allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were traded. The U.S. company expends consumption allowances in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production of the controlled substance for an inter-Party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade and then asks EPA for a ``refund'' of these consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances because the controlled substance was exported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the redundant cycling of consumption allowances in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inter-Party trades to the United States described above, EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also considering the option that a person  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> receive additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption allowances through inter-Party trades for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining control period from January 1, 1995, to January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1996. Under this option, consumption allowances would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expended in the production of controlled substances as part of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inter-Party trade. The option of eliminating consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowances for inter-Party trades to the United States for methyl  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bromide would begin January 1, 1995, and extend until January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2001. EPA seeks comments on this considered option to alleviate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative requirements for consumption allowances for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export of controlled substances to Parties to the Protocol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

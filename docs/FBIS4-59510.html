			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben, 'Aqiva Eldar, and Gay Bekhor] </F>   [Excerpts] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will  apparently visit Jericho on 17 May in order to get a first-hand  impression of the establishment of Palestinian autonomy.    Christopher prefers not to focus exclusively on the  negotiations between Syria and Israel during his current Middle  East tour. It was originally proposed that Christopher visit  Morocco with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres but the trip was  canceled after Morocco's King Hassan explained that he had no  intention of taking steps to normalize relations with Israel.  Officials in the American peace team suggested that the  secretary of state visit Jericho, and Israel expressed no  opposition.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has explained to the U.S.  Administration that he has no intention of making further  declarative steps toward Syria and is now waiting for a positive  reaction from Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on the Israeli  peace proposal. Israeli sources say that "the ball is now in  al-Asad's court." Sources assert that by declaring his  readiness to evacuate settlements in exchange for peace and to  implement a significant withdrawal on the Golan Heights, Rabin  had taken large steps to meet the Syrians half way, while  Damascus had continued to adamantly insist that Israel declare  its readiness to carry out a full withdrawal from the Golan  Heights before any progress in the negotiations.    "The proposal handed to Christopher during his last visit to  Syria was more detailed and practical than in the past; however,  as far as its content there was no change in the old Syrian  position," the Israeli sources noted. The sources said that  Christopher would make it clear to al-Asad that Syria would have  to take steps to promote the negotiations with Israel and at the  same time prove that it had changed its policies with regard to  terrorism and the drug trade.    The secretary of state will arrive in Damascus today and in  Jerusalem tomorrow. He will probably meet Prime Minister Rabin  tomorrow evening and again on Tuesday [17 May]. According to  the reports which have reached Jerusalem, Christopher does not  plan another shuttle trip between Damascus and Jerusalem and  will leave for Cairo on Wednesday. [passage omitted]    [Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew in a report by Pe'erli  Shahar and Natan Gutman on pages 1 and 8 notes that "A different  aspect of the negotiations with Syria that will be raised in the  meetings with Christopher is the scope of commitments and  guarantees the United States is prepared to give Israel in  exchange for its withdrawal on the Golan Heights. This entails  strategic cooperation, real-time satellite information, and of  course, an estimated $5 billion in financial aid to strengthen  Israel's defense and security systems."]    Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the Israeli  delegation to the talks with Syria, will arrive in Israel this  evening and meet tomorrow with the prime minister prior to  Secretary of State Christopher's arrival. Yesterday in  Washington, Rabinovich said that Israel expected Syria to accept  the basic idea behind the "package" principal. Rabinovich said  that he does not anticipate any progress in the negotiations  without agreement on this issue. Rabinovich explained that  although Syria cannot be expected to agree to every detail in  the package, it must accept its underlying principle as well as  an essential part of it.    Commenting on Syrian media reports, Rabinovich said  yesterday  that on the eve of the secretary of state's visit, Syria was  seeking to paint a bleak picture of the situation in a bid to  pressure Israel and the U.S. Administration.    [Later in the same report mentioned above, 'AL HAMISHMAR  reports that "Ambassador Itamar Rabinovich, the head of the  Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria, said that he was not  surprised by the criticism leveled by the Syrian press at the  Israeli package of proposals for an arrangement on the Golan  Heights. `It is not surprising that the Syrians are trying to  portray the situation in bleak colors on the eve of the  secretary's visit. This is a transparent attempt to pressure  Israel and the U.S. Administration,' Rabinovich asserted.    "The ambassador pointed out that there was a great deal of  wisdom in the U.S. policy of lowering expectations from  Christopher's shuttle mission between Damascus and Jerusalem  because many further visits were anticipated and one should not  expect a breakthrough or dramatic progress on every visit. When  he was asked to define Israel's expectations from Christopher's  visit, Rabinovich said: `The purpose of this visit is to create  the necessary energy to promote the negotiations and facilitate  a substantive round of direct negotiations between Syria and  Israel.'"]    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said over the weekend that  there was no guarantee that Christopher's visit would lead to  changes in the negotiations with Syria.    "The proposals submitted by Syria up to now are definitely  not earth shattering; however, there are certain dynamics in the  air and we need to continue trying to promote the negotiations  with them," Peres said.</p>

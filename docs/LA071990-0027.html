			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: WHEN A DISH RATTLES, CHILDREN COME RUNNING  </P> <P> My husband said the other day, "We haven't seen our kids in a while."  </P> <P> "You want to see your kids?" I asked. "I can arrange it."  </P> <P> "You're not going to call and tell them we're changing the will again, are you?  We've overdone that one."  </P> <P> "No, no. At least one of them will be here tonight for dinner. Trust me."  </P> <P> Sure enough. At 6 p.m. we heard a key in the door and our son walked in. My  husband was astounded. "How did you do that?" he asked me.  </P> <P> "It's easy. I defrosted and cooked two thin pork chops for dinner."  </P> <P> That's the way it's been ever since they got their own apartments. I cook  enough spaghetti to feed Sicily and no one shows. I nuke two small pieces of  leftover pizza for dinner and they fly in from out of state.  </P> <P> How do they know I've cooked for two? It's one of the great mysteries of child  raising. Kids were equipped with radar long before it went commercial. They  knew when there were bananas hidden behind the popcorn popper in the pantry.  They knew when there was a candy bar in the meat keeper in the refrigerator. It  was not possible for a leftover piece of pie to survive a child in search of  breakfast. When a dish rattles, they hear it, no matter where they are.  </P> <P> When you think about it, mothers set themselves up for it. We've dedicated our  lives to feeding our kids. Nothing went hungry. I fed a cold; I fed a fever. If  an infant cried, I stuffed a bottle in her mouth. If a child fell off a  bicycle, I promised him ice cream.  </P> <P> "You may not graduate? Have a piece of cake."  </P> <P> "Your car was totaled? Have you had lunch?"  </P> <P> "You're not overweight. You're too thin. Eat!"  </P> <P> We have created an image for ourselves of being able to feed a crowd on a pound  of hamburger and bring forth food when the cupboards are bare. It has always  been. My grandmother would scurry when we pulled into the driveway. She'd open  cans with one hand and set four more places at the table with the other. My  mother did the same thing when five of us parked in front of the house at  dinner time.  </P> <P> Now that I think about it . . . maybe they just wanted to see us.  </P></p>

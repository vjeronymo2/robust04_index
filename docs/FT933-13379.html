			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / World Trade News: GE wins Dollars 1.2bn Japanese power contract GENERAL ELECTRIC, the world's largest power generating equipment producer, last night clinched one of its biggest orders by signing a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 800m) contract to build a power station for Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco). The announcement, which followed three years of negotiations between the US company and the Japanese utility, clears the way for work to begin on the world's largest power station, a 2,800MW combined-cycle plant in Yokohama. GE was quick to point out the wider significance of the deal in view of continuing concerns about the US trade deficit with Japan. Mr Delbert Williamson, president and Asian regional executive for GE industrial and power systems (Geips), said Tepco had played a key role within Japan to improve trade relations with the US and to encourage positive changes in Japan's procurement policies. The order is a coup for GE in an industry which has often complained about lack of access to Japanese markets. The US group has fared better than its western rivals, however, and Tepco is its largest customer. It said that Tepco had spent several years evaluating technology for combined-cycle power, which uses the waste heat from gas turbines to power a steam turbine, raising efficiency and reducing emissions. The Yokohama plant is due to begin commercial service in the mid-1990s. It will include eight GE single-shaft Stag 109F units, each using a 9F gas turbine, a newly designed 'three-pressure reheat' steam turbine and a hydrogen-cooled generator. GE will design and build the plant, and is also the prime equipment contractor. The turbines and generators will be built at the group's plants in the US, while Hitachi and Toshiba, the US company's Japanese associates, will supply much of the remaining equipment. Yesterday's announcement came a few days after Mr Williamson was appointed to his new post; Geips reshuffled top management to 'sharpen its focus' on the three key markets of Asia, Europe and the Americas. He will be based in Hong Kong, where Geips is setting up a regional headquarters.</p>

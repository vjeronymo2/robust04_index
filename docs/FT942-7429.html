			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Trade boost for dollar The dollar finished higher yesterday as markets responded positively to news that the US and Japan plan to resume framework trade talks, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency closed in London at Y104.445, up from Y104.400 on Monday and an intra-day low of Y103.90. The dollar was also pulled higher against the D-Mark, finishing in London at DM1.6478 from DM1.6456. Analysts cautioned that although the resumption of talks was positive, it was not the same as reaching agreement. But the feeling was that it probably underpinned the dollar in the short term. Elsewhere, trade in Europe was fairly quiet following Monday's holiday. The D-Mark was generally stronger. The Bundesbank announced another variable rate repo. The futures markets were again very volatile, with euromarks regaining some of their recent losses, and eurosterling losing ground. The announcement by Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, that the US and Japan would end the three-month stalemate in trade talks is significant. Some analysts trace recent dollar weakness to the collapse of the trade talks in February. Although the interim period has been chastening for both parties - Japanese exporters have been hurt by the strong yen, while the weakness in US bond markets has been linked to the ailing dollar - the tenor of yesterday's announcements made clear that a difficult path lies ahead. Amid all the fine words, Mr Kantor's claim that the Clinton administration would expand trade with Japan, 'one way or the other', sounded suspiciously like a threat. The aim of the trade talks is to try and reduce Japan's Dollars 131bn bilateral trade surplus. Mr Kantor said Japan had agreed on the need to stimulate its economy with a 'substantial' macro-economic package, and reiterated a commitment to bring about a 'highly significant' cut in its current account surplus. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said the announcement had 'provided the dollar with some support, but had not been the catalyst to take out key technical resistance.' He said there were still sellers of dollars in the market. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at the Bank of America in London, commented: 'It will be perceived by the market as a further indication that US policy against the yen has changed.' He said the dollar was probably now underpinned at Y103.50, but 'you will need to see progress before the market starts buying the dollar aggressively again.' Mr Hawkins said the lows of the dollar had probably been seen. A fairly large drop in the German repo today could lend more support to the revival of the dollar. But analysts are not predicting it, nor do call money rates make it likely. Rates firmed to 5.30/5.40 per cent from 5/5.12 on Friday (German markets were closed on Monday), driven by tighter liquidity conditions and the recent rise in euromark futures. With call money above the repo rate of 5.23 per cent, analysts are predicting a fall of 3-5 basis points in the repo rate. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'After recent Bundesbank comments - ie no continuation of the step-by-step easing for the time being, it would be bizarre for Frankfurt immediately to sanction a sharp fall in the repo rate.' The case for lower rates was not helped by the release of the April M3 figure, showing that money supply grew, year on year, by 15.8 per cent. Ironically, the M3 number, which was better than some had expected, was cited as one reason why euromark futures performed better. The December contract settled 9 basis points firmer at 94.77. Volumes were again high, with the December contract trading nearly 60,000 lots. Other possible factors were short covering and the fact that the Bundesbank announced a variable rate repo. Some had feared a fixed rate repo as a means of slowing the recent fall in rates. Analysts were bemused by the fall in eurosterling futures. The December contract closed 4 basis points lower at 93.95. One possible explanation was nervousness ahead of today's gilt auction. Mr Richard Phillips, analyst at brokers GNI, said the market was 'verging on the schizophrenic'. 'Most traders have never known a market like this,' he lamented. In Europe the Danish krone finished at DKr3.916 to the D-Mark from DKr3.911 after poorer than expected inflation data. Year on year consumer prices rose by 2.1 per cent compared to market expectations of a 1.8 per cent increase. Mr Cunningham of UBS said the currency weakness reflected the market view that Denmark might not be able to make the interest rate cuts required to stimulate growth. Sterling had a steady day, rising from DM2.4789 to DM2.4856. In the money markets the Bank of England provided Pounds 1.016bn assistance to clear a Pounds 1bn shortage.</p>

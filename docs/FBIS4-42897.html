			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Ferdinand Hennerbichler report: "Neutral Austria Welcome!"] </F>   [Text] WEU [Western European Union] Chief Eekelen tells  NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG: If Austria joins the European Union [EU],  it need not give up its neutrality. Wars among EU partners  would be impossible. If we were attacked, multinational WEU  troops would come to our rescue. Regarding EU security issues,  Austria need not do anything that it does not want to do  voluntarily.    "Neutral Austria is welcome in the WEU. It can participate  fully and can play an important peace role." In an exclusive  interview with NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG, WEU Secretary General Dr.  Willem van Eekelen confirms: Austria can fully participate in  the EU's security policy without having to give up its tried and  tested neutrality.    The WEU chief's statements in NEUE KRONEN-ZEITUNG are the  most effective arguments so far against storytellers in our  country who claim that we would have to give up our neutrality  if we joined the EU.    As Dr. Eekelen makes clear, all of Europe has changed  drastically -- the WEU like the issues involving neutrality. We  would approach each other, grow together. Neutrality is "no  obstacle to actively participating in the EU's security policy."  The three great principles of Austria's military neutrality --  not to join any military alliance, not to tolerate any foreign  troops, and not to declare war on anyone -- are nowadays  accepted all over Europe as general principles for safeguarding  peace. First, there are no longer and Cold War military  alliances. Van Eekelen: "The WEU is a military alliance that  is changing in the direction of a global European security  system." Austria is playing "a vital peace role" in this  process. Second, the question of having foreign troops on  Austrian territory is no longer topical if we join the EU. In  case of war the EU would come to rescue Austria from attackers  and would drive away enemy troops. Third, the WEU "will never  declare war on anyone."    Asked whether Austria would then have to shed all its blood  on Europe's battlefields in the WEU's defense wars, Eekelen  gives a determined answer: This is "not the case at all." The  WEU is establishing a "multinational task force" for  emergencies. This task force is organized along national lines.  It will ensure peace with arms. Participation is "voluntary."  A WEU army is not planned. Further, Austria will "not be  forced to do things it does not agree with." Decisions on  security issues are "made only unanimously" in the EU. Austria,  too, has the right to veto decisions.    Regarding international peacekeeping missions, the WEU would  "not do anything without the United Nations and the CSCE." Van  Eekelen: "Let us build this European security system together!"</p>

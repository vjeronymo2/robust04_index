			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clash over role of directors - Electricity SIR GRAHAM DAY, chairman of PowerGen, has clashed with Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, over the role of government-appointed directors in determining the policy of privatised companies. Speaking on BBC television, Mr Dobson said it would be possible for Labour ministers to appoint directors to both PowerGen and National Power, the privatised generating companies, to ensure they complied with government policy. In letters to Mr Dobson and Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, Sir Graham said the government had no special powers to appoint directors. He insisted that the idea that replacement directors could be obliged to follow Labour policies - 'by implication without regard to their legal duties' - was ill-founded. Mr Dobson commented that 'private profit-seeking electricity companies' would not be allowed to ruin the economy. A Labour government would use its powers to ensure that electricity companies pursued the policies of a Labour government as assiduously as they had pursued those of the present administration. Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary, last night ruled out government intervention in the negotiations between British Coal and the electricity industry which are likely to determine the future size of British Coal. His statement follows reports that the government was attempting to persuade the electricity industry to sign contracts with British Coal which would force the closure of all but about a dozen pits.</p>

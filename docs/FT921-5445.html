			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Digital seeks 7,000 job cuts DIGITAL Equipment is offering early retirement to about 7,000 of its US employees, or over 10 per cent of the computer company's US workforce, in its latest effort to reduce costs. Digital has been struggling to reduce employment for two years in the face of flat sales and depressed profitability. The company employs about 119,500 people worldwide, including 60,300 full-time workers in the US. The early retirement programme, the first of its kind offered by Digital, applies to all US employees over the age of 50 with five years or more service with the company, and is voluntary. The company said the voluntary programme was in addition to existing Digital severance programmes. Since September 1989, when the job reduction programmes were initiated, about 12,450 people have left the company, excluding normal attrition and retirements. All but 5,550 of these job cuts were mandatory. For its second fiscal quarter, ending in December, Digital reported net losses of Dollars 138m on revenues of Dollars 3.5bn. Digital has taken a total of Dollars 1.6bn in restructuring charges over the past two years to cover the cost of plant closings, consolidations and work force reductions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by journalist Irina Alekseyeva: "Four Vice </F> Premiers in New Government. Whom Will the Premier Invite?"]    [Text] Boris Yeltsin recently signed an edict on the  structure of the organs of executive power. The document  provides for the presence of four vice premiers in the Cabinet  of Ministers, two of whom should be first vice premiers. Viktor  Chernomyrdin must give their names within a week.    Obviously the premier will choose the new vice premiers from  the nine who are already working now. Here he will have to be  guided not only by his personal sympathies and antipathies but  also by the disposition of political forces and the results of  the elections to the State Duma. Government analysts, who have  already run through many options, believe that it is to  Chernomyrdin's advantage to set out his game of cadres patience  in such a way that he himself is in the center and can thus  strengthen his own positions. Otherwise, if a homogenous  government is formed the premier runs the risk of coming under  fire from the criticism of the offended side. So that to all  appearances no radical changes in the government are predicted.    The main question is who will occupy the first four seats in  the government, or rather the two first seats and the two second  seats?    Obviously Oleg Soskovets will not be competing. Today, too,  he is the first among the first three vice premiers (Soskovets,  Gaydar, and Shumeyko). Chernomyrdin left him "in charge" when  he went on vacation.    Oleg Nikolayevich's staying power is explained by the fact  that it is he who in the government symbolizes the large army of  industrialists and state officials. It will not be without  interest also to recall the fact that Mr. Soskovets, who had  been about to run as a deputy, withdrew his candidacy at the  height of the election campaign. It is entirely possible that  even then the premier had guaranteed him a leading place in the  new government.    By analogy with Soskovets, the premier will obviously leave  Aleksandr Zaveryukha among the four vice premiers as well.  Behind him there is a large and influential Duma faction of  agricultural experts and the Cabinet of Ministers leader cannot  disregard him. Through Zaveryukha the premier will be able to  influence not only the agricultural experts but also some of the  Communists close in spirit to the collective farms' champion.  Actually, regarding this candidacy, Viktor Stepanovich will  probably not have to go through any internal struggles: The  premier's sympathies toward Mr. Zaveryukha can be felt quite  clearly.    You cannot confidently say the same about Chernomyrdin's  attitude toward Gaydar. But the premier will hardly dare not to  leave the young father of the Russian reforms and the leader of  the largest duma factions among his vice premiers. Moreover  Gaydar is a very convenient figure who can be blamed for all  blunders in the work of the cabinet of ministers. You only have  to use the standard and uncomplicated formula: "The reforms are  proceeding somewhere in the wrong direction..." -- and everyone  will immediately understand that Gaydar is to blame.    And who will be the fourth? Probably not Shumeyko. It is  even more likely that Shakhray will not be the fourth. The  elections showed that there are not substantial enough forces  behind the party that he conceived.    Probably the fourth could in theory be Anatoliy Chubays,  were  it not for the powerful and vigorous figure of Boris Fedorov.  Much now depends on Fedorov. No one can any longer hold the  budget together -- even Chernomyrdin probably understands that  now. Removing Fedorov would mean getting hyperinflation within  three months.    But there is a suggestion that even Fedorov could be  bypassed. And by none other than the present vice premier Yuriy  Yarov, a politician distinguished mostly for the fact that he is  the only vice premier who has not managed to distinguish himself  by any action or if worst comes to worst by any statement for  the press. Having such a vice premier to hand would be far more  peaceful for Chernomyrdin than having the irrepressible Fedorov.  By an irony of fate Mr. Yarov entered the Duma on the "Russia's  Choice" list so that party formalities will be observed if he  should be appointed.    Who will Chernomyrdin appoint as his second "first vice  premier?" Most likely Gaydar -- the leader of the "Russia's  Choice" movement.    Actually, it is not out of the question that the matter may  end most unexpectedly. It is no accident that one high-ranking  government official who wishes to remain anonymous stated in a  talk with your correspondent: "If a government that does not  suit the reformers is proposed, we shall not stay here as  whipping boys."</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / UN seeks help for Bosnian refugees THE United Nations High Commission for Refugees yesterday made an impassioned plea for international financial assistance, food and medicine, saying the scale of the refugee and humanitarian crisis in Bosnia-Hercegovina was beyond all expectations. 'In the name of all the victims and displaced persons, we appeal to all sides in the conflict to let us renew our operations in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' said Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, head of the UNHCR mission overseeing humanitarian aid to the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Mr Mendiluce said 500,000 people were now displaced in Bosnia, while over 1m were cut off from any supplies. 'There is fighting all over the towns and villages in Bosnia. Paramilitary groups are forcing people to leave their homes. Others are fleeing before the fighting starts in their villages,' he said. 'The economy in Bosnia is collapsing. The people in the cities are without any supplies.' The UNHCR requires Dollars 141.9m (Pounds 78.8m) to cope with its relief programme from November 1991 to April 1993 in the former Yugoslavia. So far, however, it has obtained only Dollars 25m. Over 1m Moslem, Serbs, and Croats have already fled the republic since the fighting began last month following the international recognition of Bosnia's independence. 'If the war does not stop, and if relief supplies are not allowed through, then Croatia and Serbia must be prepared to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees,' Mr Mendiluce said in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. The UNHCR and the International Red Cross were recently forced to pull out of Bosnia-Hercegovina after Serb paramilitary groups repeatedly fired on relief convoys, while the Yugoslav federal army and Serb militias have blocked off Sarajevo airport. 'We were forced to stop all operations because of these blockades,' said Mr Mendiluce. 'Our staff, our vans, and our supplies have been repeatedly attacked. There is no respect for the symbols (of the UNHCR and the Red Cross).' A Swiss relief worker was killed by a Serbian mortar attack last week in the Bosnian capital. Despite these setbacks, Mr Mendiluce said UNHCR was continuing to negotiate safe passage for its convoys. But he acknowledged that he was not hopeful after previous pledges of safe conduct had been repeatedly broken.</p>

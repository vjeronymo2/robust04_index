			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Ambassador Badr Hammam, Egypt's assistant  foreign minister for Arab affairs and envoy of the Egyptian  president, left Sanaa today following a working visit to our  country that lasted several days. During the visit, Hammam  delivered messages to Brothers Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, the Presidential Council chairman, and 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  the Presidential Council vice chairman.    Before leaving Sanaa international airport, the Egyptian  envoy made a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', in  which he stressed the need for wisdom and logic to overcome the  political crisis that the Yemeni Republic is passing through at  this important phase in the Arab nation's history.    He said: At this phase, in which Yemen is passing through  hard times for both Yemen and every Yemeni, we wish Yemen peace  and tranquility. We must all remember that the recent incident  in 'Imran between the soldiers of the one homeland should not  forces us to deviate from the path that we all started with  democratic discussions to proceed toward the goal that is dear  to every Yemeni and Arab; namely, the preservation of the  homeland's unity and its people's cohesion.    Ambassador Badr Hammam also stressed the need to provide a  calm and appropriate atmosphere to start serious and programmed  action to implement the pledge and accord document. He said the  document is the correct path to establishing the state of unity  with its institutions and constitutional and executive agencies  so that Yemen and its people can begin a new era of security and  stability in the young Yemeni Republic, under which progress and  the comprehensive social and economic development can be  achieved.    Hammam was seen off by Brother Ibrahim al-Sa'idi, Foreign  Ministry under secretary; a representative from the Presidential  protocol department; and Brother 'Ata Harun, the Egyptian  ambassador in Sanaa.</p>

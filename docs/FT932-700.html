			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Private View: Hard times but still no hard sell for a dealer of the old school DEALERS lounged in booths tricked out like Mayfair drawing rooms, staring at the tanned legs of Girl Fridays sashaying down the aisles. Among the Sainsbury bag-carriers the occasional shopping queen stood out  - mane of hair, gold bangles, her decorator dancing attendance. It was June, the peak of the London selling season, and a stiflingly quiet day at the Olympia antiques fair. Halfway down one aisle, beside a nude Apollo, I found the exotically-styled Edric Van Vredenburgh, the very picture of an antique dealer with his grizzled beard, pony-tail, humorous eyes and morose expression. The way he talked about the recession prompted the question: so how is your business different to running a hardware store? 'It's not any more.' He became emotional. 'It's not. That's just the point. When I first came into the business you could be an antique dealer first. You bought and it was  - this is a very important word  - fun. You could enjoy it. You worked hard. I worked six days a week, seven days a week. I enjoyed it. I made a living. I didn't make a fortune. But I had a lot of fun. 'Now, you have to be an accountant, you have to be a tax consultant, you have to know about foreign exchange. It's hard.' Why don't you pack it up altogether? 'Can't afford to. I've got to make a living. Having done it for 30 years it's what I know how to do best.' Like any businessman in a recession  - and more prudent than some  - Van Vredenburgh began running down his Pounds 500,000 inventory and paying off his overdraft 18 months ago. Now in the clear, he has further decided to give up his little gallery in Bury Stret, St. James's, at the heart of the London antique trade, and deal from his house in Portobello Road instead. Why? 'Selling costs a lot of money today, especially in this city. The wheel clamp is a nightmare, parking is a nightmare, rates are a nightmare and rents are a nightmare.' Worse still, people were not coming to London any more. By 'people', Van Vredenburgh means Americans. What about the Japanese? 'Their houses are too small to accommodate antiques.' He blamed the big auction houses for shortening their selling season, suggesting that Sotheby's and Christie's were more interested in New York, Monte Carlo and Geneva than London. 'They are more like real estate agents than antique auction houses now, more accountant-driven than expert-driven.' It is the kind of stock-in-trade pessimism you would expect from a farmer grumbling in his Jag. The fact is that Van Vredenburgh, 48, is also beginning to feel his years. 'I've got to an age where I know there are other things than dealing in antiques,' he said finally. What are they? 'Well, people, among other things. Working with people, enjoying people's company. There was a little notice quoted in a newspaper last year about a gallery in St. James's that said 'Gone mushroom picking or fishing'. It happened to be me. I rather enjoy mushroom picking. If you have to run a gallery you don't have time to do things like that. 'And I want time to travel as well. I'm a hundred per cent an antique dealer. When I'm abroad I like to look at a museum or a house. It's important to do that. You're learning the whole time. I've realised in the last eight to ten years how little I do know.' Are there other reasons for giving up the gallery? 'Yes. You find less things.' In auctions that week he had found barely half a dozen things worth looking at and only one he really wanted, a circus painting, estimated at Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 8000. 'I went to sixteen and a half. It went to eighteen. I wasn't even the underbidder.' He suggested another reason for pessimism: Aids. He has noticed that some of his best clients, homosexual decorators from America, have just disappeared. On the other hand the financial disaster of the Lloyd's insurance market, which this week reported a Pounds 2.9bn loss for 1990, will bring a lot of antiques on to the market. The Antiques Road Show on television has flushed objects out of attics. But the trade had become too commercialised. 'Everything is an antique, from a Dinky toy to a Roman sculpture. As soon as the money-men get hold of anything they do it to death.' It seemed odd for an antique dealer to disparage money-men. Are you a typical dealer? I asked him. 'No. I'm probably more extrovert than most, in the way I express myself, in my behaviour, in the objects I buy.' I thought all dealers were showmen and wheeler-dealers, I said. 'Some may be. I hope I'm not any of those things. I would hate ever to be called a wheeler-dealer.' This dealer is descended on his father's side from Dutch burgomeisters who emigrated to the US in the 17th century. His mother's family were Russian Jewish refugees. The son, academically weak but visually acute, was a frustrated architect who at the age of 17 joined his father, a former entomologist at the British Museum who had gone into porcelain. Father and son fell out 15 years ago but have made it up since. 'Probably if I'd gone to work for someone else first our attitudes to each other would have been different,' Van Vredenburgh said. 'It's a typical father-son thing.' He considers himself a small dealer. The most he has paid for an object is Pounds 100,000, for a 16th century marble bust of the Roman emperor Commodus at the Castle Howard sale last year. But what sort of dealer? 'I've been asked that question many times. It's been said I have an eclectic taste. I like beautiful objects, I like a beautiful painting, a beautiful piece of furniture, a beautiful piece of pietro duro, and sculpture.' Do you buy only things you like yourself? 'Generally speaking, yes. When I say I buy for me, I buy first, I hope, with knowledge, second with taste  - my taste  - and then I hope the client likes my taste.' Have you anything you wouldn't ever sell? 'Not now. If you'd asked me that question five years ago I would have said yes. I've got quite a few things at home I've had for more than 10 years, some even for 20 or 25.' Are you sentimental? 'Not about the objects.' Do you ever get sick of objects? 'For a while, sometimes. But then something comes up and it does something to you. I think more than the pot of gold, the great bargain, the big windfall, you get your excitement from the really beautiful or interesting thing you come across occasionally.' What about people? Are you hard-hearted with them? 'I can be both. If I don't like someone I can be very tough. If I like somebody I think I'm pretty soft. I have both sides to my character. I mean, I've fallen out with a lot of antique dealers because I don't like their attitude. I don't like dishonesty. For the first time in a long time I am suing someone who owes me money. I'm only doing it because the person wouldn't discuss it.' I asked about stolen goods. 'It's not something I come across very often. There were people that one knew in London who imported things from Italy, for example, that were almost certainly stolen. It is usually easy to tell, and word soon gets round.' But once he was offered a half share in a bronze head which he discovered had been stolen from a church in the City. How does a buyer know if he's dealing with a rogue? 'How would he know if he goes to someone who's advising him on stocks and shares? He jolly well goes and finds the right person. If you just walk into a shop you don't know. If you are spending money you find out about the person you're spending money with. 'The problem with a lot of clients is they don't expect the person giving them advice to earn money from it. What are they in business for? Most people who have money to spend make it in business in some form or another. They expect to be paid, and usually quite well. But when it comes to spending money they'll spend it very freely without getting advice and then moan about it afterwards.' Do you bargain? 'I'll discuss, yes, why not? I prefer not to. It depends on the client. Personally, I prefer to know my client and say I want such-and-such a price. That's it. I don't want to have a big fight. 'On the other hand there are some people who will never  - never  - pay the price you ask them.' The richer people were, the more they disliked talking about when they would pay. Such talk they considered vulgar. 'So I have this 'when-do-you-pay price'.' Van Vredenburgh said his mark-up varies from 30 to 100 per cent depending on the object. 'To average 100 per cent is very rare in this trade, in spite of what punters think.' Bargains, too, were rare. 'You could not base a business on them.' Have you made a lot of money? 'I've made a living, not piles in the bank. A good living, but I still have to work.' What would make you give up altogether? 'I don't think I could altogether. There's still enough to enjoy. It gets less and less, but still enough. If I did extremely well  - when I say that I mean if I had between a million and five in one fell swoop, I would have no doubt about moving aside and spending far less time on it. 'It's like any other business: keep your eyes open, keep changing, be modern. I've given up the shop before. I might open a shop again, who knows?'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng today called at the office of the State Flood Control and  Drought Relief Headquarters to inquire about the flood situation  in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the provinces of  Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi in southern China.    Premier Li showed great concern about the flood situation in  the valleys of the Xijiang, Beijiang, Xiangjiang and Ganjiang  rivers. He expressed sympathy and solicitude for the broad  masses of local people and the soldiers of the People's  Liberation Army, armed police force and security force who are  in the forefront of combating the flood.    The Chinese premier also expressed the hope that the people  and soldiers in the flood-hit area would, under the leadership  of the local party committees and governments, carry forward the  spirit of continuous fighting to safeguard the dykes of the  rivers and the cities such as Guangzhou, Changsha and Nanchang,  and finally overcome the flood disaster.    Since severe rainstorms hit southern China in early June  this  year serious floods on the four above-mentioned rivers have hit  Guangxi, Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi. The local people, led by  the party and government, are combating the floods to reduce the  losses to the minimum.</p>

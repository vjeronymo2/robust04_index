			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 25 Jan (AFP) -- The Congolese  opposition today accused the ruling power of organizing  "military operations to establish a state of siege in order not  to recognize the verdict of the arbitration committee"  established to settle the electoral dispute before 5 February.    The arbitration committee is composed of seven international  magistrates in charge of examining 58 appeals for the  cancellation of the early 1993 legislative elections. These  legislative elections, whose results after the first round were  violently contested by the opposition in June and which led to a  suspension of the vote, constitute one of the root causes of the  political crisis that led to clashes between opposition  militiamen and the presidential group in the southern suburbs of  Brazzaville. After signing an agreement in Libreville last  August which established the arbitration committee among other  things, the elections resumed in October.    In a communique, the opposition accused the presidential  group of organizing "warlike pressure and violence against  civilians in the southern suburbs," where "armored cars fired 65  shells on Sunday night," the statement said with no further  details. For the opposition, these shellings are aimed at  "destroying the bridge over River Djoue," which links the  Brazzaville to the south of the country, and at preventing the  southern suburbs from obtaining their provisions from the  neighboring Pool Region. If this bridge is destroyed, "the  opposition reserves the right to retaliate," the statement said,  threatening to "attack local radio and television" and to block  all "air traffic."</p>

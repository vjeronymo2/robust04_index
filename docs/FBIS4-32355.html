			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva and Kiril Vulchev: "SDS To Boycott </F> Parliament Until It Opts For Elections"]    [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- The anti-communist Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) will continue its month-old boycott of  parliament until the National Assembly "clearly demonstrates a  will for the initiation of elections this autumn." In a special  address circulated this afternoon, the SDS National Coordinating  Council (top political leadership) calls for united action on  all democratic forces sharing the SDS principles and policy  documents.    For more than a year and a half now, the SDS has been trying  in vain to precipitate early general elections (regular  elections are due in the autumn of 1995). At its congress in  early June, the ex- communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP)  declared itself in favour of elections this coming autumn.  Extraparliamentary parties are also clamouring for early  elections. On May 26, the Lyuben Berov Cabinet was voted  confidence by parliament on the strength of a programme which  covers the period ending this September. On May 20, parliament  voted down the structural cabinet changes proposed by the prime  minister. The SDS saw Prof. Berov's refusal to resign in the  wake of the latter vote as a violation of the constitution which  illegitimizes the government. The SDS petitioned the  Constitutional Court to rule on the matter. The Court's ruling  was announced today. According to it, the prime minister need  not resign when parliament votes down any cabinet changes he may  move.    SDS Filip Dimitrov and BSP leader Zhan Videnov met yesterday  to discuss ways of achieving early elections. They, however,  failed to reach agreement. "SDS warns of the danger of turning  the Bulgarian Parliament, controlled by BSP and its satellites,  into a machine for recommunization of the country and for  relapse into the methods of the half-century-old communist  dictatorship," today's SDS address says. The coalition sees  elections as the only way out. The union remains committed to  the position, reaffirmed at its latest national conference in  May, that it will not take part in the formation of a new  government within the lifetime of the incumbent parliament.    BSP leader Zhan Videnov says SDS would not provide  guarantees  of early parliamentary elections. "The intra-coalition problems  which are taking the upper hand in the SDS deny it the  possibility to implement flexible and pragmatic policy and that  is why the resolutions of the SDS National Conference are  followed blindly," the BSP leader emphasized.</p>

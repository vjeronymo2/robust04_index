			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Jobless fall boosts economic optimism ANOTHER unexpected drop in unemployment and a marked slowdown in earnings growth yesterday revived hopes that the UK economy is continuing to recover with inflation under control. The figures prompted a strong rise in sterling, which closed in London 3/4 of a pfennig up on the day at DM2.51, a four-month high. It rose further in New York to DM2.5153. The monthly fall in unemployment - the third in a row - helped offset doubts about the strength of the recovery that arose earlier this week when official figures showed falls in retail sales and manufacturing output. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit shrank by 1,400 last month to 2,939,600, or 10.5 per cent of the workforce. The drop followed falls of 25,500 and 25,800 in February and March respectively and took the unemployment total to its lowest level for five months. Optimism about the UK's economic prospects was boosted further by news that average earnings growth hit a 25-year low in the year to March, on the strength of lower pay settlements. The subdued earnings growth also reflected sharp pay increases in March 1992, when some bonuses and salaries were paid ahead of the general election to avoid higher taxes under a possible Labour government. But a 45,000 rise in the number of people out of work for more than a year in the first quarter, acted as a reminder of the economy's fragility. At 1.07m, long-term unemployment was 234,000 higher than in the first quarter of 1992. The latest figures from the Department of Employment did little to end the confusion over the trend in unemployment. Some City economists said a strong rise in manufacturing employment for the third consecutive month meant the drop in unemployment was more than just a statistical 'artefact'. Manufacturing employment rose by 5,000 in March, the third consecutive monthly rise, following revisions for January and February. But Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, reiterated his accusation that the figures had been 'fiddled'. He said the government had restricted eligibility for claiming unemployment benefit. Mrs Gillian Shephard, backed by officials from the Employment Service, said the accusation was 'fabricated' and said her department had used the same method of calculating the number of unemployed since 1981. The unemployment figures diminished expectations of another cut in interest rates. The FT-SE 100 index of leading industrial shares closed down 2.9 points on the day at 2,816.8.

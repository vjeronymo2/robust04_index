			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COUNTY OR NORTH COUNTY FOR JAIL?  </P> <P> I noted from the responses to your editorial ("Time to Deal in Jail Realities,"  Aug. 22) that those most supportive of putting a jail on that site are from  central and southern Orange County.  </P> <P> Those people are right; it is time for NIMBY to stop. Let's build the jail in  South County. There is more unused land there than in the northern section.  </P> <P> Laughably, one South County resident asserted that people living near the jail  will benefit from it. If this is the case, then he would surely be an advocate  of placing the jail in his neighborhood (it could even be built on one of the  greenbelts).  </P> <P> J.S. FISHER  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

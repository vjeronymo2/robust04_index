			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Labour urges Clarke to provide investment boost Labour yesterday urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to abandon the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and to deliver a substantial increase in investment in his first Budget today. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, told a meeting of backbench Labour MPs that the Budget should maintain public services, introduce an emergency job-creation programme and rebuild Britain's social and economic fabric. Mr Brown also released a pamphlet, published by the Tribune group, setting out details of his claim that tax revenues could be increased by Pounds 10bn by closing tax loopholes. The pamphlet argues for abolition of the Business Expansion Scheme, reform of corporation tax, withdrawal of government plans to abolish stamp duty on share transactions and a windfall tax on the profits of privatised utilities. In his speech Mr Brown said tax loopholes allowed many millionaires to pay little or no tax, while many companies avoided their full share of taxation by using offshore tax havens. Mr Brown said that typical families already faced tax increases of Pounds 8.50 a week as a result of the last Budget. The imposition of VAT on domestic fuel would further weaken those least able to cope. Mr Brown said that tax reform would generate substantial funds to finance both the abolition of VAT on domestic fuel and a 'business plan for Britain' which would help create jobs and increase investment.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong off 3.5% at year low Stocks fell precipitously near the end of the session, wiping out early gains and putting the Nikkei 225 below 19,000 for the first time since December 2, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo After closing above 19,000 all week, the 225 index slid 201.74 under a barrage of arbitrage unwinding to finish at 18,978.30, having moved between 19,240.15 and 18,972.29 during the session. When futures started to tumble in the afternoon due to position covering, the market was deluged by arbitrage-related sales, pushing prices lower. Volume on the first section soared to an estimated 492m shares, more than twice the 211m shares traded on Thursday. Brokers attributed more than half the day's volume to transactions stemming from Friday's special-quotation settlement of index futures and options. The Topix index of all first-section stocks dropped 14.98 to 1,506, while the capital-weighted Nikkei 300 edged down 2.89 to 277.61. Losers swamped winners 772 to 237 with 168 stocks unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.40 to 1249.25. Sega Enterprises broke a nine-day winning streak and ended Y50 lower at Y5,660 after climbing to Y5,910 earlier in the day. Nintendo shed Y200 to Y5700. In Osaka the OSE average fell 197.18 to 20,984.92 in volume of 29.4m shares. Roundup The region was sharply weaker following Wall Street's overnight loss. HONG KONG closed a dismal week with a further 3.5 per cent decline to record another low for the year. The Hang Seng index lost 279.24 to 7,789.07, down 5.3 per cent over the week, amid heavy selling by foreign investors worried about rising US interest rates and fallout from the Orange County bankruptcy. The futures market pointed to further declines. The December share index contract ended at a discount to the physical market at 7,750, down 230 in heavy volume. Shares fell across the board with mainland China companies hardest hit. Investors feared that China's entry into Gatt would be delayed, dampening opportunities for mainland companies. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell 44.95, or 4.3 per cent, to 1,002.61. SINGAPORE fell 1.8 per cent to its lowest level since April as fund managers followed the trend seen elsewhere, selling stocks to raise cash. The Straits Times Industrials index closed 37.40 lower at 2,102.28 but off an intra-day low of 2,078.33. The index fell 5.1 per cent over the week. KUALA LUMPUR finished at a 13-month low as foreign investors continued to sell blue chips. The composite index closed 14.08 points lower at 911.26 for a 6.8 per cent fall on the week. SEOUL saw broad based selling for the third straight day, amid continuing worries of a liquidity squeeze and the composite index lost 16.03 to 1,037.67, for a 1.5 per cent decline on the week. Dealers said rumours that the central bank would allot to financial institutions Won1,300bn worth of monetary stabilisation bonds chilled sentiment, while news that a securities watchdog would inspect recent risers as an anti-corruption measure took its toll on a rally led by smaller-capitalisation companies. SYDNEY retreated to a 16-month low with the All Ordinaries index closing down 24.1, or 1.3 per cent, at 1,850.9, a week's fall of 1.6 per cent. Turnover was ADollars 325.3m. Among the movers BHP lost 44 cents to ADollars 18.56, CRA 28 cents to ADollars 17.18 and News Corp 13 cents to ADollars 4.97.

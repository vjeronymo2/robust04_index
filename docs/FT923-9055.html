			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Amic down 15% in first half LOWER prices in export markets and weak domestic demand caused earnings at Anglo American Industrial Corporation (Amic), the industrial arm of South Africa's largest company, to fall by 15 per cent in the first half to June. Turnover rose 5 per cent to R3.3bn (Dollars 1.2bn) from R3.1bn a year earlier, but difficult trading conditions saw operating profits fall to R170m from R211m. Amic's share of earnings of associated companies rose marginally to R90m from R89m, while income from investments and interest earned rose to R48m from R35m. Pre-tax earnings fell to R239m from R282m, while attributable earnings were 12.1 per cent lower at R160m compared with R182m. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said most of Amic's subsidiaries and associates had experienced reduced demand in local markets and lower prices abroad. This had resulted in cuts in some operations and lower production runs. Amic's interests are concentrated in mining-related activities and heavy industry. These have been hard hit by a fall in fixed investment by industry, which dropped at an annualised 7.5 per cent in the first quarter. The dividend was maintained at 110 cents a share on earnings of 281 cents, down from 333 cents. Mr Boyd said that earnings for the full year were likely to be in line with those for the first half. Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), the world's second-largest ferrochrome producer, improved its operating performance but still made a loss in the year to the end of June. CMI, a member of the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI) group, increased turnover to R306.4m from R274.6m in 1991 and managed to turn a R6.4m operating loss in 1991 into a R14.9m profit in 1992.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: US bank to expand in Germany Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, intends to double the size of its German operations within the next 18 months. Mr Richard Fisher, chairman of Morgan Stanley worldwide, said in Frankfurt the plan was to take the headcount from around 80 at its Frankfurt office to double that level. The expansion, which will be across all divisions, is the latest sign of the increasing attractions of Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - for the international investment banking community. The leading international investment houses have in most cases had Frankfurt offices since the mid-1980s but many institutions are keen to expand. Goldman Sachs, a late arrival which opened its Frankfurt office only in 1990, has doubled its personnel to 120 since last year. Mr Fisher said the main reason for the planned expansion was the likelihood of further globalisation of international capital markets. He predicted that the German financial world would become more 'Anglo-Saxon' as capital markets opened up further to international investors. 'The German capital markets will evolve considerably in the next few years,' Mr Fisher said, 'increasing in liquidity and the diversity of investor interests.' The recent decision to site the European central bank in Frankfurt was not a deciding factor behind the decision, he argued. It merely strengthened the arguments for stepping up the institution's commitment to Europe's largest economy. He denied that the expansion would be at the expense of its London operations, where the institution employs 1,400 out of a total European headcount of 1,800 staff. Currently much of the firm's German business - in areas such as mergers and acquisitions and equity research - is handled out of London but Mr Fisher was unwilling to be drawn on whether staff would be transferred out of London to Frankfurt. Morgan Stanley's German operations are headed by Mr Hans Peter Peters, a former main-board director of the powerful Westdeutsche Landesbank. The firm is especially strong in the capital markets area: Mr Peters said that in the year to date Morgan Stanley had underwritten DM12bn (Dollars 7.1bn) in capital, up from DM4.2bn last year, making the firm the leading non-German underwriter for D-Mark issues. It has lead managed 83 capital-raising issues in Germany this year, up from 27 last year. Mr Peters also pointed to successful M&amp;A transactions on which the firm has advised recently - for example it advised the privately-owned Gustav und Grete Schickedanz Holding group on the sale of its tissue business to Procter &amp; Gamble, a deal completed last week with a value estimated at DM1bn. Mr Fisher also said the firm would remain true to its commitment to Germany even if business conditions retreated from current levels. Foreign investment banks, like their domestic competitors, have prospered amid buoyant securities markets this year and a perceptible increase in the willingness of German companies to appoint foreign financial advisers. In Germany, however, there is a lingering mistrust of foreign institutions' staying power because many have withdrawn from the market after encountering severe difficulties.</p>

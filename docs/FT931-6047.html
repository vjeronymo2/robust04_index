			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Employers use surpluses to take holiday from pensions MORE THAN half of all British employers are now using pension fund surpluses to reduce or eliminate their contributions to employee pension schemes, according to an industry survey. The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, found in its 1992 survey of pension schemes that 38 per cent of employers are making no contribution while another 16 per cent are making reduced contributions. A further 1 per cent have used scheme surpluses to refund cash to themselves. The figures show a rise from the previous survey in 1991, which found that 47 per cent of schemes were on full or partial contributions holiday. Mr Mike Brown, NAPF director of information, said the rise in contributions holidays showed the effects that the recession was having on employers. 'They would rather use the money to pay their suppliers and staff,' he said. The question of whether employers should have the exclusive right to use scheme surpluses is among the most contentious issues under review by a government panel headed by Professor Roy Goode. The NAPF survey did not ask respondents whether contributions holidays have been accompanied by benefit improvements for scheme members. The survey covered 852 NAPF members, covering roughly 40 per cent of all UK pension scheme members. Meanwhile, the survey noted one potentially troubling trend for occupational pension schemes. Last year, 19 per cent of those eligible to join a scheme chose not to do so, up from 16 per cent the year before. Mr Brown said there may have been reasons other than disenchantment with occupational schemes which might account for the figure, such as the inclusion of part-time workers who may feel their earnings are too low to be able to afford contributions. Meanwhile, the survey found no sign of a much touted trend suggesting that employers are abandoning so-called final salary schemes - which promise employees a percentage of final salary upon retirement - in favor of money purchase schemes in which the employee receives a lump sum of contributions plus investment returns. Mr Brown said: 'It's the sort of thing many people are talking about but very few are actually doing it.' Employers have threatened that, if the government imposes new regulations on occupational pension schemes, they will abandon them in favour of the less attractive money-purchase schemes. The survey also found that, after the Maxwell affair, companies are more likely to appoint non-management trustees to their pension schemes.</p>

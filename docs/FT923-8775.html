			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Finance and the Family: Dream homes - nightmare scenarios - Scheherazade Daneshkhu and Emma Tucker add up the human costs - and benefits  -of the property market collapse THE steep fall in British house prices has forced some people to make painful decisions. Others have been able to profit from distress. Here four people tell remarkably different stories of how the collapse of the market affected their lives and decisions. James Higgins, of Chamberlain de Broe, a financial adviser, gives his assessment of each case. THE FIRST TIME BUYER . . . Michael Fitzgerald, a London banker in his early 30s, this week exchanged contracts on his first home - a flat in Islington, north London. 'I've been in a position to buy for a number of years,' he said. 'But I haven't done so both because of market conditions and personal reasons.' He has been renting since he left university in Ireland and moved to London. By the time he joined the bank, he felt he could afford to buy a flat for about Pounds 90,000, particularly since the bank would subsidise his mortgage as a perk. Like many others, he was tempted to buy in 1988 when the imminent abolition of double mortgage tax relief sent the housing market into a frenzy. He held off, partly because he could not find the right place and partly because of the additional costs of owning a own home, beyond the mortgage payments. 'At that time I would have bought a place as an investment,' he said, but this idea was undermined as house prices began to fall. He decided to buy now because he expected monthly mortgage payments would be down to about the same level as his monthly rent of Pounds 300. 'In the medium-term interest rates will probably drop so I think it is a reasonable time to buy,' he says. As a first-time buyer he had the advantage of being able to react quickly once he had chosen the flat he wanted. The three bedroomed flat he has bought, a repossession, is exactly what he was looking for. He believes that for the same amount of money, he would only have been able to afford a two bedroom flat in the same area in 1988. . . . picks a bargain JH: Michael is very fortunate. He is buying at the right sort of time - the London property market might not yet have reached its nadir but it should improve in due course. He has been able to take advantage of other people's desperation to sell and the general slump in prices. He is also able to match interest payments to present rents. Most of the current problems were created in the mid-1980s, when interest rates were low and when people grossly over-extended themselves in the rush to buy the biggest and best house they could possibly afford. They took no account of the fact that interest rates might rise - and this is precisely what happened. People will therefore be more aware of the pitfalls in future, and buyers and lenders will be more cautious - and realistic. There should therefore be slower but more sustainable growth in the property market. Whatever happens, Michael should be wary that he does not regard his home as an investment. THE GROUP OF FOUR . . . In October 1988 Sarah Cranfield, now in her late 20s, clubbed together with four friends to take out a 100 per cent mortgage on a house in Lewisham, south London. 'At the time everyone was saying we couldn't lose on the property boom,' she said. The four young professionals - two journalists, an accountant and a personnel officer - were each responsible for a mortgage of about Pounds 25,000, plus extra charges because of the supposedly greater risk of lending to four people. Within a year, higher interest rates had pushed their monthly payments from about Pounds 240 per month to Pounds 340 each - more than each would have paid to rent a similar house. Three years later the friends decided it was time to sell; they had all moved on, found partners and generally felt they had outgrown the property. But the house was valued at some Pounds 20,000 less than the value of the mortgage. Sarah and her friends decided to let the house but found that the rent did not cover the mortgage payments. Meanwhile, Sarah became pregnant and moved in with her husband, who was also sitting on a loss in his one-bedroomed flat in Brixton. They are now trying to sell it, desperate to move somewhere bigger as the baby grows up. But in the two months that the Brixton flat has been on the market, only six people have been to look at it - and none has shown an interest. Sarah and her husband hope that they will be able to transfer their joint debts to a new mortgage. But at Christmas she will be made redundant from her job. Her husband's job is also at risk and with both out of work, they are unlikely to find a lender willing to meet their needs. . . . trapped by debt JH: Sarah and her friends managed to get into the housing market at the top of the boom. Given that the first flat had a 100 per cent mortgage, there should have been a mortgage indemnity insurance taken out. These only have limited benefit for the borrowers, but if the property were to be repossessed, the insurance should cover the balance. The danger is that the insurance company might pursue the borrowers for the balance and they (the borrowers) would have difficulty raising new finance in the future. If the rent on the first property is only a little short of the costs of the building, the borrowers should try to service the loan until a buyer can be found at a reasonable price. Interest rates should fall over the course of the next year. The costs of the loan will decrease - it will also stimulate the market. THE PRUDENT RENTER . . . For almost a year David Kauders, an independent financial adviser in Taunton, Somerset, has been renting a four bedroomed detached house close to the town centre. The rent of Pounds 400 per month includes the water rates and a gardener. Kauders, who sold his last house, a small country cottage, for Pounds 33,000 in 1986, says: 'I am now renting a house I couldn't afford to buy'. The house he is renting last changed hands for about Pounds 160,000 three years ago. Kauders has calculated that if he had taken out a 20-year mortgage of Pounds 150,000 on the house, he would be paying around Pounds 18,000 in interest alone. On top of this, he would have to spend around Pounds 7,500 a year to repay the capital. This compares with a mere Pounds 4,800 a year in rent. 'Over 20 years I would spend something like half a million pounds to acquire a property which could well be worth less than Pounds 100,000 by the end,' he says. Meanwhile, it would take only a small level of savings a year to accumulate Pounds 100,000 over 20 years. 'People are still making false assumptions about future rates of inflation and house prices when it comes to buying homes,' Kauders believes. An oversupply of property and a low inflationary economy means that house prices will continue to fall for a long time yet. 'People should rent somewhere now and gather their cash - in time they will be laughing,' he says. . . . bides his time JH: There is a lot to be said for renting - David's experience demonstrates the comparatively low costs involved. The problem is that the property is not one's own. The time can always come when the owner either wants to sell or to change the use of the property. Also, David's experience could be limited to the south west of England and might not apply across the UK property market - certainly not to London. If the house was worth Pounds 160,000 three years ago, it would probably not sell for more than Pounds 125,000 now. The current climate means that some very good deals can be had. There is also the question of comparative investments. David has measured his situation over three years - possibly a rather unusual three years and certainly too short a term over which to measure growth in investments. Over the last two decades the overall return on property has outstripped most equity indices. However, those who put all their money into property can end up being 'asset rich but cash poor'. David is probably maximising his potential retirement income by building up a portfolio of cash/liquid assets on which to call when income is required. A balance between the two forms of investment is what is needed. THE UNEMPLOYED DEBTOR . . . Raymond Fender's problems began when the business for which he worked in Tyneside went into liquidation last year. Monthly payments on his Pounds 50,000 mortgage were Pounds 465. At first, he managed to meet the commitments by dipping into his building society savings. After several months, however: 'I realised there was no work for me and that our savings were being depleted quickly.' Raymond, 46, and his wife, Pamela, decided reluctantly in November to put their much-loved house, set in the countryside 10 miles west of Newcastle, on the market. 'It was valued at Pounds 81,000 a year and a half back,' says Raymond. 'But even though it is on the market for Pounds 67,950, we've had just one couple coming to see it.' As paying the mortgage became more and more difficult, Raymond decided to talk to his lender. It agreed to a temporary reprieve by allowing him to halve his monthly payments. That was nearly six months ago. Now, with savings depleted, no prospect of a job and no buyer, the Fenders live in fear of repossession. 'There will come a day when they will have to repossess,' said Raymond. 'The worst thing is the uncertainty. You go to bed not knowing if, in the morning, you are going to get a repossession order or a letter from the lenders saying we've given you enough time.' . . . waits in fear JH: This is another sad tale - a very common one at the moment. No income because job prospects are poor, and the inability to sell a property when either capital is required or when a debt and debt servicing need to be reduced. Raymond will need to talk again to his lender to reassure them that he can provide them with at least some flow of income until times improve. They will prefer that to the alternative of repossession, which is costly to them. There is still some equity in the property. By halving his payments for six months, his arrears have been increased by only Pounds 1,500 approximately. This suggests that his lenders should be prepared to let matters run for at least a further year - perhaps longer if property prices pick up. Building societies are developing new strategies to offer a pragmatic solution which will be in everyone's favour. There are likely to be some sale and leaseback arrangements which may either involve housing associations (someone buying the property and renting it to the owner), or some form of reduction of interest payments for a period of time in return for a percentage of any overall "profit' (sale price above loan value) on final sale.</p>

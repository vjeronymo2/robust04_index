			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / International Company News: MCI president Akerson quits telecoms industry MR DAN AKERSON, president of MCI, the US's second-biggest long-distance telephone company, is leaving to head General Instrument, a maker of transmission equipment for cable television with a market value of nearly Dollars 4bn. He will also become a general partner in the leveraged buy-out firm of Forstmann Little, which took control of General Instrument in 1990. Mr Akerson, 44, was made president and chief operating officer of MCI only last year. He had won the support of Wall Street for his hard-driving attitude, and for the agreement in June to bring in British Telecommunications as a 20 per cent shareholder in MCI. Mr Akerson said he had not been looking to leave MCI, but had been drawn away by the opportunity to lead General Instrument as it develops in the field of interactive media. Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's chairman and chief executive, added that the financial package had also tempted Mr Akerson away. His new remuneration was not disclosed, but last year his salary and bonus at MCI came to Dollars 830,000, and he was given restricted stock in the company worth another Dollars 790,000 and options over 46,000 shares. Analysts said that the departure resulted in part from the fact that Mr Akerson's path to the top at MCI was blocked by the 51-year-old Mr Roberts. Both men denied there had been any disagreement over strategy. MCI, which was notified of Mr Akerson's intention to leave only on Tuesday, said it had not yet decided whether to replace him, or whether to take the opportunity to reorganise management. General Instrument said Mr Donald Rumsfeld, 61, a former US defence secretary, would step down as chairman and chief executive after Mr Akerson joins the company at the end of August, but would remain a director. MCI shares fell on the news but later recovered to close at Dollars 28 1/4 , up Dollars  5/8 on the day. General Instrument's shares lost Dollars 2, to Dollars 47. McCaw Cellular Communications and PacTel, a unit of Pacific Telesis Group, have received regulatory approval to combine their interests in San Francisco, San Jose, Dallas, and Kansas City, and Kansas, into a 99-year joint venture. McCaw and PacTel said they would each have equal ownership of the venture.</p>

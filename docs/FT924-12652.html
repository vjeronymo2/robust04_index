			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Notts Tec calls for national energy policy JUST five months ago North Nottinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council warned that continued pit closures would have a 'devastating' effect on the economic and social life of the county. In the first political intervention by a Tec, the council called for a national energy policy based on the use of coal as a strategic fuel. Mrs Pat Richards, chief executive, said: 'Everything we do on the training and enterprise front can be negated by a rapid reduction of the (coal) industry.' Yesterday, Mrs Richards and representatives of 16 other Tecs affected by the threatened pit closures met Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, to discuss what Tecs can do to help miners made redundant. Mrs Shephard has written to Mr Greville Janner, Labour chairman of the Commons employment committee, saying that Pounds 75m will be made available to Tecs. She wants the Tecs worst affected by the closures to present plans within two weeks for tackling the problem alongside the Employment Service. The ES and Tecs will get an extra Pounds 30m this year and Pounds 45m next year. This year's money will be additional to Tecs' Pounds 2.4bn training budget, but it is not yet known whether the Pounds 30m will be additional to next year's settlement. Tec representatives said after the meeting with Mrs Shephard that they were appreciative of her efforts to get extra funds. They were, however, critical of government policy. Mr Michael Malone, deputy chairman of MetroTec near Wigan, said: 'No amount of money compensates for the fact that we are losing jobs and we just cannot create new ones.' Tecs at present are struggling to deal with existing rises in unemployment, including the high-est level of long-term unemployment - people unemployed for more than a year - since July 1988. Before the mining closures were announced Tec leaders told the government that they considered any cuts to their budgets in the next public expenditure survey would be unacceptable. Many Tecs have pointed out that cuts to their budgets have led to falls in the quality of their programmes, particularly Employment Training - the scheme for the adult long-term unemployed. Tecs feared that the government might cut their existing programmes or claw back any underspending on Employment Action, the work experience scheme, to pay for extra help for miners. The belief that the Pounds 75m over two years will most probably be new money has been welcomed by Tecs. Mr John Troth, chairman of North East Wales Tec, said in a letter to the prime minister at the weekend: 'Tecs were set up precisely to deal with this sort of situation and it required the government to recognise the need for local flexibility and the relevant investment to enable us to provide the individually focused support that the miners will need to get into jobs.' He added: 'We are not talking about throwing money at the problem as has happened with previous large-scale redundancy programmes. We are calling for focused investment in local, effective solutions.'</p>

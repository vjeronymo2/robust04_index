			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / People: Environment and Home Office - UK civil service moves for Wilson and Turnbull Two of the UK's larger government departments will have new permanent secretaries from the start of next month. Richard Wilson, currently permanent secretary at the department of the Environment, will be taking over the top job at the Home Office. The vacancy was created by the premature retirement of Sir Clive Whitmore, linked by the Whitehall gossip mill to friction between civil servants in the department and Michael Howard, the abrasive Home Secretary. Wilson, 51, should have no difficulty in dealing with his new master, having worked with Howard when he was Environment Secretary. Before moving to Environment, Wilson was deputy secretary (Industry) at the Treasury. His place at the top of the Environment department will be filled by Andrew Turnbull, who is currently second permanent secretary at the Treasury in charge of public expenditure. Turnbull, 49, has spent most of his working life at the Treasury and was responsible for exchange rate policy at the time of sterling's departure from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. He was principal private secretary to the prime minister between 1988 and 1992, serving both Margaret Thatcher and John Major. In line with the prime minister's ending of automatic honours for top mandarins, neither has yet been awarded the once traditional knighthood for permanent secretaries.</p>

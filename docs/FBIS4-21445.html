			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [``Pool'' item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, April 6 (TANJUG) -- Foreign Minister of  the Republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) Slobodan Jarcevic said on  Wednesday in a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali that Croatia was depositing nuclear and toxic waste  in western Slavonia, close to the border with the RSK.    The radioactive and toxic waste is being dumped on two  locations on Mt. Papuk, Jarcevic specified.    Croatia drove out all Serbs from western Slavonia in 1991 in  its war of secession from the former Yugoslav Federation.    Jarcevic said he wrote a letter last month to UN expert  William Fenrick informing him about the hazard the dumps posed  to the environment. The copy of the letter was sent to the  office of the UN secretary-general.    In the letter addressed to Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday, whose  copy was sent to TANJUG, Jarcevic expresses regret and  puzzlement at not receiving a reply from the UN  secretary-general, ``all the more so as the dumps pose danger  not only to the people of the RSK but to UN troops deployed near  the danger zone too.''    The RSK was formed in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated  areas in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from  the former Yugoslav Federation and attempts to downgrade the  Serbs to a national minority.    The RSK was placed under UN protection in March 1992 and  14,000 UN peacekeepers are currently stationed there.    In his letter to the secretary-general, Jarcevic enclosed  the  topographical map of the two locations and roads leading to  them, and insisted that the UN civilian police investigate the  matter and report the findings to the Security Council.</p>

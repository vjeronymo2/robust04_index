			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Daimler enters MTN market with Dollars 2bn deal DAIMLER-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, has entered the fast-growing Euro medium-term note market with a multi-currency programme of Dollars 2bn to provide more flexibility in the refinancing of its leasing and credit sales business. The programme, to be signed today, is the largest yet arranged for a German company. It will enable Daimler, whose activities include vehicles and aerospace, to draw tranches for varying periods, at differing interest rates, in a variety of currencies. Mr Paul Wick of Daimler's finance department said Debis, the group's financial services arm, had a yearly refinancing need of some DM8bn, likely to grow by about DM1bn a year. This mostly related to business in cars and trucks. Debis's activities were growing in the US - where car leasing deals are a way of offering competitive prices in a tough market - Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, and Japan. Newer markets included the Nordic area and Mexico. The EMTN programme has been arranged by Deutsche Bank, with Merrill Lynch International as co-arranger. Daimler will be able to draw on the programme in dollars, D-Marks - recently made possible by the Bundesbank's further liberalisation of the capital market - other leading European currencies, ECUs, and Canadian and Australian dollars. The programme will fit between its short-term commercial paper funds and its Eurobond borrowings, with tranches expected to run mainly for two to five years. The funds can be drawn on by three group subsidiaries: Daimler-Benz International Finance in the Netherlands, Daimler-Benz North America Corporation in New York, and Daimler-Benz UK in London.</p>

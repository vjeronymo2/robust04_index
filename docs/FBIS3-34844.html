			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah] </F>   [Excerpt] 'Abdallah Hurani, PLO Executive Committee  member, says any Executive Committee session to which fewer than  10 members turn up is illegal.    In statements to AL-RA'Y, Hurani observed that the PLO's  bylaws state that the Executive Committee quorums are met by the  attendance of two thirds of its membership -- 12 out of 18  members. Six members have boycotted its meetings since last  September over the Oslo agreement. He indicated that the bylaws  also provide that if the 12-member quorum failed to materialize,  a meeting may be set for the following day, with the attendance  of half the committee members of nine plus one. Accordingly,  any session to which fewer than 10 members report is deemed  illegal.    I suggested to him that this had been practice even before  the Oslo agreement and was nothing new to the Executive  Committee meetings. Hurani agreed, but noted that the decisions  under consideration by the Executive Committee this time are  crucial.    He called the Cairo agreement an offspring of the Oslo  accord, and contended that it yielded further ground to the  Israelis. An assertive and vigorous popular action in the  occupied territories, rather than smartness and skill at the  negotiating table, can call a halt to these concessions, Hurani  maintained.    The PLO Executive Committee member, who is viewed as an  independent, said he was not surprised by the Cairo agreement,  seeing that it is substantially covered by the Oslo accord. The  Cairo agreement simply spelled out certain details.    The series of Palestinian concessions also did not come as a  surprise to me, Hurani added. Criticisms and opposition, he  said, must focus mainly on the root of the problem and that is  the Oslo accord. Unless the Palestinian leadership rethinks the  core of its position, the string of concessions seems unlikely  to stop there. It has made a series of retreats on the  boundaries, the crossings, the area of the Jericho enclave,  Jewish settlements, and security. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- President Lee Teng-hui  Saturday [9 April] called Beijing's handling of the Lake Qiandao  disaster "shoddy," saying mainland officials had acted like "a  bunch of bandits."    Li made the remarks while touring Chungshing new village.    He stressed that government should be a government "of the  people [words indistinct] saying that the Communist Party is  made up of [word indistinct] elements and they have acted like a  bunch of bandits, he said that such a government should have  been discarded by the people long ago.    Meanwhile, Huang Kan-hui, chairman of the Mainland Affairs  Council, condemned Beijing's handling of the case as "barbaric  and shameless."    It was the harshest criticism of Beijing's authority from  any  ministerial-level official since the government adopted an open  policy toward the mainland.    He also criticized Beijing for having repeatedly turned down  requests from Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation to send an  official to the mainland to assist the victims' relatives.    Huang accused Beijing of trying to cover up the truth by  barring reporters and the relatives from examining the [word  indistinct] boat.</p>

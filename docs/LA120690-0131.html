			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : POLICE EXAMINE CAMPAIGN RECORDS IN BRADLEY  PROBE  </P> <P> Police detectives probing political fund raising by Los Angeles Mayor Tom  Bradley's aides and appointees examined public campaign records at City Hall on  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The investigators and a Police Department spokesman refused to say what they  were seeking.  </P> <P> "We are investigating and that means we get out and talk to people and look at  records," said Police Cmdr. William Booth. Other officials said the  investigators inquired about Bradley campaign records mentioned in recent Times  articles.  </P> <P> The Times reported last month that some Bradley aides may have misused city  resources and some commissioners may have run afoul of state  conflict-of-interest laws while raising campaign money for Bradley. The Police  Department is conducting a joint investigation with the district attorney and  the state Fair Political Practices Commission, Booth said.  </P></p>

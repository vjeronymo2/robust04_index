			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Congo forced to relaunch Dollars 600m structured deal A complex structured bond issue for the Republic of the Congo, which was intended to raise Dollars 600m from international investors, has had to be completely revamped and relaunched due to lack of investor demand for the original product. Qwinzy Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based broker, announced last month it had bought the bonds, with a face value of Dollars 600m. It had hoped to place them with specialist emerging market investors. Qwinzy originally structured the deal in the form of zero-coupon 'energy receivables' bonds maturing in 2003, when the bond proceeds were to be redeemed using royalty payments from Agip, the Italian oil company with drilling rights in the republic. The zero-coupon bonds were forecast to yield between 9 and 11 per cent, according to Qwinzy. Because of the low level of investor interest, Qwinzy, which initially purchased the bonds in a bought deal, has renegotiated a lower purchase price for the bonds, according to Mr Neil Miller, managing director of Anglo-Oriental Investments, the London arm of Qwinzy. He said the original terms of Qwinzy's agreement with the Congo allowed for renegotiation of terms in the event of placement problems. The new-look structured deal consists of Congo bonds securitised by 10-year US Treasury bond principal (bonds stripped of their coupon, and carrying a triple-A credit rating) with a 10 per cent coupon made up of the Agip 'receivables' or royalties. As a result of the restructuring, the Congo will receive about Dollars 250m instead of the estimated Dollars 500m in the original deal.</p>

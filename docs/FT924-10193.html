			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Race for the White House: Bush tries to ignore Iran charge PRESIDENT George Bush made it crystal clear over the weekend that he has no intention of responding to the latest Iran-Contra revelations in any detail and thinks the public should focus much more on Governor Bill Clinton's evasion of military service 23 years ago. Mr Bush bristled in a TV interview yesterday when questioned about new evidence in an additional indictment against Mr Caspar Weinberger, the former defence secretary. Mr Weinberger's notes suggested Mr Bush was much more familiar with the arms-for-hostages scheme far earlier than he has let on. 'Do you want to spend the whole half hour on this,' the president demanded. The time could be better spent talking about Mr Clinton and the draft, he said. In any case, the two issues were entirely different. He thought the Iran-Contra investigations were 'a big witch-hunt' and found it sinister that the latest indictments should have been handed down so close to the election. Over the weekend he accused the Democrats of seizing on the issue to divert attention from the fact that their lead was 'slipping away'. Whether that is true or not, the Clinton campaign has lost no opportunity to capitalise on the fact that the trust issue may be as relevant to Mr Bush as to Mr Clinton. Thus, on Friday night, Mr George Stephanopoulos, Mr Clinton's communications director, called up the Larry King Live TV show, on which Mr Bush was a guest, to point out discrepancies in presidential statements about his knowledge of Iran-Contra. Mr Clinton also consistently accuses Mr Bush of putting out false and misleading advertisements about his record. He specifically charged the president of pandering to regional prejudice. 'In one state,' Mr Clinton said in Georgia, 'he says I'm too liberal, in another state he says I'm a backwater redneck.' Mr Bush said yesterday: 'I have never accused him of being a redneck, I've just said he has a sorry record in Arkansas.' He denied he bore any responsibility for what he conceded was 'an ugly campaign, the worst I've known', adding 'I will dish it out and see if they can take it.' He then denied all knowledge of two recent commercials which portray Arkansas as an industrial and environmental wasteland. The authors of two studies which form the basis for the advertisements have complained that the Bush campaign has completely distorted their findings.</p>

Rivero), first secretary of the Communist  Party of Cuba [PCC] in San Nicolas Municipality, Havana  Province, has announced that the PCC will pay special attention  to economic efficiency in all sectors this year, principally in  the production sector. (Rivero) said that in San Nicolas, like  everywhere else in Cuba, economic problems are being discussed  at the work centers and analyses are being conducted on ways to  reduce subsidies to the management and budgetary systems, while  producing more with the available raw materials.    The PCC municipal leader stressed that the PCC's attention  in  the province is focused on increasing cane production by 20,000  arrobas per caballeria in the 1994-95 harvest. He said they also  aim to continue the tasks of defense and recovery in  cattle-raising, as well as the fuel conservation policy.</p>

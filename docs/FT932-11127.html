			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Italian deputies end secret voting in scandal cases ITALY'S chamber of deputies yesterday decided to abolish secrecy when voting on whether to waive the immunity of members involved in cases of corruption and the illicit financing of political parties. This represented a hurried attempt to mollify public opinion, outraged by the way parliament last Thursday blocked four of six requests by Milan magistrates for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, to face charges of corruption. In demonstrations in Italy's main cities, protesters claimed immunity was being abused to protect parliamentarians like Mr Craxi. The outcome of the vote led the former communist, Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), and the Greens to withdraw their four ministers from the Ciampi government within ten hours of it being formed. Only yesterday were four new ministers, all technicians, sworn in. Many deputies were convinced that in the Craxi vote secrecy was itself abused. Members of the opposition like the populist Lombard League, the hardline communist group, Reconstructed Communism, and the Network (La Rete) are believed to have voted to preserve Mr Craxi's immunity - with the aim of embarrassing the government. The decision coincided with the late night agreement on Tuesday by the Socialist Party not to contest magistrates' requests for its deputies to be investigated. In an attempt to improve its image, the party also agreed that members under investigation, especially the 54 in parliament and the main party apparatus, should be suspended. The party, which has a new leader, Mr Giorgio Benvenuto, is also planning a new name and symbol. The corruption issue yesterday looked like implicating more deeply the former Italian Communist Party (PCI). Milan magistrates leaked evidence that Mr Giulio Caporali, a former board member on the state railways, representing the Communists, had ensured funds went to the party via railways contracts handed out to 10 groups belonging to the PCI's co-operative movement. The funds were used, he alleged, to plug the debts of L'Unita, the PCI daily and cover conference expenses. Mr Caporali was expelled from the PCI in 1988 after a scandal over the purchase of linen for sleeper coaches. Railway contracts are emerging as a major new line of enquiry by Milan magistrates. Another is contracts in the state telephone system. In the past four days one senior former executive in Asst, the telephone service, and an official in the tele-communications ministry have been arrested. Mr Giuseppe Parrella, former managing director of Asst, is being questioned about alleged kickbacks on L2,500bn (Pounds 1.06bn) of telecom orders involving major domestic and multinational companies between 1987 and 1991.

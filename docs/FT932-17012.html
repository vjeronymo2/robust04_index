			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / UK Company News: Investment trusts' concern over ruling INVESTMENT TRUST companies have been looking nervously over each others' shoulders recently since the latest ruling from the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog. Their concern follows a carefully-worded statement from the Panel on the accounts to December 31 1991 of Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust. At issue were two points which have wider implications for other companies, most notably quoted investment trusts: disclosure of the emoluments of the directors of its investment management company, and the consolidation of subsidiaries. 'As professional investors we live by information and so it is in our interest to set high standards of financial reporting,' says Mr Eric Elstob, joint managing director. 'We believe in maximum disclosure.' The Panel's primary concern was that F&amp;C's 1991 annual report disclosed only the emoluments for the chairman of Pounds 25,000, and for the six non-executive directors of the parent, all in the Pounds 10,001-Pounds 15,000 range. There was no disclosure of emoluments for the five executive directors of Foreign &amp; Colonial Management, F&amp;C's investment manager, which is an associate of one of the parent company's subsidiaries. This reflects the peculiar nature of the investment trust industry. The investment management company is not wholly owned by F&amp;C, and conducts work for other investment trusts which - while they may carry the F&amp;C name - are not subsidiaries but separate companies. The review panel took the view that the proportion of remuneration by the directors to the investment manager relating to services for F&amp;C and its subsidiaries should nevertheless be shown in the accounts. Mr Elstob said the figure was difficult to calculate, but the company has made an attempt to allocate payment for the time spent. The 1992 accounts show the restated directors' emoluments for 1991 as Pounds 195,000. That includes - in addition to the figures shown the previous year - a seventh director in the Pounds 10,001-Pounds 15,000 range; one in the Pounds 15,001-Pounds 20,000 range; two earning between Pounds 25,001 and Pounds 30,000, and Pounds 114,000 to the highest paid director. The second issue of concern to the Panel was whether certain subsidiaries should have been consolidated in the 1991 accounts. F&amp;C maintains that the subsidiaries were not material, and their inclusion was therefore not necessary. The Panel has left its verdict ambiguous on the topic, but F&amp;C has decided to consolidate these subsidiaries in the 1992 accounts, with a re-statement for 1991. There is no mention of the discussions with the Panel in the accounts, but Poutney Hill Holdings, which owns 50 per cent of F&amp;C Management has now been included in the consolidated balance sheet. Its consolidation during 1991 would have added just 0.1 per cent to net assets. While the Panel's rulings only affect F&amp;C and do not set a wider precedent, they do give a hint to other companies of the way in which UK accounting thinking is evolving.</p>

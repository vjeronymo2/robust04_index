			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A FRESH AND WITTY 'FORUM'  </P> <P> A funny thing happened on the way to the La Jolla Playhouse: "A Funny Thing  Happened on the Way to the Forum" became high class entertainment. That's  Entertainment with a capital E, not a capital H, as in high-brow, which "Forum"  could/should never be.  </P> <P> It simply means that director Des McAnuff, choreographer Wayne Cilento,  designers John Arnone (playful sets), Brenda Berry (jocular lights) and Susan  Hilferty (tongue-in-cheek costumes) have taken the 1962 Burt Shevelove and  Larry Gelbart book based on those immortal low-brow Roman gags of Plautus and  added new fun and visual wit of their own.  </P> <P> They didn't have to do anything to the gorgeous Stephen Sondheim music or  lyrics (how do you improve on "I squeak, I squawk/Today I woke too weak to walk  . . . ."?) except restore a couple of hitherto deleted songs. "The House of  Marcus Lycus" is back to its original length and the exquisite love duet, "The  Echo Song," uncharitably excised in the past, is happily back where it belongs.  </P> <P> Orchestrator Bruce Coughlin has spiced things up with some embellishments a la  Spike Jones, and musical director Ted Sperling and Steven A. Freeman have  injected some strategic but noninvasive incidental music. All to the good.  </P> <P> The results are a truly funny thing: a vivid, fast-moving, new-vision "Forum"  for the '90s.  </P> <P> McAnuff has called it a New Vaudeville "Forum," but never mind the semantics.  What it comes down to is that, without hampering the old plot (the oldest of  them all: the convoluted machinations of the slave Pseudolus to attain his  freedom) or altering any of the sexist-chauvinist jokes and stereotypes (the  harridan Domina, the hen-pecked Senex, the bevy of courtesans with such  indiscreet names as Vibrata, Gymnasia and Panacea), McAnuff has breathed robust  new life into them.  </P> <P> He's given the women equal smarts, made them undiminished rebels instead of  bimbo chattel, placed the show's emphasis squarely on everyone's unquenchable  thirst for freedom (from slavery, from marriage, from parents, from contracts)  and let it rip.  </P> <P> This "Forum" moves like the wind, part Barnum &amp; Bailey, part Abbott and  Costello (Ralph Bruneau's Hysterium rightfully gets just about equal billing  with Ernie Sabella's Pseudolus), and is redolent with sight gags, word gags  ("Oh, Philia . . ."), chases, revolving houses that make comic statements of  their own -- everything, in fact, except the kind of Las Vegas sleaze that has  beset this appealing musical through the years, making it too often just  appalling.  </P> <P> Sabella, a Gorbachev look-alike, is a great dumpling of a Pseudolus -- a savvy  jangle of loose nerves in a terminal snarl of self-defense. Given this show's  affection for puns it's amazing he didn't end up being called Pandemonium.  </P> <P> Without doing an imitation, Paul Keith's lech of a Senex is reminiscent of the  late-great Phil Silvers in the role, while Liz Torres as his wife Domina, plays  the virago aspects of the role with a surprisingly sympathetic subtext (it  can't be all fun being married to Senex).  </P> <P> Hero, their son, is a lovesick puppy at the proper hands of Jeff Blumenkrantz,  while Pamela Winslow's Philia, the object of Hero's adoration, eschews the  usual dumb-blond interpretation for the classier uneducated-but-not-stupid. It  makes her instantly more interesting. As for George McDaniel as her smug,  cock-o'-the-walk betrothed Roman general, Miles Gloriosus ("I am my own  ideal"), he looks like a young William F. Buckley -- a coincidence that rather  enhances the performance.  </P> <P> But the overriding virtue of this co-presentation with the Orange County Center  for the Performing Arts (where the show will play Aug. 17-21) is the director's  regard for the dignity of comedy. McAnuff has respect for the material and a  field day clowning it up -- up, mind you, not down. Cilento's choreography is  never cheap; suggestive yes, in bad taste no. There's not a smidgen of  vulgarity in this show, with a splendid pit band of 14 that keeps things at a  frenzied pitch.  </P> <P> It's a vibrant, unclean, saucy romp, filled with cleverness and wit, in which  all elements come together to make it the summer's great Roman caper. Something  for everyone. They don't make them much more entertaining than that.  </P> <P> "Forum" may just be headed for Orange County next, but watch it go a lot  farther.  </P> <P> At the Mandell Weiss Theatre, UCSD campus, La Jolla Village Drive and Torrey  Pines Road in La Jolla, Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; matinees, Saturdays  and Sundays at 2, until Aug. 12. $20-$26; (619) 534-3960.

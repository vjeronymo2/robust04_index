			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE OPERATOR SOUGHT FOR U.S. DRUG PROGRAM; UNION OBJECTS  </P> <P> The Justice Department is seeking a private firm to run a major anti-drug  program and to coordinate federal attempts to curb juvenile crime, a move that  "defies common sense," a government union charged Thursday.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, the department would replace 48 government employees in the  Bureau of Justice Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention by signing a contract with a private firm to do their work.  </P> <P> In the past, the Ronald Reagan Administration tried on several occasions to  eliminate the Office of Juvenile Justice by not requesting any funds for its  operation, but Congress invariably stepped in to rescue the agency.  </P> <P> "This is another good way to destroy it," said Stu Smith, president of Local  2830 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  </P> <P> Smith said 27 of the affected employees are social scientists, and eliminating  those positions would wipe out more than 60% of the office's professional work  force.  </P> <P> On Capitol Hill, Rep. Paul E. Kanjorski (D-Pa.), chairman of the House Post  Office and Civil Service Committee that oversees the government's  contracting-out program, challenged the proposal in a letter to Atty. Gen. Dick  Thornburgh.  </P> <P> Kanjorski said the employees who would be affected by the change were  performing legitimate governmental functions.  </P> <P> Richard B. Abell, assistant attorney general for the Office of Justice  Programs, announced last week that the department would accept bids from  private firms to do the work now performed by social science program  specialists in the two agencies.  </P> <P> The Bureau of Justice Assistance supervises the use of $446 million in funds  for anti-drug operations by state and local governments as well as private  groups. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has an annual  budget of $72.5 million to finance its coordination of all federal youth  program activities.  </P> <P> In protesting the move, AFSCME Local 2830 said the two agencies make sure that  government funds are spent according to Congress' specifications.  </P> <P> "The employees filling many of these positions . . . operate programs to teach  law enforcement officers about child abuse, train juvenile court judges, help  communities fight drug trafficking and coordinate the fight against crime with  other government agencies," the union said.  </P> <P> "To allow the private sector to take over such operations defies common sense  and mocks the congressional intent of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 and the  Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention statutes. The intended or  unintended result would be to destroy the integrity of two major government  programs."  </P></p>

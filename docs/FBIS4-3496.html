			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 21 (CNA) -- Egypt has expressed a  strong desire to strengthen bilateral trade and economic  relations with Taiwan, P.K. Chiang, minister of economics  affairs said Wednesday [20 April].    Chiang made the comment after returning to Taiwan from a  three- day visit to Egypt April 17-19. Chiang said he told his  Egyptian hosts that resuming direct Taiwan-Egypt airlinks and  setting up liaison offices in both countries would effectively  strengthen bilateral ties.    During an April 18 meeting with Chiang, the Egyptian  Industrial and Business Federation said it hoped to attract more  Taiwan tourists to the north African country, the minister said.    The federation also accepted Chiang's invitation to take  part  in the Fourth Republic of China [ROC] import fair scheduled to  open in Taipei in October, Chiang said.    Chiang noted that the Egyptian Government is working to  prevent further decline in its large tourism industry by  improving the commercial and investment climate, liberalizing  currency exchange and cutting inflation.    Before visiting Egypt, Chiang attended a General Agreement  on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ministerial meeting in Morocco.</p>

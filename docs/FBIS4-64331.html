			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Eberhard Wisdorff report: "Few Features, But Much </F> Continuity"]    [Text] There are going to be important events with a  bearing on European integration in the coming months. The  fourth direct elections to the European Parliament take place in  the middle of June. Two weeks later, Germany assumes its  six-month presidency of the European Union [EU], which will  reach its climax with a December summit in Essen, after which  France will assume this role. Finally, the European Commission's  mandate expires at the end of the year.    This was sufficient reason for Rudolf Scharping, the SPD's  [Social Democratic Party of Germany] candidate for chancellor,  to follow up his Washington visit with a visit to Brussels and  acquaint himself with the problems of the EU and NATO, as he did  in talks with Delors, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner,  and members of the European Parliament, and during a weekend  visit to Paris. The concept that he revealed to journalists  contains no major features. However, it lays great emphasis on  continuity in the basic paths of foreign and European policy, in  accordance with Federal Republic tradition.    Scharping sounds just like Chancellor Kohl when, on the eve  of the European Parliament elections, he calls for an expansion  of its powers. "The Strasbourg chamber of deputies must play a  greater role in the preparations for the 1996 government  conference as envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty on the subject  of further reforms, and must emerge from this conference in  stronger shape," he said. He described the encouragement of  European integration and relationships with France as one of the  basic principles of German foreign policy. "Problems such as a  lack of economic reforms, unemployment, and the security of  citizens can be better solved together," he said. NATO is  described as a practical element of European security, which is  unimaginable without a substantial U.S. presence in Europe.  Russia's particular role must be taken into consideration  without accepting any kind of hegemony.    The SDP candidate was not ashamed to express his open  respect  for the European political commitment of his adversary Helmut  Kohl. On the other hand, Scharping creates problems for himself  with his remarks about other adversaries. He complained that  the German policy on interest rates has offloaded problems onto  Germany's neighbors. The white paper produced by the Commission  for Growth, Employment, and Competition has been brushed aside  too many times, he says. He accuses the CDU/CSU [Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Socialist Union] of having  nationalistic tendencies, and criticizes the occasional  assertive appearances of Foreign Minister Kinkel on the European  scene.    But Scharping is very careful when speaking out on one of  the  most important issues of the coming years, the expansion of the  EU to include Central and East European countries and the  financial consequences of this. If the occasion so requires, he  uses a tone different from the frequently euphoric expressions  of German Christian Democrats. Scharping talks of "variable  steps" in the spheres of politics, culture, and the economy.  There is no question of handing over money. The fears of  southern EU members must be taken seriously. The European  Agreement signed between the EU and the countries of southern  and East Europe must be extended, according to Scharping. These  countries need a European perspective, but no one knows how  their economies will develop, and that is why no firm date for  their EU membership can be fixed.    As far as this last point is concerned, Scharping is more  realistic than the CDU/CSU, because during weekend election  meetings, CSU politicians once again called for increased  reimbursements from the EU budget to Bonn, and for an eastward  EU expansion at the same time. This provides no answer to the  question of who would finance the drastic costs of regional  development policy and the necessary adaption of agrarian policy  following the EU's expansion.</p>

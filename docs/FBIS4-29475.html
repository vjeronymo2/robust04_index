			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michio Watanabe, chairman of the Watanabe </F> faction in the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, by an  unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The leadership of the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] plans to submit a no-confidence  motion against the Hata cabinet to the Diet. What is your  opinion?    [Watanabe] The LDP leadership will move in that direction.  In  case the House of Representatives is dissolved, the LDP could  not fight in general elections without spending money. I think  that no bank would lend 10 billion yen to the LDP. The LDP is  prepared to fight in the general elections. At the present  stage, I would like to refrain from commenting on the LDP's plan  to submit a no- confidence motion against the Hata cabinet to  the Diet.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] You are advocating plans to forge a  conservative-conservative coalition.    [Watanabe] I intend to talk candidly with any politicians  who  share my political belief about how to run the state and handle  the political situation.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the ruling parties will  propose to the opposition parties to hold talks to discuss how  to form a new coalition government after the 1994 budget is  passed in the Diet?    [Watanabe] There is a possibility of the ruling parties  first  holding talks with the opposition Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ. If Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and  the Democratic Socialist Party believe that they will be able to  break the present political deadlock and carry out their  policies after forging an alliance with the SDPJ, then the SDPJ  would return to the ruling coalition. If those ruling parties  have no intention of forging the alliance with the SDPJ, the  SDPJ will not return to the ruling coalition.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Will the ruling parties approach the LDP  for an alliance if they fail to forge an alliance with the SDPJ?    [Watanabe] Yes, they will approach the LDP. Their approach  may trigger debates in the LDP and stir up the LDP.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of  Shinseito, once said, "I am not sure whether we can reach a  policy consensus with all members of the LDP." What do you think  of his comment?    [Watanabe] If he thinks that the LDP is divided over  policies, no alliance can be forged between the ruling parties  and the LDP. A minority of LDP members share my political  belief. If the LDP is unable to shape its own policy consensus,  it will not be strange if the ruling parties seek an alliance  with some LDP members who share their policies.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] If the Kono leadership rejects an offer  from the ruling parties for policy consultations, how will you  respond to the rejection?    [Watanabe] The LDP should hold intra-party discussion on the  offer.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Mr. Watanabe, will you quit the LDP?    [Watanabe] I will not break away from the LDP so lightly. I  need not leave the LDP.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Speaking on a television talk show, Mr.  Ozawa has said, "If I am asked to apologize for what I have  done, I will apologize." What is your comment?    [Watanabe] I take his statement as an indication of his  eagerness to look for a way to break the current political  deadlock and for a policy consensus after putting aside his  personal feelings.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does the LDP have a blueprint for an  LDP-SDPJ coalition?    [Watanabe] If there is no decision about who will become the  prime minister and what the coalition will do, such a coalition  would immediately collapse.</p>

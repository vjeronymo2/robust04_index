			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> An accused Cuban spy remained in federal custody Friday after U.S. authorities  obtained an order blocking his release, contending that he is a risk to  national security.  </P> <P> Juan Manuel Rodriguez Camejo, who is seeking political asylum in the United  States, was being held without bond at Metropolitan Correctional Center in San  Diego.  </P> <P> Rodriguez, 40, a former Cuban intelligence agent who entered the United States  clandestinely last month from Tijuana, along with his wife and 6-year-old  daughter, says he has reformed and wants to defect to the United States.  </P> <P> Federal authorities have charged that Rodriguez remains a Cuban intelligence  operative and seeks U.S. residence as a cover for his spying activities.  </P> <P> On Thursday, a federal immigration judge ordered Rodriguez freed on $7,500  bond, rejecting the government's allegation that he poses a threat to national  security. But Rodriguez remained imprisoned, as U.S. authorities won a stay of  that order Friday from the Board of Immigration Appeals in Washington.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Rodriguez has requested that U.S. District Judge Lawrence J. Irving  set bail to allow him to be free while his case for political asylum is  adjudicated, a process that could last for more than a year. The judge is  considering the petition.  </P> <P> Rodriguez's wife and daughter are already free from INS detention on $2,000  bonds. They are staying with relatives in Beverly Hills.  </P></p>

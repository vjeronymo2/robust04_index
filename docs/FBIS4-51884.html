			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Central Committee of the General Federation of the Unions of  Literature and Arts of Korea called upon all the literary and  art organizations, patriotic writers and artists in South Korea  and abroad aspiring after national independence and  reunification of the country to make a bold decision to  participate in a national conference and actively lead other  political parties, organizations and individual figures to join  them.    In a statement today the spokesman said the Kim Yong-sam  group's opposition to the proposal of a national conference  initiated by a joint meeting of the DPRK Government, political  parties and public organizations is, in essence, intended to  conceal their flunkeyist, treacherous nature and monopolize  North-South dialogue.    "The South Korean authorities claiming to be 'civilian' have  blocked all dialogues and contacts between political parties,  organizations and individual personages," the spokesman said,  adding: "This clearly shows that they do not want national  reconciliation and unity but seek to prolong their remaining  days as henchmen of outside forces."</p>

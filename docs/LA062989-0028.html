			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> HIGH ENERGY BUT MIXED SIGNALS FROM 24-7 SPYZ  </P> <P> Guitarist Jimi Hazel of the group 24-7 Spyz has declared, "We want to turn the  '90s into the '60s all over again." Judging from the Bronx quartet's slam-happy  mega-dose of thrash 'n' burn at the Roxy on Tuesday night, the punk spirit of  '77 might be a more appropriate target.  </P> <P> But what kind of "cutting-edge" band, from either the hippie or the punk days,  would have spent part of its set endorsing a name-brand tennis shoe? And where  does a band's consciousness lie when it goes from attacking social injustices  and intoning reggae mysticism to using a bit of the funk classic "Brick House"  to frame a rude, sexist limerick? We are talking about some very mixed signals  here.  </P> <P> Musically, the Spyz throw a lot into their churning stew: Jimi Hazel has  obviously spent study hour listening to his Hendrix namesake, but he also  employs some jazzy, augmented chords and goofy, Zappa-esque themes. Even if the  band is fast and heavy enough to open for, say, Metallica, its real  crowd-pleaser is a remake of Kool &amp; the Gang's '70s R&amp;B barnburner  "Jungle Boogie."  </P> <P> Singer Peter Fluid was more agitated than a Maytag, taking his party to the  people at one point by jumping off stage and running through the club as the  band jammed on stage. But take away the advanced musicianship, the bluster and  the high-energy high jinks, and the Spyz's material has more calculated shock  effect than memorable hooks. 24-7 Spyz makes a big noise, but without real  depth or any philisophical consistency behind its "radical" image, it doesn't  have a whole lot of soul.

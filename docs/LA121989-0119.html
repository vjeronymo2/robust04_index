			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SEC CREATES INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS OFFICE  </P> <P> Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden said Monday that  he is creating an International Affairs office to coordinate enforcement  cooperation with foreign stock regulators.  </P> <P> Breeden announced the new office at a news conference where he reported on  cooperative agreements reached last week with securities regulators in France  and the Netherlands.  </P> <P> The new Office of International Affairs will be headed by Michael D. Mann, now  an associate director for international affairs in the SEC's Enforcement  Division.  </P> <P> Breeden said the new office, which will be responsible for negotiating formal  cooperation agreements, known as memoranda of understanding, "underlines the  very high priority the commission places on international cooperation."  </P> <P> Last week Breeden signed cooperation agreements with Dutch and French  securities regulators that will allow the exchange of information to help stamp  out insider trading and other market abuses.  </P> <P> Breeden said the French agreement is contingent upon the passage of legislation  pending before Congress that would allow the SEC to guarantee foreign  authorities that confidential information they supply to U.S. investigators  would be kept confidential in this country.  </P></p>

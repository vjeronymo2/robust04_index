Party Presidents Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Miguel Arraes  met in Brasilia to debate the joint program of government. They  defined their priority: the 70 million people who are being  "ignored" by the Brazilian economy.    "We will work together to design the program and coordinate  the political sectors during the campaign," Lula said. After  this meeting Lula met with Roberto Freire, PPS [Popular  Socialist Party] deputy for Pernambuco, and with Sergio Arouca,  PPS deputy for Rio de Janeiro. At a national party convention  held last Sunday, 12 PPS state boards voted to support the PT in  the presidential elections.    At the meeting with the PSB Arraes raised the issue of the  "ignored" sectors. Lula clarified that the PT draft government  program advocates an economic policy that favors the lower  income sectors. "Yet to support those who are oppressed is not  sufficient. What is needed are concrete projects for solving the  issue," said economist Maria da Conceicao Tavares, who attended  the meeting between Lula and Arraes.    Three PSB names are being considered for vice president on  Lula's ticket: Jose Paulo Bisol, senator for Rio Grande do Sul;  ex-prefect Vilma Maia (Rio Grande do Norte); and Maceio Mayor  Ronaldo Lessa. Lula and Arraes said that their agenda did not  include this topic.    Late in the afternoon, Ronaldo Lessa contacted PT leaders to  arrange a conversation with Lula. Lessa said that the PT has  not made a formal commitment with the PSB because it must still  negotiate with the PPS and the PC do B [Communist Party of  Brazil]. He said the PSB position is "legitimate." "We are the  largest among the allies. I am sure this is the major factor,"  Lessa said. In what is a favorable precedent, Lessa defeated  then President Fernando Collor in the elections for the post of  mayor of Maceio in 1992, in an unprecedented coalition between  the PSB, PT (post of deputy mayor), PDT [Democratic Labor  Party], PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], PPS, and PC do  B.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / World Trade News: BMW sets up assembly offshoot in Mexico BMW said yesterday it had established its own subsidiary to prepare for the assembly of cars in Mexico, starting next year. The German executive carmaker said that the new company, BMW de Mexico, was also to take over from its Mexican importer responsibility for developing and supporting BMW's dealer network in the country. BMW said cars were to be assembled from next year at a rented plant at Toluca, 60km west of Mexico City. Only 'several hundred' 3 -Series will be produced next year. However, the Mexican market is already the second largest in Latin America after Brazil and, following its inclusion in the North American Free Trade Agreement, is regarded by BMW as offering rapid growth potential. A purchasing office is also to be set up by BMW de Mexico to create a network of local component suppliers. The volume of cars BMW will be allowed to produce in Mexico is geared to the percentage of domestically-produced components it can build into the vehicles. The new subsidiary will take over the dealership and distribution functions of its Mexican importer, Grupo Bavaria. However BMW de Mexico is also to establish a separate operating subsidiary to run the assembly facilities, in which Grupo Bavaria is to have a minority stake.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ding Yajun (0002 0068 6511): "First-Quarter Crime </F> Figures Up; Public Security Organs Step up Crackdown"]    [Text] Crime was on the rise across the nation in the  first quarter of this year. Public security organs recorded  approximately 300,000 criminal cases, up 9.2 percent from the  same period last year, and close to 120,000 were serious, up  23.1 percent from the same period last year. The authorities  smashed 28,031 criminal gangs boasting 105,582 members, which  were respectively 9 percent and 7.8 percent higher than the  numbers recorded in the same period last year; the gangs were  responsible for 1.4 billion yuan in property losses, up 42.9  percent over the same period last year.    Robbery remained one of the most serious crimes. There were  a total of 30,316 robberies in the first quarter, up 9.8 percent  over the same period last year; 20,709, or 46.4 percent, were  serious, which was 19.5 percent higher than the figure in the  same period last year. There were 1,694 robberies involving  over 10,000 yuan each, and 290 over 100,000 yuan each, both an  increase over last year.    "Highway and train robberies" were on the rise again in some  localities. Robberies on highways, railways, and other means of  transportation in the first quarter totalled 9,100, almost as  many as in the same period last year. In areas in Guangdong,  Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Jilin, highway and train  robberies occurred earlier than they did last year. There were  52 train robberies in Zhejiang in February, up 73.3 percent from  the same period last year.    In economically advanced areas, there were more kidnappings,  with criminals abducting people for ransom.    Murders and assaults greatly undermined the people's sense  of  security. The first quarter recorded 6,196 murders, up 8.9  percent from the same period last year. Of these murders, those  motivated by personal disagreements and disputes accounted for  the greatest number.    Assaults rose continually, with 12,285 such cases reported  in  the first quarter, up 5.4 percent from the same period last year.    Thefts rose even faster. The first quarter saw 211,473 theft  cases, up 8.8 percent from the same period last year, of which  70,746 were serious, representing a 28.3 percent rise. Car  thefts and safe burglaries accounted for a large percentage of  crime and respectively rose 54.1 percent and 47.6 percent.  Banks and other financial institutions remained prime targets  for criminals. Crimes against financial institutions in the  first quarter numbered 470, 59 more than the figure recorded in  the same period last year. Since early this year there have  been five bank holdups, each of them involving more than 200,000  yuan. The cases were all perpetrated by workers of the banks  and resulted in losses of approximately 7 million yuan.    Serious fraud and forgeries rose considerably, and cigarette  smuggling was on the rise again. There were 7,700 fraud cases  in the first quarter, up 16.3 percent from the same period last  year, of which 4,493 were serious, 31.5 percent higher than the  same period last year. Fraud cases involving 100,000 yuan  numbered 632, up 80 percent. Some criminals defrauded banks  with massive check overdrafts. Some even set up banks  themselves and later absconded with huge amounts of savings in  cash. There were a total of 797 cases of forged money reported,  up 77.1 percent from last year. Public security organs across  the country seized millions of yuan worth of forged money in the  first quarter.    On the whole, smuggling dropped, with 187 cases reported in  the first quarter, down 17.6 percent from the same period last  year. However, following the ban by the State Tobacco Bureau on  imported cigarettes, there have been a spate of extraordinary  foreign- igarette smuggling cases. Wuxi City in Jiangsu,  smashed a 10-strong cigarette-smuggling ring and seized 954  cartons of contraband cigarettes.    Gun and drug trafficking remained serious in the southwest  border regions. Public securities in the region solved a series  of drug cases involving over 10 kg of drugs.    Public security organs across the country are deepening and  extending the struggle against various crimes, are strengthening  investigative efforts, and are working hard to curb the rise of  crime to ensure stability and public order in the spring and  summer.</p>

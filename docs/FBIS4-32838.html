			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] In her first statements to the media minutes after  being elected to the National Directorate [DN] of the FSLN  [Sandinist National Liberation Front], Commander Monica  Baltodano called for editorial changes in BARRICADA.    She thinks that following its Congress the FSLN "has an  opportunity to draft a better program for the 1996 elections.  We now have all the necessary elements for establishing a new  party that will create more democratic possibilities."  Baltodano added, however, that the idea is not to subtract from  but to add to the party.    When asked about the possible removal of certain cadres from  the party, Monica Baltodano admitted that there will be "some  separations, but only of mid-level cadres, not of national  figures."    "Any defeat involves frustrations and negative responses,"  Baltodano noted. She added that the group which until yesterday  was called Current of the Majorities suffered "a political  defeat."    Baltodano rejected any possibility of implementing a policy  of "revenge" against those she termed political losers. "If we  were not vengeful toward the Somozist guardsmen, how can we be  vengeful against companeros in our own ranks?"  <H5>  The Media </H5>   Baltadano said the ambiguous ownership of certain media such  as Radio Ya and Canal Cuatro will be among the topics discussed  at the new Sandinist Assembly.    Reporter William Roiz asked Baltodano whether there will be  changes in BARRICADA. She replied: "Definitely, because most  of the new DN members think BARRICADA's editorial policy should  be changed. We will discuss it in the next few days, but by no  means are we talking about a sweep."    [BARRICADA Director] Carlos Fernando Chamorro was on Canal  Dos' "Good Morning" program yesterday, and a viewer called to  ask about his possible dismissal in view of Baltadano's  statements.    "Is that the democracy of Sandinism you have spoken about?"  the viewer asked.    Chamorro replied that he had not heard Baltodano's  statements  so he could not answer the question. "I refuse to believe this  is true. But if it is, the alleged unity and democracy  proclaimed at the Congress would be a complete farce," he added.    Chamorro admitted, however, that there are profound  differences of opinion about the media. "Some think that  newspapers such as BARRICADA should be para-partisan  [parapartidario] instruments of power subject to the party's  control. I think BARRICADA is a democratic newspaper that has  gained broad credibility in this country and that it must endure  without becoming a propaganda tool again," he added.  <H5>  Doris Tijerino Speaks Out </H5>   Doris Tijerino, who was not elected to the DN despite having  been nominated by nearly all departments, said the Congress  achieved some important things, including electing women to 30  percent of the positions and a high Atlantic Coast  representation.    "Most importantly, for the first time there were currents  with different positions voicing their views. This had never  happened in the FSLN before, but that doesn't mean the unity was  broken," Tijerino said. She added that more needs to be done in  terms of tolerance of political ideas.    As for her exclusion from the DN, Tijerino said the Congress  delegates were not wearing a straitjacket, and although much was  said about respecting the results of consultations with the rank  and file, "the decisions of the Congress are sovereign, and I  respect them."    Contrary to Baltodano's claim that one current dealt a  "political defeat" to another, Tijerino said that "when two  different ideas clash within a party, the goal is to find the  truth, not to defeat each other. Commander Baltodano's  assessment was wrong," Tijerino added.</p>

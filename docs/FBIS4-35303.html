			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nasir 'Arif in Sanaa] </F>   [Text] Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah has  asserted that the criticism by some people of the legitimate  Yemeni Government and their accusations that it is trying,  through war, to impose Yemeni unity by force are null and void  and lack objectivity because unity has been maintained since 22  May 1990, when a document on merging the Yemeni people was  signed.    In an exclusive statement to AL-ASWAQ, the Yemeni foreign  minister added that everyone should realize that the [Yemeni]  Socialist Party [YSP] continues to work, through war, to impose  secession and destroy the Yemeni unity. Thus, it is high time  for all our Arab brothers to realize this fact, and they should  not ignore the presence of a constitutional legitimacy stemming  from the results of the 1993 elections.    Basindwah added: This being the case, no person inside or  outside Yemen is allowed to violate the Yemeni people's will as  expressed through the polls. He ruled out the possibility that  the Yemeni crisis would be discussed during the meetings of the  foreign ministers of the Nonaligned Movement which will be held  in Cairo, unless the discussion of peoples' internal affairs has  become a general right for anyone.    On whether the YSP would succeed in consolidating the  secession of the southern part of Yemen, the Yemeni foreign  minister said this is no longer possible, especially since the  Government forces, in addition to controlling three important  governments in the center of the former southern part of Yemen,  have managed to impose a complete siege on the places housing  the leadership of the YSP secessionists. He added that the  leader of secessionists is now fully aware that his project  cannot be implemented; otherwise, he would not have fled from  Aden to Hadhramaut. If this leader finds himself besieged in  Hadhramaut, he will flee outside the country, he added.    Basindwah ruled out the possibility that the fighting raging  in Yemen will have future negative repercussions on the border  issues in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf for the simple  reason that the fighting can in no way whatsoever turn into a  long-term civil war. With regard to the message that the Yemeni  Government is reportedly awaiting from the south, Basindwah  said: In fact, we are not awaiting any message from the  Socialist Party. However, what should be cautioned about here  is the fact that the unionist elements in this party should show  courage and condemn the secession decision made by 'Ali Salim  al-Bid if they really care for preventing further bloodshed and  destruction in Yemen; otherwise, their silence will be  interpreted as recognition of this secession declaration.    Asked about his expectations regarding the fate of the  Yemeni  crisis, Basindwah said: "The truth is that the legitimate  forces belonging to the Government will succeed in imposing  their control on all Yemeni territory. At that time, the  legitimate leadership will undoubtedly open dialogue with the  unionist forces, whether in the Socialist Party or in other  parties."    Basindwah asserted that the legitimate leadership no longer  needs to storm Aden, knowing that the decision to enter it was  contingent upon the issuance of a political decision. Now,  however, we bet that the citizens of this city will definitely  not allow the secessionists to inflict havoc on them.  Therefore, I expect that all the sons of Aden will soon arrest  the leader of secessionists and his clique, Basindwah said.    [In a similar interview published on pages 1 and 20 of Amman  SAWT AL-SHA'B in Arabic on 29 May, Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Basindwah states that he is carrying a message from  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to Egyptian President  Husni Mubarak. The message, he adds, deals with recent Yemeni  developments. Basindwah categorically denies that his visit to  Cairo is aimed at meeting with certain YSP leaders there.]</p>

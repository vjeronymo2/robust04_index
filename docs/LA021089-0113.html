			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HORSE RACING / BILL CHRISTINE;  </P> <P> THIRD IN JUVENILE IS LUCKY SPOT FOR DERBY  </P> <P> Horses that finish third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile have a better record in  the Kentucky Derby than horses that have won the $1-million fall race for  2-year-olds.  </P> <P> In 1984, when the inaugural Breeders' Cup was run at Hollywood Park, Spend a  Buck was supplemented into the Juvenile for $120,000. His owner, Dennis Diaz,  fell $12,000 short of breaking even when Spend a Buck ran third. But the next  May, the colt won the Kentucky Derby.  </P> <P> Alysheba, the Derby winner in 1987, ran third in the Breeders' Cup the previous  year. The winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile has never won the Derby.  </P> <P> Last November at Churchill Downs, Tagel, a French-raced 2-year-old, ran third  in the Juvenile, finishing 9 1/4 lengths behind the winner, Is It True, and  trailing Easy Goer, the runner-up and 3-10 favorite, by eight lengths.  </P> <P> Francois Boutin, the French trainer who has Tagel, was at Santa Anita last  weekend and said that the 3-year-old son of Cox's Ridge is being prepared for  the Kentucky Derby on May 6.  </P> <P> Tagel, bought at a Kentucky yearling sale for $725,000 by Allen Paulson, was  sent back to France after the Breeders' Cup. Boutin said that Tagel will run  only one race there -- either in late March or early April -- and return to  Churchill Downs the week of the Derby.  </P> <P> Although he seemed to be overmatched by Is It True and Easy Goer, Tagel  actually ran an exceptional race in the Breeders' Cup. It was his first race on  dirt, the first time he has run counter-clockwise, and he went into the race  with a sore mouth. Tagel was undefeated before the Breeders' Cup, having won  twice on the grass at Longchamp.  </P> <P> Bold Arrangement, an import from England, ran second to Ferdinand in the 1986  Derby. The week before the Derby, Bold Arrangement finished third at Keeneland  in the Blue Grass, his first American start. Canonero II won the 1971 Derby  coming off prep races in Venezuela, after running a couple of times as a  2-year-old at Del Mar.  </P> <P> Noel (Spec) Richardson, the last remaining principal from the controversial  match race between Seabiscuit and Ligaroti at Del Mar in 1938, died last week  at 75.  </P> <P> Richardson rode Ligaroti, who was nosed out by Seabiscuit in a $25,000  winner-take-all race. Ligaroti was owned by singer Bing Crosby and his son,  Lin.  </P> <P> Richardson and George Woolf, Seabiscuit's jockey, were locked in physical  combat through the stretch. In a 1983 interview, Richardson said that if there  had been head-on camera angles, as there are now, the stewards would have  disqualified Seabiscuit and Woolf.  </P> <P> Bill Mills of Murrieta Hot Springs was an assistant starter who handled  Seabiscuit in the gate that day.  </P> <P> "The gate was pulled into the infield after the start, and that's where the  assistant starters were until the horses passed the eighth pole," Mills said.  </P> <P> "At that point, I stepped out onto the track to see the finish from behind.  What I saw does not agree with what Spec Richardson remembers.  </P> <P> "Just past the eighth pole, when Seabiscuit started to move ahead of Ligaroti,  Spec reached over and took hold of Seabiscuit's saddle cloth, pulling him back.  As the two horses neared the finish line, apparently Woolf realized what was  happening and reached out and took hold of Ligaroti's bridle rein."  </P> <P> Peg Grueneberg's unusual picture of jockey Nate Hubbard clutching his horse's  neck after he was jolted from the saddle at Golden Gate Fields last week is  similar to a prize-winning shot taken at River Downs near Cincinnati in 1981.  </P> <P> In the River Downs shot, the horse went down on a sloppy track and was sliding  across the finish line with jockey Bernie Sayler still aboard. Tom Baker, the  photographer, received an Eclipse Award at a dinner in Miami Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> A few weeks before the dinner, Sayler called the Eclipse organizers, asking if  they were going to pay his way to Florida.  </P> <P> "Without me, there wouldn't have been a picture," Sayler said.  </P> <P> He had a point, but he still didn't get a free trip to the dinner.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Chris McCarron, who rode his first winner at Bowie in Maryland 15 years ago  Thursday, is eligible for the first time to be voted into racing's Hall of Fame  in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. McCarron won a record 546 races in 1974 and has about  4,500 lifetime. Another jockey who may be new to the Hall of Fame ballot this  year is Eddie Delahoussaye. Sandy Hawley was on the ballot last year, but Angel  Cordero was the only jockey who polled enough votes.  </P> <P> Cutlass Reality, who hasn't run since the Breeders' Cup, has been assigned 124  pounds for Sunday's $250,000 San Antonio Handicap at Santa Anita. Other  probable starters are Super Diamond, 121 pounds; Cherokee Colony, 120; Payant,  118; Stalwars, 115; and Stylish Winner, 112.  </P> <P> A 2-year-old doesn't win world-champion quarter horse honors very often, but in  a close vote, Merganser won the horse-of-the-year title for 1988. Merganser won  three major races, including the $2.5-million All American Futurity. . . .  Sunshine Forever, champion male turf horse in 1988, makes his debut as a  4-year-old on Saturday in the Canadian Turf Championship at Gulfstream Park.  </P> <P> If Dixieland Brass goes on to win the Kentucky Derby, his trainer, Charlie  Peoples, will be called a genius because he added blinkers back in September.  Dixieland Brass has won four of five starts since the equipment change. . . .  It wasn't well known that Easy Goer suffered sore shins after his second-place  finish in the Breeders' Cup, but the winter-book Kentucky Derby favorite is  training splendidly in Florida.  </P> <P> The site for the 1990 Breeders' Cup is expected to be announced on Kentucky  Derby day -- May 6 -- at Churchill Downs. Some Breeders' Cup directors are  uncomfortable with a return to the West Coast -- because Hollywood Park had  operational glitches when the races were held there in 1987 and because of the  recent criticism of Santa Anita's grass course. The favorites for 1990 are  Churchill Downs and Belmont Park. This year's races will be held at Florida's  Gulfstream Park on Nov. 4.  </P></p>

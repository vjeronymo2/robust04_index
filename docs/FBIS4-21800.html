			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [See Selected Video Reports section for accompanying footage] </F>   [Excerpt] [Announcer Aleksandr Sapozhnikov] [passage  omitted on details of crash] Several different versions of what  happened to the plane have already emerged. According to Yuriy  Korenevskiy, deputy head of the air transport department of  Russia's Transport Ministry, the plane's abrupt fall and crash  could only have been caused by instantaneous decompression of  the interior, caused by an explosion aboard the aircraft or  collision with another object. However, Korenevskiy said that  the professionalism and training of the A-310 crew is not in any  doubt.    Yuriy Vorobyev, first deputy minister for emergencies, said  literally the following: The plane crash in Siberia happened  suddenly. The crew did not transmit an SOS. So, the  possibility of an act of terrorism cannot be ruled out.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Allied Lyons' Pounds 200m bond issue launched ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, yesterday launched its Pounds 200m convertible bonds issue. News of this was leaked last weekend and led to three days of see-sawing share prices. The company said yesterday that its financial advisers were discussing the leakage with the stock exchange and decisions about possible action would be made after the talks. 'We are very concerned about the leakage, which certainly was not in our interests,' Allied said. The timing of the convertible issue, which came a day after the group reported a Pounds 10m increase in full year profits to Pounds 620m, had not been affected by the leakage, it added. Allied said the proceeds of the issue would be used for 'general corporate purposes.' Some will replace short - term bank borrowings used to finance its free - trade pubs' loan book. None of the cash is intended for acquisitions, such as the purchase for an estimated Pounds 40m from Seagram of Perrier - Jouet/Barton &amp; Guestier, the French distribution company. Allied repeated its long-standing pledge yesterday to launch a rights issue only to fund a major acquisition. The 15-year bonds will be converted into Allied ordinary shares at a premium between 17 per cent and 20 per cent above the company's share price. A coupon of 6 3/4 per cent will be paid twice a year. Credit Suisse First Boston is leading the issue and Cazenove and SG Warburg Securities will be co-lead managers. There will also be a group of international co-managers.

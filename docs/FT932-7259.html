			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / People: Golden days at Vauxhall as appointment raises status Charles Golden, treasurer of General Motors since 1989, will bring an enhanced status to Vauxhall, the group's UK subsidiary, when he takes over as chairman and managing director on June 1. Golden was appointed a vice-president of GM, the world's largest vehicle maker, in November last year. He will be the first GM vice-president to head Vauxhall for a decade. After many years of losses, Vauxhall turned the corner in the latter 1980s and last year achieved a record operating profit, despite the recession in the UK new vehicle market. Vauxhall has become one of GM's main profit centres, giving it an added status in a corporation that has been suffering record losses in North America. The UK has also been attracting GM investment and is becoming an important source for components purchasing for GM's operations in continental Europe. As GM treasurer in New York, Golden, 46, appears to have been on the fast track at GM. Of the five key executives at the top of GM today, four are graduates of the treasurer's office, including Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, based in Zurich. As executive vice-president responsible for all of GM's international operations, Hughes is now Golden's immediate boss. Golden began his General Motors career in 1970 in the treasurer's office where his responsibilities included overseas financial analysis. He later had various financial assignments there, at GM's headquarters in Detroit, as well as at the former GM assembly and Fisher body divisions, before returning to New York as assistant treasurer in 1984. With the Vauxhall appointment, Golden is being given his first operational experience overseas, usually a precursor to bigger things at GM.</p>

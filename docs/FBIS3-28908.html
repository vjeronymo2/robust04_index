"There is always room for mutual concessions," Hata told  reporters as he showed up at Kantor's office for the meeting,  their third round of talks since Thursday morning.    Hata returned to face the top U.S. trade negotiator after a  round of consultations with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa,  who arrived in Washington Thursday evening for the summit  meeting with President Bill Clinton    Negotiators from the two countries have been trying to work  out an accord by the time the two leaders sit down for talks at  11:30 A.M. Friday (1:30 A.M. Saturday Japan time.)    Prospects of a mutually acceptable accord looked elusive  throughout Thursday as both countries seemed to harden their  positions over the so-called "objective criteria" for measuring  progress in sales of foreign goods and services in Japan.    "It is difficult" Japan's Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro  Matsuura told reporters after emerging from the second round of  talks between Hata and Kantor Thursday evening.    U.S. Officials agreed.    "I'm sorry to say it doesn't look like we're doing real  well," U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown told reporters after a  dinner speech. "I'm not encouraged."    Japanese officials said the United States insists on working  out "objective criteria" -- some kind of measurable goals -- to  gauge Japan's progress in opening its markets for foreign goods.    "Without objective criteria, we can't have a good  agreement,"  U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was quoted as saying in a  separate meeting with Hata Thursday evening.    Senior Clinton administration officials have warned that  Clinton has made it clear he would rather have no agreement than  "a bad agreement" reached by papering over differences.    In between negotiations with Kantor, Hata also took up  Japan's case -- Tokyo's commitment to open up its markets and  deregulate its economy -- in separate meetings with Vice  President Al Gore and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    Hata even took time out from a frenzied schedule for an  informal dinner meeting with U.S. lawmakers to sound out the  mood at Capitol Hill, which has increasingly called for a  get-tough U.S. trade policy with Japan.    There was no crack in the responses Hata heard from his U.S.  hosts.    Japanese officials said Gore reiterated the Clinton  administration's position that "objective criteria" are  essential for measuring trade results.    The controversy stems from an agreement reached between  Tokyo  and Washington last July that provides for the use of "objective  criteria, either qualitative or quantitative," to determine  whether foreign companies had made headway in penetrating the  Japanese market.    U.S. officials have argued for a "results-oriented" trade  policy with Japan as past trade agreements have failed to dent  Japan's global trade surplus, which totaled 130 billion dollars  last year, almost half of it with the United States.    Christopher, talking to reporters before his meeting with  Hata, emphasized that Washington is determined to change the  situation.    "The United States is determined that we will redress the  great imbalance in our trade. We will seek in a determined way  access for American business in the Japanese market,"  Christopher said in a photo-taking session prior to his meeting  with Hata.    The sharp dispute over "objective criteria" was not the only  problem Hata faced in his encounters with key members of the  Clinton administration Thursday.    Washington also launched a barrage of criticism against the  15 trillion yen tax cut and government spending plan Tokyo  announced earlier this week, saying it will be ineffective for  stimulating the ailing Japanese economy.    Japanese officials said Hata heard the U.S. displeasure in  talks with both Bentsen and Gore.    Christopher openly criticized the Japanese economic plan in  the photo-session with Hata, saying the U.S. is "disappointed"  with the program.    Along with opening markets, Tokyo also pledged last July to  take macroeconomic measures to stimulate the Japanese economy as  part of Japan's efforts to reduce its global trade surplus by  boosting demand for imports.    The shape of the Japanese economy is expected to be high on  the agenda at the Friday meeting between Hosokawa and Clinton.</p>

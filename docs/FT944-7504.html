			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Government to set standards for cleaning contaminated land The government is set to announce proposals for dealing with contaminated land that are expected to cut the cost to industry of cleaning up polluted sites. Under the plans, to be announced soon, polluted sites will only need to be cleaned to a standard suitable for their intended use and not restored to their original, unspoilt state. For example, land intended for use as a car park would not need to be cleaned to the same standard as a site on which a school is to be built. By setting such a standard, government hopes business will avoid the huge clean-up costs encountered in countries, such as the US, which have taken a tougher stance on industrial pollution. Legislation is expected to follow principles laid down in a consultation paper issued in March. It drew fierce criticism from environmental groups but a cautious welcome from business. Local authorities will be instructed to keep a record of all significantly polluted sites in their area. But registration will be based on actual rather than potential contamination. Last year the government dropped controversial plans for public registers of potentially contaminated sites, based on the past uses of the land. Landowners and property developers argued such registers would have blighted formerly industrialised regions and pushed development on to green field sites. In March, the government said that in some circumstances banks should be liable for pollution caused by companies to which they made loans. However, it is thought to have softened its line after banks argued that lender liability could discourage investment in industry. Legislation on contaminated land will be included in the environment and countryside bill. Getting the dirt, Page 9</p>

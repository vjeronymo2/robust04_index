			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (11): An aid to teamwork for PC-users - The price of groupware has put off many companies, but increasing competition will bring the cost down / Groupware THERE was a time when companies avoided making any significant investment in a new technology until IBM entered the market to 'legitimise' it. Today, nobody waits for IBM anymore and this is particularly evident in the workgroup computing/groupware market. This is not to say that IBM does not have groupware products, because the company announced a number of product enhancements in the groupware area, earlier this month. However, IBM is unlikely to emerge as market leader in groupware as it has done in the past with products like the PC. Groupware is a software environment that aims to make teams of PC-users work together more efficiently. It updates colleagues on new developments, and is similar to a central 'hold' for information, where files, diaries, memos and other office documents are stored, easily amended and accessible to anyone. With groupware, work is not held up because someone else has the file, or has forgotten to add new information. Lotus was first to enter the groupware market with its Notes package, but initial take-up of the technology was relatively slow because it involved large-scale investment and required an IBM OS/2-based server system. Although Lotus makes most of the running in the market, there are numerous disparate products which, it could be argued, already fall into the groupware category. Apart from Lotus and Microsoft, two other leading PC software vendors - WordPerfect and Borland - have jointly announced groupware products, although the forthcoming WordPerfect Office 4 looks set to compete independently. ESP is another company specifically targeting the groupware market with a range of third party software products. Most products centre on a mail engine. Novell, for example, is talking about workgroup computing in terms of its global messaging service. A 'mail engine' is essential for people to work effectively in teams together. Alan Harris, associate partner at Andersen Consulting believes there is still room for an outsider to come into the groupware market and then play a dominant role by establishing the rules of play. 'It is going to be somebody who comes up with a framework to understand how groups can interact,' he says. 'The biggest gap is in the lack of a telecoms infrastructure. If you really want to get groups working together, they have to be free to do it from wherever they are. At the moment, there are too many compromises made because of the lack of a telecoms capability. 'You cannot really participate if you are on the move,' he says. Most applications are designed to provide good performance in a local area networks (LAN) but do not work well on anything slower - 'groupware is an application idea that is waiting for the data highway to come along.' For businesses to succeed with the new way of working with groupware, they need to be able to create groups across dispersed geographical locations throughout the enterprise. Alan Harris believes that telecommunications suppliers will emerge as contenders by teaming up with software vendors. PA Consulting recently completed a survey on groupware and information sharing. John Kay, director of management and professional systems at PA Consulting, says: 'We were concerned that although groupware has been much touted, the chasm between IT and the business is not narrowing.' THE survey sample consisted of around 100 senior managers in IT, finance/accounting and marketing in large private sector companies. Eighty per cent acknowledged the importance of information sharing, while 65 per cent did not like the way IT presented its solutions to the business. Eighty-six per cent did not think the time was right to act on information sharing and groupware. Some responses included comments like: 'Groupware is a fad,' and 'I'm not interested in groupware - I always get my IT people to deal with it.' Only 13 per cent thought they were getting any benefit from what they had done in the groupware area. 'Groupware is another packaging of technology concepts which have been around for a long time,' John Kay adds. Business managers do not naturally think of IT as a solution to their work problems at the tactical level, he says - 'there is no doubt that they all have an IT strategy and know how important it is to link it to the business, but when sales or marketing managers run into problems, they do not naturally turn to groupware for a solution.' The price of groupware also puts many companies off, although increasing competition will bring the cost down. Lotus Notes Version 2 had 'a hefty price tag,' comments Niels Jaeckel, manager of the desktop consulting group at Hoskyns. 'Version 3, which has now been released in part, will be cheaper. One of Notes's problems in the past is that it required OS/2, whereas the majority of sites have Microsoft Windows,' he says. Lotus has only recently released a Version 3 Windows development server product, he adds, 'but it not entirely suitable for services because Windows is not a pre-emptive multi-tasking environment like OS/2. 'What that means is that it does not switch from one task to the other mechanically but through something called co-operative multi-tasking, which means that the application has to release control to the operating system.' A pre-emptive environment means that the server gets a specific amount of time to do its job. Under Windows, if anything else is running, then the server may not get its fair share of work, and performance will suffer. However, the forthcoming release of Windows NT will probably solve that problem as it uses a pre-emptive approach to sharing out processing time. According to Niels Jaeckel, Microsoft has a more powerful set of language tools in its groupware products than Lotus which uses a macro scripting language in Notes. He comments: 'The edge that Microsoft has is that those language tools will be embedded into Windows 4.0, the next release of Windows for PC clients, which is also a 32-bit pre-emptive multi-tasking operating system.' The transition to Windows NT server will be very clear, he believes, 'unlike the transition from Release 3 to Release 4 of Novell Netware which has totally confused users, or from Lotus Notes 2 to Notes 3 where substantial changes were made.'</p>

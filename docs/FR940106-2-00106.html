			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Wyle Laboratories states that it will implement control procedures for identifying products which have been certified. It will maintain a controlled and secure file for each product tested. This file will contain the technical and business records of the test program, including the services agreement, test results, correspondence, transmittals, the Factory Inspection Reports, and the product documentation. (See Exhibit 2.A.(1), Section 7). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant further states that products bearing the Wyle label will be considered evaluated, certified, and listed by Wyle. It will certify that these products are in compliance with the applicable safety standards to which they were tested. Wyle will thereafter have unannounced and unrestricted access to conduct inspections at approximately three-month intervals at manufacturing and other facilities where products certified by them may be fabricated, processed, or stored. Wyle will conduct field inspections to monitor and assure proper use of its certification label after the products are delivered to the end user. (See Exhibit 2.A(1), Sections 5 and 9, and Exhibit 2.A.(2), Appendix XI). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WL states that its Product Safety Certification activities are performed completely independent of its clients. No Wyle clients have ownership positions in Wyle or have any sort of influence on WL's activities. No WL employees are under the influence or control of manufacturers or suppliers. (See Exhibits 2.A; 2.A.(1), Section 3; and Exhibits 2.A.(2), Appendix I). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant appears to maintain effective procedures for producing creditable findings or reports that are objective and without bias.

The Appeals Procedure is available for any interested party, including users. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All other pertinent aspects of Wyle Laboratories' program are detailed in Exhibited 2.A and 3.A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The applicant states that Wyle Laboratories was founded in 1949 in El Segundo, California, as an independent test laboratory to support the nation's fledgling aerospace industry. As manned spaceflight became a national priority and support of spaceflight development was required, Wyle expanded to a new location in Norco, California, which was dedicated in 1959. To complement the propellent and vibration testing capabilities of the California locations, Wyle states that it created the Huntsville facility in 1962 to support the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the establishment of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama, with testing, engineering, and research capabilities. Of the three major operations at the Huntsville facility, the one of interest to the NRTL Accreditation program is the Test Operations Division, which includes the Product Safety Department. The Product Safety Testing and Certification Division of the Test Operations Division is responsible for the testing, certification, and factory follow-up inspections of the products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applicant states that over its 42 year history, Wyle Laboratories_Scientific &amp; Systems (3S) Group has expended and diversified into various business disciplines. At the same time, the applicant states that the Company has continuously maintained its independent laboratory status as a major provider of conformity assessment services to North America's most quality-conscious industries. Wyle's focus continues to be on the science of evaluation, test and measurement engineering, as well as the business of regulatory compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wyle Laboratories desires recognition for testing and certification of products when tested for compliance with the following test standards: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 --> ANSI/UL 153_Portable Electric Lamps <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 187_X-Ray Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 465_Central Cooling Air Conditioners <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 484_Room Air Conditioners <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 489_Molded-Case Circuit Breakers and Circuit-Breaker Enclosures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 499_Electric Heating Appliances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 506_Specialty Transformers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 508_Electric Industrial Control Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UL 544_Electric Medical and Dental Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1012_Power Supplies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1025_Electric Air Heaters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1069_Hospital Signaling and Nursing Call Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1087_Molded-Case Switches <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1236_Electric Battery Chargers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UL 1244_Electrical and Electronic Measuring and Testing Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1262_Laboratory Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1310_Direct Plug-In Transformer Units <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1411_Transformers and Motor Transformer for Use in  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> &blank;&blank;Audio-, Radio-, and Television-Type Appliances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1459_Telephone Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1570_Fluorescent Lighting Fixtures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1571_Incandescent Lighting Fixtures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1585_Class 2 and Class 3 Transformers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1778_Uninterruptible Power Supply <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UL 1863_Communication Circuit Accessories <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANSI/UL 1950_Information Technology Equipment Including Electrical Business Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Barings bucks the trend with 54% first-half rise: 'We chose the right things to do and avoided the wrong things' Barings yesterday bucked the trend among UK merchant banks by reporting a 54 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 35.5m to Pounds 54.8m in the half year to June 30. The advance contrasted with lower first-half profits reported last week by SG Warburg and signalled by Hambros. Mr Peter Baring, group chairman, said: 'This is a very satisfactory result in much more difficult market conditions than those of 1993.' He added: 'I'm conscious that we have had a very good 18-month period and, life being what it is, you can't maintain that.' However, one analyst described the results as 'the best of the sector from any company of any size'. The first-half performance puts Barings in a strong position to exceed the Pounds 100.1m full-year profit before tax it achieved in 1993. Barings reported a strong performance in corporate finance, lifted by the role advising Lloyds Bank on its proposed acquisition of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society. Income from fees and commissions rose 47 per cent to Pounds 238.8m. Barings, like Warburg and Hambros, described market conditions as 'turbulent' but said its money market and fixed income businesses had 'coped well'. Net dealing income, which fell at other banks, grew 16 per cent to Pounds 63.6m. The company suffered relatively little because its main securities broking business is in Asia rather than North America and western Europe. Mr Andrew Tuckey, chairman of Baring Brothers, the merchant bank subsidiary, said a third of employees were based in Asia and the region provided a similar proportion of profits. Mr Tuckey described Barings' involvement in bonds, where the market has fallen sharply since the start of the year, as 'specialised and modest'. Dillon Read, the US investment bank of which the group owns 40 per cent, produced lower profits in the first half but Barings noted that the performance was significantly better than many of its counterparts on Wall Street. A rival UK banker said the contrast between Barings' results and those of Warburg and Hambros owed much to 'a different mix of businesses'. Mr Baring said Barings had avoided markets where losses were made recently and those in mature economies where competition between market makers was tough. 'I think we chose the right things to do and avoided the wrong things,' he said. Lex, Page 26</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Critchley debut with Pounds 25.4m tag CRITCHLEY, the maker of electrical cable accessories, will begin trading next Thursday with a market capitalisation of Pounds 25.4m. SG Warburg Securities, the company's adviser, said yesterday it had placed 6.7m shares at 220p with a number of institutions and with some brokers for private clients. The issue will raise Pounds 14.7m and leave Critchley with net cash of about Pounds 3m. The pricing puts the group on a substantial discount to Bowthorpe and Volex, companies with which it is sometimes compared with. Critchley will come to the market at 14.4 times historic earnings, while on prospective earnings of 18p per share. The shares will start with a multiple of 12.3. This is based on forecasts of Pounds 2.8m pre-tax profits for the year. The dividend yield, based on a notional net dividend, is 3.7 per cent.</p>

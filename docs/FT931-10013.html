			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / UK Results Season: Captains wary of another false dawn - Pessimists fear companies may cut the pay-outs they have struggled to maintain THE STOCK MARKET could face a testing time as companies report results over the next few weeks, or it could be about to see the turning point from recession to recovery. Optimists hope that when company chairmen publish profit figures for 1992 - which in aggregate will be poor - they will signal a brighter outlook for 1993. Pessimists are more concerned that some companies will cut dividends they have struggled to maintain through the longest recession since the 1930s. There is broad agreement that industrial companies' profits in aggregate will have shown no growth, or even a slight decline, in 1992. Profits fell 6 per cent in 1991. The market's concern will be what the results say about the outlook for the current year. Analysts will use the results to rework their profit forecasts for the coming year, setting the tone for the stock market. Chairmen's statements and companies' dividend decisions will be studied carefully for hints that the famous green shoots are at last starting to appear or that captains of industry see no recovery on the horizon. And chairmen may be nervous about being over-optimistic having witnessed false dawns before. Estimates for current year profits growth vary widely, not only between stockbroking firms, but also between strategists, who take a 'top-down' approach, and the 'bottom-up' aggregation of analysts' forecasts. In most cases, the analysts' number is higher than the strategists', even the more bearish of whom look for double-digit percentage profits growth from industrial companies in 1993. Even without much help from the economy, cost-cutting, lower interest rates and the benefit of the fall in the pound, if only on translation of overseas profits, should be sufficient to boost profits by 10 per cent or more. Mr Mark Brown, chief UK strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, is forecasting a 12 per cent rise in industrial profits, while his analysts are going for 21 per cent. He says the gap is not unusual at this stage, but worrying since he feels if his forecast is right analysts will bring down their estimates over the next few weeks which could hit the market. Mr Brown is concerned that an economic recovery will be slow, particularly as many companies are still trying to cut stock levels, and says that 'one company's reduction in stocks is another's cut in output'. The most optimistic strategists, such as Nomura Research Institute, have a forecast of 30 per cent for industrial earnings growth in 1993. Although admitting some of this may be deferred to 1994, Nomura's analysts are closer to other firms' forecasts with 22 per cent growth predicted. Nomura believes that analysts lag behind strategists at turning points. While most market commentators expect 1992 dividends to be little changed in total, there could be surprises from individual companies. Many are leaving the decision until the last moment so that the dividend can reflect the up-to-the-minute trading situation. One such is Pilkington, the glass company, which has a March year-end and reports in June. It cut its final dividend last year, but maintained its interim in December paying it from reserves, saying it would decide on the total payment for the year in June. If positive signs of recovery appear by then, investors hope Pilkington will decide not to cut again. Dividend increases in 1993, forecast at about 3 or 4 per cent across the market, are expected to lag behind earnings growth as companies attempt to rebuild cover. Although the hope that the UK has become a low-inflation economy means dividend cover need not be as high as it was in, say, the 1970s, companies and investors generally still feel uncomfortable if cover is below 2. An additional problem for companies with surplus advance corporation tax, is that a dividend increase adds to the tax charge, thus reducing cover more severely. Many companies will be keen to retain earnings to help finance extra working capital which they will need when recovery comes. Mr Brown said dividend cuts were still made after the last recovery had started.</p>

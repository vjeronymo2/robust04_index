			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Paper Bomb at Spanish Embassy"] </F>   [Text] Rome, 3 Feb (ANSA) -- A paper bomb exploded under a  diplomatic car outside the Spanish embassy in Rome at around 10  o'clock [0900 GMT] this morning, injuring the driver in the  buttocks. The driver was taken to hospital as police and  firemen rushed to the scene.    The driver was later identified as an Italian employee of  the  embassy, Marco Formichella, 34, suffering from cuts and bruises  after a blast that made a small hole in the road surface and  split open the side of the car.    The bomb is believed to have been a rudimentary device,  little more than a cardboard box packed with nitrate-based  explosive, with an electrical detonator (proved by the discovery  of six small batteries under the car).    Investigators are trying to establish whether it was set off  by a timer, or was attached to the car ignition -- a thesis  indicated by the fact that it went off as the driver turned the  key.</p>

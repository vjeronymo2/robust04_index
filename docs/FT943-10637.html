			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Spain trims benchmark rate The Bank of Spain yesterday trimmed its benchmark intervention rate to 7.35 per cent from 7.50 per cent, its first cut since May 13. The markets expect a further cut in September if the July CPI figures, due in the middle of this month, show that inflation is continuing its downward trend. The Bank has room to manoeuvre because the peseta remains stable, underlying inflation is at an historic low of 4.4 per cent year-on-year, domestic demand remains flat and most wage increases have kept to around 3 per cent. The research department of Banco Central Hispano (BCH) estimates that GDP has grown by 2.5 per cent in the first five months of this year and that it will show 2 per cent growth overall in 1994. The forecast compares with the government's estimate of 1.3 per cent. BCH expects year-end short-term rates to stand at around 7 per cent in December. Economy minister Pedro Solbes said yesterday that Spain's budget deficit fell by 22.8 per cent during the first seven months of this year compared to the same 1993 period. 'The total deficit (to July 31) is 1.378 trillion pesetas compared to 1.782 trillion pesetas in the same period last year.' he said. The number of corporate bankruptcies in west Germany rose 21 per cent to 6,000 in the first five months of the year, the federal statistics office has said. A further 1,438 companies collapsed in the east.</p>

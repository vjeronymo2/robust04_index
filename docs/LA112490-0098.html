			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE DEPT. ALLOWS EMBASSY FAMILIES TO LEAVE SUDAN  </P> <P> In the wake of large anti-U.S. and pro-Iraqi demonstrations in Sudan, the State  Department on Friday authorized embassy dependents to leave the country and  warned American private citizens to leave.  </P> <P> The revolutionary military government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir has  sided with Iraq in the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Well-managed demonstrations have been reported in cities including the capital,  Khartoum.  </P> <P> In addition, the State Department said there is reason to believe there is a  high potential for anti-American terrorist attacks in Khartoum.  </P> <P> Government sources said this week that there is evidence that Iraqi-backed  terrorists have been casing American installations in Khartoum in preparation  for a possible wave of actions against U.S. diplomats and citizens if  hostilities should break out in the gulf.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the country, continuing drought and famine, compounded by civil  war, have made the western and southern Sudan unsafe for travel.  </P> <P> The United States is a principal supplier of food aid to Sudan, despite the  difficulty of delivering supplies to refugee centers, where an estimated 3  million to 4 million people are at risk of starvation.  </P></p>

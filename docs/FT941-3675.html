			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: EuroLeisure in loss and finance package agreed European Leisure, the debt-laden snooker hall and discotheque operator, said yesterday it had completed a financial restructuring to reduce gearing from 227 per cent to 101 per cent. It also reported a loss of Pounds 344,000 pre-tax for the half year to end-December compared with previous profits of Pounds 54,000. The group blamed the turnround on Maygay, its fruit machines division which struggled to break even during the period - it made profits of Pounds 1.5m in the previous half year. Group turnover fell from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 30.1m and losses per share came out at 0.89p (0.65p). In the restructuring European Leisure has reached agreement with a syndicate of eight banks, led by the TSB, Barclays and Bank of Scotland, to convert Pounds 20m of debt into equity and roll anticipated annual interest of Pounds 1m into loan notes over the next three years. Mr Ian Rock, chief executive, said the company had been forced into the restructuring by a cycle of over-priced acquisitions, significant trading losses in France and Spain and high interest rates in the early 1990s.</p>

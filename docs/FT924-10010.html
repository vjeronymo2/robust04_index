			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Dilemma at the pits as payout time ticks away: Miners are taking sides over whether to apply for redundancy MINERS at the 10 pits where British Coal has given 90-day statutory notice of closure face a dilemma. Should they take redundancy now, thereby improving their chances of getting a new job before their pit is formally closed, or hope to strengthen the union campaign against closure by staying put? Neither choice in itself guarantees a stable future, but already miners are taking sides. Of the 7,350 employed at the 10 pits, more than 1,000 have applied for voluntary redundancy. The majority, encouraged by the wave of popular support, have closed ranks behind their union officials, pledging to dig in above ground if not below. Many miners at the 10 remain fearful that by opting to stay put on basic pay for 90 days, pending a final decision, they might diminish their redundancy pay, as pay-offs are partly based on their last 12 weeks' wages including overtime and bonuses. British Coal has assured miners that redundancy pay will be based on the last 12 weeks of full work, whenever closure comes, but many remain unconvinced. 'You can't trust anything Heseltine says, nor any of them,' said power loader Mr Terry Greener as he left Vane Tempest colliery in County Durham after the last coal-producing shift on Friday. The National Union of Mineworkers fears that a surge in the numbers of miners already volunteering to leave the pits may jeopardise the chance of a reprieve for any of the 10 and is seeking written confirmation of the redundancy assurance. 'We're facing a flight of men from the colliery,' said Mr Tony Mitchell, NUM assistant secretary at Vane Tempest. What is the financial outlook for miners who take redundancy either now or later if, after the 90-day review, their pit is closed? Redundancy pay accounts for about three quarters of the original Pounds 1bn earmarked to cushion the closure blow, but the sums available are far less generous than those available until March 1987, when the maximum pay-out was about Pounds 80,000. Under the present programme, total redundancy payments (made up of statutory minimum redundancy and British Coal redundancy) range from Pounds 3,760 (19-year-old miner with three years of service and average weekly earnings of Pounds 140) to Pounds 37,000 (57-year-old miner with 41 years of service and average weekly earnings of Pounds 300). British Coal says that while the maximum amount payable to employees is Pounds 37,000, the average pay-out will be nearer Pounds 28,000. That is because the older mineworkers have long since left the industry, leaving an industry with an average age profile of 36 to 37 years. British Coal refuses to make available detailed figures on the number of miners that will fall into specific categories within the programme. The NUM argues that in practice the programme will disadvantage many young miners, who will be paid much less that the average that British Coal claims. If the miners were to go on strike, they might lose their lump sum supplements and the British Coal redundancy payment (the bulk of the package), although they would still be entitled to a minimum statutory redundancy. The NUM believes it would be most unusual to withdraw redundancy pay in such circumstances and that it might be able to challenge it in the courts. Minimum statutory payments are as follows: age 18 to 21 years, half a week's wages for every year of service; 22 to 54, a week's wage; 55 years and over, 1 1/2 weeks' wages. The following examples give an indication of what miners might stand to lose in the event of a strike: based on average weekly earnings of Pounds 205, a 50-year-old miner with 20 years' service would be left with Pounds 5,022, while a 23-year-old with seven years' service would end up with as little as Pounds 615. The government's Pounds 1bn fund to ease the closures is also intended to be used on pension enhancement, which will allow miners to begin drawing payments from age 50 rather than 60, the present minimum. Those in the Mineworkers Pension Scheme who choose to remain in it will have their deferred pensions increased annually. On the government-guaranteed portion  - worth about 20 per cent of each pension  - increases will be equal to those of national average earnings. The remainder will be increased with the retail prices index, which is typically up to 2 percentage points lower. Miners will be entitled to a 60th of their final salary for every year of membership in the scheme. Thus a 35-year-old miner with 15 years of service will be entitled to only a quarter of the pension he would have had at 60 had he stayed long enough to collect it. Meanwhile, miners are free to extract their pensions in a single lump sum and purchase a personal pension  - a move that will produce less attractive returns because, among other things, the pension payments will not rise with inflation. Mr Paul Trickett, secretary to the Mineworkers Pension Scheme, notes that personal pensions do not offer death benefits or widows' pensions. 'We've had several men who have been killed on the job who had bought personal pensions. Their wives got no insurance benefits,' he said. In one instance, the National Union of Mineworkers was able to extract an Pounds 11,000 insurance payment for one widow, but had been less successful in other cases, he said.</p>

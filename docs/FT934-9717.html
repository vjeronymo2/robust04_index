			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early falls reduced in nervous trade FAVOURABLE UK economic statistics, a steadier lead from Wall Street and firmness in domestic bonds all helped to check the setback on the London stock market yesterday. Although traders remained apprehensive ahead of important US data due today and tomorrow, early losses in share prices were more than halved by the close of business. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 Index down by 8 points at 3,077.6, and some market strategists continued to warn that the index could be vulnerable down to the 2,850 area if selling resumed. The stock market opened higher, heartened by the 18-point recovery in the Dow Average on Friday, which drove some of London's more speculative sellers to hasten to buy stock to meet selling commitments entered into on Friday morning. However, the Footsie topped out at 3,096.5 early in the session, indicating that it was not confident enough to test 3,100 again at present. The loss of impetus soon turned into a downturn as weakness in the futures market drove the December contract on the Footsie to a discount. Stop-loss selling of the futures contract proved to be a negative influence throughout the day. Before noon, the market was down by 20.5 on the FT-SE scale and then remained nervy as it awaited the opening of the new session on Wall Street. In the event, Wall Street made a good start, and was only a shade easier when London went home for the day. The Footsie, having traded a somewhat erratic pattern, largely under the influence of the stock index future, was rallying at the close. The London market was fuelled at first by the announcement of a sharp jump in UK consumer credit in September, indicating reviving economic activity, and then by the non-inflationary implications of a modest increase in factory gate prices in October. 'The economic data was excellent for the stock market,' commented one leading trader, noting that the statistics implied that, whatever the worries regarding the outlook in the US, the UK economy is expanding while inflation remains under control. But traders agreed that, since the shakeout in global markets had clearly been prompted from the US bond sector, the near term outlook will depend heavily on how federal bonds react to the US producer price index, to be announced today, and to the US consumer price index expected tomorrow; overhanging both is the outcome of this week's US bond auctions. London's rally from the day's lows reflected some good quality buying from investors taking the view that the market had been oversold. At Strauss Turnbull, Mr Ian Harnett pointed to market support from real dividend yields, prospective dividend and earnings growth, a good equity bond ratio, and expectations of further falls in base rates. Underlying nervousness took its toll of the second line issues, where share prices were more readily marked down. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was driven down by 19.4 to 3,440.7. Non-Footsie business made up around 56 per cent of the Seaq total of 557.6m shares. On Friday, Seaq reported that 773.3m shares changed hands for a retail worth of Pounds 1.74bn, one of the highest daily figures this year.</p>

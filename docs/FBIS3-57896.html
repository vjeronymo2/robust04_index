			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Agnes Gorissen and Alain Guillaume: "Ankara and </F> Brussels Split Over Interpretation of Incidents"]    [Excerpt] The violent clashes that took place this weekend  between groups of Turks and Kurds in the Brussels communes of  Saint-Josse and Schaerbeek have had rapid repercussions.    On Monday morning [2 January], the Turkish Government issued  a communique stating that the Belgian authorities were  responsible for the incidents. They were responsible firstly  for allowing Kurdish intellectuals from Bonn -- whom the Turkish  Government claims are supporters of the separatist Workers Party  of Kurdistan [PKK] -- to "demonstrate in an area with a large  Turkish population," and then for "laying the way open for the  spread of such incidents" by the decision not to ban the PKK in  Belgium, as has been done in France and Germany.    In particular, the Turkish Government was outraged by the  "inadmissible" statement of Belgian Interior Minister Louis  Tobback who had "shifted the blame" for these incidents onto the  Turks.    The result was a veritable diplomatic merry-go-round, with  the charge d'affaires at the Belgian Embassy in Ankara being  summoned to the Turkish Foreign Ministry while Belgian Foreign  Minister Willy Claes received the Turkish ambassador before  speaking directly with his Turkish counterpart, Mr. Hikmet Cetin.    According to the semi-official Turkish press agency,  ANATOLIA, Mr. Cetin again stressed the need to extend the ban on  the PKK to cover Belgium. The same source claims that Mr.  Claes, for his part, stated that the demonstrators would be  "expelled" from Belgium and that Brussels "in no way accepted  the use of violence," adding that his government "would not  tolerate terrorism and terrorists."    These reported statements were quickly denied by Willy  Claes,  who made it known that any possible expulsions could only be  decided on in agreement with the other government departments.  This statement was in line with the moderate tone taken  yesterday afternoon by the foreign minister when he received --  another sign -- a delegation from the Union for the Protection  of the Kurdish Culture [YRWK], which had organized Saturday's  meeting.    According to the Foreign Ministry communique, "the  delegation  informed the minister of the Kurdish people's hopes for the  recognition of its identity." In response, Mr. Claes "expressed  his understanding for the Kurdish problem but condemned the use  of force as a way of fighting political battles." The minister  added that "Belgium, with its tradition of hospitality for  political refugees," nevertheless refused "to become the stage  for violent confrontation between foreign groups."    This Belgian-Turkish incident comes precisely at the time  when Ankara has launched a major campaign to neutralize the PKK.  This campaign operates at every level: Observers say that  there is pressure on "friendly countries" and NATO allies -- and  the Turkish Government will not fail to stress the useful  geostrategic position of Turkey and the barrier it provides  against the Islamic regimes.    There are also diplomatic moves afoot in Syria, Lebanon, and  Iran to obtain assurances from these countries that they will  cease backing the PKK. Only Monday, the Turkish daily newspaper  HURRIYET reported that the Turkish Prime Minister Mrs. Ciller  intended using the NATO summit to be held in Brussels on 10  January as an opportunity to ask President Clinton to put  pressure on Damascus during his meeting with President al-Asad.    The PKK rebellion has cost Turkey dearly -- $7.5 billion  last  year -- not to mention the cost in lives for the Turkish Army,  the PKK fighters, and the civilian population. The ANATOLIA  agency claims that 21 people, civilians and rebels, have been  killed since 1 January in the Anatolian southeast, although  these official figures should not be considered definitive.

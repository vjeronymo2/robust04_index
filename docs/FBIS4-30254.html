			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party [DLP] has decided to nominate Rep. Hwang Nak-chu  as the new speaker of the National Assembly to succeed Rep. Yi  Man-sop, it was learned Thursday morning. Incumbent speaker  Yi's term expires on June 28.    A party source said two lawmakers -- Yi Chun-ku and Kim  Yong-tae -- are candidates for the post of assembly vice  speaker, but Yi is considered the front-runner, party insiders  said.    DLP Chairman Kim Chong-pil will meet with President Kim  Yong-sam at Chongwadae Thursday morning to get the president's  approval for the candidate roster for the parliamentary posts  which also include committee chairmen.    A source said Rep. Pak Hui-tae is the likeliest candidate  for  chairman of the Legislation-Judiciary Committee while Reps. Yi  Sung-yun and Kim Ki-pae are hoping to chair the Foreign Affairs  and National Unification and Home Affairs Committees,  respectively.    National Defense Committee Chairman Rep. Sin Sang-u and  Ethics Committee Chairman Rep. Yi Chong-kun are likely to be  retained.    The chairman of the Information Committee, which will be  newly installed soon, will be either Rep. Hwang Myong-su or Rep.  Chong Chae-mun.</p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Councils rapped on shake-up plans Councils are not preparing properly for reorganisation, the Audit Commission says in a report published today. It says some councils are failing to talk to their neighbours, planning prematurely to take over other councils' services, or making financial commitments which incoming councils would inherit. Under reorganisation, due to take place in 1996, all-purpose unitary authorities will replace the existing two-tier structure in Wales and in several areas of England. The greatest fear is that councils facing abolition will spend irresponsibly. At the last reorganisation, in 1974, the number of new swimming pools tripled. Mr Bob Chilton, the commission's head of local government studies, said the chances of another 'swimming pool binge' had been reduced. Several councils with extensive reserves were, however, planning big capital projects, while at least one was planning to set a nil council tax in its final year to highlight the costs of reorganisation. This would burden new authorities with unnecessary costs. The commission says councils are refusing to improve their records for use by incoming authorities, or to prepare for competitive tendering of white-collar services, which will be compulsory.

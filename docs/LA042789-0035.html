			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-AUSTRALIA TIES BACKED BY QUAYLE, HAWKE  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle and Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke reaffirmed  Wednesday their countries' strong military links but differed on the  contentious issue of trade.  </P> <P> The two topics dominated 90-minute talks at the start of Quayle's five-day  visit to Australia on the first leg of an Asian tour.  </P> <P> Quayle, arriving here for his first visit to the Pacific region, was welcomed  with a 19-gun salute on arrival in this country's capital.  </P> <P> Quayle gave Hawke a letter from President Bush that was "warm and personal" but  did not delve into hard issues, according to a U.S. official. Hawke is  scheduled to visit the United States in June, and Bush came to Australia in  1982, when he was vice president.  </P> <P> Quayle described Australia -- the site of joint strategic satellite, shipping  and communication monitoring posts -- as "a solid and steadfast ally," U.S.  officials said.  </P> <P> On the thorny issue of trade, Hawke argued for a swift end to the U.S. Export  Enhancement Program, under which exporters receive a government bonus for  increased sales.  </P> <P> He said the program, adopted largely to combat European Community subsidies,  was also affecting Australia's penetration of world markets -- particularly in  wheat sales -- because it cut prices.  </P> <P> Although the two differed on the issue, Australian officials described the  atmosphere as "very friendly."  </P> <P> The talks also covered a threat this week by New Zealand Prime Minister David  Lange to pull out of the ANZUS defense alliance linking his country with  Australia and the United States.  </P> <P> The United States has effectively suspended New Zealand from the alliance since  1985, after Wellington banned visits by ships carrying nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> Officials said both sides want New Zealand to remain in ANZUS, but the United  States will not change its position of wanting its ships to visit New Zealand  without preconditions.  </P> <P> Quayle continues his tour, his second trip overseas since taking office, with  visits to Melbourne and Sydney before leaving Sunday for Indonesia. He will  also visit Singapore and Thailand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> QUAYLE'S PACIFIC TRIP  </P> <P> 1 -- Arrived in Canberra on Wednesday to participate in Australian-American  friendship week.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Rabin Is Maneuvering Anew," the  newspaper AL-BA'TH writes: As part of Israel's policy of  evading the requirments for peace--and whenever the  international community tightens the grip on this policy of  maneuvering and tampering with words--Israel makes statements on  so-called concessions to this or that party. Rabin has talked a  great deal about concessions in return for peace with Syria. He  reiterated this notion of concessions after he returned from  Washington, supposedly seeking to learn about the nature of  peace that Syria wants.    AL-BA'TH adds: Rabin's remarks are part of an attempt to  search for a way out of his isolation. At the same time, these  remarks are a mere semantical game, a much feigned desire for  peace attempting to cover a strong adherence to occupation. The  paper points out that anyone who talks about concessions should  first possess legitimate property or a legitimate right to the  thing he wants to relinquish. Rabin, as well as the former  Israeli rulers, do not have any right whatsoever to the occupied  Arab territories, and thus their alleged concessions are sheer  falsehood.    The paper stresses that the territories are Arab lands with  legitimate owners whose legitimate rights to these lands have  been unanimously recognized by the resolutions of international  legitimacy. The most important of these resolutions are the  ones on which the peace process was established. Israel,  however, is evading these resolutions by all ways and means.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Rabin is continuing his maneuvers  and procrastination. This method, however, will not last long  in view of the available opportunity for peace. This  opportunity should achieve its objective.</p>

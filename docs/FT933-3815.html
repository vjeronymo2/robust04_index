			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / International Company News: Japanese steelmakers see wider losses JAPAN'S leading steel companies, hit by the prolonged economic slump and the higher yen, warned of pre-tax losses for the current year to next March. The announcements by Kawasaki Steel, NKK, Kobe Steel, and Sumitomo Metal Industries, follow Nippon Steel's downward profit revision earlier this week. Japan's steel companies have been hit by the sharp fall in demand from its leading customers, including the car, electronics and construction industries. Although the companies had forecast first-half losses, they had hoped an economic recovery in the second half would support profits for the whole year. But the economy has remained lacklustre, and the appreciation in the yen is delaying an upturn. The companies said they would omit interim dividend payments. Kawasaki predicted a non-consolidated pre-tax loss of Y8bn (Dollars 49m) for the year on sales of Y1,040bn. It now expects a first-half pre-tax loss of Y8bn instead of Y5bn as previously estimated. Sumitomo Metal said it would post pre-tax losses of Y9bn on full-year sales of Y1,110bn. Its interim pre-tax loss will widen to Y9bn from the initial estimate of Y5bn. NKK expects to break even for the year on a 0.5 per cent rise in sales to Y1,270bn. For the first half, it will book profits of Y10bn from a change in accounting method and Y10bn from sales of part of its securities portfolio. However, it predicts an interim pre-tax loss of Y15bn on a 7 per cent fall in sales to Y560bn. Kobe Steel hopes to break even on a pre-tax profit basis on sales of Y1,100bn. For the first half to September, Kobe expects pre-tax losses of Y9bn on sales of Y550bn.</p>

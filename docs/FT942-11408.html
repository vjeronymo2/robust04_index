			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (13): Providing potential buyers - While investment rather than trade dominates, rapid economic growth means a new market for exports / Country profile, Vietnam Many of the companies excited by prospects in Vietnam following the communist government's decision to liberalise the economy in the late 1980s have hitherto concentrated on investment opportunities rather than trade. This is partly a reflection of Hanoi's own priorities, which include creating jobs and increasing exports, and partly because the widespread poverty in Vietnam makes it more attractive as a low-wage location for manufacturing than as an immediate market for foreign products. 'Investment has been the main preference of the government, while the purchase of goods and services has received low priority,' says a guide to Vietnam and the region published by Canada for the benefit of its investors and exporters. 'Rules and regulations applying to agents and distributors have not received high priority.' But the rapid growth of the Vietnamese economy - currently expanding at about eight per cent a year - and the substantial population of 70m make Vietnam an increasingly attractive market for exports. Vietnam's merchandise imports are expected to rise to around Dollars 4bn this year, nearly double the Dollars 2.2bn recorded in 1991, according to the Asian Development Bank. In these early days of Vietnam's development, the most promising buyers of imports are the foreign investors themselves and their joint venture companies, along with international institutions, such as the World Bank which are helping to rebuild Vietnam's transport and communications infrastructure after decades of war and neglect. There are good opportunities, for example, to sell machinery to the new breweries, food-processing and textile factories, and equipment for the new hotels springing up in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) and other big towns. And already there is intense competition to sell telephone equipment, power generating and transmission systems and aircraft to Vietnam, as infrastructure is steadily upgraded. According to one estimate, the construction machinery market will be worth Dollars 500m over the next five years. Looking further ahead, the US Department of Agriculture reckons that Vietnamese agricultural imports from the US alone could eventually rise to Dollars 300m a year, compared with Dollars 213m in 1992 from all sources. That is based on an assumption that per capita Vietnamese imports reach the present level of other south-east Asian countries such as Thailand, bringing Vietnam's total annual agricultural imports to Dollars 1.7bn, and that the US has a 16 per cent market share typical for the region. Given that Vietnam is itself a leading agricultural exporter, second only to Thailand and the US for rice exports, other sectors could perform even better than agriculture. Competition in Vietnamese markets, previously confined mainly to Asian and European exporters, has intensified since President Bill Clinton lifted the US trade embargo at the beginning of February. The big Japanese trading houses have been working in Vietnam for years, importing machinery to Vietnam and sending out seafood and agricultural produce to Japan. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, visited Vietnam recently with an entourage of 60 businessmen in a bid to increase Thai investment and trade with Hanoi. Trading with Vietnam, however, is not something to be undertaken lightly. A number of bureaucratic, financial and physical obstacles must be overcome for the enterprise to be worthwhile. Vietnam has limited foreign exchange resources, imports are licensed and only authorised companies are permitted to import goods. In the past the government has suddenly suspended imports of non-essential products to save money. Although Vietnam's creditworthiness is improving, those who trade regularly with the country say it is advisable for exporters to check whether their banks will accept a letter of credit from a Vietnamese bank. While the demand for capital goods is likely to remain strong, the consumer market is limited by poverty. The average per capita annual income is about Dollars 250, although that figure hides wide regional variations. Some villagers in central and northern Vietnam are very poor, while the residents of Ho Chi Minh City are relatively prosperous. Cross-border smuggling has also caused severe problems for bona fide exporters of consumer goods to Vietnam, since avoidance of customs tariffs allows the smugglers to undercut the price of the legally-imported products. Importers of high-value electronic goods have been particularly affected. Corruption is rampant in Vietnam, despite the government's public attempts to punish corrupt officials. In February Mr Vu Ngoc Hai, the former energy minister, was sentenced to three years in jail for embezzling money from an electric power line project, but government employees still routinely demand  -and receive - bribes in exchange for purchase contracts and other transactions. Companies dealing with the health ministry, for example, say over-invoicing is standard practice when selling pharmaceuticals. Vietnamese ports and roads are congested and slow, although the government and foreign donors have plans to improve them. Difficulties with distribution - to achieve nationwide coverage a company is likely to need three different distributors - and the confusion surrounding official regulations make it imperative for an exporter either to open an office in Vietnam or to appoint a good local agent. 'There are no clear channels of distribution for consumer products,' says Mr Raymond Eaton, chairman of Export Development Trading Corporation, which has offices in Vietnam and Thailand. 'There is a very definite demand for products in Vietnam, but you can only be totally effective if you have some sort of serious representation.' Several multinational companies are showing a keen interest in exporting directly to Vietnam, according to Mr Eaton, whether they want to sell construction machinery or stationery. Others, such as Castrol, the British lubricants company, or US soft drink producers Pepsi-Cola and Coca-Cola, have invested in joint ventures that prepare and package the product locally.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Christie's sell dinosaur egg for pounds 5,500 Good egg: Christie's South Kensington yesterday sold a 70m-year-old fossilised dinosaur egg for Pounds 5,500. The 18.2cm-long egg, which is assumed to have come from a sauropod dinosaur Hypselosaurus, was found near Aix-en-Provence, southern France, Clive Cookson writes. Paleontologists have recovered hundreds of fossilised dinosaur eggs. Most contain nothing but featureless stone when cracked open, but a few contain remains of dinosaur embryos. If the new owner of the Hypselosaurus does not want to risk the Pounds 5,500 investment by taking a hammer to the egg, it would be possible to get an idea whether anything interesting is inside with a specialised X-ray machine.</p>

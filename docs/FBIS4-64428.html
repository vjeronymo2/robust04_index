			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [John Palmer report: "Tory Row Baffles EU Partners"] </F>   [Text] Brussels -- Britain's European partners are  following the debate among Conservative politicians about  possible withdrawal from the Union with amusement and amazement.  The Tory row about a possible British referendum on EU  [European Union] membership is seen as evidence of a permanent  split on European policy in the party.    Few EU leaders believe reports that John Major has  considered  putting membership of the EU to a referendum at the next general  election. But some have already indicated to London their  determination to move further towards a federal European Union  after 1996 -- even if this has to be without Britain.    "The British Conservatives seem to be tearing themselves  apart and I really cannot understand what is at the bottom of  it," a Dutch minister observed yesterday. "The wild men seem to  be running your government's political agenda."    A senior European Commission member said: "The Eurosceptics  have no real alternative to offer except complete withdrawal and  no British government will agree to that."    Few people believe that the 1996 review conference set up  under the Maastricht treaty will result in a fully federalist  system for what will probably by then be an EU of 16 states.  But the British government will come under pressure to allow a  majority of EU countries to agree on steps to "deepen" political  union -- with Britain being entitled to stand aside.    "The most important decision in 1996 will be how to take  future constitutional decisions," one EU ambassador said.  "There may be a precedent in the Maastricht treaty. The  British opt-outs on a single currency and social policy could be  used again. This could allow a big majority of the 16 to agree  on further integration within the European Union without  obliging everyone to take part."    The odds are that a majority of the 16 will decide to move  to  a single currency by the end of the decade. Technical work has  begun to permit a single currency to be introduced, maybe in  1998, and optimism is growing that 10 or 12 of the 16 EU  countries will be economically strong enough by then to take  part.    Senior British ministers have dismissed as "utopian" any  prospect of monetary union this decade. But Sir Leon Brittan,  European commissioner for foreign trade, warned last week that  Tory Euro- sceptics were out of touch with developments.    The 1996 conference of EU governments will almost certainly  agree to create a European defence union by merging the Western  European Union (the association of the European member states of  NATO) with the EU itself. The signs are that the British  government will back this move and may even join the existing  multi-national Eurocorps -- seen as the embryo of a future EU  army.    "The British are quite right to see the 1996 conference as  of  crucial importance to the future of Europe. It will not decide  the final shape of a federal union but it could go further in  that direction than some in London realise," a senior member of  the European Commission said yesterday.    The starting point for the 1996 conference and reform of  decision-making in the Union will be enlargement. Everyone  accepts that expansion to include Austria, Finland, Norway and  Sweden next year is only the start of a process which will  continue into the new century and may lead to an EU of between  20 and 30 states.    Rather than risk the Union being paralysed, or even  imploding, under the weight of new members, most EU governments  accept the need for radical political reform. The 1996 review  is likely to make fundamental changes to the voting system in  the Council of Ministers, giving many more votes to the larger  countries (of which the British government will approve) while  making it easier to decide by majority vote (which London is  opposed to).    Mr Major will have little difficulty in agreeing to reduce  the numbers of European commissioners to 12 or 14, but he will  resist the German and French call for far greater powers for the  future president of the Commission to pick the commissioners on  merit rather than being forced to accept those chosen by  national governments.    Alongside reforms in the Commission and the Council of  Ministers, the German government will also press hard for the  European Parliament to be given further legislative powers over  justice, policing and immigration, as well as foreign, security  and defence policy.    Some favour a committee of national parliaments being set up  as an upper chamber of the European Parliament to rule on which  issues are best legislated at European or at national or  regional levels. The increasingly powerful regions, particularly  in Germany, Italy, Spain and Belgium, will also demand a bigger  say through the Committee of the European Regions.</p>

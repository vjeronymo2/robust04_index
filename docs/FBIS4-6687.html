			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States should hold preliminary negotiations on "objective  criteria" for gauging foreign penetration of Japanese markets  before resuming bilateral "framework" trade talks, a senior  Foreign Ministry official said Thursday [21 April]. Koichiro  Matsuura, former deputy foreign minister, made the remark at a  lecture in Tokyo.    The framework talks have been stalemated since the Feb. 11  breakdown of the Japan-U.S. summit over objective criteria.    Matsuura, commenting on the Group of Seven (G-7) summit  scheduled to open July 8, forecast that Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's successor is likely to meet U.S. President  Bill Clinton immediately before the summit.    Regarding the April 15 talks in Marrakech, Morocco, between  Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor, Matsuura said Kantor's comments  seem to show "serious U.S. intentions" to settle the framework  talks.</p>

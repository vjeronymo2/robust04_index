Salmin Amour, second vice-president of the United Republic  of  Tanzania and Zanzibari president, confirmed support to the stand  of the DPRK in their efforts for a fair and smooth solution to  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    Klaus Riis, chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the  Communist Party of Denmark (Marxist-Leninist), said that just  is the stand taken by the DPRK to cope with the grave situation  in which the situation of the Korean peninsula is growing acute  due to the perfidy of the United States. "We express our full  support for and solidarity with this stand," he pointed out.    He stressed that there is no more important work at present  than to launch the solidarity movement for supporting Korea on a  worldwide scale.    Indrajit Gupta, general secretary of the National Council of  the Communist Party of India, said his party condemned the U.S.  imperialists for scheming to isolate and stifle the DPRK, taking  issue with the "nuclear inspection".    He confirmed full support and solidarity to the Workers'  Party, the government and the people of Korea in the valiant  struggle against the challenges of the enemy.    Siale Bileka Silvestre, prime minister of Equatorial Guinea,  said that the U.S. action evidently proved it had no willingness  to resolve the nuclear problem and was resorting to the  premeditated moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK, taking  advantage of a lever of the DPRK-U.S. talks.    The step taken by the DPRK Government this time is just, he  said.    Ali Alatas, foreign minister of Indonesia, told reporters  that dialogue is important in solving the nuclear problem in the  Korean peninsula and the present crisis should not be aggravated.    The National Assembly of Zambia, in a note to the DPRK  Embassy, expressed its support to all efforts of the DPRK to  realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.</p>

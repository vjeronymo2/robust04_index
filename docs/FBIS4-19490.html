			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "EU: European </F> Employers (UNICE) Stress How Urgent It Is To Reach a Council  Decision on Dual-Use Goods"]    [Text] Brussels, 15 Apr 94 (AGENCE EUROPE) - UNICE [Union  of Industrial and Employers' Confederations of Europe], the  spokesman for European business circles, has expressed concern  about the delay by the Council of the [European] Union in  defining a regime to be applied to "dual-use" goods and  technologies (civilian and military). It is a known fact that  the problem concerns exports of such goods towards third  countries. Difficulties arise from the need to reconcile the  free movement of goods in the market without borders with the  control of certain "sensitive" exports towards a number of third  countries. If there is no common regime, then goods and  technologies which could be used for military purposes would  leave the [EC] Community and cross countries which do not have  sufficient controls. This issue has implications on the defence  policy of Member States which makes it difficult to define what  regime should be introduced. UNICE recalls its earlier  suggestions for resolving this problem through "effective export  controls" which are not detrimental to the competitiveness of  European companies. It affirms: "Although the Council's work has  since made considerable progress, UNICE regrets that it has not  been concluded. Ministers of the Twelve still do not agree on a  number of points, such as the `catch-all' clause (treatment of  suspect customers), length of and measures applicable during the  transition period, which are fundamental to the efficient  operation of a European Union export control system.  Consequently, UNICE calls on ministers to resolve the  outstanding problems urgently. The abolition of the Coordinating  Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) on 31 March,  which UNICE welcomes, makes the setting up of a European Union  regime of export controls on dual-use goods and technologies all  the more necessary. It would strengthen the European Union's  position in the current negotiations related to the  establishment of the New Forum in charge of defining the lists  and procedures for future controls on dual-use products. For  economic operators, cooperation between countries which have  developed effective and reliable control regimes is essential to  prevent distortions of competition both in Europe and with third  countries. Lastly, at a time when the United States is reviewing  its own exportcontrol regime, the European Union should seize  the opportunity to show the way forward by putting in place an  innovative system of export controls based on a licence-free  European zone which could evolve in time into a licence-free  zone at multilateral level, including the United States, Japan  and any country which could meet the criteria defined in common.  For all these reasons, UNICE stresses how urgent it is that  decisions be taken."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Qian Qichen, vice premier and foreign </F> minister, by an unidentified station correspondent; place and  date not given; from "The World Today" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Video shows Qian Qichen in a dark Western  business suit seated opposite a male correspondent]    [Correspondent] Vice Premier Qian, thank you for accepting  our interview. A review of the international situation over the  past year reveals an Asia-Pacific fever. Some call 1993 the  "Year of the Asia-Pacific Region." Its hallmark is the Seattle  meeting in November. What are the political and economic  factors behind this Asia-Pacific fever? Please discuss them  with our viewers.    [Qian] The emergence of Asia-Pacific fever is not  accidental. Economic factors have become the most prominent  issue following the end of the Cold War. Economic factors are  playing an increasing role in the relations of various  countries. The Asia-Pacific region currently enjoys excellent  economic development while the rest of the world is in a general  economic recession. The Asia-Pacific region can now be  described as the most economically vibrant part of the world.  Politically, the region now enjoys relative stability and  relatively good interstate relations, possessing a dwindling  number of hot spots at a time when some countries are  politically unstable, engulfed by an endless stream of regional  conflicts. Therefore, politically speaking the emergence of  Asia-Pacific fever is only natural, as is the way developments  in the Asia-Pacific region have become the focus of widespread  attention. [announcer-read passage on the Asia-Pacific region's  growing importance in international diplomacy omitted]    [Correspondent] The Chinese and U.S. leaders held an  official meeting in Seattle. The event was the focus of  international attention. Would you please tell us what impact  the official meeting between the Chinese and U.S. leaders will  have on future Sino-U.S. relations?    [Qian] Presidents Jiang Zemin and Clinton held an official  meeting in Seattle for the first time in five years. In my  opinion, the meeting between the Chinese and U.S. leaders  carried vital significance. To be sure, the meeting of the top  leaders was not an occasion for specific discussions; it was an  occasion for exchanging views on major issues. The development  of Sino-U.S. relations was discussed from a long-term  perspective and within a broader context. China and the United  States have many common interests. At the same time,  differences exist. Both sides are aware it is necessary to  carry out exchanges and cooperation in accordance with the  principle of common interests. At the same time, both sides  also know it is necessary to carry out frank [tan cheng]  dialogue to deal with these differences. This formula will lead  us to the correct path for solving and developing Sino-U.S.  relations and for eliminating obstacles. [announcer-read  passage on Western political crises in 1993 omitted]    [Correspondent] In sharp contrast to the Asia-Pacific fever,  this year Western countries have generally experienced political  crises which have led to changes in regimes and role reversals  for governing and opposition parties. People have demonstrated  a mentality of change. Would you please discuss the main  reasons for the political crises in the West?    [Qian] Public opinion in the West terms the current  phenomena as post-Cold War syndrome. A very important reason  for the occurrence of this phenomena is people in various  countries have begun to turn their attention inward following  the end of the Cold War because they have grown more concerned  about domestic affairs. Domestic economic, social, and political  contradictions; scandals; and other issues have become matters  of great concern to people in those countries. This has led to  changes in the original political structure. Economically, the  entire Western world has been mired in an economic recession  since the beginning of the nineties; the economies of some  countries have become stagnant, whereas the economies of others  have grown at a very slow pace or posted zero and negative  growth. Unemployment rates in the West are high. This has  caused social unrest and spawned a post-Cold War syndrome.  [announcer-read passage on Russia's political and economic  problems omitted]    The problem with Russia seems to be that the difficulties  it encountered following the change in political power and in  economic restructuring are far greater than previously  anticipated. Russia is our largest neighbor. Because it is our  neighbor, we of course hope the situation there will stabilize  as soon as possible and its economy will develop gradually.  [announcer-read passage on the world's political and economic  situation following the end of the Cold War omitted]    [Correspondent] The international situation has undergone  major changes following the end of the Cold War. What kind of  impact do you think the new international situation will have on  China's future development?    [Qian] The situation arising in the wake of the Cold War has  posed new challenges to all countries. However, the successful  maintenance of world peace is the most important thing. During  these past two years -- 1992 and 1993 -- our country's economy  began the course of rapid and healthy development. This  precisely demonstrates the importance of the maintenance of  world peace; this situation is very conducive to China's  development.    [Correspondent] What diplomatic achievements do you think  China has achieved this year?    [Qian] Diplomacy is the extension of domestic affairs.  Because our country's domestic situation is very good, the  situation on our diplomatic front is likewise very good. More  than 30 foreign heads of states and government leaders, as well  as over 50 vice presidents, vice premiers, and foreign  ministers, have visited China this year. Our diplomatic  activities are relatively active; a total of 158 countries have  established diplomatic relations with us. The emphasis of our  diplomacy is to strengthen relations with our neighbors and  establish good-neighborly relations with them; to strengthen  unity and cooperation with developing countries; and at the same  time to establish economic and trade relations with countries  throughout the world. Two major events of great importance took  place last November. One was German Chancellor Kohl's visit to  China, and the other was the meeting between Presidents Jiang  and Clinton. These two events signified that Western powers  have begun to show interest in developing constructive  relationships with China. In other words, both Western public  opinion and Western business communities have a sanguine view of  China's economic development; everyone wants to do business with  China. Under these circumstances, politicians in the West feel  it is necessary to establish constructive relationships with  China. I believe that in the new year, we may have diplomatic  breakthroughs in this respect.    [Correspondent] What will be the emphasis of our diplomatic  activities in 1994?    [Qian] The emphasis of our diplomatic activities next year  remain the creation of a favorable and peaceful international  environment. This can be divided into two parts. On the one  hand, we will strengthen good-neighborly relations with our  neighbors. On the other, we will develop broad economic and  trade relations with all countries. What is especially  important is what I have just said. After the Seattle meeting,  we hope Sino-U.S. relations as well as relations between China  and Europe will develop further. We hope a breakthrough will be  made in this respect.    [Correspondent] Thank you.</p>

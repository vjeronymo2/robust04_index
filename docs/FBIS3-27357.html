			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan in Guangzhou and Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Guangdong, the most economically dynamic region in  China, is likely to actually benefit from the controversial tax  revamp, this year's budget plan has revealed. The provincial  budget as well as a Government Work Report by Governor Zhu  Senlin will be tabled at a provincial People's Congress which  opens in Guangzhou today.    In his work report, Mr Zhu is to swear allegiance to the  central Government by pledging to implement Beijing's tax reform  programme. He will also stick to calls for "sustained, high  speed, and healthy" growth of the economy this year, avoiding  phrases such as "fast-track growth".    The Government will reduce fixed asset investments by 10 per  cent and cut down re-investment by enterprises by about 30 per  cent, Mr Zhu says in his report. But he vowed to take all means  to ensure Guangdong is one step ahead of other provinces in  marching towards a market economy.    About 800 delegates arrived in Guangzhou yesterday to attend  the Second Session of the Eighth Guangdong People's Congress.  Although no major personnel changes are expected at the  congress, the week-long conclave has been seen as significant as  the drastic tax reform, which was considered the centre-piece of  this year's economic reform, will face the test. For instance,  delegates will be asked to endorse the controversial value-added  tax (VAT).    According to conference documents, Guangdong and Beijing  agreed to a formula on the share of revenue from VAT. Beijing  will get 75 per cent while the remaining one-quarter goes to  local funds. However, Guangdong will receive a yearly increase  of rebate from Beijing to guarantee the local treasury will not  suffer under the new package. Moreover, Beijing has also agreed  to allow Guangdong to keep its annual increase of financial  contribution to the central [authorities] to nine per cent.  This was despite the fact that Guangdong achieved a 56.42 per  cent increase of government revenue last year.    The tax arrangements have been seen as concessions made by  the central authorities to the southern province, which had  earlier been widely seen as the worst-hit region under the tax  reform. According to the Governmenl Work Report, the economic  growth rate for 1994 has been set at 15 per cent. The national  target adopted by the central Government for this year is nine  per cent. Industrial output is expected to rise 21 per cent  while the province's agriculture will grow at five per cent.    While Guangdong's social retail index--a key indicator of  inflation--jumped 18.2 per cent last year, the Governor is  hoping to keep the figure below 12 per cent this year. Mr Zhu  will also give a rundown of the glowing success of his province  last year and ask the delegates for their support in pushing  ahead the reform agenda, especially the new tax reform package.    Three areas--runaway fixed investment, neglect of  agriculture  by the government, and inflation have been singled out for  concern this year. The report says fixed assets investments  increased 58.5 per cent reaching a staggering 146.1 billion yuan  (about HK$130 billion) last year.    Damages by deluge and typhoon also cost the province as much  as 1 billion yuan last year. "The third [problem] is a  relatively large increase of inflation. The social retail price  index rose 18.2 per cent over the previous year," the report  says.    However, Mr Zhu's report made no mention of a series of  industrial accidents in Shenzhen last year, killing more than  100 people. The report also has little to say on the chronic  problem of inflation. Prices of grain went up by more than 40  per cent in Guangzhou last November. The surge of prices has  prompted the central Government to re-impose price control in  major cities.    Last night the China News Service reported that the State  Planning Commission and the State Administration of Taxation had  recently issued a joint directive ordering the authorities to  maintain stable prices following the implementation of tax  reform.    Meanwhile, a tight budget is to be delivered by top finance  official at the Guangdong conclave. According to a report to be  tabled by head of the Bureau of Finance, Zeng Bingsheng, total  revenue for the Government last year reached 34.6 billion yuan,  11.1 billion up from the previous year. That represented a 56.4  per cent increase.    Mr Zeng is to tell delegates that Guangdong is unlikely to  suffer under the new tax scheme. The provincial Government is  expected to have a 9.89 per cent real increase of revenue this  year.</p>

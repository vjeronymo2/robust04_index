			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE;  </P> <P> WIFE, HUSBAND CIRCLE THE GLOBE IN THE PURSUIT OF HIGH FASHION  </P> <P> It had been an exhilarating week. Laguna Beach fashion designer and boutique  owner D.N. Evans had just finished creating wardrobes for five county women  attending last week's presidential inauguration when she got a call from an  official in the Soviet Union requesting her help in developing that nation's  fashion industry.  </P> <P> That was 2 weeks ago. Since then Evans, born Donna Shaw in Chicago in "the  early 1940s," has put the finishing touches on her new spring line and prepared  for a globe-circling trip in search of hand-woven fabrics for use in the  designs she shows and sells exclusively in her Laguna Beach salon, D.N. Evans  Couture.  </P> <P> Evans and her husband/partner Michael have built their business on the  philosophy that clothes must be comfortable and elegant. They have peddled that  philosophy to prominent names, including Barbra Streisand, Ali McGraw and  Margaux Hemingway. In Orange County, Evans has dressed Judie Argyros, Harriet  Nelson and Ginny Ueberroth (she designed the gowns for Ueberroth's daughter's  wedding). And for the inaugural celebrations, she created 10 outfits for Orange  County businesswoman Kathryn Thompson alone.  </P> <P> "I can only say, God bless the ladies of Orange County," said the designer, who  was wearing fuchsia-knit separates and tiny round sunglasses with her dark hair  pulled back. "The women of Orange County are so much more enlightened and  educated (than they used to be). They travel all the time, and because there is  such a heightened social scene, they know they have to look terrific. And they  have a great appreciation for art."  </P> <P> One characteristic of the Evanses' clothes is workmanship. The couple employ  about 30 seamstresses who work in their own homes or in a factory in Costa  Mesa. Each seamstress is responsible for an entire garment and much of the work  is done by hand. "The cost is greater, but the quality is more controllable,"  Michael Evans says. It is this workmanship and cottage-industry concept that  the couple will discuss with Soviets when they attend a business and trade  development conference in Moscow in October.  </P> <P> Quality workmanship and art have always been important to the Evanses. Both  have art backgrounds. Michael, who designed the boutique, is a former sculptor.  D.N., who attended the Art Institute of Chicago and in 1987 received the Orange  County Arts Alliance award for outstanding contributions in design, started out  designing jewelry.  </P> <P> As a self-described "high-fashion flower child," she spent the late '60s  traveling through Europe, learning about art and fashion by visiting museums  and exploring cities. By the 1970s she had begun marketing jewelry she  designed, which appeared in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar magazines and  high-fashion boutiques.  </P> <P> One day, on a business trip to Los Angeles promoting her jewelry, the Evanses  got lost and ended up in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> "It was a day like today," D.N. recalled on a recent clear and sunny morning in  her salon. "Picture it: I'd never been to Southern California before, traveling  here from the East in the middle of winter. I thought, what a great place. . .  . I don't know how I got here, but I'm not going back."  </P> <P> She had gained a reputation in the '70s with her contemporary silver and stone  jewelry and accessories, such as the soft-leather hobo bag, but had yet to  venture into clothes design.  </P> <P> She and Michael settled in Laguna Beach in 1974 and began raising a large  family (the couple have six children). It wasn't long before she decided the  place needed a fashion designer.  </P> <P> "I started playing around and designed a little tube top and short wide pants,  which became my trademarks," D.N. said. "People kept asking me for them. It was  that simple. And the business grew and grew."  </P> <P> Michael said his military background and his wife's love of comfortable  traveling clothes helped steer them into marketing what they call "no-excuse"  fashions -- high-styled, yet soft and unstructured.  </P> <P> "I was used to (there being) no excuses for a sloppy uniform," he says. "You  had to be no-nonsense about the way you looked. We combined that with comfort.  Our criteria was: Can you get on a horse and ride out of town in it?"  </P> <P> In the past few years D.N. has focused more on evening wear, applying the same  concepts of comfort to more glamorous designs.  </P> <P> She grabbed a white wrinkled-silk bustier to show how the piece can go with a  long ballerina-length skirt or wide-legged pants. Versatility and comfort are  the key elements, she said.  </P> <P> "I'm thrilled to say I dressed quite a few women for the inaugural with this  concept," she said. "The idea is you can take these comfortable formal parts  and wear them different ways. They're evening separates. Of course, the pieces  are expensive, but think of the mileage."  </P> <P> During the past year, hand-woven fabrics from Southeast Asia have dominated her  collection. She buys the material overseas, brings it home and designs clothes  for the fabrics. Each piece is hand cut and hand sewn.  </P> <P> "A lot of my inspiration comes from the peasants I see on my travels," she  explained.  </P> <P> "We're making investment clothing from fabrics that are works of art," said  Michael, fondling a piece of material from Laos. "You have to go farther and  farther to find people still doing this kind of work. You don't find 2,000  yards of this fabric. You're lucky if you find six pieces."  </P> <P> The shop is half couture and half ready-to-wear, with everything designed by  D.N. Prices range from $350 for a ready-to-wear ensemble to $4,800 for a  couture evening outfit. Last week she displayed a layered-cotton skirt made of  hand-woven cloth from Southeast Asia, $1,250; a white Thai silk bustier, $750;  a black-silk evening skirt, $1,250; a kimono jacket made of fabrics from  Southeast Asia, $750, and a fuchsia double-breasted blazer, $650.  </P> <P> Her spring clothes include wheat-colored hemp jackets, organza silk wide-legged  pants, silk and beaded vests and lots of black-and-white and navy-and-white  dressy separates.  </P></p>

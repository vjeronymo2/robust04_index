			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow's strength masks broad market decline Wall Street Blue chip issues posted solid gains yesterday, but otherwise US stock prices were mostly flat to lower in light trading after the Federal Reserve's open market committee meeting ended with no hint of any change in monetary policy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.02 at 3,674.50. The strength in the Dow, however, masked weakness in the wider market. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poors 500 ended 0.24 off at 446.13, the American SE composite eased 0.15 to 423.55 and the Nasdaq composite was 2.59 weaker at 701.00. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled a moderate 236.2m shares. As on Tuesday, trading yesterday was hamstrung by the unwillingness of many participants to become involved in the market while the FOMC was still holding its meeting. When the meeting started on Tuesday, there was considerable speculation that the FOMC might vote to raise interest rates to support the dollar, which has dropped steadily against the yen in recent weeks. Although by yesterday the consensus was that the FOMC would not change monetary policy, and would wait until it saw tomorrow's June employment report before deciding whether to act, uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates continued to restrain demand. There was little subsequent reaction when the meeting ended during the afternoon with no announcement from the Fed, which was taken by analysts as a sign that monetary policy had not been changed. While much of the market languished, the one bright spot was the Dow, which outperformed other indices thanks to strength in a few cyclical stocks, including International Paper, which closed Dollars 1 3/4 ahead at Dollars 68 3/4 , Alcoa, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 76 7/8 , and Caterpillar, climbing Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 104 1/2 . Texaco advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 1/2 as investors bought more stock following Tuesday's announcement of a major restructuring by the oil group aimed at cutting costs. The share price was given an additional lift yesterday by rat-ings upgrades from two broking houses, Wertheim Schroder and Dean Witter Reynolds. Dime Bancorp was one of the most active stocks on the NYSE, dropping Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 9 1/4 in volume of 3.2m shares after investors signalled their displeasure at news of the savings bank's acquisition of Anchor Bancorp in a Dollars 1.2bn stock swap. The news also failed to lift Anchor shares, which ended Dollars  3/8 cheaper at Dollars 15 1/2 . Salomon fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 45 1/2 after the company warned that it would incur a loss of Dollars 200m in the second quarter because of poor results at its Salomon Brothers brokerage unit. The warning hit other brokerage stocks: Morgan Stanley softened Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 55 5/8 , PaineWebber Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 1/2 and Dean Witter Discover Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 37. Canada Toronto closed modestly lower in light trading after the falling gold bullion price again pushed gold shares downward. The TSE 300 composite index lost 10.2 at 4,043.4 and declines led rises by 409 to 311 after volume of 42.8m shares. Ten of the 14 sub-indices lost ground, with the golds group weakening 1.5 per cent as the price of gold in New York dipped USDollars 2.10 an ounce to USDollars 383.85. The transportation group gained 1.4 per cent. Laidlaw 'B' rose CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 9 5/8 in anticipation of its third-quarter financial results, expected to be released soon. Brazil Sao Paulo rose 5.3 per cent in local currency terms in strong volume, on optimism over the government's anti-inflation plan and a presidential election poll expected later this week. The Bovespa index ended 1,892 higher at 37,535 and turnover was about RDollars 221.5m (Dollars 242.1m). Traders saw local and foreign investors coming back into the market and said a dip in the Sao Paulo price of the basic basket of goods of 0.69 per cent between Monday and Tuesday provided a boost to stocks, given that inflation was running at 1 or 2 percentage points a day before the government's latest anti-inflation plan came into operation.</p>

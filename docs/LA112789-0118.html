			<p><P> November 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW, IMPROVED AND FUNNIER ANN JILLIAN LAUNCHES TV ASSAULT  </P> <P> The Ann Jillian you see assaulting the airwaves these days is a new, improved  model.  </P> <P> She's less blonde, more subdued, no longer the glossy -- sometimes brassy --  glamour girl she was when she first hit Hollywood.  </P> <P> And she's lightened up from the sometimes heavy drama she has been doing in  "Ellis Island," "Convicted: A Mother's Story," "Mae West" and the on- and  off-screen melodrama chronicled in her autobiography, "The Ann Jillian Story."  </P> <P> The sojourn into heavy material improved her timing and technique for comedy,  which she uses in three major television projects set to air within days of  each other.  </P> <P> Tonight's two-hour NBC movie "Little White Lies" begins The Ann Jillian  Television Festival with the actress-singer portraying a policewoman -- which  she knows quite a little about because she's married to a cop.  </P> <P> Then there is the Thursday airing of the pilot to the "Ann Jillian" series,  which settles into its regular Sunday slot on Dec. 3.  </P> <P> " 'Little White Lies' is a romantic comedy with Tim Matheson playing my love  interest. I play a policewoman. He's a doctor and they hide their professional  identities when they first meet, but then they fall in love," says Jillian.  </P> <P> "It is the kind of light comedy the movies used to make in the '40s and '50s. I  think we've really captured the same romantic feeling," she said.  </P> <P> On her new series, Jillian plays a widow with a 14-year-old daughter. She's an  ex-Radio City Music Hall Rockette and a New Yorker who moves to a small  California town. It's a sitcom dealing with the complicated relationship  between mother and daughter.  </P> <P> "I'd describe this show as being close to the heart. I've never been a mother,  but I've played a few in other projects and I have a lot of friends with  teen-age daughters.  </P> <P> "I feel comfortable in the role with Lisa Rieffel, who plays my daughter.  Working with Lisa is such a pleasure I'd like to have a teen-age girl of my  own."  </P></p>

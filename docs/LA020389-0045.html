			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAR-CRASH MURDER CONVICTIONS UPSET  </P> <P> A state appellate court in Santa Ana on Thursday overturned the murder  convictions of a man who killed two teen-agers in a car crash as he fled from  police, ruling that discrimination against Asians and Latinos was evident  during jury selection.  </P> <P> The 4th District Court of Appeal ruled 3 to 0 that the exclusion of a  Vietnamese immigrant because of what the prosecutor stated was his inability to  understand English was illegally based on a racial stereotype.  </P> <P> In a 16-page opinion written by Justice Edward J. Wallin, the court also found  that Valle's rights were violated during a police interrogation after his  arrest.  </P> <P> Ruben Valle was the first person ever convicted of murder in Orange County in a  case involving traffic deaths. Valle, driving a stolen van and chased by Costa  Mesa police on Dec. 19, 1984, ran a stop sign and rammed a car carrying two  Estancia High School students, Roy Williamson and Billy Dearing, both 17.  </P> <P> Both boys were killed. Valle was convicted in 1986 of two counts of  second-degree murder.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard King said his office would consider an appeal.  </P> <P> King showed bias by disqualifying Tuoc Vo, a mechanic and Vietnamese immigrant,  when there were no proper legal grounds to do so, the court concluded.  </P> <P> According to the opinion, King stated that "members of the Oriental race" can  have difficulty learning English and can have "serious problems in  understanding words that have abstract meanings to them."  </P> <P> Valle's attorney, J. Courtney Shevelson of Monterey, said King failed to  establish that Vo had such problems.  </P> <P> The justices also found that King had improperly rejected a Latino for jury  service.  </P></p>

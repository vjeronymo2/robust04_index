			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Volatility 'unhelpful' says food chairman MR ERIC NICOLI, chairman of United Biscuits, is more concerned about where sterling will be tomorrow than where it stands today. 'The volatility is extremely unhelpful,' he says. Until last month, his company's main concern about foreign currency exposure was to prevent the weakness of the dollar magnifying the impact of a steep slide in profits at Keebler, its US biscuits and snacks subsidiary. UB is still struggling to restore Keebler's fortunes, but at least it has stopped worrying about the dollar. Mr Nicoli says a series of foreign exchange options taken out by the company at rates a little above Dollars 1.70 to the pound are being quietly allowed to expire. Cadbury Schweppes, which has sizeable soft drinks sales in the US, had also come to regard the dollar as its main source of foreign exchange risk. 'Now we are treating all currencies as foreign,' says Mr David Jinks, finance director. He says Cadbury will benefit slightly from devaluation. He has revised his forecast of the adverse financial impact of currency fluctuations on the company from 4.5 per cent to about 1.5 per cent over the full year. He says the company, which exports about Pounds 40m worth of confectionery every year, will peg prices. Mr Nicoli does not expect sterling's decline to have a big impact on United Biscuits in the short-term, but is unsure whether the gains outweigh the losses. 'You'd have to do the calculations twice a day to give an answer.' Both companies expanded internationally in the 1980s, with a particular priority on continental Europe, and their sterling results will be flattered by income from acquisitions in countries in the European Monetary System. The companies are reasonably sanguine about the immediate effects of devaluation in input costs in the UK. The main consequence so far has been in downward adjustments by the EC to the value of the 'green' pound - the rate at which EC farm prices are expressed in sterling - which has increased the sterling price of sugar. Mr Nicoli is more cautious about prospects in the longer term. He says: 'Depending on how low the sterling exchange rate goes and how long it lasts, there is bound to be some adverse impact on our raw materials costs.'</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> MET PERFORMERS ARRIVE IN BEIJING  </P> <P> A company featuring artists from the New York Metropolitan Opera arrived today  in Beijing for the first prominent American cultural event since the bloody  military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last month.  </P> <P> "What happened in China is tragic for all concerned," Joann Grillo, managing  director of Ambassadors of Opera and Concert Worldwide, said in an interview.  </P> <P> "However, China is a reality. The world must deal with her," she said,  explaining the company's decision to proceed with its three performances in  Beijing despite the May 20 imposition of martial law and the June 4 military  crackdown in which hundreds or perhaps thousands of protesters were killed.  </P> <P> The Ambassadors of Opera and Concert Worldwide is an independent company that  features performers from the New York Metropolitan Opera. Since 1983, it has  staged operas and musicals throughout the world.  </P> <P> "I don't want to sound presumptuous, but if our concerts can bring some beauty  into the lives of the people in Beijing, then we will have served our purpose,"  Grillo said.  </P></p>

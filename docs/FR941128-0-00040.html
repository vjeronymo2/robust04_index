			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NWF supported the addition of the phrase ``any available'' agreeing that the absence of a performance bond has no bearing on whether a site should be classified and abandoned for inspection purposes. One SRA, noting the time lag between initiation of bond forfeiture and actual collection, supported the proposal to allow reduction of inspections while the regulatory authority is diligently pursuing bond forfeiture. This commenter believed that inspection resources would be used much more efficiently by this change. Another SRA commented that this provision should include those sites where no reclamation bond is available due to insolvency of surety companies. These sections are being adopted as proposed. To address the latter SRA's concern, if no performance bond exists because of the insolvency of a surety company, then under this rule a performance bond would not be considered available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 840.11(h) introductory text/842.11(f) introductory text <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These sections as proposed provided that the regulatory authority shall inspect each abandoned site at a rate of no less than one complete inspection per calendar year. This minimum inspection frequency is being retained under this final rule. However, the language has been revised to provide that the regulatory authority shall inspect each abandoned site on a set frequency commensurate with the public health and safety and environmental considerations present at each specific site, but in no case shall the inspection frequency be set at less than one complete inspection per calendar year. This revised language emphasizes the requirement that the regulatory authority must tailor an appropriate frequency to the site-specific conditions that exist at each mine. That frequency could vary from one to twelve or more per calendar year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most commenters supported a reduced inspection frequency for abandoned sites and commended OSM for taking the initiative on this rulemaking. Eight SRAs voiced strong support for the rule. One SRA stated that, based on its long history of regulating coal mining operations, it supported OSM's conclusions that fewer inspections of certain abandoned sites would not harm the environment; the States' finite resources could be used more effectively; all significant violations are cited prior to abandonment; and that abandoned sites often remain stable over the course of several years. Another SRA stated that its inspection staff is being required to inspect abandoned sites regularly under circumstances that serve absolutely no purpose other than to meet an arbitrary inspection mandate and that eliminating or curtailing redundant inspections will greatly improve the efficiency of its inspection staff. A third SRA said that in these days of increasingly restrictive State and Federal budgets, it is imperative that our resources are effectively allocated to further the purposes of the Act and that the time spent inspecting abandoned sites detracts from the time that can be spent to ensure compliance at non-abandoned sites. Finally, a fourth SRA maintained that the States continue to be best suited and capable of deciding the appropriate frequency for inspection of abandoned sites where all other enforcement measures have failed to force compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

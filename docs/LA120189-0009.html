			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD A GRAND SETTLEMENT -- NOW;  </P> <P> EUROPE: AMERICA CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE THE CHIEF ARCHITECT OF A NEW SECURITY  SYSTEM FOR THE CONTINENT, BUT IT MUST DO MORE THAN REACT.  </P> <P> After 45 years, the opportunity is now at hand to write a peace treaty to bring  World War II to an end.  </P> <P> The Warsaw Pact has collapsed. Mikhail Gorbachev has given a clear signal to  the regimes of Eastern Europe that Soviet tanks will not save them. The  collapse of communist rule throughout the Soviet European security shield, so  long feared in the West as the spark that could start World War III, has  finally prompted the United States to downgrade the military threat in Europe.  </P> <P> This extraordinary moment makes a political settlement in Europe both possible  and urgent.  </P> <P> President Bush has been attacked for the limp rhetoric with which he has  greeted mamy of the changes in Eastern Europe. What is needed, however, is not  grandstanding at the Brandenburg Gate. It is a set of clearly articulated U.S.  goals and strategies for a world undergoing dizzying transformation.  Administration officials fear that an active rather than a reactive foreign  policy increases the risk of costly mistakes. But the failure to push a new  security arrangement in Europe when one is so clearly needed is much more  risky.  </P> <P> The unprecedented conjunction of forces and events offers not only the chance  to write an end to a long, sad chapter of human history; it also imposes an  obligation to put into place the pillars of a new international system to take  the place of the one created by American initiatives 40 years ago. The changes  are so great and they are coming so fast that nothing short of the grand  settlement envisaged by Winston Churchill in the 1950s offers the hope of a  stable security arrangement.  </P> <P> Unlike the 1940s situation, the United States is not in control of the action.  Two weeks ago the European Community held a summit to plan reactions to the  drama unfolding in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev is busily establishing new  relationships with the other players in the West, and it should not be assumed  that these relationships depend on his personal survival. This country cannot  and should not be the chief architect of the new European security system, but  it must do more than react.  </P> <P> The United States, like all the other players, is unprepared. There are file  drawers of contingency plans in the Pentagon for fighting all sorts of wars  that can never be fought, but the White House clearly had no contingency plans  for a Cold War victory.  </P> <P> Suddenly there is talk of cutting more than $180 billion from the defense  budget over the next few years and accelerating the pace of troop reductions in  Europe. But there are no plans for easing the conversion of military production  to peaceful purposes, or for using a desperately needed peace dividend to  address the underlying causes of America's deepening domestic problems. It has  been more than a year since George Bush was elected, but his Bush  Administration has not yet articulated either a set of post-Cold War goals or a  strategy for achieving them. In the grip of unshakable Cold War assumptions  about the limits of change under communism, the Administration has been  displaying astonishment and calling it prudence.  </P> <P> The German Problem is now ripe for solution. But the only one that can work is  to encourage a political process leading to greater German unity within a  progressively more united Europe. The United States can neither prevent  reunification nor orchestrate the range of possible new relationships between  the Germanys. But it can put its authority as a World War II victor and its  still-considerable weight in world affairs behind flexible security plans that  will give the two Germanys time to evolve a new relationship without  precipitating severe economic crisis.  </P> <P> The great contribution the United States can make is to push much faster for a  radical reduction of military forces across the Continent. Peace can be built  only on a NATO-Warsaw Pact consensus that, for the first time in 55 years,  Europe faces no danger of war. Especially now, none of the nations on either  side of the line can afford the charade of endless, mindless war preparation.  </P> <P> This is not the time for grudging cutbacks in the military budget but for  fundamental rethinking concerning the goals and missions of U.S. military  forces in a world where the threat of war in Europe is no longer credible and  the costly maintenance of military forces to fight communism around the world,  most of which we dare not use, has become the modern day Maginot Line.  </P></p>

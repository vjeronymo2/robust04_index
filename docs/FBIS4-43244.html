			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "D.Gd.": "Defense Budget Likely To Be Cut By </F> 2.5 Billion Francs"]    [Text] Not so long ago, Defense Minister Leotard thought it  appropriate to confirm that the government had resolutely  decided to break "with the habit" of the Socialists "to  systematically amputate the Armed Forces' arms budget." He will  have to reconsider this statement. His 1994 budget, which was  already cut by 630 million francs [Fr] in March, may be reduced  by another Fr2.5 billion. In a statement to the Assembly's  Finance Commission, Budget Minister Nicolas Sarkozy announced  that this amount would be frozen. Jacques Boyon, the RPR [Rally  for the Republic] chairman of the defense committee, was quite  upset about this yesterday and wrote a letter to [Prime  Minister] Eduard Balladur seeking "guarantees for the gradual  release of these frozen funds so that deadlines with regard to  weapons programs can be adhered to." If the Fr2.5 billion cut  is approved, which is highly probable, it will come from the  Armed Forces arms budget. The issue comes at an inconvenient  moment for Francois Leotard, who is defending the 1995-2000  Military Programming Law before the Senate today. This law  provides for an annual 0.5-percent budget increase, which is an  exception, in theory and in the name of the national defense  effort, to the five-year law on the limiting public spending.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUBS BLOWN A BIT OFF COURSE IN LOSS TO PHILLIES  </P> <P> There is one thing for certain when the wind is blowing out at Wrigley Field:  Runs will be scored in bunches.  </P> <P> With a big breeze Wednesday at Chicago, neither starting pitcher made it  through the third inning and the Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies were tied, 7-7,  after four.  </P> <P> In a game featuring 36 hits and 11 pitchers, the Phillies slowed the Cubs'  drive to the National League East title with a 9-8 victory.  </P> <P> With the St. Louis Cardinals defeating the New York Mets, 5-3, the Cubs' lead  over the Cardinals was cut to three games.  </P> <P> Von Hayes drove in four runs for the Phillies and Ricky Jordan singled home the  tie-breaking run in the sixth inning. It was similar to an Aug. 10 game, again  in high wind, when the Phillies outlasted the Cubs, 16-13.  </P> <P> Manager Don Zimmer was so upset he held a 30-minute clubhouse meeting. Although  he refused to talk about the meeting, Zimmer said he was concerned because his  pitchers have been giving up too many runs.  </P> <P> Zimmer seems to be getting a little testy. "Can't I hold a meeting without the  whole world knowing about it?" he asked. "I'm not saying one word about it."  </P> <P> Don Carman, a 15-game loser as a starter, gave up three hits and three walks,  but no runs in 2 2/3 innings to get his fifth victory.  </P> <P> The wind wasn't blowing directly out, it seemed to be merely blowing the ball  away from fielders. Hayes hit the only home run, his 24th of the season.  </P> <P> Philadelphia rookie Pat Combs pitched well in two previous outings under normal  conditions, but allowed four runs and nine hits in 2 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Rick Sutcliffe of the Cubs, seeking his 16th victory, gave up six hits and four  runs in 1 2/3 innings.  </P> <P> Ryne Sandberg drove in a run with his fourth hit of the game to get the Cubs  close in the ninth. With runners on first and second, Roger McDowell got Mark  Grace to bounce into a double play.  </P> <P> Darren Daulton of the Phillies went five for five and did not score a run or  drive one in.

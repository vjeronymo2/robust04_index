			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / South African President de Klerk arrives in London South African President FW de Klerk (centre) arriving at the South African Embassy in London yesterday. Mr de Klerk met his country's rugby team at the embassy but refused to become embroiled in the row over national anthems at the South Africa v England match. Anti-apartheid campaigners had threatened a series of protests during the visit, but were notable by their absence. Last night at a dinner of the South Africa Club at the Savoy Hotel he said South Africa was well on the way to a negotiated settlement, but warned that the process was 'lengthy, delicate and difficult' and did not lend itself to 'simplistic analyses or rigid timetables'. Mr de Klerk said the African National Congress and other parties had accepted the necessity for power-sharing during a transitional period, but serious consideration was being given to 'a much longer-term acceptance of this principle'. Earlier Mr de Klerk had a meeting in the Commons with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. This morning he is meeting Mr Major in Downing Street before going on to the Twickenham match.</p>

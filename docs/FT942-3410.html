			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Clarke set to impose more spending cuts Mr Kenneth Clarke will today warn cabinet colleagues in charge of Whitehall's big spending departments to expect a further round of cuts in their budgets. His stance will foreshadow the third consecutive year of tight public-sector pay restraint and the possibility of a new batch of measures to curb the Pounds 85bn social security budget. Amid calls from the Tory right for an early government commitment to tax cuts, the chancellor is preparing to use his speech at the Mansion House to tighten the framework for this summer's spending round. The main thrust of his annual speech to bankers will seek to underline the government's seriousness about sticking to its medium-term inflation target. The Treasury wants to dispel any idea in the financial markets that recent differences in emphasis between Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, might represent a softening in the government's resolve. In spite of calls from rightwing cabinet ministers for early tax cuts, the Treasury is dismissing suggestions it might abandon the second stage of the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. But Mr Clarke is keen to impress on cabinet colleagues that the overall spending figures which were set out in his Budget last November represented 'ceilings' rather than targets for the government's spending. The Treasury set a global Whitehall figure of Pounds 263bn for 1995-96 and Pounds 272bn for 1996-97, representing increases in real terms of less than 1 per cent each year. But Mr Clarke believes the improved inflation outlook since last autumn allows for a further reduction in the cash figures and the establishment of a still tougher target for 1997-98. The cabinet's EDX spending committee is due to report to the full cabinet next week. The Treasury wants that meeting to endorse its strategy of a tighter squeeze. But ministers close to EDX said that because of higher-than-predicted increases in 'demand-led' expenditure in areas such as social security and education, cash reductions will be required in other departmental budgets. Some ministers want Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, to take fresh action to contain his budget, with tighter limits on the growth in housing benefits and curbs on mortgage interest payments for the unemployed. Others are voicing frustration at the Treasury's unwillingness to ease the pressure on spending by relaxing the present constraints on private-sector involvement in public-sector projects.</p>

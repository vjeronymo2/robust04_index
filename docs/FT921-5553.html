			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / International Company News: Steinhardt in Dollars 587m bid for Integrated Resources STEINHARDT Managers, the New York-based investment company, yesterday announced that it had made a Dollars 587m cash bid for Integrated Resources, the troubled financial services company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Steinhardt bid matches a similar offer for Integrated from the Pritzker family of Chicago, whose holdings include the Hyatt Hotel chain. The new offer comes a few weeks after Bankers Trust, the US banking group, pulled out of a deal to acquire Integrated for Dollars 565m, reported to be because negotiators could not agree on the terms of the liabilities the bank would have assumed under the takeover. Steinhardt said its bid was submitted on behalf of the company and 'affiliated entities' last week. It would not comment on the details of the offer, but said it expected its proposal to be subject to significant negotiations and modifications. Any acquisition of Integrated would have to be approved by the bankruptcy court and creditors as part of a reorganisation plan that brings the company out of Chapter 11. Integrated, which specialised in syndicating property tax shelter partnerships, went bankrupt in February 1990 with liabilities of at least Dollars 1.5bn. Since then, the company has been talking with a number of potential bidders while attempting to formulate a reorganisation plan. Steinhardt Partners is an investment and fund management firm run by the New York money manager Mr Michael Steinhardt. The company was in the news last year after it was discovered that Steinhardt was one of the customers which, along with securities house Salomon Brothers, acquired more than 90 per cent of a May 1991 auction of government securities. Government authorities are investigating whether there was any collusion between Salomon and its customers to corner the market in the May issue. Some market participants claimed they lost millions of dollars because of Salomon's dominance of the two-year note issue, and their complaints eventually led to the discovery of illegal bidding by Salomon's bond trading desk in previous auctions. The investigation, however, has so far uncovered no evidence of such collusion, and Steinhardt Partners has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Motoring: Get a grip on tired tyres ONE CAR tyre in three is worn beyond the point of illegality before it is replaced. Another 40 per cent are changed only when they have worn right down to the limit. Tom Farmer, chief executive of the Kwik-Fit chain of specialist tyre dealers, finds this 'horrifying'. The official view, as expressed by Kenneth Carlisle, Roads and Traffic Minister, is more relaxed. He sees the figures - revealed by a nationwide survey - as 'showing that, on average, tyres are being changed when they reach the legal limit . . . and confirming that the public has understood the recent change in the law.' According to another recent survey, many drivers do not know the urban speed limit is 30 mph and the motorway limit 70 mph. So what chance is there of their being aware that to be legal, a tyre must have at least 1.6 mm of tread pattern remaining in a continuous band covering at least 75 per cent of the width of the tread? It seems that tyre neglect will always be with us. Yet another survey (the public opinion pollsters must be immune from the recession) suggests that road hauliers, though always moaning about rising costs, throw away Pounds 80m a year in premature wear caused by abuse and neglect of lorry tyres. Nothing is more essential to safe driving than a good set of tyres. But mention tyre care to most motorists and their eyes glaze over. Tell them that four new ones for their sporty, 130 mph (210 kph) family saloon will be over Pounds 500 and they mutter highway robbery. Even though the elaborate in-car entertainment system they selected cost far more. Today's steel belted radial tyre is long lasting (and long suffering) as well as life saving. Even better ones are starting to appear on new cars and in specialist dealerships or are waiting in the wings. For example, at Geneva Show earlier this month, Michelin unveiled a futuristic tyre called Anhinga on the Renault Racoon, a concept for an amphibious, go-anywhere leisure vehicle. The fat, low pressure Anhinga's tread pattern looks like animal hoofprints. It blends with the terrain it runs over and does less surface damage than a normal off-road tyre. Michelin made it of green rubber to show it is environmentally friendly. Very low rolling resistance Michelin tyres are helping the latest Citroen AX diesel to be the world's most economical production car. Over 65 mpg (4.35 l/100 km) is possible in normal use yet it remains agreeably driveable. For years, the tyre industry has been trying to defeat the curse of the wide, ultra-low profile tyre aquaplaning in heavy rain. A bright idea, by Swiss inventor Jerry Juhan, was to replace one big, fat tyre with two very narrow ones, mounted side by side on a special wheel. Instead of surface water building up dangerously, as it might under a very squat tyre's footprint, it flowed through the gap between the two skinny tyres. Narrow tyres do not aquaplane. The Juhan twin-tyre concept beat that particular bogey. But there were problems as well as benefits in having twin tyres. Goodyear and Continental use the same aquaplane-defeating centre channel on their Aqua-Tread and Aqua-Contact tyres. But they are conventional ultra-low profile types with a deep grove moulded in the centre of their tread. Michelin has taken the idea a stage further. At Geneva Show it displayed Catamaran, a prototype tyre for super cars like Ferraris. It looks much the same as its Goodyear or Continental rivals but is made more like two separate tyres, though still sharing the same air chamber. A thick reinforcing cable buried in the bottom of the groove ensures its depth - and water clearing capacity - stays constant as the twin treads wear away. Like so many tyre innovations, Catamaran is not brand-new. Michelin patented the design in 1972. If 21 years seems a long time between concept and reality, consider the radial ply tyre. Two Englishmen, Grey and Sloper, patented it in the reign of King Edward VII. But it was another 40 years before a Citroen Six became the first car to run on radials (Michelin X) in 1949.</p>

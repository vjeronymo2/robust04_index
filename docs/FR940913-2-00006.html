			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No significant adverse environmental impacts will result from installations, with the exception of minor inconveniences to local residents during construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The measure plan consisted of three alternatives, the no action plan, construction of 4 miles of channels, and the removal of all residents from the flood area. Alternative 2, the construction and modification of the channels, was chosen as the best economical and cost effective solution. Alternative No. 2 has been modified three times to avoid possible endangered species habitat and wetlands at the request of those agencies involved in the comment processes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Consultation_Public Participation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Formal agency consultation began with the initiation of the notification of the State Single Point of Contact for Federal Assistance in April 1992. Agencies were again notified when planning was authorized in August 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scoping meetings were conducted with SCS staff and included representatives from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, and South Carolina Coastal Council. Meetings were held during April 1992, September 1992, June 1993, and September 1993. Planning involved all agencies identified and included county government and landowners within the project area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific consultation was conducted with the state Historic Preservation officer and residents within the watershed as to cultural and historical resources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The measure plan was transmitted to all participating and interested agencies, groups, and individuals for review and comments in January 1994. Public meeting with landowners and sponsors were held throughout the planning process to keep all interested parties informed of the study progress and to obtain public input to the measure plan and environmental evaluation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency consultation and public participation to date has shown no unresolved conflicts with the implementation of the selected plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Environmental Assessment summarized above indicates that this Federal action will not cause significant local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. Therefore based on the above findings, I have determined that an environmental impact statement for the Burgess Community Flood Prevention Measure is not required. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jose J.

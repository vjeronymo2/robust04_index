			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Pressac close to important order in US PRESSAC Holdings yesterday announced a 6 per cent rise in annual profits and said it was 'reasonably close' to winning a breakthrough order from a Japanese car manufacturer in the US for its instrument cluster circuit boards. The Nottingham-based manufacturer of automotive, telecommunications and lighting products lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.84m to Pounds 1.95m in the year ended July 31, after an exceptional charge of Pounds 147,000 (Pounds 177,000) relating to redundancies. This was despite a slight fall in turnover from Pounds 33.7m to Pounds 33m. Earnings per share rose from 4.7p to 4.86p. The final dividend is increased 10 per cent to 1.82p, making a total of 2.57p (2.4p) for the year. Mr Roger Boissier, chairman, said increased demand for cars in the UK had been more than negated by a severe decline in the rest of Europe. Excepting telecommunications and specialist engineering, demand fell during the year. Pressac has spent more than Pounds 10.3m over the past three years to improve its production facilities, which increased efficiency and helped improve market share. Mr Geoff White, chief executive, said it had also helped the company win new business. The completion of the instrument cluster circuitry plant in Alabama would allow the company to penetrate the important Japanese transplant market in the US. Pressac was also looking to expand its recently-acquired automotive heated mirror business, especially in the US.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LEAVE THEM OUT OF IT  </P> <P> In response to "Ex-Navy Trainer Attacks U.S. Use of Sea Animals" (Nov. 13):  </P> <P> I find David Reames' position that he is "concerned about human beings" quite  ironic.  </P> <P> Reames argues that the use of marine mammals endangers the lives of human  soldiers because of the animals' unreliability and, therefore, the mammals  should not be used in military combat.  </P> <P> Yet, what about the endangered lives of the marine mammals?  </P> <P> The sea animals are trained to please the trainer and are unaware of the  potentially destructive task they are performing, and could easily make a  mistake and not realize the seriousness of their actions. As one protester's  placard stated, "How can dolphins know friends from foe?"  </P> <P> Man should fight his own battles and leave the innocent creatures out of it!  </P> <P> CYNTHIA M. KELLNER, La Jolla  </P></p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Days of making hay are over: Unilever must cut costs or increase prices if profit margins are to stay ahead of the pack If the stock market is a guide, Unilever is in trouble. Back at the start of April, the US tobacco company Philip Morris slashed the price of Marlboro cigarettes. Unilever's shares fell sharply. Two weeks ago they fell again, when the detergent maker Procter &amp; Gamble said it was closing a fifth of its factories. For the stock market, the two announcements meant one thing: consumer brands are losing value in the penny-pinching 1990s. Unilever, a giant in the world of food, detergents and toiletries, is the brand manufacturer par excellence. Thus, since the Marlboro news broke, its own value has fallen by a fifth. Round at Unilever's monumentally imposing London headquarters, these arguments are stoutly rejected. Take the two events in context, the company says. The Marlboro affair is irrelevant: the price of the brand stood a phenomenal 70 per cent above the own-label competition. None of Unilever's brands carries remotely that kind of premium. As for Procter &amp; Gamble, which is a direct competitor, Unilever admits a touch of surprise at the scale of the closures. But the process itself, Unilever insists, is not surprising in the least. The industry has been restructuring since the late 1980s, and will do so for the foreseeable future. Unilever itself has spent almost Pounds 600m on closing and relocating production over the past five years. If anything, Procter &amp; Gamble is catching up with the pack. And, above all, says Unilever, look at the factors which underlie the two events: recession, increasing competition, the concentration of the retail trade and the rise of own-label goods. None of these is new. The basic value of brands remains unchanged. So far, Unilever is ahead on points. But the stock market could still be right for the wrong reasons. The fundamental issue is one of profit margins; and leaving aside brands versus own-label, margins could still be under threat. The crucial importance of margins to Unilever is illustrated by one simple fact. Over the past decade, its sales measured in dollars have doubled. So has the world's nominal GDP. In other words, as a supplier of basic goods for eating and washing, Unilever grows in line with the world in which it operates. If it wants to beat the average in profit terms, it must raise its real prices or cut its costs. In recent years, it has done the latter. Since the late 1980s, the company says, it has been able to raise its prices by only between two thirds and three quarters of the inflation rate across the countries in which it sells. But thanks to that Pounds 600m spent on reorganisation - plus a steadily rising bill for research and development, much of it directed at cheaper manufacturing processes - costs have fallen faster than real prices. As a result, though sales have only doubled, net profits have tripled; and as the company proudly observes, its net margins now are the same as its operating margins were a decade ago. But this is to make it sound too easy. What Unilever has in fact managed to do since the mid-1980s is hold on to most of the benefits of its improved productivity, rather than passing them on to the consumer. In the same period, Procter &amp; Gamble has done the same: its operating margins rose from 9.9 per cent in 1985 to a peak of 13.5 per cent in 1991. Comparison with other industries suggests life is not always so simple. In consumer electronics, the increases in productivity put Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble to shame. As the electronics manufacturers are fond of remarking, if their achievements in the past 20 years were matched by the car industry, a Rolls-Royce would now cost as much as a bicycle. But fast though costs have fallen, prices have fallen faster. The world's makers of TV sets, for instance, have collectively lost money for years. If Unilever made hay in the late 1980s, it was not always so. As the chart shows, until 1985 its margins moved closely in line with the world economic cycle. Year by year, if world growth accelerated, Unilever's margins rose. If growth slowed, margins fell. Intuitively, this is not hard to account for. Unilever is continuously sparring with its rivals in hundreds of product markets across the world. In a year when the consumer is feeling affluent and volume is rising, a price rise is likely to be followed by the competition. In a bad year it will be challenged and undermined. In the latter half of the 1980s that relationship seemed to break down. Whether the world economy slowed or accelerated, Unilever's margins - and its share price - kept rising to new heights. The company today is in no doubt about the reason. It is all down to the skill and persistence of management. The actions taken come under two headings. First, Unilever's tradition used to be one of vertical integration: 'from the palm tree to the soap-kettle', as the founder William Lever put it. The result was an immense sprawl of businesses. 'It is easy to forget,' Unilever's chairman Michael Perry told analysts last month, 'how diverse our activities were only 10 years ago. We were in transport, distribution, market research, advertising, fishing, printing, plastics and packaging  - you name it, Unilever had tried it.' In the early 1980s, most of those businesses - accounting for nearly a quarter of group sales - were sold off. This was not only an exercise in the now fashionable doctrine of business focus. It also had the mechanical effect of improving group margins, since most of the businesses sold were low-margin by nature. Beyond that, Unilever argues that it achieved a once-and-for-all margin improvement in the businesses it retained. This came from the physical relocation of production, the development of cheaper production methods and the more efficient deployment of a massive advertising and marketing budget. This process, the company insists, has further to run. In particular, the huge rationalisation of production undertaken at the start of the 1990s in preparation for the European single market has yet to work fully through to profits. Against all that, old hands in the stock market have a familiar and maddening answer: once a cyclical, always a cyclical. It is in the nature of business managers to be optimists, and to believe when times are good that the cycle has been abolished. In the late 1980s the managers of Imperial Chemical Industries - like Unilever, enjoying the fattest margins they had ever seen - were honestly convinced that they had protected themselves against the next economic downturn. Last year, they made a net loss of almost Pounds 1bn. Nothing so grievous will happen to Unilever. But as the company freely concedes, the improvements in productivity and efficiency on which it prides itself have been largely matched by its competitors. It is therefore hard to escape the conclusion that its profitability remains in the hands of its customers. The company appeals to history to demonstrate that the death of brands has been exaggerated. History equally suggests that in the cost-conscious 1990s, the margins of the free-wheeling 1980s cannot be sustained.</p>

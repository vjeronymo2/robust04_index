			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Mickey Mouse awaits Discovery Mountain - Euro Disney Euro Disney is expected to report continuing heavy losses when it publishes its results for the year to September 30 on Thursday. Some analysts have predicted losses of more than FFr1.6bn (Pounds 191m), down from losses of FFr5.3bn last year as the theme park continues to cope with its start-up costs. The results will be the first since the park arranged a FFr13bn restructuring with its banks in June. Mr Philippe Bourgignon, chairman, believes the results this year must be put in the perspective of the restructuring and will give little idea of its future likelihood of success. He recently stressed that the park was still on target to break even by the end of the 1996 financial year, and that creditor banks were content with its performance. Analysts and shareholders, however, will be closely examining many aspects of the results, and above all the attendance figures, which showed a downward decline in visitors to 9m last year from 9.8m the year before. They will also scrutinise changes to the levels of expenditure by visitors to the park, and the impact of changes to the tariffs at hotels and restaurants. The company is pinning its hopes on approaches including changes in management, a new marketing strategy and the opening next year of Discovery Mountain, its latest attraction.</p>

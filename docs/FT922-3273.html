			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Leading Article: A case for police investigation A SYSTEM of grants and expenditure controls which fails to encourage the efficient management of resources. Blurred lines of accountability. A mismatch between financial and management responsibilities. The Audit Commission's charge list offers ample justification for Mr Kenneth Clarke's two reviews into the UK police, the second of which was announced on Wednesday when the Home Secretary addressed the chief police officers' conference. As with other managerial reforms of public services, the driving force behind the government's reviews will be economy and efficiency. The cost of policing, which has risen almost 75 per cent in real terms since 1979, will be a target for the Treasury in a tough public expenditure round. But the issue of effectiveness is also central for a government which claims law and order as its strong suit. Money has been poured into police manpower, pay, support services and equipment in the 1980s. Yet levels of recorded crime have doubled while the proportion cleared up has fallen. Worse, public confidence in the police has declined, partly because of well-publicised miscarriages of justice, partly because the service is not seen as user-friendly. Without a relationship of trust, the flow of information from the public dries up, depriving the police of a vital resource in preventing crime and catching criminals. In seeking to tackle these issues, Mr Clarke is pushing at a door which, if not wide open, is at least ajar. Many senior police officers have recognised the failings of the old ways and the need to rebuild public trust. Greater flexibility in staffing and working patterns are being introduced. The most go-ahead forces (now restyled police services) have adopted devolution of management, policing by objectives and customer service initiatives well in advance of the Citizen's Charter. Though they have yet to make an impact on crime levels, there is evidence that these steps have begun to restore confidence in the police. However, intractable issues remain to be tackled by the Home Secretary's reviews. The rank-based career structure has produced top-heavy management, in which the best police officers are encouraged to become administrators. Perverse incentives built into the financing system encourage the recruitment of extra officers but discourage the substitution of cheaper civilians where they can do the same job. And there is a real problem of accountability in the present structure with many police forces accountable either to joint boards or - in the case of the Metropolitan Police - only to the Home Secretary. If the Local Government Commission creates unitary local authorities based on smaller districts rather than larger counties, the link between police authorities and elected local politicians will be further attenuated. Mr Clarke is well-placed to deal with such challenges. He has already pushed through far-reaching reforms of the health and education services, in the teeth of opposition from the professionals. In this instance, he has attempted to carry along the police, with skilful speeches to the annual conferences of the chief officers and the rank and file. Their co-operation will be essential to the success of the solutions which his reviews devise, and he is wise to take steps to keep them onside.</p>

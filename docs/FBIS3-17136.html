			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By BELINFORM-TASS correspondents Vladimir Glod and Leonid </F> Tratsevskiy]    [Text] Minsk March 23 TASS -- Official talks between the  defence ministers of the United States and the Belarus Republic  began here today. The U.S. secretary of defence arrived in the  Belarus capital today. His negotiations with Colonel-General  Pavel Kazlowski are proceeding behind closed doors.    "One of the main subjects that will be discussed during the  meeting is American aid to solve Belarusian conversion  problems," First Deputy Defence Minister of the Belarus Republic  Aleksandr Tushinskiy told BELINFORM. Tushinskiy is a prominent  electronics specialist and first civilian appointed to the  leadership of the republic's Defence Ministry. He is charged  with the task of switching the defence industry to civilian  rails.    Tushinskiy said that Perry is expected to announce some  Belarus- American conversion programmes, covering such  Belarusian defence enterprises as "Belomo" and "Intergral." As  a result of a tough contest carried out in the United States,  several American partner firms have been selected for them,  whose technologies, know-how and other parameters coincide with  those of the Minsk plants. "During the American secretary's  visit," Tushinskiy said, "we expect to sign a joint statement on  the principles that will underlie the work of the  Belarus-American conversion committee. An organisational  meeting of this body will also be held."    Tushinskiy stressed that this committee was set up as a  result of previous Belarus-American meetings at top level and  after repeated consultations between expert delegations of the  two countries.    The final results of the talks will become known today  afternoon during a press conference that will be held here  jointly by the U.S. secretary of defence and the Belarus defence  minister.</p>

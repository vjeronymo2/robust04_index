			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dr. Jorge Valentim, spokesman for the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating team,  said in Lusaka yesterday that the talks were continuing at the  right pace, contrary to what has been reported. Dr. Valentim  once again reiterated UNITA's willingness to reach a peace  agreement with the Luanda government. The proof that the  negotiations are continuing is that the two sides are discussing  holding the second round of presidential elections.    [Begin Valentim recording] I would like to assure the  Angolan  and international communities that the talks are continuing.  They are not on the verge of collapse. There is no impasse.  We are dealing with an extremely delicate issue relating to the  final point of the national reconciliation agenda. This has  forced us to make an in-depth assessment of the situation, like  a submarine underwater, without much publicity. So, an in-depth  work is under way. We are dealing with the second round of  presidential elections. The issue was raised at a plenary  session in which the two sides met face to face. It was a very  positive meeting. The talks are continuing with the mediator.  Today we had a very fruitful session with the mediator, lasting  for hours. There is hope. A great deal of patience is required  to hold a very frank debate. That is what we are doing right  now, not undiplomatically, but in the interest of Angola. [end  recording]</p>

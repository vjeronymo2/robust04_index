The 70-year-old ayatollah was first  taken to the late Grand Ayatollah Golpayegani Hospital in the  holy city of Qom after complaining of chest pain and headache  during a visit to Mofid University in the city Tuesday night.  Mas'ud Musavi, the son of the former chief justice, said that  his father's left arm and leg have been paralyzed as a result of  apoplexy.    The doctors treating Ayatollah Ardebili at Tehran's Khatem  ol- Anbia hospital, where the ayatollah was later taken, said  they expect the ayatollah to fully recover in a week.    Talking to reporters, Ayatollah Musavi-Ardebili said he was  feeling well. Ayatollah Ardebili, also a substitute Friday  prayer leader of Tehran, is the founder and chancellor of Mofid  University. He also teaches at the Qom theological school.    It is the second time the ayatollah has suffered a stroke.  He first fell ill nearly two years ago. Since the victory of  the 1979 Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ardebili has served as a  member of the Revolutionary Council, prosecutor general, head of  the High Judicial Council and chief justice.</p>

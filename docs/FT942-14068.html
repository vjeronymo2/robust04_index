			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets correct in first quarter Emerging markets in general suffered sharp corrections in the first quarter, according to research published this week by Kleiman International. The US-based independent group, which analyses emerging banking and securities markets, comments that most of the markets fell back on profit-taking and as a consequence of interest rate and equity market turbulence in the developed world. 'Of the 62 markets tracked from January to March 1994, global interest rate and equity turbulence affected the more mature emerging markets, while double digit advances remained the norm on lesser known exchanges, notably in central Europe, the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa.' The picture was not altogether negative on the larger exchanges - Colombia, Zimbabwe, Brazil and Portugal all picked up gains in dollar terms of between 46 to 18 per cent. But some of the strongest rises came from the more exotic markets, such as Morocco, up 17.5 per cent, and Tunisia, up 18 per cent in local currency terms, while the Cyprus over-the-counter market, according to Kleiman's, climbed 13.7 per cent. Baring Securities remarks that the flow of funds into emerging markets totalled Dollars 52m in 1993, some 15 times greater than the 1986 level. US buyers remained the heaviest purchasers, taking 40 per cent of the total.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------        EMERGING MARKETS: IFC WEEKLY INVESTABLE PRICE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Dollar terms                       No. of       Apr 15     % Change     % Change Market                stocks        1994      over week    on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America         (210)        590.13       -4.9         -9.3 Argentina              (25)        859.21       -1.8        -13.6 Brazil                 (57)        261.22      -13.3        +12.2 Chile                  (25)        594.28       +2.0         +7.7 Colombia 1             (11)        915.84       -2.3        +42.1 Mexico                 (69)        803.48       -1.9        -19.7 Peru 2                 (11)        133.41       -3.8        +10.3 Venezuela 3            (12)        673.03       -2.1        +13.7 Asia                  (558)        239.74       +5.8        -17.6 China 4                (18)        101.91       +2.1        -31.7 South Korea 5         (156)        120.79       +1.8         +2.2 Philippines            (18)        261.25       +4.1        -23.3 Taiwan, China 6        (90)        125.30       +1.6         -7.3 India 7                (76)        129.57       -0.2        +11.2 Indonesia 8            (37)         95.33       +4.0        -23.5 Malaysia              (105)        266.94       +8.0        -21.3 Pakistan 9             (15)        403.55       +0.8         +4.0 Sri Lanka 10            (5)        194.93       +0.3        +10.0 Thailand               (55)        361.75       +6.3        -24.3 Euro/Mid East         (125)        113.37       -0.9        -33.0 Greece                 (25)        238.08       -1.6         +4.6 Hungary 11              (5)        212.68       -5.6        +27.6 Jordan                 (13)        164.75       -2.3         -0.5 Poland 12              (12)        617.90      -24.3        -24.5 Portugal               (25)        129.42       -1.3        +13.7 Turkey 13              (40)         96.69       +4.7        -54.5 Zimbabwe 14             (5)        229.53       +2.1        +13.6 Composite             (892)        302.59       -0.0        -14.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Local currency terms                                 Apr 15     % Change     % Change                                  1994     over week    on Dec '93  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Latin America Argentina                    527,326.46      -1.8        -13.6 Brazil                    392,704,317.8      -4.6       +286.4 Chile                          1,004.69      +1.3         +5.4 Colombia 1                     1,343.00      -1.9        +44.9 Mexico                         1,166.85      -1.9        -13.0 Peru 2                           177.84      -3.6        +11.8 Venezuela 3                    1,783.90      -1.3        +25.5 Asia China 4                          111.99      +2.1        -31.8 South Korea 5                    128.46      +1.8         +2.4 Philippines                      344.17      +4.8        -22.5 Taiwan, China 6                  124.09      +1.6         -7.3 India 7                          143.28      -0.2        +11.2 Indonesia 8                      111.71      +4.2        -21.5 Malaysia                         264.75      +8.0        -21.4 Pakistan 9                       558.04      +1.0         +5.7 Sri Lanka 10                     208.16      +0.2         +9.0 Thailand                         363.55      +6.4        -24.8 Euro/Mid East Greece                           404.78      -1.8         +5.3 Hungary 11                       265.18      -4.8        +31.3 Jordan                           239.62      -1.9         +0.1 Poland 12                        878.37     -24.1        -20.4 Portugal                         155.66      -0.4        +12.7 Turkey 13                      1,595.97      +9.5         +9.7 Zimbabwe 14                      277.26      +2.5        +29.8 Composite  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Indices are calculated at end-week, and weekly changes are percentage movement from the previous Friday.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base date: Dec 1988=100 except those noted which are: (1) Feb 1 1991; (2) Dec 31 1992; (3) Jan 5 1990; (4) Dec 31 1992; (5) Jan 3 1992; (6) Jan 4 1991; (7) Nov 6 1992; (8) Sep 28 1990; (9) Mar 1 1991; (10) Dec 31 1992; (11) Dec 31 1992; (12) Dec 31 1992; (13) Aug 4 1989; (14) July 2 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri by </F> Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not given]    [Text] [Khashanah] With the completion of the formation  of the Transitional National Council [TNC], is it to be hoped  that the democratic process will be revived?    [Dembri] We have undertaken to implement the resolutions of  last January's national conference. We have indeed concentrated  on the transitional institutions. The political dialogue is  still in progress with an open mind and with all parties  including those who have so far refused to participate (in the  institutions). We are very hopeful that the circle of accord  will be enlarged in the coming months.    I should remind you here that the election process has been  programmed for three years from now, but we would revive it even  earlier if the circumstances allowed that.    [Khashanah] There is an urgent U.S. call for dialogue with  the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] and for giving it a share in  government. What do you say to that?    [Dembri] We say that Algeria needs all its sons without  exception. When we declare that we are for an open dialogue,  that means that we do not exclude any political group or  political figure if they accept the fundamental conditions,  especially the republican regime, respect for the opposite  opinion, partisan plurality, respect for the Algerian people's  components and sanctities, and renunciation of violence as a  means of gaining power or remaining in power. I believe that  these conditions should be accepted by those who enter into a  dialogue with us.    [Khashanah] The gap between the U.S. and French positions is  now common knowledge. How do you in Algeria view the two  positions, especially the U.S. call for FIS participation in the  government?    [Dembri] We are now in a transitional stage paving the way  for the resumption of the election process. After that it will  be the people who will freely decide who is to the represent  them in the future. The government's role is to organize this  transitional period.    As regards the dialogue, it is an open dialogue and it  covers  the horizons of the new Algerian society based on the rule of  law, politial plurality, and respect for the components of the  Algerian character. That is important because we in Algeria are  Muslim Arabs. These are basic facts which nobody has a right to  (claim to) monopolize in the political arena, because they apply  to all the Algerians.    It seems to me that there are numerous ways of loving  Algeria  but there is only one Algeria which should be united and uniting.    [Khashanah] Should we expect an early release of FIS leaders  as a step to build trust and pave the way for national  reconciliation?    [Dembri] In a democracy, everything is possible.    [Khashanah] In the government's view, what are the possible  grounds for reconciliation?    [Dembri] There are the resolutions issued by the national  conference. They have now been submitted to the [TNC]....    [Khashanah] But some major forces such as the Liberation  Front [FLN], the Socialist Forces Front [SFF], and the FIS have  boycotted the conference, so how could the latter's resolutions  form common grounds?    [Dembri] The political forces you have mentioned did not  reject the national conference resolutions, they wanted to add  more points. How could they reject a republican regime, for  instance? Nobody rejects that. And how could they object to  political plurality, respect for the opposite opinion, and the  rule of law?    [Khashanah] The government recently announced that it had  destroyed Saeed Mekhlouf's group and dealt a blow to the  fundamentalist groups. Does this mean that the regular forces  have regained the initiative?    [Dembri] I am not acquainted with the security situation.    [Khashanah] How do you interpret the emphatic U.S. call for  a dialogue with FIS and the emphatic French rejection of such a  dialogue?    [Dembri] There are differences of opinion but we Algerians  see ourselves as an Islamic Arab society and at the same time we  adopt all the rules of the modern political game including  respect for the law, individual and collective freedoms, and  human rights.    Algerian society should now discuss everything that would  contribute to its renaissance and chart its future dimensions.  We do not need a classification of the Algerian society that is  done abroad. I believe that Algerian political groups are  intelligent enough and able enough to discuss their own affairs  without foreign interference.    [Khashanah] Do you not believe that the economic agreements,  especially the agreement with the "Paris Club" to reschedule  public debts, would help reduce the deficit and calm the  internal situation?    [Dembri] After our agreement with the IMF and the recent  agreement with the Paris Club and the rescheduling of debts, we  initiated separate bilateral negotiations with each donor state.  The problem we Algerians are facing in this connection is  whether our handling of this file should be political or  strictly technical. The volume of [trade] exchanges between  Algeria and the industrial states confirms clearly that there is  an imbalance there and we have been losing since independence  and to this day.    Between the years 1969 and 1989, that is in 20 years,  Algeria  got from the Western world $1.5 billion net but we paid the  Western states in the same period $2.5-3 billion annually, or  $50 to $60 billion over 20 years. So we ask: Which side  contributed to the other's development, Algeria or the  industrial states? I believe that the third world contributed  to the development of the Western countries.    [Khashanah] The Moroccan press has been criticizing  Algeria's position on the Sahara. Has there been any change in  the Algerian Government's handling of that file?    [Dembri] There is a peace plan drawn up by the United  Nations for the settlement of the Sahara problem. It has been  decided to hold a free and impartial self-determination  referendum as soon as possible. The UN peace plan is actually  derived from the OAU's plan.    We should now tackle the issues which precede the referendum  and pave the way for its success such as the terms for the  definition of identity, the number of voters, the provision of  guarantees after the referendum, and the way of organizing the  election campaign. There are many issues on which understanding  is expected to be reached in direct talks between Morocco and  the Polisario, the two parties to the conflict. Algeria's  position is one favoring success of that plan but if, during the  talks, a possibility emerged of an agreed political solution  between the two parties to the conflict, then that would be up  to them before anyone else. That would then require political  intelligence from all parties.    [Khashanah] Will Algerian-Moroccan relations improve after  the coolness that has recently characterized them?    [Dembri] We do not judge relations by press campaigns which  have no solid basis. Morocco is dear to us. Morocco, Algeria,  Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania have a role to play to strengthen  our presence in this world. That is the main aim. The rest is  secondary.    There is much room for fruitful cooperation and integration  between us. Algeria is working on building a pipeline that  crosses Moroccan territory. Morocco will get a share equal to  30 percent of the gas carried through it to Europe. That proves  Algeria's goodwill.    [Khashanah] What is Algeria doing to reactivate the Arab  Maghreb Union [AMU], having assumed its chairmanship?    [Dembri] There is an extensive plan of action. Everyone  appears to want to launch the Maghreb train. We have seen over  the past years that the political will is ahead of the  bureaucratic executive organs. If we review the results of the  six summit conferences since the formation of the AMU, we would  find that the leaders approved 30 agreements but only five of  these agreements have entered the phase of implementation. That  does not indicate a rejection of the march toward integration  but it does indicate the existence of a gap and the reason for  it is that the political will is ahead of bureaucratic practice,  and that must be remedied.    [Khashanah] President Zeroual recently sent envoys to the  Gulf states. Their arrival there coincided with the escalation  of the war in Yemen. What did the envoys carry?    [Dembri] We always have talks with the Arab brothers on  matters of common interest. On Arab and Islamic causes, Algeria  is always eager to be at the forefront of the states searching  for solutions and expressing absolute solidarity with its  brothers.    There is a tragedy in Yemen and it should be tackled in the  appropriate manner, which is consultation and coordination with  all parties. If the Arabs cannot put their own house in order,  what is left for us in this world?    [Khashanah] There was talk earlier of an Algerian initiative  on behalf of the AMU to stop the war in Yemen. Is that still on?    [Dembri] Yes, it is still on but we have asked the brothers  in Yemen to stop the fighting before anything else. The Yemeni  brothers could then find solutions with their intelligence and  wisdom.    [Khashanah] What is Algeria's position regarding the  declaration of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen"?    [Dembri] Yes, there was such a declaration but will it end  the fighting and will the Yemeni people accept a continuation of  the battles? We first of all call for a cease-fire to spare the  Yemeni people's blood and then we can look for solutions. That  is Algeria's position.</p>

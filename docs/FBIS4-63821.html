The meetings with the  Russian minister are expected to produce above all a  clarification of the prospects for the development of relations  between Russia and NATO, and, consequently, a plan for a future  European security system.    Under a program announced around a month ago, P. Grachev  will  familiarize the heads of the alliance's military departments  with the main provisions of Russia's defense doctrine, including  the issues -- of concern to the West -- of the use of nuclear  weapons, and the place occupied by the former Soviet republics  in Moscow's strategy. But the delay in Russia's planned April  accession to the "Partnership for Peace" program proposed by  NATO leaders, and contradictory statements in Moscow and  Brussels have put this aspect of the visit at the center of  attention.    P. Grachev will set out Russia's corresponding position at a  meeting with the NATO leadership and at a North Atlantic  Cooperation Council (NACC) defense ministers' session 25 May.    Everyone in NATO agrees that a nuclear power with a major  economic and military potential should play a special part in an  international security system. But they do not want to formally  enshrine this in the program's framework document, which has  already been signed by 18 other countries apart from the  alliance members, including eight former USSR republics. The  framework document, NATO leaders say, is a kind of "letter of  intent" that does not carry any obligations. It is planned to  cooperate under an individual program -- that is, on a bilateral  basis. Here too Russia's special status will be established by  itself. But if Russia does not join the program, it will be  hard for it to influence the formation and workings of this  mechanism, and then a new barrier could arise in Europe -- on  the Russian border.    During his official visit to Belgium 26-27 May the Russian  minister will hold talks with his Belgian colleague Leo  Delcroix, who, we have learned, incidentally, was the initiator  of the meeting between the 15 NATO defense ministers and P.  Grachev. The Russian guest will visit a small-arms plant, an  air base, and the Ostend Naval Base, and will fly by helicopter  around Flanders and its ports of Antwerp, Ghent, and Zeebrugge.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Observer: Fuelling debate The hearts of Tory business managers must have been in their mouths yesterday morning on sighting a strongly worded press release from Mid-Staffordshire MP Michael Fabricant condemning the government's VAT on fuel proposals. To date, Fabricant has made his name less for any rebelliousness than for his extraordinary flaxen mane - once memorably described by a sketch writer as resembling 'a Caribbean beach hut wrecked by a tornado'. Yet here he was on the eve of today's vital procedural vote announcing his opposition 'on three grounds' to 17.5 per cent VAT on fuel. If that was the attitude of a stalwart, what were the hard-pressed whips supposed to do? Breathe again. For, provided they read his second page, they discovered that Fabricant will be behind the government tonight - because, his 'argument' goes, Labour's amendment is merely procedural and would not have the effect of keeping VAT on fuel at 8 per cent. If only Tory backbenchers would devote a fraction of such ingenuity to deciding how best to run the country.</p>

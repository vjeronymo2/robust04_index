			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Operatic melodrama: After the traumas of 1992, the new Paris opera house faces a critical year When the curtains swung to a close at the end of Messiaen's St Francis of Assisi at the Opera Bastille in Paris on Tuesday, it marked the end of a traumatic year at France's lavish new opera house. The trouble started this summer when a set collapsed during a touring production of Otello in Seville, killing one singer and injuring 36 others. The tragedy aggravated the tension among the Bastille management. Mr Philippe Belaval resigned as chief executive in August, together with six senior colleagues. Then there was a furore over the new contract of his former foe, Mr Myung-Whun Chung, now one of the highest-paid artistic directors in international opera. The new management is beginning a critical year: it must heal the scars of Seville and establish the Bastille as a centre of excellence in international opera. It may also confront a less sympathetic political climate if, as the opinion polls suggest, the ruling Socialists, who founded the Opera Bastille, lose the March general elections and the right returns to power. The litany of trials and tribulations is very different from the picture painted by President Francois Mitterrand in 1982 when he unfurled his plans for a new 'people's opera'. Paris opera was in the doldrums. The old Opera Garnier was run down. The president envisaged a brand new opera house with cheap seats, state-of-the-art acoustics and magnificent music. The government spent almost FFr3bn (Pounds 365m) to build the 2,700-seat house at place de la Bastille. It is run as part of the Opera de Paris together with the Garnier, now used for dance, and the smaller Opera Comique. It has an annual budget of FFr800m, of which the state provides 65 per cent. President Mitterrand in 1988 appointed Mr Pierre Berge, one of his staunchest supporters and dubbed Pierre le Panthere for his ruthless style in running the Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house, as chairman of Opera de Paris. But the melodrama began even before the Bastille's opening. A string of resignations culminated in early 1989 with that of Mr Daniel Barenboim, the conductor, who stormed out as artistic director after a row with Mr Berge. Mr Chung, then a comparatively obscure Korean conductor, succeeded him. The Opera Bastille opened its first full opera, Les Troyens by Berlioz, in March 1990 to mixed reviews. The reviews have remained mixed ever since. The Bastille is almost always full, with an audience of 392,290 last year. It has also had some success in fulfilling its populist mandate. Almost a third of its audience are first-time opera goers. But it has been haunted by complaints about the building, a lacklustre response from the critics and more management problems. 'I'm French and I'm an opera buff, I want it to work,' said Mr Alain Lompech, opera critic of the daily newspaper, Le Monde. 'But there has only been one production good enough to launch Paris opera on the international arena - Shostakovich's Lady Macbeth, directed by Chung.' One obstacle is the glacial, modernist building, designed by Carlos Ott, which has been criticised on architectural and musical grounds. 'It was a wonderful idea to build a new opera house, but the acoustics are not great and the theatre is a disaster,' said Mr Max Loppert, the FT's opera critic. 'The scale of the stage makes it difficult to put on anything other than the very biggest operas.' The Bastille is now mooting plans for a Petite Salle with 1,100 seats for smaller productions. However, its hopes of securing the state's financial support could be scuppered if the Conservatives win the March elections. Last time the right was in power, in the mid-1980s, it tried to scrap the Bastille project by calling a halt to the building work. A future Conservative government might be less generous to the new opera house than the sympathetic Socialists. Meanwhile, there is little the Bastille can do about its labyrinthine lay-out. 'It's impossible to find your way around,' said Mr Lompech. 'I've been there dozens of times but I'm still so confused that, whenever I leave my seat, I can't find my way back.' The Bastille has also been hounded by the strikes and stoppages that dogged the Garnier. The French government baulked at adding a battle with the opera unions to its other difficulties before the opening, so the new house retains the old union agreements, which have lumbered it with a high wage bill and rigid working practices. The 'people's opera' is also burdened by high prices: tickets range from FFr50 to FFr560, but two-thirds cost more than FFr200. Mr Belaval spent his 20 months as chief executive in intricate negotiations, trying to thrash out a new union agreement. But this summer Mr Berge intervened, and bowed to union pressure by extending the deadline for the negotiations from August to November. Mr Belaval, already fuming after rows with Mr Chung over who was to blame for the Seville disaster, resigned. The November deadline has passed, but the negotiations are still going on. The union problems, combined with frequent management changes - Mr Belaval was the fourth chief executive to resign in as many years - have made it difficult for the Bastille to fulfil its creative potential. Mr Loppert's view is that it has 'not lived up to expectations'. Even Mr Chung admitted to Le Monde this autumn that he was unhappy with the quality of output and that, in three years, he had only been satisfied with one production, Lady Macbeth. The Bastille desperately needs a period of stability to recover from the trauma of the Seville tour. So far only half the injured singers have returned to work. Mr Chung must then get to grips with its music, while the management, under Mr Jean-Paul Cluzel, the new chief executive, tackles the unions. There are some positive signs. Mr Chung's new contract not only increases his financial package - which will rise from FFr3.3m next year to FFr8m at the end of his six-year term - but also considerably extends his power. 'Until now he hasn't really had the chance to be anything other than a good conductor,' said one critic. He now has complete control over programming and artistic policy, and will be consulted on some administrative issues. Mr Cluzel, meanwhile, is a high-flying bureaucrat, who has headed the Socialists' arts administration reforms but who also has the advantage of close contacts with the right, having worked for a Conservative minister in the mid-1980s. His ability to straddle both sides of the French political arena could prove invaluable to the opera house after the elections. But if there is a change of government this spring, it seems doubtful that even Mr Cluzel will be able to prevent the Opera Bastille from being embroiled in a repetition of the mid-1980s power struggle between President Mitterrand and the Conservatives, particularly as Mr Berge is so close to the president. The Opera Bastille seems set for another melodramatic year.</p>

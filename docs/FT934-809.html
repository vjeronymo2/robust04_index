			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (11): Cleaned up with courage on the river Clyde - Health Care International centre The site of a former asbestos factory and shipyard might seem a curious place to locate a hospital. But such is the case with the new Health Care International medical centre nearing completion at Dalmuir on the banks of the Clyde. The Pounds 180m project will contain some of the most advanced medical facilities in Europe, including 64 intensive care units and 21 operating theatres. It will also have a hotel with 168 bedrooms to accommodate friends and relations of the patients. Yet six years ago, the site was derelict and polluted, a relic of more glorious days on Clydeside. The 50 acre site used to house a shipbuilder and a factory which made asbestos building components such as pipes and tiles. After these went out of business, it was taken over by the Scottish Development Agency, now called Scottish Enterprise, and cleaned up in the hopes of attracting fresh investment. The site included a former ship basin. This was sealed off at the mouth, and lined with a geotextile membrane - a woven man-made fabric which creates a flexible barrier against contamination. The contaminated remains of the factory were then tipped into the dock, and the top of the basin was sealed with another membrane. The whole site was then covered in clean material and landscaped. The operation, which began in early 1988 and took two years, was monitored by local health authorities and the Institute of Occupational Medicine. Several thousand tests were conducted while the work was in progress. Health Care International, which is owned by a group of business investors headed by Harvard University. Scottish Enterprise, Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank, and John Laing, the project's builders, had been looking for a site for a new hospital to provide advanced medical care for patients from Mediterranean countries. The requirement was for a location close to an airport in an English-speaking country with medical traditions. The Dalmuir site met all those criteria. It was 15 minutes from Glasgow airport and only a few minutes from the centre of the city. The fact that the site had a history of contamination was obviously important. But an HCI spokesperson says the investors were satisfied that it had been cleaned up to a high standard. They commissioned an independent test which prompted some further remedial work to satisfy the US investors. The purchase went through in July 1991; The hospital will take its first patients next March. The clean up cost, Pounds 9.3m, was paid for by Scottish Enterprise. The project shows that contaminated sites can be returned to productive use. But it also suggests that the initiative needs to be taken by an official agency with some money at its disposal.</p>

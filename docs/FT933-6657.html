			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Caution at Aegis despite recovery AEGIS, the holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and planning group, returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.2m for the first six months of 1993. That compared with break-even last time and a Pounds 1.9m loss for the year to December 31 1992. Turnover rose 4 per cent to Pounds 1.45bn (Pounds 1.39bn), with the first three months being particularly strong, analysts said. No interim dividend will be paid and the company reaffirmed that no final dividend will be proposed. Earnings per share were 2.16p (losses of 13.1p). Profits after tax were Pounds 9.2m (Pounds 8.8m loss). Net average debt in the past six months was Pounds 66m. Mr Frank Law, chairman, said yesterday that while the first half results were 'satisfactory', the overall picture in Europe was still clouded by 'a general weakness in European advertising markets' implying 'continued pressure on group profits in the second half of the year.' Mr Law also said that the group had managed to reduce operating costs by 3 per cent. Analysts said that the impact of recent legislative changes in France make it difficult to accurately forecast final results for the group, but some were reducing pre-tax profit forecasts from about Pounds 28m to Pounds 25m or less. 'Aegis have diligently been trying to dig themselves out of a hole. They are still the market leader and are now back in profit. But they are not yet out of the wood,' said one analyst.</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: The exploitation of a quirk of nature / Preview of the Pounds 100m flotation early next year of Chiroscience Chiroscience, a pharmaceuticals discovery and manufacturing company that specialises in single isomer drugs, has announced it is to float in mid-January, in a Pounds 100m flotation. Robert Fleming, the company's advisers, have decided to postpone the float from this month to mid-January because of fatigue in the new issues market. Chiroscience was aware it was following a string of new bio-technology companies to market and may well have been influenced by the fact it was following Celltech, which on Thursday completed the UK's largest new pharmaceutical company float. Chiroscience is another creation to emerge from Enzymatix, a creation of Mr Chris Evans, a scientist who floated diagnostics company Celsis earlier this year. The board includes chief executive Mr Nowell Stebbing, veteran of US bio-technology successes Amgen and Genentech, but he will be assuming an executive chairman's role for health reasons. He is replaced by Mr John Padfield, managing director of Glaxo Manufacturing Services, who has responsibility for product development and brings experience of new product introduction, according to Mr Stebbing. Chiroscience, which has never made a profit, is exploiting a quirk of nature that has caught the imagination of the big drug manufacturers. It is based on the discovery 150 years ago by Louis Pasteur that many molecules exist in chemically identical but physically different forms or isomers. One example of this property - called chirality - is found in the smell of oranges and lemons. Both fragrances are produced by chemically identical molecules of limonene. Physically, however, the molecules are mirror images of one another and thus generate a different smell. The pharmaceutical companies are interested because it is widely recognised that the active component of many drugs is found only in one of the two chiral molecules. The other molecule is sometimes very harmful. One of the Thalidomide isomers, for example, was an effective sedative, but the other damaged the developing foetus. The theory is that if only the active isomer was synthesised, drugs would act more specifically on the cells they need to reach. Chiroscience's prospects were given a significant boost in June last year when the US Food and Drug Administration said that companies developing drugs with more than one isomer would have to carry out tests on each isomer as well as the 'mixed' final product. The company is pursuing three paths. Its profitable manufacturing business is making single isomer compounds for third parties to use in their own drugs. Among its customers are Abbott, Glaxo, Pfizer and Wellcome. In an extension of this programme, Menarini, an Italian company, in June signed a 10-year agreement for Chiros - as the company was then called - to make a single isomer version of Ketoprofen, a chronic pain drug already sold in a chiral form. Chiroscience expects this drug, now going through registration in Spain, to be in the market by late 1994. Mr Stebbing says there is a worldwide market of Dollars 500m (Pounds 336m). The second path involves development of single isomer versions of existing drugs that are coming off patent. Because these drugs have been registered in a form that has both isomers, Chiroscience expects its single isomer versions to pass rapidly through the clinic and registration. Its most advanced development is a single isomer version of Bupivacane, an Astra product that is a long acting local anaesthetic. It is currently in phase one of clinical trials. Chiroscience has three other single isomer versions of existing drugs in pre-clinical trials. Finally, Chiroscience is trying to develop single isomer drugs from original research, concentrating on oncology, arthritis and cognitive disorders. These products will take as long to develop as any new drug developed by pharmaceutical companies and are only at a research stage. Unlike many of the new bio-science companies recently floated, Chiroscience has internally generated cash flow which will slow the rate at which the research and development side of the business swallows money. But the results to date demonstrate just how much hope value is already carried in the new bio-technology and drug discovery companies. In the six months to August 31 1993, Chiroscience's manufacturing business generated sales of Pounds 1.34m. Profits from this area reduced the group loss to Pounds 1.37m after a research and development spend of Pounds 1.1m. Mr Evans expects Chiroscience to raise Pounds 35m in the flotation, most of which will stay within the company. It is not clear to what extent Schroder Ventures, Apax Partners, and 3i will seek an exit. With Pounds 8m currently in the bank, partly from a private placing earlier this year, Chiroscience does not expect to return to the market for new funds before it is profitable in 1999, Mr Stebbing says. This is based on the assumption that it continues to generate cash from intermediary product manufacture and that sales of these products 'double each year', according to Mr Stebbing. In the short term, he expects sales to be more than Pounds 2m by the year end and Pounds 6m in 1994. Panmure Gordon is the broker.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Leon -- Henry Ruiz, a member of the national  directorate of the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN],  said yesterday that his party must "move away from internal  struggles" and immediately begin working on winning the 1996  election, including the process to select a candidate. Time is  working against the party's electoral prospects.    Ruiz said that "the idea of selecting a presidential  candidate at this time is premature. In my view, however, those  who believe we should make that selection in 1995 are also  mistaken." Ruiz spoke before 180 Sandinists during a party  meeting in Leon.    Ruiz, who has been mentioned as a candidate for FSLN general  secretary, said: "If my becoming a candidate will serve to unite  the party, then I will accept. I cannot agree to say, however,  that having two or more candidates would affect FSLN unity."    The FSLN treasurer expressed concern over the fact that "we  are spending time on this discussion, while our political  contender is quickly gaining strength." He stressed that  "losing again in 1996 would mean the end of Sandinism as we know  it." The Sandinist leader said: "There is no time to organize  another congress." We must begin the task of organizing from  the ground up, so as to inspire the popular support we will need  in 1996.    The meeting was led by Leon Mayor Luis Felipe Perez, Deputy  Doris Tijerino, and Fanor Herrera, the FSLN political secretary  in Leon.    To start selecting a presidential candidate in 1995 "would  drag us into an internal debate. The Enhanced Structural  Adjustment Facility [ESAF] is already in motion, and I doubt the  Congress will go back on the decision it took at its last  meeting to disapprove the plan," Ruiz explained. He continued  by saying: "That decision, however, does not say how to counter  those economic and political formulas. We must move on to the  next task: What national plan should the FSLN work on and  develop for what comes after the elections?"    Ruiz affirmed that it is necessary to begin the process of  selecting teams and people, comparing them, and seeking new  alliances with the people who are bound to approach us in search  of specific posts and responsibilities with the new government.    In his analysis, he stressed the need for the party to act  openly. "If we are late in doing so, we will end up in an image  game with our own militants. The first thing they will say is  that we have just finished a congress during which we decided to  act one way and that now we are rearranging things. We need  clarity."    In addressing congressional sovereignty, he said that "the  delegates will have the responsibility of reviewing the benefits  of FSLN party modernization or renewal, considering the historic  responsibility of dividing or uniting the party, and, before the  people, deciding on rising to power within a short time."    According to Ruiz, the FSLN must aspire to a power "not of  minorities but of majorities, and, thus, it must have national  consensus. That is why a national proposal is needed." He  cited the example of agriculture, saying that there is no  Sandinist proposal on the topic. Ruiz called upon the  Sandinists to "heal the injuries and erase the memories of the  war in order to be able to build a new nation." To open the  doors of the FSLN to all the politicians in the rural sectors  is, in his opinion, "the modernization and renewal of the FSLN."    Ruiz called for "finding politically feasible solutions that  will strengthen the cohesion and unity of Sandinism." "If the  discussion is insufficient, if we are unable to solve all the  issues through this means, and if we only have the political  solution to preserve unity during the next two years in order to  tackle the 1996 elections, it would be a pity not to accept it.  It would be necessary to accept it because, if not, we face  fragmentation and the prospect of not achieving power," Ruiz  stated.    According to the FSLN treasurer, the party's internal debate  process "is showing that several issues that we initially  thought would weaken us -- such as opening the doors of  Sandinism -- have [not] been so contentious." Ruiz considered  the possibility "that this process could, perhaps, end up in a  political discussion rather than an ideological debate." He  added that, in his opinion, the political solution should be  implemented prior to the congress "without confabulations,  unprincipled conciliations, or artificial commitments."</p>

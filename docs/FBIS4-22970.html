For the State Standards organization, the Ministry of the  Machine Industry and the ASU to develop proposals to create a  single state system of standards, unification, and  certification of computing equipment (both foreign and domestic)  in accordance with world practice.    6. To send representatives of Ukraine to international  organizations that are undertaking standardization of computing  equipment and information science, as well as to other  international organizations.    7. For the Ministry of Education, with the ASU, to analyze  the training of personnel and to develop proposals to improve  the training system for the creation and use of computing  equipment (including microelectronics) as well as to create an  infrastructure of instruction on the basics of information  science and computer technology for numerous levels of the  society.    8. For the heads of the Scientific Research and Design  Institute, the Ministry of the Economy, the Institute of  Cybernetics of the ASU, the Ukrainian Scientific Research  Institute for Scientific and Technical Information, the Print  Scientific Production Association, and others to conduct an  annual analysis of the state and trends for the development of  computing equipment and informatization in Ukraine as compared  with leading foreign countries and to formulate conclusions and  recommendations and submit them to interested ministries,  departments, and organizations.    9. For the State Committee on Science and Technologies of  Ukraine and the ASU (the Institute of Software Systems of the  ASU) to examine the possibility of founding and organizing a  regular periodical publication on the software industry in  Ukraine.  10. In order to economically spend state budget resources and  create state centers for highly scientific advanced  technologies, to ask the Ministry of the Machine Industry and  the Ministry of Defense to submit to the Cabinet of Ministers  proposals on the allotment of targeted funding to buy licenses  and technologies:     -  the production of printed circuit boards ;    -  assembly line production of printed circuit boards;    -  design and manufacture of software tools;    -  production of cathode-ray tubes;    -  production of hard disk drives;    -  laser printers.       11. In order to produce computing equipment at the current  technical level (instead of buying computers ready to use) and  to save monetary resources, to ask the Ministry of the Machine  Industry and the Ministry of Finance to submit to the Cabinet  of Ministers proposals for the allocation of targeted funding  for purchase in 1993 of:     -  microprocessor assemblies;    -  high-capacity memory microcircuits;    -  high-cap acity hard disk drives;    -  components of computers and workstations;    -  licenses for software.       12. In order to economically spend state budget resources,  to ask the Ministry of the Machine Industry to resolve the  problems of producing RU7 and RU9 high- capacity memory  microcircuits in Ukraine (at the Kvazar or Rodon plants), which  would enable Ukrainian computer manufacturing enterprises to  provide their own elemental base at a European level.    13. It is considered expedient to conduct regular scientific  and practical seminars on computing equipment. To ask the  Elektronmash computer production ass ociation to expand (in an  established order) the materials of the scientific and  practical seminar.    ``Main Points of State Scientific and Technical  Policy in the Area of the Development of Computing Equipment in  Ukraine.''    This document was developed in the process of composing the  ``Concepts of the Development of Computing Equipment in  Ukraine'' (version 2-92) which was included in the draft  ``Concepts of the Rapid Development of the Machine Building  Industry of Ukraine ( decree No. 32 of the State Committee on  Science and Technologies dated 17 Jun 92) as part of the  section titled ``Instrument Building.'' ''    The general governmental significance of the computing  equipment subdivision was affirmed by resolution No. 2705-XII  of the Supreme Council of Ukraine dated 16 Oct 92, which  defined ``promising information technologies, comprehensive  automation devices, and communication systems'' as a top  priority area of science and technology in Ukraine. The hardware  and software base for this area is computing equipment and  micro-electronics.    The purpose of this document is to develop the foundations  of state technical policy on the creation in Ukraine of a  profit-making subdivision of computer equipment production. The  materials of this document should be a component of the  ``Concepts of Informatization of Ukrainian Society.''    This document was examined and approved by the interbranch  scientific and practical seminar ``Current State and Prospects  for the Development of Computing Equipment in Ukraine'' (Kiev,  17-18 May 1993, State Committee on Science and Technologies,  ASU, Ministry of the Machine Industry, Ministry of the Economy,  and Ministry of Defense).    A brief analysis of the state of development and  production of computing equipment in Ukraine    1. When Ukraine was part of the former USSR it entered into  a collaboration with a number of republics (Russia, Ukraine,  Belorus, Lithuania, and others) including organizations and  enterprises comprising the union computing equipment industry.  The production of computing equipment was mainly divided among  three ministries: The Ministry of Radio Industry, the Ministry  of Instruments, and the Ministry of Industrial Communication.    There was a territorial specialization in which Ukrainian  organizations and enterprises concentrated on small computers  (the SM computer), control computers, and peripherals and  subcomplexes for the SM and YeS computer (the Elektronmash KPO  [expansion not given], Impuls scientific production  association, Khartron scientific production association, the  Scientific Research Institute of Microdevices, the Kvazar joint  venture, the Print Scientific Research Institute, the Magnit  joint venture, the Infrakon Central Scientific Research  Institute, etc). In the last 3-4 years Ukraine has also  developed a line of low-performance personal computers (consumer  and educational computers, etc.).    The ASU (Cybernetic Center, IPRI, IPME , etc.) have been  engaged in basic and applied research while participating in  union projects to develop large specialized computers and  professional personal computers (the YeS 1800 series) for  general industrial and special use.    The teams at these organizations are now the  scientific-technical and industrial technological potential of  Ukraine in computer equipment. However, due to former  departmental separation, they have not formed an integrated s  tructure organized for the production of consumer computer  equipment.    2. The existing projects for the development and production  of computing equipment in Ukraine make it possible to partially  meet the needs of the domestic market and the CIS market for  the following types of computing equipment:     -  controlling and measuring (real time) computing systems  (PS series);    -  consumer and game computers;    -  laptops;    -  multiprocessor computers and special processors;    -  basic units of personal computers (of the Poisk-2 series);    -  terminals for digital communication networks;    -  telecommunications equipment (LAN equipment, computer  communication via telephone and television channels,  specialized input-output in banking systems,systems based on bar  codes, etc.);    -  fiber optic communication line equipment;    -  PROM controllers, numerical programmable control units;    -  video terminals and collective use imaging devices;    -  devices for the input of graphic information (digitizers,  scanners);    -  devices to output graphic information (plotters)    -  tools for interactive communication with a computer (mouse,  joystick, etc.);    -  various types of printers;    -  hard disk drives;    -  floppy disk drives and floppy disks;    -  Kartridzh type magnetic tape drives and magnetic tapes;    -  service and auxiliary equipment.       The cost of this equipment is a factor of 2-12 less than  analogous foreign models (for acceptable technical  specifications). In terms of the elemental base of  micro-electronics, electronic radio components, and special  materials, the percentage of computing equipment supplied  domestic ally is on average 10- 12%. By comparison, the  figure  for Western Europe is 30-40%.    After a long drop in computing equipment production (1990 to  the first half of 1992), an almost complete cessation of work  to develop new products, and suspension of experimental  production and mass production enterprises, a definite  rejuvenation has been noted. A number of targeted comprehensive  programs have been developed and are in operation, including:     -  ``The Target Comprehensive Program To Develop Computing  Equipment in Ukraine in 1992-1995'' (State Defense Industry of  Machines, Elektronmash KPO, March 1992 );    -  ``Competitive Computing Equipment To Solve the Problems of  the  Informatization of Ukraine (State Committee of Science and  Technologies and the ASU, 1991-1993)'';    -  ``Target Program To Develop High-Performance Computing  Equipment in Ukraine in 1993-1997'' (Ministry of the Machine  Industry, 1993);    -  ``Ukrainian Program To Create and Start Mass Production of  Network Hardware and Software Based on the MAP/TOP Protocol for  Comprehensive Automation of Machine Building'' (State Defense  Industry of Machines, Integral UNPTs [expansion not given],  1991);    -  Elektronika-93 (Ministry of the Machine Industry, Scientific  Research Institute of Microdevices, 1993).       Many claims have been made about these programs, but they  are in any case providing some direction. More than fifty  organizations of the ASU, Ministry of the Machine Industry, and  other departments are participating in them. Moreover, more  than a dozen computing equipment projects have been implemented  as part of comprehensive programs in allied fields: instrument  building, and in the sector of defense computing equipment.  However, these minute changes in the computing equipment  subdivision have not yet nullified the profoundly impaired  macroprocesses that are hindering the development of the  subdivision, which is evidenced by the following analysis of  its grave condition.    3. Analysis of the current state of research and development  of computing equipment and the elemental base in Ukraine finds  it in grave condition. Especially depressing indicators are:     -  the absence of a single state technical policy (program  for development, standards, mechanisms for state regulation and  attracting private firms and foreign investments). Such  programs exist in many developed market economy countries in a  range of national and international programs: PAFE (France),    ALVEY (Great Britain), ESPIRIT (the European Community), and  in Russia (National Programs on Electronics and  Informatization);  %the assortment of computing equipment produced in Ukraine is  insufficient to support information technologies, not only in  strategic areas (defense, energy, finance, transport,  communications), but also in general use;  %the low level of competitiveness on the world market and even  in the markets of developing countries; the lack of a system of  standards and certification of domestic and imported products;  %a low level of self-sufficiency of the elemental base;  %the low level o f self-sufficiency of basic system and  application software; %the insufficient level of precision  electronic and electro-mechanical technologies;  %the absence of experience and technologies for mass production  of precision electro-mechanical devices , not only for  computing equipment, but also for similar products (for  example, there is no clock factory in Ukraine);  %the weak development of software tools (CAD) to design VLSI,  computing equipment, and software;  %a massive drain of computing specialists to distant foreign  counties and to other fields in Ukraine. This process is taking  on an increasingly irreversible and catastrophic nature for the  development of computing equipment.  Factors defining the need to develop a domestic computing  equipment subdivision       Under these conditions a subdivision can arise, and trends  for the reorientation of enterprises in the subdivision to  another product have already begun, for example to consumer  goods far from electronic machine building. The idea that  Ukraine does not need its own computing equipment is being  heard not only in the halls of well-known western firms present  in Ukraine (IBM, DEC, SIEMENS, BASF, and others), but also at  seminars in solid institutes and even state institutions  involved in the management of science.    Let us present some basic arguments for the need to  strengthen and develop electronic machine building (computing  equipment, communication, instrument building, etc.) in Ukraine.    1) Because the enterprises of basic areas of industry are  lagging behind technologically, they are not competitive, and  this makes it impossible in the near future to develop the  exportation of products to hard currency zones, in order for  Ukraine to buy all the Western equipment it needs. Ukraine does  not have export supplies of valuable raw ma terials to provide  for the annual purchase of 50,000 computers (75-100 million  dollars). This is the only reason Ukraine is forced to  independently provide for the main areas of human activity in  the production of electronic machinery, including computers.    2) Ukraine, like the other republics of the former USSR,  developed in a closed social, economic, and scientific  production space for a long time. Outdated information  technologies, methods and forms of representing and processing  information were created, and a standards base (GOST, OST, etc.)  was created which was stricter in some ways (for example, on  the conditions of testing and use) than international  standards. Thus, at present there is and will continue to  before some time objective conditions limiting the widespread  use of imported standard computing equipment in our real  conditions. In many areas this is simply impossible (military  equipment, automated control systems for technological  processes in metallurgy, chemical processing, atomic energy,  etc.).    3) In a number of areas of application (government, defense,  the economy, finance, etc.) high requirements are placed on  confidentiality and the protection of information, which is  impossible to guarantee with imported computing equipment;    4) Enhancement of the defense capacity and its maintenance  on a sufficient level in Ukraine (as an independent state  outside the bloc) requires a high level of self-sufficiency of  highly scientific defense equipment, primarily electronic  equipment (including computers).    These factors are sufficient to conclude that development in  Ukraine of the electronic machine building field, including the  building of computers, is a prime necessity. However, there are  other factors which justify the technical, economic and social  advantages of development of this sector of industry in  Ukraine, including:     -  foreign experience shows that electronic machine building  is the most profitable (and at the same time ecologically pure)  field for states with limited natural resources, as is the case  of Ukraine. In industrially developed countries, the last few  decades have witnessed active restructuring of the economy due  to a sharp increase in the rate of growth of industry in  scientific areas. For example, in the US, since 1977 the  average annual rate of increase of industrial production was  2.9%, and in scientific areas, 14%;    -  the development of the  computing field for use in the difficult conditions of defense  and a number of other industries creates the necessary  infrastructure (scientific, technical, industrial, etc.) for the  computer equipment industry and its elemental base, which makes  it possible to create and develop a competitive consumer and  industrial computing equipment industry with minimal material  and labor costs;    -  the creation of a domestic computing equipment industry with  a  gradual increase in the level of competitiveness in the final  analysis will substantially reduce hard currency expenditures  in the state economy;    -  the domestic development of computing equipment stimulates  the  development of science and the overall intellectual potential  of the country.       Goals and the main points of state policy in the  development of computing equipment    1. The main trend in state policy on the development,  production, and use of computing equipment is creating a balance  between meeting state interests in all areas of Ukrainian  society and real resources, considering the need to preserve the  scientific and industrial potential which exists in this field.    The following are proposed as the main strategic line of  development of computing equipment in Ukraine (1993-1996 and to  the year 2000):--to create a profitable domestic computer  equipment industry concentrated on the production of computing  equipment, and systems based on this computing equipment, that  are needed to provide for the primary goals of informatization  of Ukraine;--to develop domestic computing software in the form  of the State Open System of Computing Equipment (GOSVT-Ukraine,  hereafter GOSVT-U) with a consideration of the following  principles:     -  orientation of the assortment of hardware and software in  GOSVT-U to complete compatibility with international standards;    -  the use of modular construction;    -  achievement of self-sufficiency in the elemental base of up  to  40-50%;    -  maximum possible combination of the development and  production  of computing equipment for civilian and military use;       2. GOSVT-U should be the basic complex for state means of  informatization, primarily in defense and security, government  control, health, education, and welfare, taxation, the ecology,  and other noncommercial areas of activity. Work to create and  introduce GOSVT-U should mainly be financed by the government.  Economic and legal mechanisms must be created to stimulate:     -  the expansion of the assortment of GOSVT-U modules to  reduce the import of computing equipment into state information  systems;    -  finding designs which reduce the assortment and/or amount of  imported components;    -  producing GOSVT-U products which are competitive in the  domestic and foreign markets.       3. Detailed analysis and the selection of primary trends for  the development of computing equipment will be done by  determining the assortment of equipment for GOSVT-U. However,  the main guidelines for state policy in this area should be:     -  the creation of computing equipment and information  technologies linked with the defense and security of the nation;    -  providing automation equipment to the country's most  important  technical facilities (energy, metallurgy, agriculture, ecology,  etc.);    -  production of profitable competitive products;    -  the creation of computing equipment in high demand  (preferably  with a high degree of domestic labor in the production of these  products);    -  the presence of experience and real stockpiles of computing  equipment;    -  primary provision of state control, fundamental scientific  research and work related to urgent social needs of  society.       4. World experience has shown that a full computing  equipment  self-sufficiency level (80-90%) can only be reached by  developed and wealthy nations such as the U S, Japan, and  Western Europe (as a whole). However, the technical and economic  advantage of international division of specializations holds  them to a level of self-sufficiency of no greater than  70%.  Less wealthy nations (Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy)  are at a 40-50% level. However, the overall level of  informatization of these countries is extremely high. Ukraine  may reach a self-sufficiency level of 30-40% in the next  3-5  years.    To determine the balance of production of domestic and  purchase of imported computing equipment (bought from the West  and the CIS, namely Russia and Belorus) it is expedient to  consider the following recommendations on the main trends of  informatization with computing equipment:       Purchased advanced foreignequipment      Domestic equipment using   based on current platfo rms              mass-produced computing equipment   (workstations, supercomputers, etc.)     and equipment for state use   1. High level of professional use in     1. Automation of routine tasks,   information science (CAD, CASE, etc.)    office work,  and   in other areas                           household equipment, etc.   2. Higher specialized education          2. Intermediate and preschool                                           education   3. Flexible automated production robot   3. Automation of basic areas    factories, numerical programmable        of industry energy, metallurgy,   control, etc.                            machine building, etc.   4. State control of high-level and       4. Systems at the administrative-   financial-banking systems with all       regional level  types   of protectio n   5. Special low-level systems with all    5. Special strategic systems   types of protection      Consequently, the path of providing Ukraine with computing  equipment in the next 3-5 years can be represented as follows:    a) fostering domestic development and production of defense  equipment (all types) and civilian equipment intended to meet  the needs for computer equipment in terms of mass  informatization based on GOSVT-U, including: basic components  of personal computers of low and intermediate performance  levels, individual models of micro-computers and small  computers, equipment for automated control and measurement  systems and general-purpose computing equipment; a basic set of  peripherals and media for them; PROM controllers,  telecommunication equipment for collective use; computer and  game computers,  equipment for digital communication networks; consumer  micro-electronics; services for the use and repair of the  entire assortment of computing equipment (domestic and import);    b) creation of joint ventures with advanced firms in the CIS  and the West in the production of computing equipment needed  for promising areas of informatization, including  general-purpose supercomputers, personal computers and  workstations, central communication network equipment, and  software for it; production of basic components for this  equipment with subsequent ``Ukrainization'' of the production  of these parts due to accelerated development of analogous  domestic production;    c) purchase of computing equipment for a single use: unique  supercomputers and peripherals, licenses for the use of the  necessary software, and high- performance micro-processors and  their frameworks;    d) provision of preferential conditions for conducting  fundamental and applied research and scientific research and  design work to create promising original computing equipment  with no foreign analogs, as well as competitive types of  computing equipment for which research and development is  ongoing abroad.    5. Mechanisms to implement computing equipment development  programs in Ukraine should take the following basic measures:     -  restructuring of scientific and industrial potential and  the state system of control of these facilities to create a  single computing equipment production complex;    -  creation, based on state and commercial enterprises and  organizations in Ukraine, of a number of corporations  (concerns, associat ions, technopolises, or other progressive  organizational forms), which unite the producers and developers  of computing equipment and all technological gamut from  scientific research to the production of computing equipment  and the elemental base, technological equipment, services, etc.;    -  provision of financing of the development of GOSVT-U from the  state budget, extensive bank credit, customer funds, the budgets  of local and regional agencies, etc.;    -  development of primary standards documents in the Supreme  Council and Council of Ministers of Ukraine needed for the  development of domestic computing equi pment, including  standards to regulate the import of computing equipment and  advanced technologies, guarantees of foreign investments, and  investors' rights;    -  creation of joint ventures (primarily for components and  materials) with near and distant foreign countries;    -  creation of a network of support centers for scientific  technologies;    -  advanced development of th e elemental base of computing  equipment (microelectronics, electronic radio components,  instrument electromechanics, information media, etc.); purchase  of licenses for products which define the technical level of  computing equipment (microprocessors, memory, cathode ray  tubes, lasers, hard disks, etc.);    -  organization of a network of certification centers for  computing equipment;    -  creation of service systems for computer equipment;    -  creation of a software industry;    -  unification of programs for the development of military and  civilian computing equipment in order to efficiently use  scientific and technical and industrial potential.       6. Further details on the technical policy and development  of the Concepts of the Development of Computing Equipment  require advanced development of the Concepts of the  Informatization of Ukrainian Society, especially in the area of  determining the assortment of priority information technologies  and systems needed, including the basic requirements on the  specifications of hardware and software.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mixed fortunes from SA producers TAXED income from the gold mines in the Gengold group fell by 11 per cent to R65.1m (Dollars 21.2m) in the December quarter, compared with the previous three months. But Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said the mines were in stronger shape than a year ago following a campaign to mine more efficiently. The improvement is reflected by income after tax and capital expenditure rising to R48.3m compared with R22.4m in the December 1991 quarter. Total tonnes milled in the group dropped by 18 per cent to 2.92m in the December quarter from 3.56m a year previously. The average yield, however, rose by 18 per cent to 6 grammes per tonne from 5.1. While gold production over the same period fell by 4 per cent to 17,459kg, working costs per kg of gold produced fell by 3 per cent to R26,812 per kg, despite inflation averaging about 14 per cent during 1992. The best performances during the quarter came from Beatrix and Unisel which respectively increased taxed income to R12.7m from R7.9m and to R5.8m from R3.3m from the September quarter. St Helena made a R3.4m loss compared with R4.1m profit the previous quarter. The figures, however, include a R8.6m one-off retrenchment cost following an effective halving of the mine's operations. Mr Maude said the St Helena mine was set to make a solid return to profit. At the Anglovaal and Johannesburg Consolidated Investment groups, profits from gold mines increased during the December quarter. Helped by an impressive performance from flagship Hartebeestfontein, Anglovaal lifted taxed profits by 57 per cent to R35.3m from R22.5m during the quarter. Taxed profit at Hartebeestfontein rose to R32m from R20.7m. Elsewhere in the group profits at ETC rose to R5.8m from R5m while losses at Loraine fell to R2.9m from R3.4m. Taxed profits in the JCI group rose by 11.3 per cent to R62.6m from R56.2m on the back of a 3 per cent increase in production to 12,714kg from 12,338kg. Randfontein and Western Areas jointly broadly maintained taxed profits at R48.4m and R8.9m respectively. While Joel improved its financial performance considerably in the last quarter - taxed profits rose to R5.2m from R775,000 - poor development results caused tons milled to fall by 14.4 per cent. The lower levels of production have forced the mine to take steps to restore profitability.</p>

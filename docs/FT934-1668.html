			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Gore hits at IMF over plight of Russia's jobless Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, criticised the International Monetary Fund yesterday for insensitivity to the plight of the unemployed in Russia, foreshadowing a possible shift in western policy on helping the country's economy. Mr Gore said the effect of huge defence budget cuts on communities dependent on defence production had been 'devastating'. He criticised western countries for not waking up to Russia's problems. 'Every country with representatives on the IMF board has been slow to recognise the hardship caused by some of what has been done in the past. That may cause a diplomatic incident, but I don't care.' The IMF was supposed to grant at least Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) in the current year to assist reform. Only Dollars 1.5bn has been given and there are doubts if the second tranche will be released. The IMF has complained that successive Russian governments have not curtailed the budget deficit and brought inflation down to 5 per cent a month. Meeting these criteria would mean choking off credits to already shaky Russian enterprises, causing mass unemployment. Mr Gore said that 'in circumstances where there is a great deal of economic suffering and when the world does not pay too much attention to that, then people become vulnerable to demagoguery'. This was endorsed by Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, who said it was in the defence industries where 'the highest intellectual strength is concentrated, and we cannot shut them down'. The neo-fascist Liberal Democratic party swept the board in Sunday's election in that part of parliament chosen according to party lists. Senior international financial officials now believe western aid strategies for Russia will change as a new government reins back the speed of reforms. Reuter in Washington reports: Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said last night the US would go on supporting Russian reformers. In a TV interview he said the reformers had needed a 'wake-up call' and should now build coalitions. Between extremes, Page 3 Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

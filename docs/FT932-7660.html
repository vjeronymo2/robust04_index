			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Nadir successfully intervenes in Turkish courts to prevent sale of Gunaydin MR ASIL Nadir, the fugitive Cypriot businessman, has successfully intervened in the Turkish courts to prevent the sale of Gunaydin, the Istanbul newspaper, in his latest move to regain control of his Turkish assets. On Thursday an Istanbul court postponed the sale by the official receivers of Gunaydin, pending settlement of dispute over ownership of the newspaper's title. The former Polly Peck chairman, who jumped bail in the UK earlier this month and fled to northern Cyprus, has said he will fight to regain his assets in Turkey. Gunaydin's staff, owed more than TL60bn by Mr Nadir, created a new company called Yeni Gunaydin last year, printing on machinery auctioned by the state receivers. Imar bank, the newspaper's creditors, unsuccessfully challenged the move in the courts. This week Mr Osman Adas, acting for Mr Nadir, claimed the Gunaydin title was vested in Veb Holding, a private company, which according to Turkish Treasury records is 100 per cent owned by Mr Nadir. Mr Nadir's action has blocked the sale of Gunaydin to Mr Mustafa Suzer, a businessman of Kurdish origin and owner of the Pera Palas Hotel, immortalised by the writer Agatha Christie.</p>

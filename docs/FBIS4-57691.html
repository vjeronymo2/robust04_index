			<p>BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], said Cuba  seeks, through the peoples' parliaments, participation of the  entire population in the making of national decisions. In an  interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, prior to departing for  England on an official visit, the president of the ANPP harshly  criticized what he called the fiction by the so-called  representative democracies. Alarcon said such representation is  limited to the electoral act, and that from that moment on,  there is no relationship between the citizen who voted and the  politician. National sovereignty is therefore limited to one day  every few years.    Alarcon also referred to the experience gained by Cuba  during  the recent process, prior to the adoption of diverse measures to  restructure the economy and the battle against illegal profit,  preceded by celebration by more than 80,000 assemblies at work  centers.    In discussing future participation of the ANPP in the  application of the accorded measures, Alarcon said the ANPP is  responsible for control of the practical application of those  measures in a way never achieved by similar bodies in other  political systems. Alarcon went on to say: We will control and  oversee application of the national budget through the direct  work of each entity or province in coordination with  administrative authorities exchanging ideas for the reduction of  subsidies and the increase of state income.</p>

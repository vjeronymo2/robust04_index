			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Letter: Pensions argument rests on long-term low inflation Sir, In discussing the pressure on UK pension funds to increase holdings of bonds ('Time to tilt the balance', February 9), Mr Plender takes a remarkably sanguine view of the outlook for UK inflation. The case for a permanent increase in bond weightings at the expense of equities must surely rest with a belief that the UK economy has somehow achieved a fundamental improvement in its ability to deliver lower inflation over the entire economic cycle. Few would argue that events since September 1992 have reduced the uncertainty over the ultimate course of inflation, since, having abandoned the ERM, the UK authorities have failed to establish a credible medium-term economic strategy. Equally, UK economic history suggests the ultimate consequence of a sharply weaker pound is higher inflation. Lastly, given the state of public finances, it would be dangerous to ignore the attractions of higher inflation as a means of reducing the real burden of government debt. Hence, from a longer-term asset allocation perspective, the case for a sustained reduction in equity weightings becomes less convincing, and dangers inherent in assuming that inflation has been permanently laid low are understated.

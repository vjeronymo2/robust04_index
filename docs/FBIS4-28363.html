			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tokyo University Professor Takashi Inoguchi: </F> "Efforts Needed To Check Negative Side of Japan's Bureaucracy;  Politicians Need Improving, More Policy Expertise"]    [Text] 1. The bureaucracy is attracting attention because  of its connection to various problems plaguing the Japanese  Government. At the height of disarray, Japan's Government has  fallen short of producing adequate policies to bring Japan out  of its current recession, nor has it dealt satisfactorily with  problems in its relationship with other countries.    2. A new way of looking at the bureaucracy is to see it  particularly as a negative force preventing politicians from  assuming leadership and as an obstacle to the "liberalization"  and deregulation of the marketplace. These are also factors  which may negatively affect attempts to strengthen Japan's  democratic government.    3. These concerns are far removed from the view of  bureaucrats as the formulators and implementers of public  policy, or as those who hold the national interest in their  grasp, or as a force driving economic development forward. The  author explores to what degree and in which way such  perspectives are valid and useful.    Broad Discretionary Authority Within Small  Government    The original blueprint for Japan's present-day bureaucracy  came out of the Tokugawa period [1603-1867] han  system, which developed during Japan's transition from medieval  to early modern times.    One of the characteristics of this system was that [in each  han, or daimyo domain] the leading role in  formulating and implementing policy fell to a select group of  bureaucrats. Second, within the framework of "small  government," this group was given broad discretionary authority  in administering han affairs. A third characteristic was that  these bureaucrats had a strong sense of mission and  responsibility, taking full advantage of their physical strength  as well as the power of their group to sustain itself over time.    It was natural that those who took the lead in formulating  and implementing policy were members of the military ruling  class. A class of officials like the "politicians" who emerged  throughout the world during the 17th and 18th centuries, and  particularly from the 19th century on, did not exist in Japan.  Even when stripped of their weapons, Japan's samurai-bureaucrats  retained their leadership role. Using local village leaders as  intermediaries, they were to see that supervision was carried  out at the grassroots level, that taxes were collected, and that  improvements were made in the social infrastructure and were to  encourage agriculture, commercem and industry.    The preliminary work of creating Japan's modern bureaucracy  was undertaken from the mid-1800's, with the first stage of  development completed around the beginning of the 20th century.  Unlike this early modern bureaucratic system, which drew its  members from the hereditary samurai class, the modern  bureaucracy is based on nationwide competitive recruitment.    Still, even in the 1920's, half of Japan's bureaucrats were  from the former samurai class. Although a parliamentary form of  government was formed from around the end of the 19th century,  thus bringing politicians and political parties into government,  the bureaucratic system was largely unaffected and the  bureaucracy still retained its leadership character.    During these early years, politicians tended to be branded  as  special interest, factious, and corrupt. For, even though the  Meiji Restoration government was steadily pursing its goal of  forming a parliamentary democracy, in policy matters, the  bureaucracy was still one of the pillars of the new government's  enlightened, authoritarian rule.    The Meiji Restoration government, like the earlier han  government units, also pursued "small government." One of the  reasons was the new government's weakened revenue base. Another  important reason was that it lacked the ideology that would  enable it to create "big government." This is a characteristic  that has been carried over from the early modern period and only  once did this tradition lapse. This was during the early half of  the 1940's, when there was a temporary expansion of government  powers in order for Japan to successfully wage war.    In the postwar period, the bureaucracy has also basically  carried out "small government." If "big government" is  characteristic of Western Europe, then "small government" has  been realized by Japan and the United States.    That is not to say that an administration that seeks to  contain government is a weak administration. On the books,  Japan's bureaucracy may not necessarily have been given much  explicit authority. However, it exercises considerable influence  and discretionary authority, the result of its skillful  manipulation of the "give and take" relationship between  government and industry as well as past precedents and  practices, including a tradition that produces ambiguously  drafted regulations and flexibly interpretable laws. Thirdly,  like enlightened, absolute monarchs, Japan's bureaucracy is  characterized by a strong sense of responsibility and mission,  and tends to see itself being called upon most particularly  during periods of political upheaval and economic stagnation.  This is understandable, given the bureaucrat's early connections  to Japan's warrior class, and even in modern times, the  bureaucracy, at least on this point, hasn't changed too greatly.    In time, bureaucrats no longer came from the same homogenous  class background. At the same time, they were developing a sense  of solidarity, which came from graduating from the same schools,  etc., that proved to be a much stronger source of cohesion for  the bureaucratic organization than class origin.    References to the stature and strength of the  samurai-turned-bureaucrat of the early modern period may not  strike us as very strange. In speaking of the modern-day  bureaucrat, however, the reference is no longer to his physical  strength but the stature he himself probably feels as a member  of an elite class and as belonging to an organization that can  be expect to take care of his well-being. When we think about  how many years have been added to our lives after retirement, we  can imagine how much of a boost to his morale it is when he can  expect another job waiting for him when he makes his "descent  from heaven."    "Lack of Impartiality" and Other Negative Criticisms  Erupt    Most often, the emphasis until now has been on the positive  aspects of the Japanese bureaucracy--that is, its responsibility  in formulating and implementing influential public policy, its  image as the impartial embodiment of the national interest, and  its role in promoting economic development.    More recently, however, what is gushing forth like an  unleashed dam are criticisms of the bureaucracy's negative  aspects. First of all, there is a chain of criticism that sees  bureaucrats as really considering it to their own advantage that  government based on the party system is in a fluid, changing  state; that they are preventing politicians from showing  political leadership; and that they have come to take their own  leadership role for granted.    Leadership is never more needed than at times of global  confusion, and yet, according to these critics, public policy  has gone off course because of [bureaucratic] inertia and  self-interest.    Second, at a time when economies are moving toward global  deregulation, Japan's bureaucracy is being accused of not taking  the leadership nor changing what is apt to be a passive stance  on deregulation and market liberalization and of thus creating  more obstacles to this process than necessary. According to  critics, it will be a matter of no small significance if, at a  time when world economic rules are being re-done in the midst of  a new world order, we merely assume the bureaucratic spirit will  act to correct this passivity toward new rule-making and  system-building.    Third, critics are saying that the priorities which the  bureaucracy has recommended as remedies for Japan's economic  slump are not necessarily the right ones and, in fact, may have  only prolonged the recession. The criticism is similar to the  one President John Kennedy made in 1961 soon after taking office  when, meeting with opposition from fiscal and monetary  authorities, he is said to have complained that they were  "emphasizing a balanced budget more than the welfare of the  American people."    Turning such negative arguments around, critics might argue  that the government under its current party system has gotten  too lax in its duties and the bureaucracy has taken up that  slack, attempting to insure the continuity of government as well  as to stabilize the economy and soften the medium and long-range  impact of international adjustments.    In fact, the disorderly ebb and flow of party-system  governments is only too common to many of the countries in the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD].  Such, for example, seems to be the case in the United States  with the apparent confusion one finds in the Clinton  administration, or in England under Prime Minister Majors, or in  France under Prime Minister Balladur. Italy's political  situation is the most fluid and unstable of all.    Undoubtedly these conditions are all tied to the worldwide  slump economies are experiencing. At the same time, while we see  a global movement toward liberalizing markets and establishing a  global economy, we also note that within democratic governments,  social interests are narrowly competing with each other within  their own national borders.    Out of necessity, enterprises operate on a global scale, but  those who have influence only within their own national borders  and have relatively little competitive power must have political  representation and tend to become a social presence that relies  on the strength and support of government.    In the majority of cases, those social forces have access to  political power; thus, what seems to be true throughout the  world, in general, is that there tends to be an awkward strain  between governments and economies. It is probably quite natural,  especially within administrations which represents those types  of social forces, for disputes to surface regarding economic  policy.    Market Covers for Government Paralysis    The question is whether Japan's bureaucracy can stand up to  those kinds of basic problems. It might not be at all strange,  no matter how brilliant or full of missionary zeal young  bureaucrats may be, for the negative aspects of bureaucracies to  win out over their more positive aspects when those very  characteristics are taken to the extreme.    The only saving hand for government is held by the market  and--through the steady growth of market forces independent of  the political activities of elected officials and bureaucrats  and the competition between them--its ability to lessen the role  of government itself. Certainly, in the short run, this lack of  political leadership in economic negotiations with foreign  countries will be a disadvantage.    However, it is also true that in the absence of an accord  between Japan and the United States the market is continuing to  develop on its own, and the recession and high yen have taken on  the force of a surging wave, propelling Japan's manufacturing  industry into direct investments to Asia-Pacific countries,  especially China.    This direction will someday probably eliminate the trade  deficit Asian countries have with Japan. The rapid development  of the economies of Asian countries will also probably alter  their relationship with the United States. Nor does it seem such  developments will be greatly affected by the fact that  "framework" talks between the United States and Japan have  temporary stalled.    However, as long as one takes seriously the task of  strengthening democratic government and as long as our actions  to bring us closer to that end are important in raising the  international level of confidence in Japan, then it is necessary  to endeavor to keep the potentially negative aspects of Japan's  bureaucracy from surfacing and coming too strongly into play.    To put it another way, an effective antidote is probably the  one that improves the quality of our elected officials as the  representatives of our interests. Restraining our bureaucrats  will not lead to any solutions. Instead, we must not delay in  cultivating and nurture elected officials who are capable,  strong, informed, and well-versed in policy.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Long View: Update on the bull market UP GO those share prices. London has been following Wall Street into new high ground this week, with the Footsie Index breaking through 2700, and even poor old Tokyo has been staging something of a rally. There is nothing like a fall in interest rates to stimulate the stock market. Mathematically, it is worth paying more for a stream of future dividends if the alternative rewards for investment are coming down. Of course, you can argue that short-term interest rates, which fell in the UK this week, are less relevant than long-term bond yields, or perhaps the real return on index-linked gilts. However, it is spring, and there is economic recovery in the air, if not yet in the statistics. The stock market is the most sensitive indicator we have. Other asset markets are not yet giving the same signals: the dreary old residential housing market, for instance, was still heading downwards in April according to the Halifax Building Society. The average house last month was worth 5.5 per cent less than a year earlier. You would not expect the house market and the stock market to move precisely in line. The market in homes is very inefficient because people tend to hold their property off the market rather than accept what they consider to be unrealistic prices. There are no market makers to cut prices to whatever level will stimulate demand. Funnily enough, though, share prices at the beginning of April, ahead of the election, were running 5 or 6 per cent below their year-earlier level, extraordinarily similar to the pattern in house prices. It was the election result that transformed the stock market, leading to a jump of 12 1/2 per cent since two days before the poll. Estate agents will no doubt be anticipating a similar effect in the property market, but there is a big overhang of unsold homes to be cleared. However, just as Wall Street is supposed to have signalled five of the last three recessions, for the London equity market this is the second celebration of the coming recovery. Share prices were buoyant late last summer as interest rates fell and the politicians tried to talk the economy up. As base rates dipped to 10 1/2 per cent at the beginning of September the FT-SE 100 Index hit an all-time high of 2679.6 which has not been exceeded until this week, as the next half-point has finally come off short-term interest rates after eight months. In the meantime the economic upturn scheduled for the third quarter of 1991 has been postponed: it may be happening in the second quarter of 1992. And although the overhang of supply is not so immediate as it is in housing, where estate agents' windows are full of highly desirable but highly unshiftable properties, or even in the gilt-edged market, where the Bank of England has eagerly sold at least Pounds 4bn of new bonds into the post-election upsurge, the flow of share issues will soon begin. It takes a few weeks and months before the merchant bankers can groom their corporate clients to exploit better market conditions, but we know that several big flotations and secondary offerings are in the pipeline: they include GPA, 3i and the Daily Telegraph, while another Pounds 4bn worth of Wellcome is in the offing. Rights issues are rather more problematical to predict: after last year's huge flow of more than Pounds 10bn the pace has slackened. But it might accelerate again if the economy improves and companies become confident they will not risk debacles such as the British Aerospace issue last year. I would be surprised if the UK stock market were to advance very much further from here, but it cannot be ruled out: markets often overshoot. And I see from a circular by Kleinwort Benson's chartist Nick Glydon that the seasonal pattern in equities appears to have changed in the past five years so that July or August rather than May are the best months to take profits. We need a new rhyming wisdom: sell in Jul or look a fool, perhaps? With the dividend yield now down to little more than 4 1/2 per cent the market can no longer be said to look superficially cheap, given that the prospects for dividend growth over the next year or two are dreary. The yield gap over index-linked gilts has shrunk to about 0.1 per cent, compared with a typical 0.5 per cent or so over the past few years; this gap has never gone negative except in the few months before the 1987 crash, and if this reversal happens again we should take it as a warning. The longer-term perspective is that the London stock market is now 19 months into a bull market that began in the autumn of 1990 (the precise timing being related to the Gulf crisis, however, rather than domestic factors). Since the turn, share prices have climbed by 35 per cent, the bulk of which was achieved within the first year. We are only just emerging into new all-time high ground, and in fact the advance by the broadly-based All-Share Index is no more than 5 per cent since the old July 1987 peak. Admittedly there has actually been a fall in real terms of a substantial 23 per cent since then, but at that stage the market was seriously overvalued (a few weeks after a Tory election victory, incidentally, albeit a confidently expected one). Another significant upward leg of the bull market will need to be supported by company profits. Earnings per share have fallen by about 8 per cent on industrials over the past year and the historic price-earnings ratio is a demanding 16.5. It would be reasonable to expect earnings per share to rise by 15 per cent this year if the economic recovery comes through on any scale, but even so the p/e would remain quite demanding. Later on the recovery seems bound to bring problems with the balance of payments and the financing of the government's deficit so 1993 could prove hard going for equities. But I don't want to spoil a good story by adding an unhappy ending.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (6): Building blocks for traders - Profile of Infinity Financial Technology Banks and other traders are all facing the same problem of pulling data together from all over the world for analysis. Even a huge central database is unlikely to manage the speeds and volumes of data required to manage risk effectively. Many of the new wave of products are based on flexible 'client/server' architecture, which links workstations to a shared processor. These are unlikely to replace core systems, running millions of loans, but new risk management systems must be able to interface with existing systems, and pass values back and forth. 'There's a general trend towards bringing all these systems under one roof, with commensurate financial activities,' observes Roger Lang, president and chief executive of Infinity Financial Technology of Mountain View, California. 'There are two compelling reasons for such a move: to make more money, and to cut operational costs.' Infinity's Montage line of products includes development tools and front-end applications tailored specifically for derivatives trading options. Based on Unix open systems architecture, they can contribute to the management of swaps, caps/floors, swaptions, forward rate agreements (FRAs), bonds, money markets, futures, futures options and foreign exchange. Clients include Chemical Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Sanwa Bank, ABN Amro Bank, Baring Brothers, and Price Waterhouse. The company claims to be the leading provider of open systems to the global financial services market. Unlike C ATS, Infinity sticks to industry-wide tools such as the Oracle and Sybase databases. Chase Manhattan is building its entire back-office and transactions processing for derivatives - specifically exotics - using the Infinity toolset. Analysts believe the attraction is the ability Infinity clients have of building their own exotics, and being able to process them downstream. While Mr Lang dismisses the PC as a potential liability, client-server architecture, with its emphasis on interconnected personal workstations is more promising. 'The PC was not the enabling technology that allowed traders to explore: it was the spreadsheet. But this is a dangerously self-contained tool, a two-edged sword because it gave rise to innovation, but left pools of unintegrated data, at the same time 'juxtaposed' to mainframe systems. Now we have fully networkable workstation environments, whereas before there was the central monolithic mainframe: two completely different architectures, achieving the same thing but with a canyon between them. What client-server and open architecture has allowed is to give power to the personal workspace so that it can finally rival the power of the mainframe.' Infinity's approach is to offer a toolset alongside its applications, which leaves the door open for users to write their own systems, or to create 'building blocks'. Many banks license tools and applications. 'We embrace the toolkit approach because of the speed of development' says Mr Lang. 'It means that your expensive technology talent doesn't waste time maintaining systems written from scratch. In-house talent can concentrate on the high-priced high-value extras and additions.' The toolkit also enables programmers to integrate previously disparate systems. 'In the past ' explains Mr Lang, 'a portfolio might be managed by different systems, and the only way of bringing together a pool of transactions would be to build separate reporting facilities. The trend is now to pool the data under one roof and drive the reporting from a consolidated set of data. 'Once there is access to consolidated data, a marketer can use the customer information database, with knowledge of the market movement. A trader can go to the market looking for specific trades, and hedge that position. A risk manager can engage in a myriad of analytical and modelling exercises to get a more intuitive profile of the company's risk, and an operations professional can streamline all the different clerical processes and transactions.'</p>

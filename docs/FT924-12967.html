			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / The UK Economy: Major abandons policy for crisis management MR JOHN MAJOR could not escape the painful irony. At last week's Conservative party conference he was pursued by journalists demanding to know how he would bridge the deep divisions in his party over Europe. As he set about that task at the Birmingham summit yesterday he was dogged by journalists aghast that he was absorbed in the arcane intricacies of European decision-making when the coal closures threatened to push Britain's economy from recession into slump. It was no use the prime minister crying foul. After its mishandled decision to shut down nearly a third of Britain's coal mines, the government faces the most turbulent period in British politics since the winter of discontent which brought down the Labour government in the late 1970s. Belated realisation of that dismal prospect jolted Mr Major into ordering yesterday's cut of 1 percentage point in interest rates. But the government has yet to demonstrate that it has fundamental answers equal to the crisis. The most startling development has been the way in which the decision to shut the pits crystallised discontent across a broad swathe of the Conservative party. As cabinet ministers admitted privately that they had simply failed to foresee the scale of the popular backlash against the closures, the fate of 30,000 miners replaced Europe as the lightning conductor for the deep disquiet among Tory MPs. Governments are frequently accused of being callous about the fate of their citizens. They are used to charges of incompetence when things go wrong. But, as one of the most thoughtful of Mr Major's ministers admitted this week, when both charges can justifiably be levelled simultaneously, a government must be ready to acknowledge that it has lost its grip. The minister might have added that something has gone terribly wrong when a Conservative government contrives to allow Mr Arthur Scargill, leader of the NUM, to present himself as a credible representative of the popular mood. Mr Major is not alone in the firing line. Mr Michael Heseltine, one of the most experienced ministers in the cabinet, has seen much of the gloss stripped from his reputation by the handling of the coal decision. Ministerial colleagues can scarcely believe that the trade and industry secretary was bounced by British Coal into bringing forward the announcement because of a spate of leaks - particularly since many of those were traceable to ministers. No-one should doubt Mr Heseltine's capacity for recovery - but even his admirers were admitting that grand talk of a strategy to revive the manufacturing sector now had a distinctly hollow ring. Mr Norman Lamont's apparent inability to foresee that an immediate shutdown of the pits would snuff out the remaining embers of hope for an end to the recession has reinforced the judgment of cabinet colleagues that the chancellor is living on borrowed time. Shunning those whom he suspects of conspiring against him, Mr Lamont has the look of a beaten man. The failure of those charged with presentation of government policy to provide a convincing explanation of how the pits decision was reached - yesterday's announcement that Mr Heseltine had told most cabinet ministers on Tuesday only added to the confusion - has strengthened the impression that Mr Major's closest advisers are political amateurs. It was not until the Tory press had subjected the government to more than 48 hours of sustained invective that Downing Street realised there was some significance in the way ministers had decided to put 30,000 more people on the dole. The cut in interest rates will ease some of the more immediate pressure at Westminster by detaching some recruits to the threatened backbench rebellion when MPs debate the closures next week. But the blunt criticism yesterday from Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of backbench MPs, provided a reminder that lower mortgage costs might not be enough to prevent a defeat at the hands of the Opposition. Lower borrowing costs carry with them a more serious risk. Yesterday's long Treasury justification for the relaxation of policy only reinforced the impression that the government had been panicked into the move by this week's critical headlines. On Monday Mr Lamont, in his evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, stressed that the combination of sterling's devaluation and the 1 point cut in rates announced last month provided ample scope for economic recovery. Only one thing had changed by yesterday - the government's announcement of pit closures. Mr Lamont and his colleagues can now do no more than pray the markets do not respond next week by sending the pound into free fall. Putting rates up again would, in the words of one minister, be 'unthinkable'. But so too would be another substantial devaluation. Some in the Tory party - and in the government - are drawing a still more dangerous conclusion. Their fear is that the vacuum at the heart of economic policy left by sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism is being filled not by a rational assessment of priorities but by a series of reflex short-term responses to whatever happens to be the latest crisis. The raison d'etre of economic policy for the past two years - the defeat of inflation - has been unceremoniously dropped in favour of crisis management. Those in the cabinet who believe that sterling can and should be returned to the ERM after a decent interval are fearful that over the next few months the government may once again throw away the prize of medium-term economic stability. Next month Tory MPs will be asked to swallow the bitter medicine of deep cuts in public spending. Many more than 30,000 jobs may be put at risk. The question one minister was asking was whether Mr Lamont would then feel obliged to lop another point off interest rates to make it palatable. Mr Major is convinced that he will survive the storm with his economic and European policies intact, if not unscathed. There is no tangible evidence of a serious threat to his leadership. But in recent weeks his government has looked like a bystander at the mercy of events. It cannot afford another mistake like this week's.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The FT Quarterly Review - At a Glance A new tax year starts in just over nine weeks, heralding the risk that the government may increase direct taxation or reduce the scope of tax shelters. It is therefore time for savers and investors to take advantage of tax-efficient vehicles still available, and to check that their finances are structured in the most tax-efficient way. The winter issue of the FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance, to be published with next Friday's paper and repeated with Saturday's, in the UK only, offers a checklist of things to do with April 5 in mind. The review also includes a survey on Personal Equity Plans.</p>

			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / US Money and Credit: Bonds mark time as slide continues DOWN A little; up a little. Up a little; down a little. Investors' attempts to read the economic runes continued unabated last week but, by the end of the five trading sessions, the US bond market had gone precisely nowhere. On Friday evening, for example, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was yielding 8.21 per cent. That was only slightly different from the 8.24 per cent return offered by the same stock a week earlier. Such lack of progress is scarcely a surprise. The market decided a fortnight ago that the authorities were unlikely to make any further moves on interest rates until the Federal Reserve's policy-forming Open Market Committee met again next month, and little has happened since to shake this conviction. True, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday - but his remarks were opaque at best. Mr Greenspan's general thrust was that the economic slide was continuing, but at a slower rate, and the central bank needed to move cautiously before trying to hasten the recovery with further interest rate cuts. Those comments also coincided with the March statistics on new orders for manufactured durable goods. At first sight, these figures might have been read as a positive signal for the bond market. The 6.2 per cent decline overall was considerably worse than pundits had feared, and bond prices usually rise on negative - and, therefore, anti-inflationary - economic news. However, in this case, closer inspection seemed to suggest that a good part of the decline was centred on aircraft and military hardware. That fact, coupled with Mr Greenspan's caution and prospective Treasury auctions later in the week, limited the market's response. The long bond, for instance, gained less than half a point on Tuesday, with its yield sliding from 8.29 to 8.26 per cent. Indeed, in terms of hard data, there has been no unequivocal evidence on the economy all week. Aside from the durable goods orders, traders confronted grim news from the car companies on recent sales, and a significant increase in the weekly claims for unemployment insurance. On Friday, however, the inflation fears returned when the GNP implicit price deflator showed an abnormally large jump for the first quarter of 1991. This statistic is designed to measure domestically-generated inflation only. In part, the steep quarterly increase was seen as a function of a sharp fall in oil import prices in the first three months of the year, although the extent to which blame could be apportioned here was a matter of debate. That said, however, the figure still gave rise to unease - or at least provided a reason for traders to lighten their holdings at the end of the trading week. Their concerns, moreover, were scarcely allayed when Federal Reserve Board governor, Mr David Mullins, suggested that the authorities needed to see more price data before 'we declare major victory over inflation and say we've made major progress'. In fact, as good a sense as any of where the economy stands can probably be derived from the flood of company earnings announcements. For the past fortnight, a large chunk of corporate America has been unveiling its first-quarter earnings, and it is clear that any economic upturn is tentative at best. Significant sectors - such as the steel industry - are still highly pessimistic about the rest of the year, and even some apparently healthy segments, such as food manufacturing, concede that their relative buoyancy stems largely from overseas operations. As for the week ahead, most attention will focus on the April employment report, due out on Friday. Analysts are predicting that the national unemployment rate will rise to between 6.9 per cent and 7.1 per cent. If correct, that would represent a gain of 0.1 to 0.3 of a percentage point on the March figure, and could entail a contraction of perhaps as much as 275,000 in non-farm payrolls. Everyone concedes that the unemployment trends lag behind any incipient recovery in the economy, but figures of this magnitude would at least indicate some stabilisation. Anything beyond these parameters would be grounds for some excitement. A broker's circular referred to last week should have been attributed to SG Warburg and not James Capel.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Last   1 week   4 wks   12-month   12-month                 Friday    ago     ago      High       Low Fed Funds (weekly average) 5.88    5.63   6.00      11.00     2.00 Three-month Treasury bills   5.76    5.91   5.92       7.94     5.54 Six-month Treasury bills   5.97    6.02   6.04       8.04     5.62 Three-month prime CDs        6.10    6.15   6.27       9.01     5.90 30-day Commercial Paper 5.95    6.00   6.32       8.28     6.05 90-day Commercial Paper 5.95    6.01   6.28       7.98     5.95  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Last     Change              1 week     4 wk.

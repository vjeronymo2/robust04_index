			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Digital claims new chip is fastest in the world Digital Equipment claims to have built the fastest microprocessor in the world. It is the first commercially available chip that can process more than a billion instructions a second and is more than twice as fast as competing chips. The Alpha 21164 'is the fastest chip on the planet', boasts Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive of the US group. The 9.3m transistor Alpha microprocessor delivers performance at speeds previously possible only in large multi-processing systems, such as expensive supercomputers. The achievement comes as Digital is undertaking a drastic restructuring of its operations in an attempt to stem losses that have totalled Dollars 4bn over the past four years. The company announced in July it would cut 20 per cent of its workforce, eliminating about 20,000 jobs over the next 12 months. While Mr Palmer hopes the new Alpha chip will boost customer confidence, industry analysts say some of the company's most prestigious customers are turning to competing computer suppliers. The Alpha chip is recognised as a significant technology breakthrough, but it is not clear that making the world's fastest microprocessor is a solution to Digital's problems. Less than two months ago, Mr Enrico Pesatori, senior vice-president in charge of Digital's core computer systems business, said that setting record computing speeds was no longer Digital's primary goal. 'We will concentrate on segments of the market where there are high volume opportunities,' said Mr Pesatori. 'We will not try to set record speeds with our products. We want to tie our engineering resources to market needs'. This, he acknowledged, would be be significant change for Digital. 'Somehow our engineering resources have become disconnected from the (real needs of) the market.' While Digital is winning the microprocessor speed race, it is far outpaced in terms of market penetration and availability of software by competing chips, such as Intel's Pentium. Moreover, the high costs of semiconductor development and production are a heavy drain on Digital's resources when the company is struggling to cut costs and selling 'non-strategic' assets.</p>

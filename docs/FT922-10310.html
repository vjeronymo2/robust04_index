			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Airbus supervisory board extraordinary meeting The Airbus supervisory board is holding an extraordinary meeting in Frankfurt today to consider giving the four-nation European aircraft consortium the go-ahead to start marketing to potential airline customers a new narrow-body 124-seat airliner, the A319, writes Paul Betts. The new aircraft would be a shorter derivative of the 150-seat twin-engine A320 and would cost around Dollars 300m (Pounds 169.4m) to develop, according to Airbus. It would complement the consortium's range of narrow-body aircraft by introducing a third model in the A320 family which already includes a larger stretched derivative, the A321.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: MFI The outcome of the MFI flotation is going to be an interesting test of investor psychology. On the one hand, the price has been slashed to the point where it starts to look attractive on fundamental grounds. On the other, the essence of a successful stagging operation is that shares should be intercepted by retail investors on their way to the institutions. In MFI's case, the almost total lack of demand from financial intermediaries suggests little interest among wealthier private investors. Taken along with the stunning lack of popular response to the Telegraph flotation, this argues that whatever the British public is saving up for these days, it is not equity issues. It may therefore be a close-run thing whether MFI opens to a worthwhile premium in a fortnight's time. That in turn could do much to determine sentiment towards other new issues, since MFI is seen as one of the most intrinsically attractive companies coming to the market. For the long-term investor in MFI the simple approach is to take up the offer and let the after-market take care of itself.</p>

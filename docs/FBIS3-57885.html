			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stavros Angelidhis] </F>   [Excerpt] There has been no response whatsoever to the  comprehensive proposal for the complete demilitarization of  Cyprus that President Glavkos Kliridhis submitted to the UN  secretary general and the five permanent members of the UN  Security Council. Responding to a question from correspondents  yesterday, the government spokesman said the ambassadors who  received the president's document on 20 December as well as the  UN officials who received it three days earlier had commented  favorably but so far there has been neither a written reply nor  any public statement by the recipients that would even imply  support for the Kliridhis proposal.    The only official position adopted in the meantime was the  Russian Foreign Ministry statement that called upon the parties  to cooperate for the implementation of the confidence-building  measures. Political circles interpreted this statement as  advice for the Cyprus Government to put aside the idea of  demilitarization and focus its attention on the realization of  the confidence-building measures. The same sources also pointed  out that this is the approach being proposed by all the Security  Council members.    The issue was raised yesterday to government spokesman  Ioannis Kasoulidhis, who confirmed that the president would be  sending messages to the leaders of the NATO member countries  concerning his suggestion for the demilitarization of Cyprus.  The messages will be sent on the occasion of the alliance's  summit which will be held on 10 January in Brussels and the  Cyprus issue will be discussed on the summit's sidelines. It  has already been announced that President Bill Clinton and UK  Prime Minister John Major will raise the Cyprus issue at their  private meetings with Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.    It should be noted that three leading NATO countries--the  United States, Britain, and France--are also permanent Security  Council members and received the Kliridhis suggestion 15 days  ago. However, no letter will be sent to Mrs. Ciller because, as  Mr. Kasoulidhis explained, Cyprus does not maintain diplomatic  relations with Turkey.    The spokesman was also asked whether the government has  considered, provided it accepts them, the ways suggested by the  two groups of experts for the implementation of the  confidence-building measures or whether it is prepared to  discuss them.    His response was: "We cannot regard the documents submitted  by the experts as being official or binding on us because the  experts' report does not deal only with the technoeconomic  questions, which fall under their jurisdiction, but also tackles  political arrangements concerning the implementation of the  confidence- building measures and will be the subject of  negotiations if the Turkish side also accepts in principle the  three documents. Official documents are the three documents that  have been proposed by the UN Secretary General." [passage  omitted]</p>

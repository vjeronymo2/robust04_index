			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: UK/US prices comparison suggests poor competition and excessive profits (1) Sir, I do not understand your defensive leader, 'The price is wrong', when the answer, for consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, is such a clear-cut case. Instead of beating around the bush you should and could have pointed your finger at the astonishing lack of competition in the UK and probably elsewhere in the EC. Where your 'soul searching' might pay off is to figure out why there is such a tremendous difference. My hunch is that cartels function more efficiently in Europe than the competitive idea. What other possible reason can there be for the dramatic earnings differential between UK and US supermarkets? Another example: it is outrageous that the price of a ream of plain copier paper in the US is about one-third of that in London. Your proposal of a searching investigation will result, say in two years, in an overwhelming report with which nothing can be done to create a competitive environment. Unless you can come up with a better idea we shall all continue to, as you say, 'pay through the nose'. Ernest A Hilton, 237 Knightsbridge, London SW7 1DJ</p>

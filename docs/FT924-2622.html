			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Eve halts three-year decline with 43% gain EVE GROUP, the USM-quoted electrical and building contractor, turned in a 43 per cent surge in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.81m to Pounds 2.59m in the six months ended September 30, 1992. Turnover improved to Pounds 27.6m (Pounds 19.2m), while earnings per share climbed from 12.8p to 18.3p. The interim dividend is held at 2.7p. Although the group arrested a three-year decline in profits, it warned it would not maintain the improvement in the second half. Mr Gerald Hough, managing director, said results in the second half of last year were exceptionally good and interim profits were boosted by the timing of contract completions. 'Although profits in the current six months will not compare with either of these periods, I am confident Eve will at least match last year's profits at year-end,' he said. Eve benefited from interest income of Pounds 300,000 and steady revenue derived from its core electrical business: contracts were entered into with the National Grid for electrical transmission line systems and more were in place for 1993. There were increased contributions from the group's Trakway division, a supplier of temporary road surfaces and bridges, and electrical contractor Arclive. The property development division was 'dormant' but could break even by year-end. Mr Hough said Eve had cash reserves of Pounds 7m, and was keen to make new acquisitions in related businesses. The group bought Graham Brothers, an electrical systems group, for Pounds 2m in October.</p>

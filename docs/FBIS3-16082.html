He said that since the deputies were elected from all  population groups they expressed today's public opinion. He  reiterated his readiness to actively work with the new  parliament for the benefit of Kazakhstan and its multinational  populace. He noted that the elections mirrored democracy in  Kazakhstan today. "We have not come up to European standards  yet, we are on our way to reaching them."    He reported that most CSCE observers, including those from  France, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Central Asia, had described  the voting in Kazakhstan as very democratic. He noted that only  some of the CSCE monitors had held "a news conference unknown to  us" without waiting for the election outcome. They alleged at  the news conference that many irregularities had gone on record  at the polls. Such conclusions, in Nazarbayev's opinion, were  improper.    He reported that 37 parties and movements had taken part in  the parliamentary elections in Kazakhstan. Representatives of  12 nationalities were chosen.    On the so-called state list of candidates, criticized by  international observers most of all, the president remarked that  the nominees had been selected on an alternative basis. In his  words, the state list featured scientists, lawyers, economists,  representatives of different nations and ethnic groups, women,  and members of various parties and movements.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Keating to ease labour powers AUSTRALIA'S Prime Minister Paul Keating yesterday signalled that relaxation of the centralised industrial relations system would be a top priority for the re-elected Labor government. Mr Keating used his first public appearance since Labor's surprise victory in last month's election to foreshadow a further weakening of the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC), the statutory labour tribunal. The IRC relaxed its supervision of national wage bargaining two years ago after strong pressure from the government for a move to direct bargaining between companies and employees. However, the impact of company-level bargaining has been limited by the IRS's continuing right to veto agreements, the complexity of overlapping state and federal regulations, and the exclusion of non-unionised workforces. Only about 800 company-level agreements have been signed. Mr Keating said the IRC was unsuited to the 'flexible' industrial relations system envisaged by the government, which would reduce national awards to a 'safety net' for workers unable to reach workplace agreements. The government is expected to introduce legislation later this year to weaken the legal standing of the IRC and reduce its powers to order compulsory arbitration. However, the government may have difficulty in forcing legislation through the Senate, the upper house of parliament, where the balance of power is held by minority parties opposed to reform.</p>

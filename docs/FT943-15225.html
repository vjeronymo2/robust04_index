			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Mercury to seek review of BT fees Mercury Communications is to lobby the government to review the fees it pays British Telecommunications if BT's market share falls below 85 per cent. BT has said the fees are needed to share the cost of upgrading the network. Mercury claims the contributions are in addition to fees it and other competitors pay for network use. It added: 'Mercury is already paying more than Pounds 35m to BT because we've essentially won too many customers. This figure will nearly double in the next year.'</p>

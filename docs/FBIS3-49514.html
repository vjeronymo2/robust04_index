			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] I still have not dispelled all my doubts concerning  the conviction that the Partnership for Peace leads to NATO  membership, Andrzej Olechowski, head of the Polish diplomatic  delegation, has said in Prague. In Olechowski's view, all the  decisions made at the Brussels' summit were, after all,  beneficial for Poland. In his opinion the Partnership for Peace  raises the security level in such a sense that it brings us  closer to NATO. Among other things, we will have access to the  procedures and military technology of the pact. In time, we  gradually will be getting access to early warning systems and  the exchange of intelligence available to the pact, Olechowski  said.    However, because of the fact that no timetable was defined  for Poland joining western structures, Olechowski said that he  considered it to be a Polish failure connected with the NATO  summit in Brussels.</p>

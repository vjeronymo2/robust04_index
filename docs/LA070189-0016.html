			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARLETTE ON GUNS  </P> <P> If it is fair for cartoonist Marlette to depict Beirut, Haiti and Washington,  D.C., as "N.R.A. Dream Vacations" (Editorial Page, June 24), it is also fitting  to portray China under (Chinese senior leader) Deng Xiaoping as a gun-grabber's  paradise.  </P> <P> The good news is that Beijing has gun control laws second to none; the bad news  is that the murders, the brutality, the roundups, the terror, the torture and  the executions continue unabated.  </P> <P> Given an alternative, the unarmed martyrs of Tian An Men Square would probably  choose Beirut, Haiti or Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> TOM NICHOLS  </P> <P> Los Osos  </P></p>

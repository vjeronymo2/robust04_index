			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Equity Markets: Other Markets FRANKFURT The German bank reporting season continues with figures due on Friday from Dresdner Bank, the country's second largest bank after Deutsche. The consensus is for a rise in net profits of about 30 per cent. At the 10-month stage, the bank unveiled operating profits up by 16.2 per cent. The supervisory board of Daimler-Benz meets on Thursday to decide the dividend on 1993's results. PARIS Suez, the financial and industrial holding company, is due to report this week. Mr Gerard Worms, the chairman, has confirmed that the group returned to 'modest' profit last year after making its first loss in 1992 due to the recession and its heavy debts. Alcatel Alsthom is also expected to announce 1993 figures during the week. Mr Pierre Suard, the telecommunications group's chairman, has already said that overall sales fell by 3.4 per cent in 1993 when he forecast static profits of around FFr7bn. AMSTERDAM The reporting season is drawing to a close although figures are expected today from KBB, the department store group. UBS forecasts a 20 per cent rise in 1993 net profits, on a sales increase of 2 per cent. The bank says that KBB has had a good year with the Hema chain benefiting from a more focused product range, M&amp;S Mode still expanding by some 10 per cent a year and FAO Schwarz having discovered a more successful, larger format which is enabling it to improve results. MADRID Wednesday is the final day for the banks BBV, Argentaria, Santander and Popular to register their intentions to bid for Banesto, whose auction is scheduled to be completed by May 10. TOKYO Although the start of the new business year signals an end to the corporate profit-taking that depressed prices in recent weeks, the market is likely to remain volatile on the uncertain outlook for the currency and the domestic political situation. Speculation that the US will keep up pressure on trade has triggered heavy buying of the yen. As a result, equity investors are likely to hold back from buying because the strength of the yen could delay the recovery of the economy later this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Otawara, Tochigi Pref., Jan. 2 KYODO -- Former  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe on Sunday [2 January] voiced  opposition to dissolving the House of Representatives if  political reform bills fail to be enacted before the January 29  close of the current Diet session.    "There is no time for dissolution," said Watanabe, leader of  the third largest faction in the opposition Liberal Democratic  Party, citing domestic economic factors.    "If (general) elections take place, Diet approval of the  state budget for the next fiscal year would be in may, and pump  priming measures will be postponed further."    Rather than concentrate now on the divisive issue of  political reform, Watanabe again urged that four pending reform  bills be carried over to the next regular Diet session, which  convenes in late January.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on December 24 apologized  to  the public for failing to achieve political reform by his  self-imposed yearend deadline, and vowed anew to pass the reform  legislation by the time the current Diet session ends January 29.    A special political reform committee of the House of  Councillors only began deliberations on the government's four  political reform bills on December 24, 36 days after the House  of Representatives passed the package.    Remarking on another contentious issue during a lecture here  Sunday, Watanabe said the consumption tax should not be raised  two or three years after a planned income tax cut is carried out.    Rather the consumption tax rate, now standing at 3 percent,  should be raised once signs of economic recovery are evident,  Watanabe said.</p>

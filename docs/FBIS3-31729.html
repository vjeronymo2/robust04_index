			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent </F> Smallholders Party, by Lorinc Szendrei in Budapest; date not  given: "The Smallholders Will Not Again Yield Precedence to  Others -- Jozsef Torgyan on Being Qualified as Extremist,  Trustworthiness, and the Constitutionality of the Government"]    [Excerpts] Istvan Csurka [cochairman of the Hungarian  Justice and Life Party -- MIEP] and Jozsef Torgyan will hold a  rally on 20 February in the Budapest Sports Hall. Is the right  wing the next to join forces after the liberals' agreement and  the left wing bloc? A straight answer is not yet forthcoming.  [passage omitted]    [Szendrei] Why are you appearing in a joint meeting with  Istvan Csurka with whom you have had many debates? It seems  that, after the former internal and external allies of the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] were expelled from paradise,  they now have found each other.    [Torgyan] I do not have 2.1 million forints to give a  massive  speech in the Budapest Sports Hall. This is why I accepted  someone else's invitation. Rather than Csurka, it was Ferenc  Morvai, leader of the Citizens' Interest Protection  Organization, who invited me. You can see that I am also talking  to you, but we cannot at all be accused of having the same  political platform.    [Szendrei] You know that an interview is different from a  demonstrative political rally. I do not believe that you would  also jointly appear with Viktor Orban [chairman of the  Federation of Young Democrats] at an event. The electors  consider all jointly held speeches to be political gestures. To  be naive: Is the meeting of the smallholders and the MIEP  really the result of a purely financial constraint, without any  intention to cooperate?    [Torgyan] In politics, it is impossible to use the same  categoric notions as in mathematics for example. Therefore, the  rally organized for 20 February has to be accepted as it is.  Nothing needs to be added. For a politician, there can be no  greater honor than to talk in front of crowd that is as large as  possible. As far as I know, there are 12,000 seats in the  Sports Hall, but the experts will set up loudspeakers in the  corridors and then as many as 100,000 people will be able to  hear us. [passage omitted]    [Szendrei] Whatever way we look at it, Csurka and his party  are on the right of the Hungarian political spectrum at the  moment. Many people say that the slightly left-wing pre-war  smallholders party may shift to the far right under Torgyan's  leadership.    [Szendrei] You are using completely different terms from  what would be appropriate. Before the war, the smallholders  party was indeed a left-wing party -- compared with [governor]  Horthy's right-wing views. However, right after 1945, we were  to the right of communism. Therefore, there is no point in  qualifying us or other parties in this way. [passage omitted]  We are not extremists. I repeat that we will not meet Csurka,  it is only our host that we have common. I will face the  challenge. We can assess our abilities in rhetoric.    [Szendrei] I must admit that, even now, you do not give in  very easily.    [Torgyan] Thank you. Therefore, I have to enter into this  dialogue, just as I do not decline dialogue with other  politicians. This is also part of political culture but we do  not have any plans to do with Csurka. [passage omitted]    [Szendrei] You are also said to have betrayed the coalition.  A government has to be formed after the elections. How certain  can the contenders be that you would be a reliable partner?    [Torgyan] I do not think reliability should be approached  from this angle. We made a coalition agreement [in 1990, at the  previous elections] which, contrary to rumors, was in writing.  It was the MDF that violated it. This is the reason we  criticized the top leadership. We had a serious debate with  [former prime minister] Jozsef Antall because he did not fulfill  the agreement. This was his way of repaying the fact that, in  the second round, we had withdrawn our candidates in many places  in the MDF's favor. Without us, the MDF would not have doubled  its votes in the second round.    [Szendrei] In other words, it was the smallholders who  helped the MDF come to government and Torgyan helped Antall come  to power?    [Torgyan] This is it, precisely. Returning to gratefulness:  On the night it came to power, the MDF made a secret pact. I  returned home after midnight and was told that a couple had been  looking for me. I later realized that these were [then MDF  deputies] Imre Konya and Katalin Kutrucz. At that time, they  had already signed the agreement with the Alliance of Free  Democrats. This is what they were going to tell me. They had  made a pact with the opposition behind our backs. Therefore, it  is only us who can raise the issue of reliability.    [Szendrei] In other words, the smallholders generously  allowed the MDF to win. This time, they will not offer this to  anyone, rather, they are certain that they will win the  elections....    [Torgyan] That is correct. No one can yet tell the size of  the victory. I think it is possible that the smallholders will  have an astonishingly big victory. The population is so bitter  and they have so much faith in us that even this is possible.  If we win the elections at whatever proportion, then it will  not be us who has to look for partners. Rather, the partners  will be seeking us because people do not like to be left out of  power. There are not many Jozsef Torgyans in the world, and I  have never been running after ministerial office. [sentence as  published]    [Szendrei] Are you so self-assured or humble?    [Torgyan] I said that we were deceived in the coalition,  because we had been promised a change of regime, a big clean-up  from top to bottom, the return of landed property, and so on.  They did not fulfill these promises, and so there was nothing  to agree about with those in power. On the contrary! After  this, let me ask if those in power who implement a completely  different program from what they had promised in their election  program are constitutional.    [Szendrei] Do you question the government's  constitutionality?    [Torgyan] Election fraud can never be seen as a  constitutional procedure anywhere. And this is what the  government has done through its politics.    [Szendrei] Where do you, as a jurist, find a paragraph in  the Constitution on this?    [Torgyan] That is a different question. What I question is  an issue of constitutionality, rather than a political issue.  The basic principles of this could be laid down in the  Constitution. I think that even a referendum is possible on  this issue. Therefore, I restate that this government is in  power contrary to the Constitution because it has deceived the  electors. If they had said that "the cleaning up means that we  will take money from your pockets, we will have dealings with  the communists, and we will participate in the communists's  preservation of power and assets," and they had received the  votes after this, then I would not at all object. In that case,  they would be ruling lawfully.  <H5>  Capitalist Communists </H5>   [Szendrei] We can read the public opinion polls and hear the  views of politicians and the public that the left wing is  becoming stronger. What will the smallholders party do after a  left-wing victory?    [Torgyan] This danger does not exist. People who have  listened to what I said can see that the communists had been  speaking up against the curse of private property until they  relieved society from this curse. They made themselves into  owners. The former party chiefs would be foolish to return to  their party positions.    [Szendrei] What kind of government would you consider to be  a strong government in the coming four years?    [Torgyan] We have to start from our program. People cannot  bear the insecurity of existence, the level of the loss of  assets, and the obvious anguish of unemployment. A government  that is able to make fundamental changes will be a strong  government.    [Szendrei] Therefore, in your view, the smallholders party  will win the elections. As the party's chairman, you may even  become prime minister. Do you think that you are the most  suitable person to be prime minister?    [Torgyan] Not at all. However, it is a fact that I am the  only politician who can mobilize really large masses. In other  parties, there are not any charismatic people who are accepted  by the people.</p>

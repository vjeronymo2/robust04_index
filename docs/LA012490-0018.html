			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MODERN AMERICAN CHURCH NEEDS NO SCARLET LETTER;  </P> <P> LUTHERANS: THE ORDINATION OF PRACTICING HOMOSEXUALS HAS BEEN MET WITH AN  INTOLERANCE THAT IGNORES THE ROLE RELIGION MUST PLAY IN TODAY'S SOCIETY.  </P> <P> The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is disturbed by the ordination in  San Francisco last week of a lesbian couple and a gay man who will not vow  celibacy. No institution should shrink from controversy and the church is no  exception. Martin Luther's 95 Theses in 1517 marking the beginning of German  Protestantism were greeted with neither mildness nor acceptance.  </P> <P> What is peculiar is that in a church body traditionally and primarily regulated  by elected, ordained pastors, there is widespread concern among the laity on  this issue. Martin Marty, foremost American church historian and a Lutheran  himself, suggests that the majority of Lutheran laity side with the official  church policy -- that practicing homosexuals should not be ordained.  </P> <P> The basis for the policy is that sexual activity should be permitted only  within the traditional marriage bond of women and men. Biblical admonitions are  found in Leviticus in the Old Testament and in Paul's condemnation of  homosexuality in the New Testament. The fact that most contemporary  parishioners agree with the current policy is not surprising, since the  Lutheran Church in the United States has been characterized and influenced by  the conservatism of Northern European immigrants.  </P> <P> But the church's views reflect pervasive and intolerant social mores. Social  judgment and hypocrisy of the kind that Nathaniel Hawthorne described in "The  Scarlet Letter" -- centered around a Puritan community that rejected an  otherwise heroic woman for her single act of adultery -- need to be recognized  and avoided by the modern church.  </P> <P> Yet even in my lifetime, the church's code of behavior has become less  judgmental and more accepting. I grew up in a Lutheran parsonage and recall  when I could not attend a theologically innocuous Ma and Pa Kettle movie on  Sundays and had to remove my colored nail polish for the sabbath. I also  remember -- only 15 years ago -- a Midwestern woman of the Missouri Synod  stating that she was showing disrespect to God by not wearing a hat to  services. More significant is the example of a Lutheran pastor 30 years ago who  was defrocked and disallowed from serving in any type of parish role because he  was divorced. Today, such "improprieties" are overlooked.  </P> <P> But how long will it take for the church to accept practicing homosexuals among  its clergy?  </P> <P> While its people move -- too slowly -- toward greater tolerance, the  fundamental beliefs of love and brotherhood that the church espouses are  diluted and become less credible. When this wrenching controversy within the  church is resolved, the church can become a stronger force in the world. Here  is an occasion where people can resist harsh and narrow judgment and accept  clergy no matter what their human sexual practices. The church needs to return  to more important concerns of salvation and redemption.  </P> <P> The ordination of practicing homosexuals is not an issue of good and evil, or  really a fundamental theological concern at all. It is an issue of individual  choice and social acceptance, a point most Lutherans refuse to acknowledge.  </P> <P> What the Evangelical Luthern Church in America -- and all Christians -- should  practice is the Greek ideal of koinonia -- unequivocal love of God and fellow  humans. If the church is going to flourish and survive in a modern world,  authentic love needs to extend beyond the bounds of current social mores. That  love is inclusive, unrestricted, tolerant and generous.  </P></p>

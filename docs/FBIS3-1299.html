Although this was lower than the number recorded in the closing  months of 1993, the HRC noted that passions were running high in  the province and that continued attacks had created a high level  of frustration and tension.    The HRC said the Midlands area had witnessed the most deaths  with 64 killings. There were four major attacks in the area.  At Richmond 12 people were killed in a single attack and at  Creighton 15 African National Congress supporters were killed.    In the greater Durban area there were 54 deaths; in northern  Natal five; 44 on the north coast; and 13 on the south coast.</p>

			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / IBM opens 'office of the future' MR Nick Temple, IBM's UK chief executive, today opens the company's first building in the UK to implement fully its 'office of the future' concept. Many staff will have no desks. Half the 120 employees at the IBM North East England regional headquarters in Newcastle upon Tyne have been equipped with laptop computers and mobile telephones so they no longer need to travel to the office every day. The staff, who work in sales, client support, servicing and engineering, use the equipment to communicate by telephone from their homes and cars or their clients' offices with IBM's computer network, accessing information and messages. The concept, dubbed Smart - Space, Morale and Remote Technology - by IBM, has been partly introduced by the company at its London and Glasgow offices, but Newcastle, where employees have just moved from old premises to new accommodation, is the first to switch entirely to the concept for all field staff. Mr Peter Austin, Newcastle location manager, said the staff response had been enthusiastic. It allowed them to work more flexibly, with greater control over their hours.</p>

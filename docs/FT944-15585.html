			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Minister resists roads budget cut Dr Brian Mawhinney, the Transport secretary, is resisting big cuts in next year's road-building programme, in spite of his determination to promote policies which are more sympathetic to environmental factors. As Whitehall departments prepare to finalise their spending plans for next year the Treasury is putting pressure on the Department of Transport to reduce its annual Pounds 2bn roads budget, saying that Dr Mawhinney is in the throes of a re-examination of policy. But Dr Mawhinney is understood to have warned that it would be irresponsible to carry out sweeping cuts in road building next year because of commitments that the government has already made, and that any reductions in the programme should be deferred. According to transport department officials about Pounds 900m of the annual budget is spent on the maintenance of existing roads, and this cannot be reduced in any event. They say that much of the remaining Pounds 1.1bn has already been earmarked for specific projects. Instead, the department is saying that any cuts should come in the second and third years of the Treasury's public spending projections. This would allow the roads programme to gradually adapt to a shift in priorities away from road building. A senior official said: 'You simply couldn't cut more than Pounds lbn from the programme in year one. That would produce the most absurd kind of cuts, with motorways being half-finished and roads ending in the middle of nowhere.' At the Conservative party conference last week Dr Mawhinney talked of the need to achieve 'a better balance between the economic benefits of motoring, the public's right to choose to drive and what I have called social and physical environmental protection'.</p>

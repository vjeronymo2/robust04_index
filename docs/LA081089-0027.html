			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ABORTION ISSUE AT THE FAIR  </P> <P> While my wife and I had a very pleasant time at the recent San Fernando Valley  Fair, it was somewhat marred by the presence of an anti-abortion exhibit.  </P> <P> The fact that I disagree with their point of view is not the issue. The fair is  supposed to be an agricultural exhibition, not a political or religious event.  Considering the turmoil surrounding the abortion issue, someone at the fair's  booking office obviously decided to make a statement.  </P> <P> I'm making a statement too. We will not attend the fair in the future if this  continues. Or maybe we'll bring a vocal contingent of pro-choice people with us  and raise the barn roof.  </P> <P> HOWARD LEVINE  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

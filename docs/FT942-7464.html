			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Mack Trucks forecasts return to profit Mack Trucks, the US subsidiary of France's Renault Vehicules Industriels, should record a profit this year after five years of losses, Mr Elios Pascual, chairman, said yesterday. According to Mr Pascual, productivity gains and restructuring measures, combined with the upturn in the US truck market, should mean a net profit of Dollars 20m-Dollars 25m this year. This compares with a loss of Dollars 36m in 1993, and a net deficit of Dollars 182m the previous year. 'In less than three years Mack has gone from monthly losses of about Dollars 20m to a profit of Dollars 3m-Dollars 4m in March and April, having returned to profit in February,' said Mr Pascual. He said the company was now able to contribute to the results of RVI, the truck and bus arm of the state-owned Renault group. The recovery in results partly reflects an upturn in demand and prices in the US. Sales are expected to increase to about Dollars 2bn this year, compared with Dollars 1.7bn in 1993. But Mr Pascual said the improvement mainly reflected the restructuring at the group, which he said would allow a sustained, rather than a cyclical, recovery. 'We now need to sell about 20,000 vehicles to break even, compared with 40,000 three years ago,' he said. This was achieved through cost cutting, productivity gains, and the closure of some factories. Purchasing costs have been reduced by between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent a year, according to Mr Pascual, while productivity has increased by 41 per cent over the past three years. He added that the cyclical nature of the US market meant it was necessary to continue improving productivity. 'The market can decline just as quickly as it has recovered,' he said, forecasting a fall in the market from next year. But he pointed out that the company was aiming to reduce its break-even production point to 17,000 vehicles by the end of the year and to 15,000 at the end of 1995. Despite the company's cost-cutting measures, however, Mr Pascual said the company had maintained its investment in new products and R&amp;D. 'Between 1994 and 1997 we will invest Dollars 40m-Dollars 45m a year,' he said. The group will also develop its commercial network in the western US and in Mexico.</p>

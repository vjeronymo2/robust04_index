			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HAWAII SHOWS SDSU WHAT 'BETTER' MEANS  </P> <P> Before the season, San Diego State was considered by the conference coaches to  be one of the up-and-coming teams in the Western Athletic Conference.  </P> <P> The Aztecs, in their second season under veteran Coach Jim Brandenburg, were  expected to field their most competitive team in five seasons and possibly  break into the upper half of the standings.  </P> <P> But after a 73-60 loss to Hawaii Thursday night in front of 3,261 at the San  Diego Sports Arena, it is clear that it is the Rainbows, not the Aztecs, who  have solidified a position as one of the conference's emerging teams.  </P> <P> The victory was Hawaii's fourth in a row, its longest winning streak in nearly  three seasons, and assured the Rainbows of their first winning season since the  1982-83 team finished 17-11. Hawaii (15-9, 8-5 in WAC play) is in third place,  only 1 1/2 games behind first-place New Mexico (16-7, 9-3).  </P> <P> The loss was the Aztecs' ninth in their past 11 games, dropping them into  eighth place and setting up a matchup for last place Saturday at Wyoming  (11-14, 3-8).  </P> <P> This was a game the Aztecs (10-13, 4-9), despite falling behind 8-0 in the  first 4 minutes, had a chance to win, but they threw the opportunity away with  a series of turnovers.  </P> <P> "We just stopped executing our offense," senior forward Shawn Bell said. "We  wanted this game real bad. We played hard. But just broke down when it  counted."  </P> <P> The wasted opportunities came after the Aztecs, having drawn as close as three  points on eight occasions, drew to within two at 46-44 with 10:06 to play.  </P> <P> But SDSU turned the ball over on five of six possessions -- three in a row --  during a 3 1/2-minute stretch to give the Rainbows an opening. Hawaii used the  breaks to go on a 7-2 run and take a 53-46 lead at 5:54.  </P> <P> "We gave them too many easy baskets off transition," Brandenburg said. "We  didn't do a good job of getting back at the other end."  </P> <P> The Aztecs did pull to within six points at 61-55 with 2:26 to play, but the  Rainbows scored 12 of the last 17 points on their way to their first sweep of  the two-game season series since 1979-80.  </P> <P> Junior forward Terry Houston's 19 points led five Hawaii players in double  figures. Houston also had 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Junior guard Michael Best had 20 points and 7 rebounds for the Aztecs. Senior  center Mitch McMullen had a career-high 14 rebounds and added 9 points, but his  effectiveness was limited by foul trouble that kept him on the bench for the  final 8:48 of the first half.  </P> <P> McMullen's difficulties were matched by the troubles of Reggie Cross, Hawaii's  leading scorer and rebounder. Cross, who played only 23 minutes because of foul  trouble, was held to six points, 14.3 below his average and only the second  time this season he has been held out of double figures.  </P> <P> "Those two guys neutralized each other with all the pushing and banging  underneath," said Riley Wallace, Hawaii's second-year coach.  </P> <P> The Aztecs, as they have done in several games of late, wasted no time putting  themselves behind. They missed their first eight shots from the field and first  two from the free throw line in falling behind, 8-0, in the first 4 minutes.  </P> <P> Hawaii made the Aztecs' comeback task more difficult by applying a soft  fullcourt press designed more to keep SDSU from getting comfortably into its  offense than to force turnovers. Wallace said the pressure was a reaction to  the Aztecs' loss of point guard Bryan Williams, who was suspended for the  season after his arrest last week for petty theft.  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> San Diego State concludes its home schedule next week with nonconference games  against Florida International Wednesday and U.S. International Saturday.  </P></p>

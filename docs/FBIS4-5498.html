			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Planned hikes in utility  and other public service charges are unlikely to put a damper on  the economy, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [8  April].    The government has allowed in its economic forecast for a  1.5  percent rise in domestic prices stemming from the hikes provided  for in the fiscal 1994 budget, Fujii told a regular news  conference after a morning cabinet meeting.    The cabinet meeting reconfirmed the need to have related  public utilities firms streamline their operations to avoid  unnecessary rate hikes but did not decide to stop or squeeze the  planned hikes.    Considering rate hikes proposed aside from the budget, Fujii  said related ministries and agencies will decide on these based  on the policy reconfirmed at the cabinet meeting. "There won't  be much," he said.</p>

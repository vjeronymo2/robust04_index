			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F> Maria Latella in Rome on 31 March: "Berlusconi: There Are Still  Matters To Discuss"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [Passage omitted] [Latella] Mr.  Berlusconi, have all the problems with [Northern League  Secretary] Umberto Bossi and the League really been resolved?    [Berlusconi] No, no. We have a whole series of discussions  and meetings planned. I am confident, as always, but there is a  whole series of different issues that need to be discussed.    [Latella] Newspaper editorial offices are busy guessing  about  the composition of the government, rumors are circulating...  According to the latest one, Ambassador Sergio Romano is to  become foreign minister.    [Berlusconi] Well, I can tell you this: There has been no  discussion about ministers with anyone. All the rumors that are  circulating are without foundation. Nothing of what I have read  corresponds in the slightest to the possible ministers suggested  by the three leaders or, rather, by the three, four, or five  leaders of the alliance.    [Latella] Is it possible to make a suggestion of how many  ministries will go to the League?    [Berlusconi] The League will have its ministers, the  National  Alliance will have its ministers, and we will have our  ministers, but they will all be people who do not feature among  the names that have appeared in the newspapers. You see, we  have not yet talked about individuals, because we are talking  about substantive matters. I think this is the right time to  discuss matters of substance; the names will come later.    [Latella] What will be the differences between the  government  that you intend to form and its predecessors? Is it true that  you will reduce the number of ministries?    [Berlusconi] I have a very clear idea, and if I am to be  prime minister, because there could be an "if," the differences  will be many and profound. I have a clear program, but it is  still to early to talk about that. [passage omitted]</p>

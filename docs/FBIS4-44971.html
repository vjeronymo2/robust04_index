			<p>CSO     [Text] London--AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked a Yemeni writer and  intellectual to record his view of events. He contributed the  following bitterly satiric article reviewing the war of words  that went on from the beginning of the crisis until its eruption  in total war.    What does unity have to do with a sandwich?    You have a right to ask this question at this particular  time: for the Yemen crisis is at its most critical juncture, and  the battle is at its fiercest between proponents of unity and  supporters of tashtir ("slicing in half"). The latter  term, which has engaged the attention of Yemeni politics for a  long time, comes from the world of the Classical Arabic  sandwich. The term is one of the achievements of the  Arabic Language Academy, which decided once upon a time to  Arabicize the foreign word sandwich and came up with  the phrase,"top slice and bottom slice with a filling in  between" [al-shatir wa al-mashtur wa al-kamakh  baynahuma]."    The phrase never caught on anywhere in the Arab world,  except  in Yemen, where the blundering of the shatir [a pun  on three meanings: "divider," "shrewd person," and "withdrawer"]  and the injustice to the mashtur ["that which has  been divided"] have brought the country to the verge of  tashtir ["cutting in half"]; and this at a time when  unity and secession have come to mean the same thing to grieving  citizens, who go to sleep with an old promise and wake up with a  new lie.    Apart from the term tashtir ["cutting in half"],  all the terms of the Yemen crisis invite deep philosophic  reflection. Everyone is fighting to defend "legitimacy," which  in the South means "party legitimacy," and in the North means  "tribal legitimacy." The only term stranger than "legitimacy" is  the phrase "foreign fingers" [i.e., foreign influences], which  shifts meaning from day to day. Sometimes it refers to  legitimate aid; at other times it refers to objectionable  interventions. To these terminological marvels you may add the  phrase "national dialogue." Everywhere else it means the need to  use the tongue; here, however, the politicians love to dialogue  with cannons, swords, tanks, and land, naval, and air weapons.    As for the tanks that fueled the latest battles, observers  have been at a loss about how to categorize the Southern  brigades located in the North and the Northern brigades located  in the South. Were these forces positioned to defend unity, or  were they hostages in the hands of two sides who deal in every  coin except good faith?    Although military thinking says that tanks require a large  crew, technicians, and supplies, here tanks were like trucks  running aimlessly at the whim of their drivers, who drove them  until the fuel ran out and then went looking for someone to tow  them to the nearest station. If no one could be found, the  driver would go off to his fate and leave the tank to its fate  of becoming an ideal storage bin for fodder.    Something laughable in our country--how many things there  are  in it to make you laugh until you cry!--is that the military  brigade is no better organized than the tank. Theoretically a  brigade consists of about 10,000 persons--except here, where a  brigade consists of a few hundred, sometimes a few dozen. They  swear allegiance to the state, but in a pinch they follow  instructions emanating from the province or tribe. The purpose  of the Pledge and Accord Document, the most recent Yemeni term  before the fighting, was to prevent militarization of the  crisis. Now the document is fulfilling precisely the opposite  role, accelerating the factors that would make for a military  resolution. It is as if its signatories had promised and agreed  not to implement a single letter of the document; which they  indeed have done, in accordance with the principles of our way  of promising and agreeing--especially when the agreements and  promises are under Jordanian sponsorship.    Although the concept of "association of ideas"  [tada'iyat] belongs to the novel, particularly the  stream-of-consciousness novel represented by Virginia Woolf, the  Yemen crisis, which has used up almost all the technical terms  of literature, has also commandeered this term among others. The  term tada'iyat is now being used in the sense of  "developments." The term is being so used by all the parties,  who fight with one hand and with the other hand draft  communiques demanding a halt to military and media  tada'iyat. What is so beautiful about Yemeni feuds is  their polished style. Your foe charges you with lying, cheating,  thievery, and treason, but he does not forget to add the title  "brother" to your respected name, so that you become "Brother  Cheater," or "Brother Traitor," or any other kind of brother  plus epithet. None of these epithets has anything to do with the  concept of brotherhood, which the fraternal enemies in Yemen  have worn out in ways never imagined by the Brothers Karamazov  or by Dostoyevsky, who could add 10 volumes to his immortal  novel merely by paying a short visit to the land of fraternal  enemies who never tire of talking about the concept of the rule  of law--in a country desperately seeking law.</p>

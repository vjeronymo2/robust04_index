			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOTS OF OPTIONS COOKING FOR BACK-YARD CHEFS  </P> <P> When Tony Higson throws another shrimp on his barby, he doesn't pollute the  air.  </P> <P> Charcoal lighter fluid was banned in Australia three years ago -- because of  safety concerns, not smog -- and consumers don't seem to miss it, said Higson,  who represents a company that manufactures Blazer, an alcohol-based gel that is  squirted onto charcoal.  </P> <P> "Products like this are completely safe, odor-free and pollution free. Everyone  uses them in Australia," Higson said.  </P> <P> The fire-lighting gel, which is expected to be available in Southern California  stores in a few months, is one of several barbecuing techniques that satisfy  the requirements of a new regulation that bans the sale of polluting barbecue  products.  </P> <P> Lighter fluid and self-starting charcoal will have to be removed from store  shelves beginning in January, 1992, unless manufacturers can reformulate them  so they emit 80% less pollution, according to the new rule imposed Friday by  the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  </P> <P> In honor of the unusual item on the agenda, several manufacturers showed off  their smog-free cooking techniques by grilling hotdogs and sausages for  breakfast in the AQMD's parking lot.  </P> <P> "We all grew up with the fluid. It's second nature to use it. But we need to  find alternatives if we are to have an environment in the future," said William  Brady of Meteor Inc., a Monrovia company that makes electric starters and  chimney starters, two devices that meet the requirements of the low-smog rule.  </P> <P> "If people know about the alternatives that already exist, they'd use them," he  said.  </P> <P> James Lents, the AQMD's executive officer, said the alternatives are not only  cleaner, but can save consumers money.  </P> <P> Most gas and propane grills cost several hundred dollars, but they are cheaper  than charcoal and lighter fluid in the long run. Electric starters for charcoal  grills and chimney starters -- metal cylinders in which coals are piled on top  of crumpled newspaper -- cost about $10 apiece.  </P> <P> The AQMD estimates that each cookout using lighter fluid can cost up to $1.59,  while an electric starter or chimney costs 60 to 65 cents per use, propane  costs 12 cents and natural gas grills cost 6 cents. Starting gels and fire  chips are also less than lighter fluid, the agency estimates.  </P> <P> "I don't even consider it a small sacrifice by consumers because there are so  many products that are environmentally cleaner," said Riverside County  Supervisor Norton Younglove, the AQMD's chairman. "At most it's a minor  inconvenience."  </P> <P> Retailers say the options work just as well as lighter fluid.  </P> <P> "People who buy the chimneys really like them," said George McHarris, owner of  The Village Patio Shops in Irvine. "It may take a few minutes longer, but it  works just as well." MARLA CONE  </P></p>

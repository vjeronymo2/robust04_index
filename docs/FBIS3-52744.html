			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A group of Jordanian figures has sent a memorandum  to House of Representatives Speaker Tahir al-Masri and members  of the House. The memorandum values the House's efforts to  spread freedom and democracy in order to fulfill the  requirements of the pan-Arab project.    The memorandum refers to the continued detention by the  Syrian authorities of a number of Jordanian political prisoners,  including pan-Arab struggler Dafi al-Jam'ani, who has been  imprisoned for 23 years without trial, and without any charges  being brought against him, and who is considered to be the  world's longest-held political prisoner.    The memorandum says that al-Jam'ani is suffering from ill  health, and appeals to the House of Representatives to take the  initiative to urge the Syrian president to immediately release  al-Jam'ani and other political prisoners so that they can return  to their families after almost three decades of imprisonment.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UN chiefs stand firm on action in Somalia THE United Nations made plain yesterday that there would be no weakening of its resolve to meet the challenge of Somali warlords despite widespread criticism of military actions that have caused much bloodshed. Addressing criticisms, especially by the Italian government, Mr James Jonah, senior official for African affairs, said that if the UN were seen to back down this would have a 'devastating' effect on all its peace-keeping operations now and in future. It would mean it could not sustain an enforcement operation mounted by the Security Council under the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter. He rejected a contention that the UN took sides in Somalia, singling out General Mohamed Farah Aideed as the main villain. In an enforcement operation, 'you go after the delinquent side' he added at a UN press conference. The Sierra Leone-born official strongly defended UN actions and indicated that the criticisms would not be allowed to sway policy. Any weakening of UN resolve would produce repercussions among the other warlords and return the country to the chaos that preceded the US military intervention last December. As Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, prepared for crucial talks next week with a senior Italian government envoy to try to resolve what Mr Jonah called 'a fracas', officials denied that he had apologised to Rome over recent events. Mr Jonah mentioned that there had been parallel problems with some other contingents, but the difference was that Italy had 'gone public'. He confirmed that the Italians had not been invited to join the force in Somalia, their former colony, but had pressed to be included - eventually providing the third largest contingent, of about 2,400 soldiers. Responding to criticism of what has been called the dominant role of the US, which has 4,000 troops in the country and a quick reaction force of 1,200 offshore, Mr Jonah asked: 'Why is it such a surprise?' When the UN force took over in April it was on the understanding there would be strong US logistic support, that the marines would stay in place and that 'if we got into difficulties we were going to call on the Americans'. Reuter adds from Mogadishu: There were worrying signs yesterday that Italian troops risked being caught up in the two-year power struggle between Gen Aideed and his rival Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed. The UN said Italian troops 'received and returned fire' late on Thursday in an area of north Mogadishu controlled by Mr Mahdi. It was the second incident in two nights. Ali Mahdi supporters apparently now fear Italy is sympathetic towards Gen Aideed's Haber Gedir clan after having held talks with its clan leaders to defuse tension in the north-south border areas Italian troops control.</p>

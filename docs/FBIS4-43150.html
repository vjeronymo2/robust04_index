			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and </F> FDP chairman, by Hans-Joachim Wiese -- live]    [Text] [Wiese] I now welcome Klaus Kinkel, Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] chairman and FRG foreign  minister. Good morning, Mr. Kinkel.    [Kinkel] Good morning.    [Wiese] Mr. Kinkel, your party is regarded as the major  loser of this election. How do you explain the defeat?    [Kinkel] Undoubtedly, this is a disappointing result for us.  Unfortunately, we do not have such thick cushions as the other  big parties, so that a relatively small loss immediately leads  us into turbulence. Yet it would have been so important for us  if the FDP had been represented again in the European Parliament.    Well, what is the reason? I feel that we simply did not  succeed in convincing a sufficient number of voters of the need  for liberals in the European Parliament. Of course, we will  have to examine whether we have made mistakes. We will do this  in the committees today. The course that we have taken will be  continued. We will not change it. We never achieved phenomenal  results in European elections. Unfortunately, I add. Sometimes  we got in, sometimes we had to get out -- the changes were  rather abrupt. This time, we are out again. We have to look  forward and primarily concentrate on the Bundestag election, but  also on the Landtag and municipal elections that lie ahead of  us. I am sure that we will be successful again.    [Wiese] How do you assess the interpretation of the bad  result for your party that the FDP simply does not have a sharp  profile or a liberal profile, but leans too much on the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU], the big coalition partner?    [Kinkel] I think that it is not right because we conducted a  Europe-oriented election campaign. Apparently -- I noticed this  in my numerous meetings -- the people are not very interested in  this Europe. Perhaps it was wrong that we concentrated too much  on it. At our party congress in Rostock last weekend, we  developed a program with a sharp profile, with which we will  also enter the Bundestag election campaign. As for the rest, we  have a coalition with the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU] and  we said -- which, in my opinion, is still right -- that we will  continue this coalition because we have done a good job. We  will do this. I say it once again: As far as the last results  are concerned, we always gained twice as much as in the European  elections or even more than that. Nevertheless, matters must not  be minced. Just for my first anniversary as party chairman, I  would have wished for better results.    [Wiese] FDP Deputy Chairwoman Irmgard Schwaetzer said that  the reasons for the FDP losses are the discussion on people with  higher incomes and the fact that the FDP's clear coalition  statement for the CDU/CSU in the government has not been used to  present the FDP as an independent force.    [Kinkel] Well, what slipped into the draft of our election  program regarding the people with higher incomes was not good.  We corrected it. We are a party that also admits mistakes.  This certainly did not help us. However, I do not believe that  it greatly harmed us in the European election. Nevertheless, we  have to examine, of course, whether this may happen again in the  future. It will not be possible to rule this out completely,  just as in other parties.    Regarding the other reasons that Mrs. Schwaetzer mentioned,  I  would not take the same point of view. We have -- I must repeat  it -- our own profile; we will continue our own election  campaign. In the past, we were also often in turbulence and  difficult situations. The FDP always recovered from it. I am  not trying to mince matters, but I am sure that we will preserve  the necessary motivation thrust for the Bundestag election.  Then we will see. Personally, I learned to lose in sports.  One also has to live with ups and downs in politics. I say it  once again: We do not have such a thick cushion as the big  parties. Our existence is always threatened. I hope that we  will overcome this low. At any rate, we will stick to the  course that we have taken.    [Wiese] Keyword Bundestag election, Mr. Kinkel. If you were  to make a forecast for this election result, what would it be  like?    [Kinkel] For my party?    [Wiese] Yes.    [Kinkel] I have just said it. As a prelude to the Bundestag  election, I would have wished for a better result in this  European election, which is something else but, of course,  noteworthy. However, things are added up in the end. It is  encouraging for me that the extreme Right did not have a chance.  I think that the results of the PDS [Party of Democratic  Socialism] are very alarming. Of course, one also has to see  the European Parliament in its overall make-up. If I see things  correctly, not much has changed. It is, of course, pleasing  that the CDU/CSU, our potential partner, has achieved very good  results. We, as the FDP, will have to get going.    [Wiese] Mr. Kinkel, perhaps a word about the referendum in  Austria, which ended with a surprisingly high degree of  agreement to Austria's entry. How do you assess this as foreign  minister?    [Kinkel] Well, this is extremely pleasing. I won a major  bet. Austrian Foreign Minister Mock called me yesterday. My  contribution to this result was not insignificant. This is  something that makes one somewhat bitter. Regarding Europe's  development in the postwar period, we Free Democrats have done  much: Scheel, Genscher, Kinkel in the past two years.  Apparently, the people have not paid tribute to it. At any  rate, we were not able to translate our reputation outside into  good results in the European Parliament elections. This is  something that makes me somewhat bitter and sad because all the  efforts paid off outside, but not at all for us within the  country.    [Wiese] What can Austria's special contribution to the  European Union be?    [Kinkel] Austria will be a benefit for this union in every  respect, politically, economically, and culturally. The country  is a net payer, it belongs to us. It was not in vain that I  struggled so much for it and I was also right about the  referendum. I anticipated a high degree of agreement and I was  right.</p>

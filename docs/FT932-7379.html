			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / International Company News: Komatsu plunges 72% as sales decline to Y870bn KOMATSU, the Japanese construction equipment maker, reported a 72 per cent fall to Y3bn (Dollars 27m) in consolidated net profits for the year to March, as an increase in public works projects failed to counter a sharp fall in private construction and in orders for construction machinery. While many Japanese companies have been trimming their product lines, Komatsu has expanded its range of construction machinery and said demand increased for some new products, but this was 'eclipsed by decreased demand for mainstay products such as regular hydraulic excavators and bulldozers'. Sales for the year fell 5.4 per cent to Y869.9bn, with a 5.2 per cent decline in construction equipment, a 26.4 per cent slide in industrial machinery, an 8.8 per cent drop in electronics, and a 16 per cent rise in civil engineering contracts. A recent government economic package to stimulate demand, which included a sharp increase in public works spending, is likely to increase further the demand for equipment for public projects, but private construction demand is still weakening. This year, Komatsu expects the government's package to lead to a gradual increase in private business orders, and sees sales rising to Y910bn and net profit to recover to Y10bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Alhaji Koromah is not only unhappy with the  fighting going on around the Po River bridge, he has also thrown  a spanner in the works of the transitional government, after  euphoria greeted Wednesday's [20 April] announcement that a  cabinet had been agreed. First, Charles Taylor quibbled, but  then backtracked. Now, Alhaji Koromah says he does not go along  with the selection of ministers. Robin White asked Alhaji  Koromah what his problem was:    [Begin recording] [Koromah] According to the Cotonou  Agreement, it is the three signatories to the Cotonou Agreement  -- NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], and the erstwhile  IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] who are to decide on  the allocation of ministries. And the last time in Cotonou, the  ministries were divided. ULIMO got Defense Ministry and Finance  Ministry. Now, we hear on the air that Defense Ministry has  been given to the interim government. This is not only  unacceptable, it is also totally illegal. So, as far as ULIMO  is concerned, that particular act is null and void and it will  never be accepted. Defense Ministry goes to ULIMO.    [White] So, what are you going to do about it?    [Koromah] We have several options. We are just making it  clear. Council of State has not any power to distribute any  ministries. So, if it is going to live by its creator, which is  the Cotonou Accord, it will not do anything that is illegal.  So, we have a number of actions that are both drastic and  nondrastic. So, we want to start off by bringing it to their  attention that that action there is no action and it will not be  accepted.    [White] Couldn't somebody have agreed to this on your  behalf?    [Koromah] No, I communicated last night and this morning  with everybody: the acting chairman, General Isaac Quawah; the  members of the executive council, I talked by radio to top  members, the field commander, General (Dumbuyah); and the  battalion commander talked to me, (Jango Jaba); and nobody seems  to be aware of this.    [White] Now, there seems to be trouble again within your  organization with forces supporting Roosevelt Johnson fighting  around the Po River bridge again. Now, you met Roosevelt  Johnson in Sierra Leone and it had been reported that you had  sorted out your problems, so what is going on?    [Koromah] Well, I don't think it is Roosevelt Johnson's  forces because Johnson kissed the Bible in front of Captain  Strasser and his deputy chairman, Bio, and took an oath and he  signed a document so the group of people who attack our  positions around the Po River are just rebels and we will treat  them as rebels. As a matter of fact, according to my Zebra  Battalion commander, (Jango Jaba), that particular group  attacked our positions and positions of ECOMOG [Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group].  As you know, ECOMOG is deployed in our territory and they killed  at least two ECOMOG soldiers. Our forces killed about 47 of  their men, and about 50 of those rebels were arrested by ECOMOG.  They are presently being interrogated at ECOMOG base and the  rest of them ran off.    [White] Where is Roosevelt Johnson now?    [Koromah] Roosevelt Johnson is... [pauses] he should be in  Monrovia, and the last time I was in Monrovia, I had invited him  and we had set up a committee that was discussing across the  line and trying to get our pieces together and sort things out.  So, it was completely shocking for me to have heard that  another group of attackers had come, but I don't want to believe  it is Johnson because I don't believe he is a pagan to go and  kiss the Bible and get involved in rebel activity...    [White, interrupting] It sounds to me that you need to go  back to Liberia yourself and sort out these problems.    [Koroma] Yes, I am on my way. For security reasons I am not  going to tell you the date.    [White] Why? Who might kill you?    [Koromah] It is not a question of who might want to kill me.  I mean all kinds of people want to kill me. [end recording]</p>

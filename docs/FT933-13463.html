			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Leading Article: The cost of nuclear power THE GOVERNMENT will shortly announce the terms of reference for this autumn's review of UK nuclear power industry. This is an important moment for energy policy because it will determine whether Britain advances further down the nuclear route, whether it pauses or even retreats. At the moment, only one nuclear station, Sizewell B, is being built, and no others have been authorised. Many first-generation nuclear reactors will reach the end of their lives during the 1990s, and decisions will have to be taken soon if they are to be replaced. The indication from the Department of Trade and Industry is that the review will focus narrowly on the economics of nuclear power. This is partly because last winter's coal crisis aired many of the wider issues in Britain's energy debate, such as the need for a more active energy policy (answer, no), and the diversity of Britain's energy supplies (which was found to be adequate). Furthermore, only one question needs answering, and that is whether the future development of nuclear power can be financed by the private sector, since the government has no intention of doing it. This makes a refreshing change from the approach of earlier governments which handed huge subsidies to the nuclear industry for a variety of ill-founded reasons, and landed the electricity consumer with large bills which are still being paid. Commercially financed But much will depend on how the question is asked. If the government is only interested in whether the City would put up Pounds 3bn to build Sizewell C tomorrow, the review will be a waste of time since the answer is clearly No. Only three years ago the nuclear sector had to be cut out of the electricity privatisation programme because investors would not buy it. The situation is not much different today. Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the two state-owned utilities which own most of the nuclear power stations in Britain, have made headway in reducing their costs. But nuclear power is still a long way from the point of being commercially financed. The more interesting question is whether the economics of the nuclear industry reflect the full costs and benefits of running nuclear power stations, including external environmental costs, and if not, how these should be factored into the calculations so that a better judgment can be made. Decommissioning costs For example, the City's uncertainty about nuclear centres largely on the question of decommissioning costs - for which there are few reliable calculations - and waste disposal. The review must get to grips with these numbers and come up with fuller answers than were produced by the recent National Audit Office report. It also needs to unravel the economics of waste disposal, including Thorp, the nuclear reprocessing plant, whose costs have a strong bearing on the performance of the nuclear operating companies. By the same token, the review should consider the environmental advantages offered by nuclear power, which does not emit carbon dioxide or sulphurous gases. Given the UK's international commitments to clean up its atmosphere, this is a measurable benefit: the more nuclear power stations, the less need to invest in a costly clean-up of conventional stations. However this advantage does not currently help nuclear's commercial case because it is not reflected in the cost structure of nuclear projects. This is not a reason in itself for invoking the national interest yet again on nuclear's behalf. But it does point to the need for a more thoughtful way of calculating environmental benefits and factoring them into the appropriate accounts. Britain has a surplus of generating capacity and an abundant supply of energy sources, not least of gas, which combines nuclear's advantages on air pollution with lower cost. At present, it is as clear as it can be that there is no commercial case for building additional nuclear power stations in Britain, but hydrocarbon prices will rise at some point and when they do, rigorous costings of the nuclear option need to be available. That should be the goal of the nuclear review.</p>

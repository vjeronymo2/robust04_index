			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Dangerous liaisons soured by gossip: The delicate working relationship between journalists and MPs but gossip in the most fiercely factional, closely monitored and widely reported office in the land. Office gossip in parliament is a well paid profession, pursued by several hundred journalists, including 80 regular Commons attenders and a pantechnicon or two of television crews. Often forgotten is that it is also the stock-in-trade of the 650 MPs themselves. Unattributably - 'strictly no fingerprints, please, old boy' - MPs and ministers use it to badmouth rivals, promote themselves or to 'float' policy proposals. If the idea sinks, it can be disowned. Corridor chat, a quick word in the members' lobby, a fulsome Covent Garden dinner and the political world may shift on its axis. Most of the time, it works as a viscous oil to the machinery of government and opposition. But, just occasionally, it acts as a spanner in the works. For all these reasons, this week's outbreak of open warfare - some might say posturing - between the Conservative government and what is still known as Fleet Street is itself a news story: all the more so because the latest developments have shown a falling-out between a Conservative government and the most loyal of Tory tabloids, The Sun. Unwritten rules of confidentiality are being flagrantly broken, the so-called 'lobby system' has broken down, with the curtain that cloaks it flapping open to the world. The reason - some journalists say - is the strong odour of humbug prevailing in Whitehall. Men, and women, who make their careers with election addresses, replete with happy family snaps and sober words about 'family values' must live up to them, the argument goes. They must also take care not to say one thing about privacy in public, and another in, well, private. Politicians might counter that circulation wars and the profit motive - not a mission to explain - lie behind the press's holier-than-thou indignation over alleged sins that are not unknown in newspaper offices. What makes this different is that the row is taking place against a growing groundswell of opinion among MPs, reportedly shared by the prime minister himself, that things have gone far enough and that statutory measures are now the only way to restrain an over-enthusiastic press. Yet what of over-enthusiastic cabinet ministers? Conservative Central Office claims that none of these right honourable gentlemen would dream of leaving information incriminating an opponent in the safe-keeping of a newspaper editor, let alone one with a circulation not so far off 4m. But then, in the words of a certain Ms Mandy Rice-Davies, it would say that, wouldn't it? If Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, is not mistaken, then someone has exceeded the normal proprieties by a considerable degree. Dangerous liaisons between individual politicians and journalists are the timeless tradition of Westminster. Back in the 1960s, Harold (now Lord) Wilson would talk of a 'white commonwealth' - trusty journalists who could be used as a conduit to the outside world. Less than a year ago, Lord Wakeham thought it appropriate to let his friends in the lobby know that the general election was postponed - coincidentally, just before Mr Neil Kinnock's crucial speech to Labour's annual conference. The Westminster gossip machine sometimes serves to alert ministers to their imminent demise. Mr John Biffen MP, when leader of the Commons, heard that he had become 'semi-detached' from the government - not soon after he was fully so. Some newspapers have tried to rise an inch or two above the system. The Independent and The Guardian both, for a while, boycotted the daily off-the-record briefings held by Downing Street. But at no time did either paper order its correspondents to shun the members' lobby itself  - the hallway where reporters mingle with MPs. Under the (marginally) more liberal reporting rules of the Major era - Downing Street can now be cited as a source - no newspaper now forbids its staff to attend. This week's bitter recrimination is fuelled by a mutual sense of guilt and betrayal. The Conservative government and its Tory tabloid admirers are behaving like rowing lovers who want an open marriage but only when it suits them. The government is threatening legislation. Fleet Street has given notice that it will kiss and tell. As one cabinet minister put it: 'These are dangerous days.'</p>

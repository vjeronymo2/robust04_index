			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special commentator Qiu Xiaohua (6726 2556 </F> 5478), chief economist of State Statistics Bureau: "Let  Enterprise Bankruptcy Become a Mechanism"]    [Text] Since last year, aiming at the acute contradictions  and problems arising from rapid economic development, the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council have taken timely  measures to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and  control; so far, positive results have been scored, and the  overall situation is changing in a good direction. But at the  same time, some problems and contradictions in economic life  have emerged in another area, which is mainly manifested in the  rising contradiction caused by market restraints. Problems such  as operating under capacity, sluggish sales, increasing stocks  and debts, and decreasing returns have once again plagued  enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, while the  number of enterprises where production has stopped or who are  operating at half capacity has markedly increased.    Judged superficially, these new problems, which have emerged  during economic operations, are mainly attributable to the  marked shrinkage of the supply of capital in society, and to the  fact that enterprises are far from being able to fund  themselves; on the other hand, the "two-way squeeze" resulting  in a rapid increase in imports and the contraction of  medium-term demand has intensified the difficult situation in  which enterprises produce and operate. However, judged from a  deeper angle, at a time when the macro environment is becoming  easier, the repeated occurrence of big increases in losses  incurred by enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, is  attributable to the fact that enterprises have not yet formed a  bankruptcy mechanism which gets rid of poor performers and  allows only the fittest to survive, and this is the crux.  Because the process of structural adjustment of assets in stock  is rather slow, resource allocation cannot be promptly  optimized, and the result is that the state has to support both  loss-making and profitable enterprises, leading to the  irrational situation in which bad enterprises tie down good  enterprises and both good and bad enterprises compete for  limited resources. This kind of mechanism, which allows both  bad and good enterprises to survive, will inevitably cause a  conflict in which resources in society are always in short  supply and problems in the market are always acute. So long as  this kind of mechanism exists, it is difficult to cast off the  currently existing condition in which state-owned enterprises  lack adequate vitality and a large number of them are making  losses. If we merely increase the money supply in order to solve  the conflicts, what follows will be price increase, and  eventually we will have to strictly control the total quantity  in order to eliminate the problem of inflation. Therefore,  forming a mechanism as soon as possible which allows enterprises  to go bankrupt is an indispensable link in reducing restraints  on the market and resources. Otherwise, if the cause of the  illness is not removed, inflation and debt chains will take  their turn to enter and leave the stage, and this will  inevitably affect the stable development of the economy and  could even cause us lose the opportunity for development.    Judging from the current situation, although the Enterprise  Bankruptcy Law has been implemented for five years, it has often  been difficult to shut down enterprises. There are many reasons  for the failure to form a mechanism allowing enterprises to go  bankrupt. Among the main obstacles, one is restraints due to  traditional concepts. Due to a lack of proper understanding of  the need to allow good state-owned enterprises to survive and  bad ones to disappear, as well as the need to form a bankruptcy  mechanism, in practice, a whole set of policies and measures  protecting backwardness and allowing both good and bad  enterprises to exist has been implemented, and this has  insulated state-owned enterprises from the bankruptcy mechanism.    Second, restraints from the old system. On the one hand, the  ownership of enterprises is ambiguous; superficially they are  owned by the whole people, but actually no one is responsible  for them, and the operators of enterprises can hardly promptly  handle the assets of enterprises according to objective needs,  bad enterprises cannot be sold, and good enterprises cannot be  purchased, and this inevitably affects enterprise bankruptcy.  On the other hand, there are barriers between higher and lower  levels, between regions, and between ownership systems, everyone  has a say in deciding whether a state-owned enterprise should  live or die, and they refuse to allow it to change its ancillary  relations easily. In addition, inequalities in taxation and  pricing policies often lead to a situation where state-owned  enterprises shoulder many burdens of a state policy nature, and  there are no common bench marks for enterprises which are not  subject to the restraints of the state's mandatory policies, and  this has made it impossible for enterprises' returns to really  reflect good or bad operational conditions in enterprises.    Third, restraints from social security. For a long time, we  have not admitted the existence of an unemployment problem under  socialist conditions, therefore, we have not established a  series of social security systems, such as unemployment  insurance, old age insurance, and medical insurance. As a  result, burdens in these areas have to be shouldered mainly by  enterprises themselves. It is often very difficult to solve  this kind of problem, which is caused by history. At present,  the country is still not in a comfortable financial condition,  and, for a short period to come, cannot completely shoulder the  social security obligations if enterprises go bankrupt.    Fourth, restraints from the production structure. At  present, among enterprises which really have to go bankrupt  according to the law of our country, many are producing excess  products, and their ability to change production capacity is  low. For example, although many military enterprises need  readjustment, their production capacity cannot be easily  transformed into a capacity which is badly needed in society,  therefore, there is no way they can go bankrupt. In addition,  the overdevelopment of the processing industry is another  problem, because many enterprises are duplicating low-standard  construction; in fact, their assets have lost value in society,  and, after going bankrupt, they cannot spare effective  resources. On the contrary, society has to spend a portion of  new resources to protect them. Since the input-output process  has low returns, it is better to keep them rather than to close  them.    Fifth, restraints from the legal system. Enterprise  bankruptcy involves transferring assets and debts, but, at  present, the asset assessment and transaction order and the debt  settlement order are not standardized, and sound protection by  the legal system is not in place. Therefore, it is still  difficult to perform various tasks relating to enterprise  bankruptcy in a prompt and orderly fashion.    To conclude, at present, there are many factors restraining  the bankruptcy of state-owned enterprises, but the most  important ones are obstacles in terms of concepts and systems.  Therefore, to form a mechanism as soon as possible which allows  enterprises to go bankrupt, we must proceed from reform and  realize and perfect it during reform.    First, we must change the functions of government as soon as  possible and realize the running of society by the government.  Only when we can grasp the building of a social security system  and a reemployment mechanism, remove various unequal policies  and conditions as soon as possible, and return the duties and  functions of running society from enterprises to the government  so as to allow state-owned enterprises to unload their burdens,  can we then make it possible for enterprise to go bankrupt.    Second, we must firmly grasp innovation in the enterprise  system to make it suit the needs of the market economy. To  establish a modern enterprise system and practice  corporatization, the crux is to straighten out property rights  relations and cast off a situation where the government is not  separated from enterprises, and only by doing so can we really  form a mechanism allowing enterprises to go bankrupt.    Third, we must build an assets transaction market as soon as  possible and create conditions for the flow of enterprise assets  after they go bankrupt. When enterprises go bankrupt, there has  to be an assets transaction market as protection, for it would  be difficult to effectively promote enterprise bankruptcy if  only the government's actions are relied on; we must also use  the strength of market and rely on market rules to carry out  fair competition and transactions to enable bankruptcy to become  a natural phenomenon. For this reason, we must step up work in  formulating standardized market transaction regulations to  safeguard orderly transaction behavior, protect legal interests,  and crack down on illegal phenomena.    Fourth, we must properly direct public opinion, publicize  the  objective necessity of enterprise bankruptcy through the mass  media, and change the influence of traditional concepts. A  correct direction for public opinion is the "catalyst" for  correct psychological expectations and behavioral norms, and  doing this job well is helpful to the smooth promulgation of  various reform measures.    Fifth, we must adhere to the principle of active and steady  work and solidly promote an enterprise bankruptcy system.  Because the direct reason for enterprise bankruptcy in our  country at this time when the system is changing track is very  different from the reasons for enterprise bankruptcy under the  conditions of a typical market economy, therefore, bankruptcy  has to embody the principle of the market economy on one hand,  and suit China's conditions on the other hand, and we must  operate prudently when handling bankruptcy, design  scientifically, and reduce various negative effects to the  minimum. We can study whether we can build an early warning  system for bankruptcy, and by so doing we may, on the one hand,  cause bankruptcy pressures on enterprises so they will build  self- restraining mechanisms and quicken their pace toward the  market, and, on the other hand, enable the state to have a  general idea of the quantity of losses which have been incurred  by enterprises over the years and which have to be handled by  way of bankruptcy to provide scientific data for macroregulation  and control on the restrained release of the negative effects to  society of enterprise bankruptcy.</p>

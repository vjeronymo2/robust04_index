			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEGGY BUCKEY'S COMMENT IN ELEVATOR SNARLS MAN'S MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> In a bizarre development involving two lengthy and sensational trials in  neighboring courtrooms, jurors two weeks into deliberations in the case of  accused murderer Harvey Rader were told to start all over again Wednesday.  </P> <P> The action was taken because of remarks made by McMartin molestation case  defendant Peggy Buckey in an elevator Tuesday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Juror Dismissed  </P> <P> A Rader juror, who overheard Buckey discussing the case, was dismissed by Los  Angeles Superior Court Judge Lorna Parnell -- who ruled that the panelist had  been "contaminated" by what she heard -- and replaced by an alternate.  </P> <P> The same juror had been the subject of an earlier hearing, after the jury  foreman complained that she was refusing to participate in deliberations.  </P> <P> Buckey, who with her son, Ray, is charged with molestation and conspiracy  involving 11 children who attended the family run Manhattan Beach nursery  school, told the agitated judge that she had said nothing more than that she  felt "very sorry" for the family of one of the alleged murder victims she had  come to know during trial recesses.  </P> <P> "My heart goes out to them for what they're going through," she quoted herself  as saying to a friend, lawyer Charles Lindner, when the juror -- the only other  person in the elevator -- identified herself as a panelist, stopping the  conversation. Lindner, not the juror, immediately reported the incident to  Parnell.  </P> <P> The juror, under questioning by Parnell on Tuesday, said she was not paying  attention, until she heard Buckey say something like "Sol went to England," an  apparent reference to Sol Salomon, who disappeared with his wife and two  children in October, 1982.  </P> <P> The remark could be construed as lending credence to the defense, since the  Salomons' bodies have never been found.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Denies Making Statement  </P> <P> Buckey on Wednesday denied saying anything about England, adding that she did  not even know who "Sol" was.  </P> <P> Rader, whose trial began in March, could face the death penalty if convicted.  He is also a suspect in the 1982 disappearance of a Granada Hills couple and a  Burbank man. Defense attorney Mark Lessem said he fears the switch in jurors  could hurt his client's chances for acquittal and indicated to reporters that  Buckey's comments may not have been accidental.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, as the juror was being thrown off the panel, McMartin defendant  Raymond Buckey was testifying in the courtroom next door about "pyramid power,"  as the judge, jury, and even one defense attorney tried to stifle laughter.  </P> <P> Buckey said he kept a large pyramid over his bed, because he believed it helped  him sleep. He added that he had a collection of smaller pyramids.  </P> <P> He explained that, from what he had read, pyramids "supposedly have a positive  effect on living things. All I know is I experimented with it and it worked."  </P> <P> The 31-year-old Buckey testified on cross-examination that in 1982 he attended  a convention on nutrition and unidentified flying objects in Reno, where he  helped a friend sell pyramid-shaped hats.  </P> <P> Shortly thereafter, he and a woman he met at the convention went to Lake Tahoe  and to Pyramid Lake, where they were baptized naked, he told Deputy Dist. Atty.  Lael Rubin.  </P> <P> The ritual, which Buckey said was "a spur of the moment thing," was performed  by a man described by Buckey as "supposedly a wandering minstrel" the woman  knew and by the prosecution as "a silver miner who claimed to be a minister."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wearing Pyramid Hat  </P> <P> Prosecutors said outside the presence of the jury that Buckey had been seen  driving around Los Angeles wearing a pyramid hat in early 1984, while under  surveillance by a district attorney's investigator.  </P> <P> The defense argued, unsuccessfully, that Buckey's experiences with "pyramid  power," an ancient concept repopularized in the 1960s, are irrelevant to the  molestation issues at hand.  </P> <P> But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William Pounders said the defendant's  dabbling in the fringe movement -- taken together with previous testimony about  his drinking, use of marijuana and other problems -- "tends to discredit"  defense contentions that his mother would not risk the reputation of the  30-year-old McMartin school by hiring an unfit teacher, even her son.  </P> <P> Pounders indicated that Buckey's conduct was not consistent with being a  pre-school teacher.  </P> <P> In addition, Pounders said in ruling that the prosecution could explore  Buckey's use of pyramids, the defendant's participation in activities that many  might view as bizarre "tends to refute" the defense position that Buckey's  alleged involvement in satanic-like rituals at a Hermosa Beach church testified  to by one child are too bizarre to be believed.  </P> <P> "This is not that far off," the judge said of the pyramids.  </P></p>

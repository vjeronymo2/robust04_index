			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, Jun 1 (PL) -- The Unidad Fortuna Petroleum  Inc., De Sherrit Inc., and Talisman Energy Inc. have announced  the discovery of 16 degree API oil in Cardenas Bay to the north  of western Matanzas Province. This information has been  confirmed.    According to the information, drilling was conducted as deep  as 3,240 meters, and petroleum with better quality than that  found at the Varadero resort site was discovered at a depth of  approximately 2,500 meters.    The exploration activity is being carried out under the  terms  of a risk contract with the state Cuba Petroleum (Cupet) firm,  which controls oil-related business in the country and maintains  risk contracts with several foreign firms.    The information released by the Canadian firms and confirmed  by sources in Cuba's oil sector also notes that the well drilled  could produce about 3,750 barrels of oil a day. Drilling has  been stopped, however, to allow nearby areas to be surveyed to  evaluate the magnitude of the deposit.    According to specialists, the crude oil found is superior in  quality to the oil found in Varadero, which averages between 10  and 11 degrees API and has a high sulphur content. The oil  discovered in the Cardenas area has less sulphur and, therefore,  it will be less difficult to refine.    Petroleum exploration in Cuba is divided into 33 sectors, 11  of which were offered in bids in Calgary, Canada, and London in  February 1993.    Since 1990, Cuba has set up risk contracts with the French  Total firm and the European Petroleum firm to explore and  exploit crude oil in the island's territorial waters.    Foreign firms exploring for oil in the country are operating  under risk contracts that grant a maximum term of 25 years (four  of them corresponding to the exploration phase) and guarantee  that the firms will be able to freely utilize their agreed upon  quota of crude oil.    In this sense, Juan Fleites Melo, director of the Cuban  marketing firm Cupet, S.A., recently stated that foreign  companies will be able to sell part of the petroleum in the  country at international market prices if they so decide. Also,  no export taxes are being considered for those who decide to  sell the product overseas.    According to the provisions of this kind of contract, the  foreign sector supplies all of the capital investment and  technical means for oil exploration in an established area and  agrees to leave without any compensation if no oil is discovered.    According to experts from the Cuban Basic Industry Ministry,  seismic studies show very interesting results, particularly in  the sector located south of Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus  as well as in the marine areas where the Swedish firm Taurus  operates.    Structures known as reef-like formations in oil geological  terms have been found in this area. These structures are  considered very favorable for petroleum deposits.    Information available in the foreign companies' zone of  operation not only reveals the possibility of finding heavy  crude (90 percent of the total extracted in the country at  present), but also light crude.    Last year, domestic oil production reached 1.2 million tons.  Oil production for this year is estimated at 1.3 million tons.  This oil is used in the generation of electricity and the  production of nickel and glass, as well as in other sectors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  after returning from visits to Russia and Uzbekistan, has called  a National Security Council meeting for Wednesday [8 June],  indicating his firm resolve to defend the country against  possible provocation by a cornered North Korea.    The fact that a Security Council meeting has been called for  the first time since the inauguration of the Kim administration  in February 1993 underscores the gravity of the worsening North  Korean nuclear row.    As stipulated by Provision 91 of the Constitution, the  National Security Council is an official presidential organ from  which the chief executive can seek advice on foreign, military  and domestic affairs prior to deliberating policy at a cabinet  meeting.    A National Security Council meeting is one notch higher than  a meeting of national security-related ministers or a  unification-security policy coordination meeting, convened  frequently in the past to discuss the dispute over Pyongyang's  nuclear program.    Consequently, it is designed to be called at a time of  crisis  and policy decisions forged at this kind of meeting carry much  more weight, according to analysts.    While visiting Uzbekistan, President Kim said Monday, "North  Korea's development of nuclear weapons is a problem on which not  only the survival of the 70 million Korean people depends. It  also threatens the peace and security of Northeast Asia as well  as the world."    "We are keeping a close watch on North Korea 24 hours a day  and our troops, the U.S. and U.N. forces have enough strength to  deter a war on the Korean peninsula," Kim said.    This National Security Council meeting is a sizeable affair.  It is being attended by the prime minister, deputy prime  ministers, and the defense, foreign, home affairs and finance  ministers in addition to the director of the Agency for National  Security Planning.    The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is an  associate member of the council, also has the right to speak at  the meeting.    Chief and senior presidential secretaries can attend the  meeting if the president so desires. It is understood that Kim  has invited chief secretary Pak Kwan-yong, Yi Won-chong, senior  presidential secretary for political affairs, Chong Chong-uk,  senior secretary for foreign and National Security Affairs, Pak  Chae-yun, senior secretary for economic affairs, and  presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik.    By presiding over the first meeting of the National Security  Council, President Kim obviously wants to demonstrate both at  home and abroad his determination to handle any developments  arising from the North Korean nuclear dispute.    Officials at Chongwadae [presidential offices], however,  took  pains to stress that the meeting is being held in "a crisis  situation."    The president and his top officials want to "check the  possibility" of the North Korean question reaching the crisis  point, they said.    President Kim appears to have considered three main  objectives in calling the meeting.    First, Kim probably aims to demonstrate to the world that  South Korea, as a nation that is most directly involved, is  doing its utmost as the U.N. Security Council prepares to  discuss sanctions against North Korea.    Second, the president wants to convey a strong message to  North Korea not to misread the South's resolve and undertake any  rash action.    And third, Kim intends to assure South Koreans that the  nation's preparedness is complete and its surveillance  water-tight, enabling them to depend on their government.</p>

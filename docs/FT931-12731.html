			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Slovaks fail to elect president The Slovak parliament inflicted Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's first serious political setback yesterday when it failed to elect his candidate for president, Reuter reports from Bratislava. The assembly is dominated by Mr Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia which had nominated the deputy prime minister, Mr Roman Kovac, as the first president of independent Slovakia.

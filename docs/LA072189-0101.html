			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALLACH TESTIFIES HE DID NOT KNOW THAT FILING FALSE AFFIDAVIT IS FEDERAL CRIME  </P> <P> San Francisco lawyer E. Robert Wallach, apparently rattled by the disclosure  that he had understated his income in a sworn statement submitted to a federal  court in 1984, testified at his racketeering trial Thursday that he did not  know filing a false affidavit is a federal crime.  </P> <P> Prosecutor Baruch Weiss, in his first few minutes of cross-examination after  Wallach had been questioned by his own lawyer, handed the defendant, who has  practiced law for 25 years, a statement that the defendant had submitted to a  Washington court in December, 1984.  </P> <P> The statement requested payment by the government of legal fees Wallach had  earned representing then Atty. Gen.-designate Edwin Meese III, his longtime  friend, during an ethics investigation of Meese by court-appointed counsel  Jacob A. Stein.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Earned No Income'  </P> <P> Wallach's affidavit in which he sought payment included a statement that  between March and September, 1984 -- the length of Stein's inquiry -- "I earned  no income from any other source, including the practice of law."  </P> <P> Wallach testified that he thought the statement was correct because he had  performed no legal work for anyone but Meese during that period. However, Weiss  declared that financial records showed Wallach had earned more than $200,000  from other sources during 1984, including at least $50,000 from Wedtech for  allegedly lobbying Meese, who was White House counsel at the time.  </P> <P> To support his case, Weiss produced three checks for legal fees to Wallach  totaling more than $125,000, which Wallach had deposited during the six-month  period cited in his statement.  </P> <P> "Don't you know," the prosecutor demanded, "that the filing of a sworn  affidavit which is false constitutes a felony?"  </P> <P> "No, I don't believe so," Wallach replied.  </P> <P> "Is it your testimony," Weiss pursued, "that you don't know after 25 years of  legal practice that filing a false affidavit is a federal crime?"  </P> <P> "That is my testimony," Wallach said softly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Awarded $80,000  </P> <P> Because Stein's six-month inquiry did not result in any criminal charges being  filed against Meese, Meese was eligible to have his legal fees paid by the  government under terms of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. Wallach ultimately  was awarded about $80,000 in fees.  </P> <P> In earlier testimony Thursday, Wallach told jurors that he was kept in the dark  about the corrupt activities of Wedtech Corp. leaders while serving as a  consultant to the now-defunct New York defense contractor.  </P> <P> Under questioning by his lawyer, Gary P. Naftalis, Wallach said that two  company officers who have testified against him never told him about their  "systematic looting" of the fledgling firm or the fact that they kept a secret  $1-million slush fund to bribe congressmen and other federal officials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Federal Investigation  </P> <P> Wallach said that he received an urgent phone call in 1986 in which Mario  Moreno, then Wedtech's executive vice president, told him that a federal  investigation into the company had begun. Moreno later came to see him in San  Francisco, Wallach said, adding that he arranged for Wedtech officers to be  represented by a New York attorney.  </P> <P> Naftalis asked whether Moreno or Anthony Guariglia, who was Wedtech's chief  financial officer, "at that time disclosed to you that they had been  systematically looting the company?"  </P> <P> "No," Wallach replied, adding that neither did they tell him about the secret  off-the-books fund used to make payoffs to government officials. Former Rep.  Mario Biaggi (D-N.Y.) and a former high-ranking official of the Small Business  Administration have been convicted of receiving bribes from this fund.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pleaded Guilty  </P> <P> Moreno and Guariglia are among former Wedtech officers who pleaded guilty two  years ago to conspiracy and other crimes in the Wedtech influence-buying  scandal. Both have testified that Wallach was part of the conspiracy.  </P> <P> Wallach is on trial in Manhattan federal court with two other former Wedtech  consultants, W. Franklyn Chinn, also of San Francisco, and R. Kent London of  Honolulu. Upon conviction, they would face maximum prison terms of 20 years  each and millions of dollars in fines.  </P></p>

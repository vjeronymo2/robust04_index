			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Openness in equities The debate over whether UK equity trading should be made more transparent reaches a milestone tomorrow ' the last date for responses to the Securities and Investments Board discussion document on the topic. But a consensus is still elusive. On the side of transparency are derivatives traders and some, but not all, institutional investors. They would like access to the prices at which market makers offer to trade shares with each other through inter-dealer broker screens. The traders feel such prices are nearer to shares' 'true' prices than the mid-points between bid and offer shown on Seaq, and so are better for pricing options and futures. Some investors think a glimpse at the IDB screens would help them negotiate better deals. Market makers, by contrast, argue that secrecy is necessary for them to lay-off the risks they incur through quoting continuous two-way prices. More openness over IDB prices would lead to a squeeze in their margins. Equally, if they could not hide the prices at which large blocks of shares traded, others would know if they were long or short and so take advantage of them. Transparency would force them into defensive trading strategies, and so reduce market liquidity. This debate cannot be resolved on theoretical grounds. The respective advantages of openness and liquidity have to be weighed. Since what is needed is effectively a cost-benefit analysis, SIB should commission an economic study to inform the next stage of its deliberations.</p>

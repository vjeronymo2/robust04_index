			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 22 Feb 94 Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 21 February that Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa has instructed Satoshi Arai, general secretary  of the Japan New Party [JNP], and other officials to study the  possibility of forming a "large floor group" by unifying five  floor groups of the coalition parties in the House of  Representatives. This was revealed by several staff members of  the party.    The prime minister so far has said he is for a "moderate  multiparty system," but he appears to have come to think that if  the coalition parties are to continue in power by defeating the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the next general election  conducted under the heiritsu-sei combining the single-seat  district system and the proportional representation system,  there is no choice but for the coalition parties to come  together and form a new party.    This concept on forming a large floor group shows that the  prime minister is changing his course toward the "two-party  system" advocated by people like Ichiro Ozawa, general secretary  of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. This can be said to be  proof also that his differences of views with people like Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who support a moderate  multiparty system, are becoming prominent. There is no doubt  that this matter will have a large impact on the political scene.    It was early this month that the prime minister disclosed  his  concept of forming a large floor group. He instructed General  Secretary Arai and other officials to conduct a study on it.  According to a JNP staff member, the prime minister asked: "Can  we not form a large floor group by combining Shinseito, Komeito,  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] as we are forming a joint floor group with  Sakigake [Harbinger] now?" Subsequently, General Secretary Arai  reported this to an informal meeting of the JNP Diet members on  16 February. But by that time it was known that the prime  minister had decided on an early cabinet reshuffle in order to  remove Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from his post. As a  result, the Diet members in the meeting were more interested in  maintaining the joint floor group with Sakigake, and failed to  come up with a conclusion regarding the idea of forming a large  floor group.    The concept of a large floor group stands on the premise  that  most of the existing five floor groups will make it through the  next general election, gathering around Hosokawa as their axis,  even though some of their members may fail. While this concept  ties in directly with the idea of a new political party being  promoted by people like Ozawa, it stands against Takemura's idea  of "strengthening ties with liberal forces within the LDP, the  SDPJ and the DSP, while drawing a line with the two parties --  Shinseito and Komeito." The concept of forming a large floor  group is likely to have some influence on the cabinet reshuffle  which the prime minister wants to bring about later this month.</p>

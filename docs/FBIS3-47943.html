The vote by the full house is widely seen as make or break  for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's five-month-old coalition  government.    In a stand-up vote, the upper chamber's 35-member Special  Committee on Political Reform approved the package of four  bills, on which Hosokawa has staked his job, by 18 votes to 16.    Committee Chairman Yubun Ueno declared, "I recognize the  fact  that a majority of committee members voted for the bills" soon  after a rebel member of the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP), Tomoichi Hoshino, surprised fellow LDP members by  voting with the government.    Hoshino's rebellion against the LDP party line was  apparently  totally unexpected, and television coverage showed vexed LDP  panelists looking around to see what had happened or pointing  accusing fingers at him.    Hoshino said after the vote that he is quitting the LDP,  which was ousted last August after 38 years in power.    It remains unclear, however, whether the coalition can  secure  passage of the bills by a full session of the upper chamber in  view of dissent among some legislators in its biggest party, the  Social Democratic Party [of Japan].    The coalition, which hopes to have the vote by the full  house  on Friday, has a slim majority with a combined force of 131,  compared with the opposition's 115. It needs 126 votes to be  sure of winning.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, Hosokawa's chief  spokesman, said the government welcomes the panel's vote. He  suggested at a news conference that the government is ready to  accept further bargaining with the LDP to prevent it from voting  against the package in the full chamber.    At the outset of the panel session, a coalition legislator  tabled a motion to dispense with a question-and-answer session.  Ueno immediately put the motion to a stand-up vote.    After the vote was tied at 17 to 17, Ueno used his casting  vote to pass the motion.    Kazuyoshi Shirahama, a legislator from Komeito, a key  coalition party, then told the panel, "Now that a total of 60  days have elapsed since the package was forwarded to the upper  chamber, it is high time for us to put this historic reform  package to a vote."    LDP Legislator Noriyuki Sekine warned, "If we pass it with  only a slim majority, this legislation to completely redesign  the mechanism of the electoral system that is the centerpiece of  parliamentary democracy would disseminate causes for future  problems in Japanese society."    Haruko Yoshikawa of the Japanese Communist Party also  expressed opposition to the bills. "The fact that the coalition  nixed a motion seeking witnesses to be called to elucidate  suspicions over payoff scandals involving general contractors as  well as the scandal over Prime Minister Hosokawa's acceptance of  100 million yen from the Sagawa Kyubin Trucking Firm, shows it  is not serious about stamping out money-dominated politics," she  said.    Yukio Aoshima of the small Niin Club said, "Although the  real  wish of the public is to rid Japan of political corruption, such  as payoff scandals involving contractors, the coalition  sidetracked this crucial issue by falsely arguing that altering  the electoral system could clear up corruption."    The committee vote came after eleventh-hour talks Wednesday  between the coalition and LDP failed to achieve a compromise  over LDP demands to modify the bills.    The package calls for drastically redesigning the mechanism  for electing members of the powerful House of Representatives of  Japan's two-chamber Diet.    It calls for the members to be elected through a mixture of  single-seat constituencies and proportional representation, in  place of the current multiseat constituencies, as well as  unifying politicians' various funds-raising channels into the  coffers of political parties.    The package cleared the lower chamber on November 18.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> East-West Buildup: Habitat for Humanity, a group that builds housing for the  poor, hopes to recruit electrician Lech Walesa and carpenter Jimmy Carter to  work on a project in Poland to renovate office buildings into apartments.  Habitat spokesman Clive Rainey said in Americus, Ga., that he wants the two to  work on the same project.  </P> <P> Lawyer Jokes: Imprisoned evangelist Jim Bakker, serving 45 years in a federal  prison in Minnesota for defrauding his flock, called his attorney, Jim Toms of  Hendersonville, N.C., last week to share some humor. "He asked me if I knew  what they call 20,000 lawyers at the bottom of the sea," Toms said. "Then he  told me the answer -- 'A good start.' That shows he at least is in good  spirits."  </P> <P> Gift Book: A previously unknown manuscript by the late Orson Welles will be  auctioned March 22 at Swann Galleries in New York. The illustrated book, for  sale by Welles' daughter, Rebecca, was her gift for Christmas, 1956, when she  was 11 and lived with her mother, Rita Hayworth. Welles wrote "The Bravades,"  an account of a French medieval pageant, as a way "to keep in touch and tell me  how much he loved me," Rebecca says. "The gift was that much more precious  because I didn't spend much time with him."  </P> <P> No Change: A nephew of U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is trying to persuade a Houston  transsexual convicted of murder to step down from a runoff election for party  chairman and let him accept the post. Leslie Elaine Perez won 27% of the  ballots for the Harris County post Tuesday, running second to Ken Bentsen Jr.,  who won 42%. Perez, 52, a real estate investor, was convicted under the name of  Leslie Douglas Ashley in the 1961 death of an insurance salesman and was  paroled in 1971. Ashley then underwent a sex-change operation. Bentsen met with  Perez on Wednesday. She said she would not withdraw.  </P></p>

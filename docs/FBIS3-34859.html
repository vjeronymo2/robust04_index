Although we realize that the illegitimate son that is the  product of Western states' relations with Jewish leaders, the  birth of Israel, will continue to be the object of Western care  and attention, new talk about the peace required in our region  dictates striking a balance -- which does not yet exist --  between the special relations the West is establishing with  Israel and the new relations the West hopes to establish with  the Arabs, who call for justice, restoration of usurped rights,  and compensation at a stage when durable peace can be concluded.    The French minister's talk about reactivating military and  security cooperation between Paris and Tel Aviv, after crossing  the river from a recent visit to Amman, is surprising. We  question the timing and aims of this reactivation, especially  since France was neutral rather than supportive of Israeli  aggression and the acts of persecution and oppression practiced  under occupation.    During the current peace talks Tel Aviv has presented  nothing, on any track, that proves it is ready to abandon the  logic of occupation and aggression. It continues daily  violations of the simplest human rights in Palestine and the  occupied Arab territories. Still, the French minister talks  about more cooperation with Israel in various fields amid  reports that the French defense minister will shortly arrive in  Tel Aviv to bolster military cooperation that was severed in  1967.    We hope the French interest in reactivating relations with  Tel Aviv will not place more hurdles on the path of the peace  process -- a process further complicated and slowed down by the  unlimited U.S. support for this entity. Israel will be  reassured that this economic, political, and military aid will  continue, even if it perpetuates the state of war and  instability in this sensitive region by its obstruction of the  peace talks. Development and construction energies in this  region have been exhausted over the past decades as a result of  the losses caused by the establishment of Israel.</p>

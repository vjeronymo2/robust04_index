			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Global Custody (5): How to set about choosing the right partner - Andrew Jack finds out what fund managers look for in custodians MR MARKUS RUETIMANN does not suffer sloppy work gladly. Last year he dismissed two of his firm's 25 local custodians after reservations over the quality of the work they provided. Mr Ruetimann is director of client and market services at UBS Asset Management in London, and a strong defender of the importance of a series of local or regional custodians rather than a single global agent. The firm uses its own nominees for UK equities, with agents in the UK for gilts and commercial paper. Overseas custody is delegated to some 25 active custodians and 29 inactive custodians. 'We are quite happy to pay a little more to be close to the right partner,' he says. 'But if the price or service ratio rises, they have to go.' His attitude appears to reflect part of a wider trend shared by other fund managers moving away from global custodians to a more localised and flexible network of regional and local providers. Yet it stands in stark contrast to much of the perceived market movements in the past few months, substantially as the result of what the industry widely calls 'the Max factor'. Global custodians are hard-selling their services partly linked to the fears arising from the stock lending abuses associated with the pension funds in the business empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell. That has stoked considerable interest, while boosting the role of value-added services and a shift away from price towards security. A survey by Phillips and Drew Fund Management of 800 of the largest UK pension funds earlier this year showed a sharp increase in the proportion using or considering using a global custodian. Its survey one year ago showed that 15.4 per cent were using a global custodian, and 4.6 per cent were actively considering their use. This year, 16.1 per cent said they used a global custodian, and 10.6 per cent were considering employing a global custodian. But Mr Ruetimann says that few are ultimately persuaded by the arguments. 'The firm has not lost a single client.' He considers Maxwell to be a red herring for clients. 'If there is anything positive about the Maxwell affair, it was to increase the understanding of pension fund management,' he says. It has also had the unintended consequence of vastly increasing the number of meetings with company executives, auditors and others to discuss the issues. 'Clients do understand the issues much more than before,' he says. 'Maxwell had nothing to do with fund management. It was a question of management control procedures.' What he does stress is the importance of using the same system for reconciliation, even though his firm has different managements for investment and asset administration. 'The more people involved in reconciliation, the more possibility of fraud and mistakes,' he says. Mr Ruetimann says the benefits of using regional custodians include flexibility, less dependency and greater cost-effectiveness. It allows local negotiations in line with local practice over fees, rather than negotiating a single fee for all markets with a single global custodian. The result, he believes, with increased competition and reducing margins, will be a reduction in the number of global custodians over the next decade. He argues that the true liabilities are not always put on their balance sheets, so their position may be weaker than it appears. There have also been considerable other changes affecting the relationship between fund managers and custodians in the last few months, which have made the services more commoditised. Since June this year, fund managers have gained access to Swift, the electronic funds settlement system, which allows them to use the standardised messages facility. Electronic trade confirmation has also been introduced. Phillips and Drew prefers to use banks rather than brokers as custodians overseas, because Mr Ruetimann says their creditworthiness tends to be greater, they have more capital, the technology is better and they are much more accommodating at accepting liability. More generally, he cites 'the 7 Cs' of how the firm chooses the right partner: Cash management: with stocks invested in interest-bearing accounts with the interest passed on to the client. Curtailment of risks: ensuring that potential custodians have appropriate systems, controls and insurance. Competitiveness of fees: to be offset against quality of service provide. Credit-rating: examining the net assets and ensuring the balance sheet of the agent is healthy. Communication and technology: how easy it is to communicate with agents and maintain links with them. Customisation capabilities: now that custody is becoming more commoditised. Commitment and comfort: with regular checking of compliance backed up by personal visits. The jury may still be out on the future balance between global and regional custodians, but the next few years will certainly see plenty of dynamism from more aggressive fund managers to respond to changing demands.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WELCOMING IMMIGRANTS AND ENTERTAINING ANGELS  </P> <P> Immigration is a big story unfolding in the neighborhoods and parishes of our  Archdiocese of Los Angeles: It changes the face of the country and speaks of  the vitality of American society.  </P> <P> On balance, the experience of our history and the conclusion of experts find  that a positive contribution is made by immigrants even today. Uneasiness,  however, surfaces on occasion perhaps due to fear of unknown cultural groups,  and of the possibility that asylum seekers, refugees and the poor may limit our  comfort and remind us that we are not alone in an increasingly interdependent  world.  </P> <P> In the public-policy debate, specific signs of anxiety are frequently headlined  in the media and a concern emerges which calls for a thoughtful and cooperative  search for fair solutions to a number of issues.  </P> <P>  -- Large numbers of individuals and families are without documents for legal  residence in this country. Pushed out of their countries by violence and  hunger, they are unable to return home and yet have not benefitted from  legalization provisions of the immigration law. More vulnerable than ever, this  subclass of the poor cannot be written off without serious social and moral  costs to their -- and our -- human dignity.  </P> <P>  -- Surveys of implementation of current immigration laws find widespread  discrimination against legalized aliens and American citizens who appear  foreign, a situation worsened by lack of information on the exact provisions of  the law.  </P> <P>  -- Undercurrents of ethnic and religious prejudice exist in the push for  "English only" as the official language for public services and programs. Yet  our experience in the archdiocese shows that hundreds of thousands of newcomers  are most anxious to learn English. They come to classes day and night in our  parishes since they realize how essential it is to know our country's language.  </P> <P>  -- In an effort to cap immigration, little attention or priority is being  given to family unity and family reunification. An immigration legislation  reform that does not respect this basic American tradition would be a step  backward.  </P> <P>  -- The thousands of undocumented immigrants who received amnesty under the  1986 immigration law need support in meeting the education and documentation  requirements of the law: English and civic classes, access to legal services  and timely information are essential.  </P> <P>  -- In many corners of the world, refugee camps still overflow with people  hoping for return to a more peaceful homeland or for acceptance in a new land;  their plight and their voices reach out to all of us.  </P> <P> These complex human, social and political issues confront the community of  faith as it reflects on Jesus' message of reconciliation and on its  relationship with Him. This relationship makes the church a sacrament of unity  for the entire human family.  </P> <P> As Pope John Paul II said in a recent encyclical letter, "Solidarity helps us  to see the 'other' -- whether a person or nation -- not just as some kind of  instrument, with a work capacity and physical strength to be exploited at low  cost and then discarded when no longer useful, but as our 'neighbor,' a  'helper,' to be made a sharer on par with ourselves in the banquet of life to  which all are equally invited by God."  </P> <P> A protagonist, therefore, in the immigration debate, the Catholic Church  follows the example of Christ and welcomes all newcomers -- not just for the  economic contribution they make through their work -- but because they add an  element of social enhancement.  </P> <P> The church sees in all immigrants, refugees and displaced persons an  avant-garde that builds a world family and, often through pain, witnesses the  interdependence of the contemporary world. Surely immigrants arrive among us  with their needs but they also bear gifts of energy, resourcefulness and hope  that contribute to the renewal of both society and the church.  </P> <P> In a complex world, the encounter with newcomers reminds us of a simple fact:  We are all brothers and sisters, one family. In this way, isolation and  hostility are impractical and misdirected attitudes.  </P> <P> Lay men and women, pastors and religious, natives and immigrants are called and  empowered to heal the breaches in human solidarity. In fact, we are all  instruments through whom God's work of creation, redemption and sanctification  is brought together on earth. His plan is for a world family where the earth's  resources are for the common good, where barriers fall and a special blessing  and care go to the poor.  </P> <P> Most people do not migrate because they want to. Immigrants are transnational  actors crossing from less developed to richer countries, and even if they are  not aware of it, they show the interdependence of the world economy. A sense of  moral responsibility for the countries of emigration can transform  interdependence into solidarity. The impact, therefore, of our national  decisions and policies goes beyond our borders and can affect all along the  journey of migrants from the start in their native countries to the point of  integration into our society. To enable the weaker countries to develop and to  participate in making a contribution of their own to the common good becomes an  effective remedy to forced migrations.  </P> <P> The temptation to confuse ethnic origin with religion could block the way of  solidarity and allow the tyranny of lesser loyalties to stifle the bonding  together of natives and newcomers in the common task of developing another  creative moment in the growth of the church and of the country. Different  cultural traditions and pastoral structures become as many valuable paths  leading to the acceptance of diversity within a basic Gospel unity.  </P> <P> The positive lesson the immigrants' presence teaches comes from the heart of  the Gospel, that we are one world family. The expression of this conviction is  in mutual knowledge, respect and love that enable us to find the fullness of  ourselves in solidarity with others. We learn intercultural relations not just  to fight prejudice or to manage interethnic relations with less conflict, but  rather, as a way to live solidarity in our environment, as a new style of  community needed now more than ever for the development of a pluralistic  society.  </P> <P> Projections indicate that immigration will continue due to economic disparity,  a chronic lack of jobs, persistent political upheavals -- and hunger.  </P> <P> Our pastoral response has been moving on the twin track of justice and  evangelization articulated in policy advocacy, and the delivery of services  within our church structures.  </P> <P> Together with the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the archdiocese's  policy for undocumented persons includes support for expansion of legalization,  a commitment to change the employer sanctions of the immigration law, safe  haven for displaced persons and the development of poorer countries. We stand  firm on the priority right of family reunion within a reasonable time.  Immigrants and refugees will continue to find a voice in the church where  acceptance and love have no borders.  </P> <P> Day after day, and with exceptional generosity, our archdiocese advises newly  arrived immigrants and refugees, sponsors family reunification, provides legal  assistance and teaches English. At the regional and parish levels a variety of  services are offered that witness our concern for the total person.  </P> <P> Allow me to stress the irreplaceable role of the parish where multicultural  communities of faith can flourish. A "policy of inclusion" should be part of  the pastoral plan of each parish.  </P> <P> In our parishes geographical distance has given way to the actual presence of  people from every continent and culture. Newcomers must be welcomed as Christ  is welcomed.  </P> <P> Mutual participation in the development of the parish future will succeed if  there is a warm, loving and exciting attitude of acceptance; if time and space  are made available to people to meet one another at their leisure in  friendship, if expressive, person-centered and vibrant liturgies teach as much  as they touch the heart.  </P> <P> In moments of rethinking, retrenching and anxiety in the public debate on the  presence and meaning of newcomers and their cultures, we are reminded that  "hospitality" is the most concrete example of our solidarity with the world  family.  </P> <P> The Scriptures state, "continue to love each other like brothers and sisters,  and remember always to welcome strangers, for by doing this, some people have  entertained angels without knowing it."  </P></p>

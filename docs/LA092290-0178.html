			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL  </P> <P> Riding High: A bumpy ride early on for Taco Bell's "Tacos to Go" campaign with  cyclist Greg LeMond has apparently not hurt the company's regard for its  advertising agency. Foote, Cone &amp; Belding of San Francisco, which won the  $75-million to $80-million Taco Bell corporate account 16 months ago, has just  completed a deal for the last of the Mexican fast-food chain's franchisee  business, said Elliot Bloom, a Taco Bell spokesman.  </P> <P> Taco Bell franchisees in the greater Los Angeles area, which pool their $10  million in advertising, have just followed franchisees in Northern California  and three other states to the doorstep of Foote, Cone, Bloom said. Adweek  magazine reported this week that the franchisees are bringing a total of $30  million in business to Foote, Cone, but Bloom would not confirm that number.  </P> <P> The franchisees have drifted away from the Los Angeles office of the  Tracy-Locke ad agency, since May, 1989, when Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine  pulled its business from Dallas-based Tracy-Locke, Bloom said.  </P> <P> The "Tacos to Go" campaign limped from the starting line in May, when the  company recalled 300,000 LeMond-inscribed water bottles after receiving  complaints that some children had pulled off the tiny plastic tops and could  possibly choke on them. However, Minnesota-born LeMond obligingly boosted the  campaign's fortunes this summer by winning the Tour de France for the third  time.  </P></p>

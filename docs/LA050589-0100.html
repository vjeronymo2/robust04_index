			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROAD TO PEACE IN LEBANON RUNS THROUGH SYRIA  </P> <P> In Lebanon, a nasty neighborhood of militias, suspicions and seething feuds,  the Syrian army is the big boy on the block, a bully to some and a protector to  others.  </P> <P> Over the past 13 years, the Syrians have salvaged the Lebanese Christians from  a Palestinian onslaught, given arms to Muslim militias and pulled back in the  face of an Israeli invasion. They also helped engineer a radical uprising  within Yasser Arafat's mainstream guerrilla faction of the Palestine Liberation  Organization, a revolt that resulted in Arafat's loyalists being ousted from  northern Lebanon.  </P> <P> They have meddled in Lebanese politics to the point where no political  settlement is deemed possible without a blessing in Damascus, the Syrian  capital, 50 miles southeast of Beirut.  </P> <P> Yet never has Syria declared its long-term aims in Lebanon -- even now, with  40,000 armed men deployed in the country.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'They Do Not Negotiate'  </P> <P> Others have not been so reluctant. Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun, commander of the  mainly Christian Lebanese army and head of a military cabinet in Christian East  Beirut, declared at the height of the artillery war between his forces and the  Syrian army with its Muslim militia allies last month: "The decision to  confront the Syrian presence was imposed on us by the Syrians because they do  not negotiate and (want to force us to) put our seal of approval to a total  subordination of Lebanon to Syria."  </P> <P> Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh, in his recent talks with French  President Francois Mitterrand in Paris, put his country's goals in a more  beneficent light. He said the Damascus government is intent on helping the  Lebanese with their problems, proposing political reforms to increase the power  of the Muslim majority, and also wants to "unite all Lebanese and make them  feel they belong to one homeland where they are equal in status and rights."  </P> <P> Whatever the specific Syrian objectives in Lebanon, they go beyond helping  their small neighboring state, according to authorities on Middle Eastern  politics. They are also driven by the Israeli-Palestinian issue, Syria's own  security concerns and the ambitions of Hafez Assad, the Syrian president.  </P> <P> Assad, in power in Damascus since 1970, is a formidable leader in the Middle  East. As president of a country with minimal resources beyond a Soviet-trained  and Soviet-supplied army, he has had some hard times over two decades but  played his few cards wisely. He is, diplomats in Damascus say, a man who gets  his way by saying no.  </P> <P> "He understands the geopolitical process better than any of the (other Arab  leaders)," a Western envoy commented recently. "He is politically astute, and  his strong card is patience."  </P> <P> A leader of the so-called Rejectionist Front opposing any negotiations with  Israel, Assad now finds himself almost alone as his former rejectionist allies  have given Arafat the green light to try to make a deal. Arafat and Assad are  the best of enemies, the diplomat said -- "They just don't like each other."  And now, he went on, "Assad is content to let (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak)  Shamir do his job on Arafat."  </P> <P> The Syrians "dig in and see what happens," the diplomat said, adding: "They're  not really the people to take the initiative. They're reactive."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Indispensable Man  </P> <P> Following that line in Lebanon since his forces first entered the country in  1976, under the Arab League's imprimatur as a peacemaker at the onset of the  Lebanese civil war, Assad has become an indispensable man in Lebanese crises, a  man with influence in Lebanon that extends beyond the power of his army.  </P> <P> When sectarian fighting escalated in Lebanon in 1985, militia leaders trooped  to Damascus and, under Syrian tutelage, forged a pact to give the Muslims a  greater share of power. The pact also gave wide powers to Syria within Lebanon.  Christian traditionalists rose in defiance.  </P> <P> Muslim leaders responded by turning their backs on Amin Gemayel, the Christian  president, and, in 1987, demanded a return to Beirut of Syrian troops, five  years after the Israelis had punched northward to the outskirts of Beirut and  driven the Syrians eastward into the Bekaa Valley. Today, with the Israelis  gone from Lebanon except for a six-mile-deep strip along their border, the  Syrian army remains, about 6,000 troops in West Beirut and 34,000 more in the  Bekaa and elsewhere in Lebanon.  </P> <P> This week, as Arab League diplomats have tried to work out a cease-fire in the  latest round of Lebanese fighting, their first stop was Damascus. Even if Assad  wanted to wash his hands of Lebanon, he dare not for several reasons, say the  experts. Among them:  </P> <P>  -- Any weakening of his pro-Muslim stance in Lebanese politics would undercut  the position he has taken as an Arab leader, the hard man in the struggle with  the Israelis. In two decades, he has never wavered on this point.  </P> <P>  -- From a security point of view, with Israeli troops still occupying their  strip of southern Lebanon, the cautious and untrusting Syrian president could  potentially put his country's western flank at risk in any future war with  Israel. So Syria insists that its troops will not leave Lebanon until the  Israelis do, underlining the prime cause for its continued presence there.  </P> <P>  -- Without direct influence in Lebanon, Syria would have diminished political  control there. Damascus would be served by increased Muslim power in Beirut,  but many analysts argue that it is served even better by keeping the Lebanese  factions at each other's throats, weakening the central government and making  it more pliable to Syrian demands.  </P> <P>  -- In the current round of fighting, others have accused Syria of more  nefarious reasons for hanging on in Lebanon. The conflict began in early March  when Aoun, seeking to extend his government's control and recover lost  revenues, imposed a blockade on "illegal" ports operated by Syria's Muslim  allies.  </P> <P> Jean-Francois Deniau, a member of the French National Assembly, who was  instrumental in arranging a shipment of fuel and food into besieged Beirut on  French vessels, declared in an interview with a French weekly that the  Syrian-controlled Bekaa is a center of opium production "which secures wealth  to Syria and the militias." He suggested that drugs left Lebanon through the  blockaded ports.  </P> <P>  -- Underpinning current politics are the historical ties between Syria and  Lebanon. Under centuries of Ottoman Turkish rule, Syria encompassed its little  neighbor, which was then known as a part of Syria called the Lebanon. Under a  post-World War I mandate following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the  French ruled in Syria and carved out Lebanon as a separate state, one with  special privileges for Christians. The independent Lebanon turned to the West,  becoming in some ways as European as it was Arab. Syria remained close to its  heritage as a center of Islam.  </P> <P> Even today, some Syrian maps show no border between the two countries.  </P> <P> Many Lebanese, particularly the Christians, insist that Damascus intends to  impose the past on Lebanon's future.  </P></p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Economics Notebook: The Magnificent Seven set to open up policymaking AN intriguing experiment in UK economic policymaking starts shortly when Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser chairs the first policy meeting with the panel of outside advisers selected to inject a breath of fresh air into the way the Treasury assesses the economy. The seven-strong panel, inevitably dubbed the Magnificent Seven or the 'wise men', was set up at the end of last year after widespread criticism of the Treasury's record in economic stewardship and forecasting. Its first report is due to be published on February 19, just under a month before the Budget  -and when public unease about the slow pace of any recovery from the recession is likely still to be high. Providing it organises itself effectively, the group could turn into a useful forum for ideas about improving the UK economy's recent lacklustre showing. In contrast to the secretiveness which characterises much internal Treasury discussion, the atmosphere in which the group will operate will be commendably open. Although the formal drafting of the panel's thrice-yearly reports is currently intended to be left to the Treasury, the department says it wants the panel's discussions to be entirely free of official influence. Its reports are to be handed to Mr Norman Lamont, or whoever else is chancellor at the time, just a day or two before they are made public. The people on the panel can be divided into two groups. There are three dissidents - Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University and Professor Tim Congdon, managing director of Lombard Street Research - all of whom have bitterly criticised Treasury policies in recent years. All argued for the UK to pull out of the European exchange rate mechanism well before Black Wednesday last September when heavy selling of sterling forced Britain's hand. In a particularly irony, the three were referred to as 'quack doctors' by prime minister Mr John Major in a speech defending the pound's ERM parity made just six days prior to the devaluation. The other four members, all of whom supported ERM membership, are more broadly representative of the economics establishment. They are Mr Andrew Britton, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research; Professor David Currie, head of economic forecasting at the London Business School; Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank; and Mr Andrew Sentance, economics director at the Confederation of British Industry. Prior to the first meeting a week tomorrow, each economist will have sent Mr Budd a 2,000-word paper setting out policy suggestions, analysis and numerical forecasts. These papers will be printed in full with the first report. The gathering itself will be in private, which is a pity because it promises to be lively. Many of the panel members differ strongly with each other about how they think the economy works and how best to monitor it. Several - in particular Prof Minford and Prof Congdon - have reputations for being argumentative. Prof Godley has a quirky sense of humour which may help ideas to flow. Even so, the genial Mr Budd will need to be on top form to keep order. His job as chairman will be to facilitate discussion, not to give his own views. Although some might see this as yet another sign of Treasury aloofness, there will be sound reasons for Mr Budd staying in the background. The usefulness of the panel's reports will depend on on their conveying outside views unadulterated by official thinking. Also should Mr Budd divulge Treasury opinions on matters such as interest rates, the panel members might be deemed to be in receipt of inside information. That could damage their reputations or even make them liable for prosecution. After the panel goes home, drafting an account of the meeting will be left largely to Mr Adrian Cooper, a junior Treasury official known as 'forecast co-ordinator' and who will be supervised by Mr Budd. Armed with Mr Cooper's view of what they all said and how any conclusions should be presented, the Magnificent Seven will return to Great George Street on February 16 to polish the draft. This is where the real fun will begin. Many of the panel members agree that little will be achieved if the report is simply a collection of individual views, without any effort to bring together ideas or important themes. Although expectations for what the panel can achieve should not be become too lofty, some of the highly worthwhile aims of the group may turn out to be incompatible with the Treasury having sole charge of the report's drafting. While Mr Budd has good credentials for chairing the panel meetings, he should not be made responsible for fashioning a report which as well as being lively and well-written may need to criticise Treasury policies. An analogy is with the reports of the House of Commons' Treasury and civil service committee, an all-party group of backbench MPs. Even though the committee's members represent many shades of political opinions, whoever is chairman bangs heads together to ensure that its reports generally contain useful and thought-provoking points. In the case of the panel's reports, Mr Budd will not have the sense of ownership of their contents to do a similar job. Indeed, forcing Mr Budd into this role could give present him with an important internal conflict. Therefore one of the first acts of the group should be to elect someone other than Mr Budd to supervise the writing of the assessments. While Mr Davies and Prof Minford would both probably do the job well, they are ruled out on the respective grounds of being too close to financial markets and being too opinionated. The best option is to give the job to Mr Britton, who has qualities of calmness and experience. He may have to be paid somewhat more than the meagre allowance of Pounds 125 a report which is all that the Treasury is currently prepared to give the panel members. A decision to put Mr Britton in charge of writing the panel's reports would be an important step to making the Treasury's new experiment a success.</p>

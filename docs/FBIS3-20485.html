			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hong Xiaodong (3163 2556 2639), International </F> Office, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation:  "China's Participation in GATT: Benefits to Trade in Services  Long-Range; Current Pressures Alleviated Only by Enhanced  Legislation To Increase `Tertiary Industry' Inputs"]    [Text] As a full participant in the Uruguay Round [of  GATT], China is prepared to sign the round's final agreement and  implement each obligation regulated by it. Trade in services, as  an important topic, was brought into the negotiations for the  first time. Its framework agreement, the General Agreement on  Trade in Services, and addenda have been reached. On the basis  of many rounds of bilateral negotiations, each country has  submitted a list of preliminary agreements for reducing  concessions. Since the start of the Uruguay Round, China began  to participate in GATT negotiations and proposed its own  preliminary list of promises to reduce concessions according to  current Chinese laws and regulations which stipulate the degree  of openness.    The following are advantages of China's participation in  GATT:    Competition introduced appropriately promotes development of  domestic service industries. We must introduce competition  appropriately to accelerate the development of China's service  industries. Since China implemented reform and open door  policies, some Chinese service sectors have adopted different  open measures which have played a definite role in spurring on  the promotion of China's domestic service industry growth.  Participation in GATT has solidified these efforts and  continuously expanded the degree of openness of service sectors  which will make China's domestic service industries develop  rather quickly.    Appropriate use of highly effective foreign services can  improve domestic service industry levels to serve the creation  of China's manufacturing growth and product exports.    Increased transparency is advantageous to fully  understanding  foreign service market conditions. After GATT goes into effect,  we could more clearly understand the restricted measures on  service trades adopted by other countries via the preliminary  list for agreement provided by signatories. This provided quite  a lot of information to China's services and service providers  to enter the service trade markets of other countries, which is  beneficial to exporting China's services.    Advantageous to enjoyment of equal treatment for China's  service trade exports, GATT is the first multiple agreement for  comprehensive management of global trade in services.  Preferential treatment is an important principle of the general  agreement. This principle will provide a rather equal  competition environment for China's service exports and avoid  discriminatory treatment via the exchange of reduced concessions  to be able to compete with other countries on an equal basis.    GATT is a new agreement regarding invisible trade. Its aims  and purpose are the same as those of GATT; namely, to gradually  remove all restrictive measures to entering the service industry  market through rounds of negotiations, granting citizen  treatment to foreign service providers, commonly using the  principles of most favored nation treatment, and ultimately  realizing full liberalization of trade in services. However,  GATT does not require participants to attain the aforementioned  demands while in the preliminary stage of implementation. What  each country should do is undertake the obligations of its own  promises to reduce concessions. The situation facing China at  present is that various signatories will continuously demand  that China liberalize the banking, insurance, telecommunications  and posts, communications, sea transport, air transport, retail  sales and specialized service (including law, consulting,  accounting, etc) markets. In particular, China's high speed  economic growth has been closely observed internationally, and  pressure demanding we liberalize service industry markets will  increase. Therefore, on the one hand we must determine the  foreign openness of service industry based on domestic  legislation and service industry development levels. On the  other hand, it is imperative to accelerate service industry and  service trade development. The main means are:    One, a greater degree of reform, faster service industry  externalization, and gradually realizing the transformation of  the majority of service industry sectors toward operations away  from welfare, public interest and undertakings according to the  principles of separate government and enterprises and pushing  enterprises toward markets in the direction of industrialization  and socialization.    Two, expand funding sources and channels for accumulating  funds. Strive to increase service industry inputs and actively  use foreign funds to develop the service industry.    Three, further even out and liberalize service industry  prices.    Four, reform service industry planning, statistical systems  and methods, overall planning, and develop statistical and  assessment service industries. Since China wants to enter GATT,  it must undertake scientific categorization and statistical  methods of the domestic service industry according to common  international practices. Then it will be comparable to service  industries in other countries.    Five, accelerate service industry legal system construction.  China's service industry has preliminarily promised to open to  the outside world. In line with further opening, China's service  industries will have to face competition from foreign service  providers. One prerequisite for further opening China's service  industry is to enhance service industry legislation. At present  China is stressing drafting basic economic laws and regulations  such as "trade laws," "market laws," "corporate laws," "fair  business practice laws," "antitrust laws," "communications  laws," and "auditing laws."</p>

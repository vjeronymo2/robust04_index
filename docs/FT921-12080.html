			<p>920129 FT  29 JAN 92 / India's jute workers strike for more pay NEARLY 140,000 workers in 53 jute mills in West Bengal, India, went on strike yesterday for more pay, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta. Trade unions have supported the strike but have exempted the five jute mills owned by the government and a unit managed by a workers' co-operative. The Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) said jute mill workers' wages compared favourably with those prevailing in other industries. It admitted that eight jute mills were paying substantially lower wages in violation of a 1988 pay agreement. But these were not members of the IJMA. The IJMA wanted rises tied to productivity.</p>

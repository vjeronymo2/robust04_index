In the last few years the two banks  have done a great deal in handling this professional work,  playing a positive role in promoting China's foreign-related  labor services. However, viewing the implementation of the  provisional method, the management of the "fund" seems to have  been out of line with the detailed handling of loan business,  making it difficult for MOFERT to know about the use and  recovery of the funds on loan or the collection of management  fees for it. To further strengthen the management of the  cooperative fund, MOFERT has now decided, with the approval of  the Ministry of Finance, to take direct charge of the "fund's"  loan business as of 1 January 1991, whereas the "fund's" foreign  exchange and renminbi deposits will continue to remain in the  two banks. The funds which are released on loan before the end  of 1990 will still be handled by the two banks until their  recovery. [Signed] The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  and Trade, [Dated] 17 September 1990.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Britain to press for lower interest rates at Edinburgh summit BRITAIN will press for 'generally lower' interest rates at the European Community summit in Edinburgh, the chancellor told the House of Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes. Rejecting Labour charges that Britain had failed to use its presidency of the EC to lead a concerted drive to reduce unemployment he stressed that a package of measures designed to get the European economy moving again would be under discussion. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, claimed that the government had relegated consideration of the measures needed to deal with unemployment from a formal session at the summit to an open-ended discussion over lunch. He called on the chancellor to demonstrate that he had the political will to ensure that Britain took the lead at Edinburgh in initiating action to get unemployment down.</p>

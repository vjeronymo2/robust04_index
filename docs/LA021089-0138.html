			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA INCIDENT;  </P> <P> POLL GUARD INQUIRY TAKEN TO SACRAMENTO  </P> <P> FBI agents carried their investigation of the Orange County Republican Party's  use of uniformed security guards at polling places to the state capital this  week, interviewing at least one person who worked on Assemblyman Curt Pringle's  1988 campaign.  </P> <P> Sen. Edward R. Royce (R-Anaheim) confirmed that two FBI agents interviewed one  of his aides, Dave Gilliard, on Wednesday. Royce said he was not interviewed by  the agents and did not participate in their discussions with Gilliard, who  worked for several weeks last fall as a press aide in the Pringle campaign.  </P> <P> The Orange County Republican Party spent $4,000 to hire 20 security guards to  monitor the polls on Election Day last November in 20 heavily Latino Santa Ana  precincts in the 72nd Assembly District. The guards were hired, Republican  officials have said, because of rumors that non-citizens -- who may not legally  vote -- might be bused into the district to cast ballots for Pringle's  Democratic opponent, Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Guards Were Removed  </P> <P> Party officials have said that the guards were instructed not to stop anyone  from voting and that they were removed by midday at the request of county  Registrar of Voters Donald F. Tanney.  </P> <P> Pringle, of Garden Grove, said he also was aware that the agents were in the  capital. He said Carlos Rodriguez, the Sacramento-based political consultant  who directed Pringle's campaign, had told him he expected to be interviewed.  </P> <P> Pringle added, however, that he had not confirmed that such an interview had  taken place as of Thursday.  </P> <P> Orange County GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes has said it was Rodriguez who  requested that Republican Party funds be used to hire the guards.  </P> <P> Neither Gilliard nor Rodriguez could be reached for comment Thursday.  </P> <P> Jim Neilson, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, would say only that the incident  of the security guards is under investigation.  </P> <P> The disclosures are the first public confirmation that the FBI is actively  pursuing the investigation.  </P> <P> A separate, civil lawsuit aimed at overturning the result in the 72nd District  election has been filed in federal court in Santa Ana. On Monday, U.S. District  Judge J. Spencer Letts refused to dismiss that lawsuit, saying its allegations,  if true, are "an outrage."  </P> <P> Pringle, who defeated Thierbach in the Nov. 8 election by fewer than 900 votes,  said no FBI agent has approached him or his staff about the incident. But he  said he would gladly speak to federal authorities if asked.  </P> <P> "I don't mind this investigation," Pringle said. "Let them do it fast. If they  want to talk to me, fine. I want to get this over and concentrate fully on  doing the job I was elected to do."  </P> <P> Pringle said he believed that the agents were doing no more than conducting a  routine review based on complaints filed by Latino groups.  </P> <P> "It is my understanding that whenever there is a complaint filed, the FBI  follows through on it," Pringle said. "I'm sure they're just covering all the  bases."  </P> <P> Royce said the agents apparently interviewed several people involved in the  Pringle campaign. But the only interview he could confirm was the one with  Gilliard.  </P> <P> "No one has contacted me," he said. "I know the reason they talked with Dave  Gilliard was that he was involved for several weeks in the campaign."  </P> <P> But Royce added that Gilliard was not involved in the decision to hire the  security guards and was "back here" working in the capital by Election Day.  </P></p>

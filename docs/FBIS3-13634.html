According to U.S. Embassy Information Service here Wednesday,  at a meeting in Washington convened for specialists on  non-proliferation issues, Carter said that the United States,  would like to control the export of "everything" to Iran and  Iraq.    Explaining the Clinton Adminstration's Counter-Proliferation  Initiative (CPI), he noted that Defence Secretary Perry and  Central Intelligence Agency Director Woolsey will announce soon  the new position of a deputy director for military support at  the CIA's Counter-Proliferation Centre.    In the past, he explained, too much of Pentagon's  counter-proliferation focus had been on characterizing and  cataloguing individual nation's weapons program. In the future,  the official suggested, the focus will be on what actions to  take after certain countries acquire weapons of mass  destruction.</p>

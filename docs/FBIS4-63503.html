			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik; all quotation marks as received]    [Text] Kiev, 21 May -- "The leadership of Ukraine has  taken a series of measures aimed at destroying the statehood of  the Republic of Crimea. It threatens to use force, including  military force," says an appeal of the Supreme Council of the  Republic of Crimea, which was adopted today. It is addressed to  the United Nations, the UN Security Council, the Conference for  Security and Cooperation in Europe, the president of the Russian  Federation, the Russian Federal Assembly, and the people of  Ukraine.    The document says, among other things, that "the Crimean  Supreme Council adopted the law on restoring the constitutional  foundations of the statehood of the Republic of Crimea on the  basis of a poll taken among the Republic's citizens. This means  that from now on the authority in economy, education, culture,  and local self-government will be executed entirely by the  people of Crimea."    The Crimean parliamentarians think that "not a single item  in  the Constitution of the Crimean Republic infringes upon the  territorial integrity of the Ukraine, nor does it lead to any  revision of the existing state border. Chapter 3, Article 9 of  the Constitution states: "The Crimean Republic forms part of  Ukrainian and determines its relations with that state on the  basis of a treaty and agreements." The Crimean Supreme Council  confirms its adherence to the principles enshrined in the  Helsinki Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe.    The Crimean Supreme Council expressed the hope that the  international community will not permit lawless acts on the part  of Ukraine's organs of state power nor any violation of the  rights and freedoms proclaimed by the "Universal Declaration of  the Rights of Man."</p>

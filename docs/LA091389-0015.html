			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNARDI ASKS L.A. TO REVOKE DUMP'S PERMIT  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi called Tuesday for the Planning  Commission to revoke the city land-use permit for Lopez Canyon Landfill on the  grounds that the dump is a public nuisance.  </P> <P> Under an ordinance approved by the council in 1985, the commission may revoke  any conditional-use permit that allows conditions affecting health and safety  or creating a public nuisance, Bernardi said.  </P> <P> "Anyone familiar with the operational history of Lopez knows that it fits the  public nuisance definition to a 'T,' " he said.  </P> <P> Specifically, Bernardi cited alleged violations in excess of the existing  permit, including longer dumping hours, more dump trucks and higher garbage  mounds.  </P> <P> The Bureau of Sanitation, which runs the dump, maintains that it is operated  safely and that all dumps cause some hardship to surrounding residents.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A radical Palestinian group said it executed 15 Arabs on charges of spying for  the West. A spokesman for the Fatah Revolutionary Council, headed by terrorist  Abu Nidal, said in West Beirut: "The decision was taken after those  collaborators refused a call to repent." He said two of the 15 Palestinians  worked for the CIA, two spied for West Germany and one gathered information for  Britain. The 14 men and one woman also were linked to the intelligence agencies  of Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon, he charged, and were guilty of  "meddling with Arab national security and the security of the Palestinian  revolution."  </P></p>

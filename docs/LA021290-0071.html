			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROONEY SAYS TYSON WASN'T READY, PUTS THE BLAME ON DON KING, TRAINERS  </P> <P> Kevin Rooney, Mike Tyson's former trainer, blamed Tyson's showing against  Buster Douglas on the champion's co-trainers Aaron Snowell and Jay Bright and  on adviser Don King.  </P> <P> "Mike acted like he didn't want to fight," Rooney said Sunday in Catskill, N.Y.  "He didn't want to be there.  </P> <P> He allowed Buster Douglas to get brave. I wouldn't have been whispering in his  ear (as Snowell did between rounds). I would've said, 'Do you want to fight or  should I throw in the towel?' He wanted to lose. Maybe the pressure was getting  to him. He was hit more in that fight than in his amateur career through his  pro career with all the sparring in between.  </P> <P> "Don King is a great con man. He controls everything. Didn't you see Don King  in the background (after the bout)? While Tyson was in the dressing room, King  was trying to get close to Buster Douglas. I hear he has five options on  Douglas. He has ruined a great young career."  </P></p>

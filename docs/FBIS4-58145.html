			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hagay Huberman] </F>   [Excerpt] Deputy Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur told the  Elqana Local Council plenum yesterday that "the Gaza-Jericho  agreement will not serve as a precedent for the future agreement  on the rest of Judaea and Samaria." Gur asserted that "this is  also the view held by the prime minister."    Gur toured Elqana yesterday and participated in a special  local council meeting.    Gur added that "a long time" will pass between the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and an agreement on  Palestinian self-administration throughout the rest of Judaea  and Samaria. Once again, Gur noted that this is also the prime  minister's position.    Deputy Minister Gur also categorically denied the report  that  a special Army unit will be established to deal with the Jewish  settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and described it  as "complete nonsense." He also denied rumors of an intention  to distribute identification tags to Jewish settlers to  facilitate their passage through security checkpoints. [passage  omitted]</p>

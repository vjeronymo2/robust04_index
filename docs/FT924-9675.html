			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Big Chinese zinc imports forecast CHINA'S SURGING demand for metals is likely to have an even more profound impact on the zinc market than it is having on the copper business, according to a study from the Economist Intelligence Unit consultancy organisation. It suggests that Chinese zinc production will fall behind consumption and leave by 1995 an apparent net import requirement of 117,000 tonnes, equivalent to 2.4 per cent of last year's western consumption. The EIU suggests that China's demand for imported copper will reach 167,000 tonnes in 1995, equivalent to 1.7 per cent of 1991's western consumption. In contrast, China was in 1990 a net exporter of 12,000 tonnes of unwrought refined zinc and imported only 21,000 tonnes of copper. Mr Richard Vivian, author of the study, assumes that China's annual economic growth during its present five-year plan (1991-95) will average more than 8 per cent compared with China's own forecast of 6 per cent and that rapid expansion takes place in the first three years rather than the last three years, as predicted by the Chinese. Consequently, China's copper supply deficit is forecast to be 123,000 tonnes this year and 139,000 tonnes in 1993. The supply deficit of refined zinc is forecast to be 60,000 tonnes this year and 95,000 tonnes in 1993. Mr Vivian says China needs some additional zinc refining capacity in order to avoid the anomaly of surplus mine production alongside a deficit in refined metal. He points out that China's five-year plan gives priority to increasing aluminium production so the country's soaring demand for this metal is not expected to throw up a big import requirement. However, even though China plans a 75 per cent increase in primary aluminium output between 1991 and 1995, the EIU foresees only a 'modest' exportable surplus of 77,000 tonnes by 1995. Next year, however, China's aluminium imports could peak at 82,000 tonnes. The study also predicts rapid growth in Chinese nickel consumption, which is expected to result in a marked reversal of China's trade in refined metal and nickel in concentrates (an intermediate product). This arises because a big expansion of smelter capacity at Jinchuan came in 1991 whereas the associated mine capacity expansion is scheduled for 1993. This means that China at present has apparently a need to import concentrates but has an exportable surplus of refined nickel. But by 1995 the study suggests China could be importing 3,600 tonnes of refined nickel and exporting 4,000 tonnes of concentrates.

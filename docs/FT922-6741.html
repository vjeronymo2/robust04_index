			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Use of performance pay is expected to spread THE traditional annual pay rise will virtually vanish in the financial services sector within two years, according to a survey published yesterday. KPMG Peat Marwick, the management consultants, found that 75 per cent of companies had introduced performance-related pay and predicted that this would increase to more than 90 per cent in the next two years. Performance-related pay has grown rapidly in the private sector over the past decade for white-collar and professional workers. KPMG said financial services companies with established schemes regarded them as 'highly successful' and were planning embellishments, for example group bonuses for sales staff. Performance pay is the norm in building societies, while some of the bigger insurance companies have introduced such schemes and banks are following. The large mutual life companies have been the slowest to introduce performance pay schemes.

This action is necessary to eliminate in an expeditious manner all swine herds known to be affected with brucellosis. This action will also help ensure that swine brucellosis is eradicated in the United States within the next 5 years, thus saving the Federal government millions of dollars in program costs. This action will also help eliminate the human health risk associated with swine brucellosis. We are also amending the regulations concerning interstate movement of swine to require that all brucellosis-exposed swine from herds known to be affected with the disease be identified with an eartag before being moved interstate from the herd. This action will allow all handlers of swine to take precautions in handling swine potentially infected with brucellosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interim rule effective March 17, 1994.

To help prevent the spread of the disease, and to further its eradication, the regulations in 9 CFR part 51 provide for payment of Federal indemnity to owners of certain animals destroyed because of brucellosis. The payment of indemnity is intended to provide owners with a financial incentive for promptly destroying animals infected with or exposed to brucellosis. Because the continued presence of brucellosis in a herd seriously threatens the health of animals in that herd and possibly other herds, the prompt destruction of brucellosis-affected swine is critical if brucellosis eradication efforts in the United States are to succeed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the regulations in &sect;51.3(b)(2) prior to the effective date of this interim rule, indemnity payments for herd depopulation were made only for breeding swine destroyed because of brucellosis, and were based on a maximum ``per head'' rate of $150 per head for registered, inbred, or hybrid swine, and $65 per head for all other breeding swine. In this interim rule, we are amending the regulations to provide that in the case of whole herd depopulation of swine, indemnity payments shall be paid for all swine in the herd, not just for breeding swine, and at a fair market value determined by the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), based on an appraisal conducted by an independent appraiser assigned by the Administrator, except that indemnity payments, plus any salvage, must not exceed the appraised value of each animal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because brucellosis is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, swine other than breeding swine have not been considered to be significantly at risk for transmitting brucellosis to other swine. Consequently, indemnity has not been paid for ``feeder'' or ``finishing'' pigs. Recently, however, the infection of 30 humans with brucellosis through the handling of swine other than breeding swine at a packing plant in North Carolina has indicated that such swine do pose a significant risk of transmitting brucellosis to swine and humans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

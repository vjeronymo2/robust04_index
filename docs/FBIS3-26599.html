Huang Zhaohong, who headed the Chinese delegation to the  meeting, told XINHUA that China has entered into 57 cooperation  agreements with Nigeria at the five-day forum, which ended last  Friday [4 February] in the Nigerian capital Abuja.    "This is the first time for China to have TCDC agreements  with Nigeria," said Huang who is also economic and commercial  counselor in the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria.    The Chinese delegation returned to Lagos on Saturday from  the  consultation meeting held in Abuja.    This is the first international conference held in Nigeria  since General Sani Abacha came to power last November.    In addition, the Chinese delegation also signed seven other  cooperation agreements with Benin, Cuba, Gambia and Thailand.    A total of 280 cooperation agreements were concluded by the  end of the consultation meeting, which involved 26 developing  countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America.    "The Chinese delegation ranks first in reaching agreements  with other nations," Huang said.    In fact, "We are among the busiest people at the meeting.  People came to our table for consultation and negotiation  before they made up their mind" to sign a cooperation agreement  with the Chinese delegation, said Li Wanming, a woman member of  the Chinese delegation at the conference.    Initiated under the United Nations Development Program  (UNDP), the TCDC is aimed at promoting cooperation among  developing countries.    China began to take part in the UNDP activities in October  1972. In September 1979, the UNDP set up a permanent  representative office in China.</p>

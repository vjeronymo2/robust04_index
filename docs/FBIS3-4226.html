			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 26 (AFP)--China said Saturday [26  March] that it will study a Russian proposal for an  international conference on the nuclear crisis in North Korea.    "We have taken note of Russia's proposal, and we will study  it," a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said by telephone.    Moscow had proposed an international conference Thursday to  try to find a solution to the nuclear impasse in North Korea.  Pyongyang rejected a complete inspection of its suspect nuclear  sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The conference would bring together the two Koreas, China,  Japan, the United States and Russia and delegates from the  United Nations and the IAEA. The countries concerned reacted  rather coolly to the proposal on Friday.    China, one of the five permanent members of the UN Security  Council, continues to oppose international sanctions against its  communist ally, but Western diplomats at the United Nations said  Friday that Beijing might sign a declaration on North Korea  which would not include sanctions.    South Korean President Kim Yong-Sam was expected to arrive  in  China Saturday for a five-day visit during which he will ask his  hosts to help get North Korea to accept inspections of its  nuclear installations and to reopen its dialogue with South  Korea.</p>

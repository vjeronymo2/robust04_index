			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To conserve the delta smelt, critical habitat is proposed for an area encompassing the specific habitat conditions required by each life stage identified above. Accordingly, critical habitat is proposed for the following geographic area: Areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma Sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta. The proposed critical habitat is contained within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, and Yolo Counties, California. The ``Proposed Regulations Promulgation'' section provides a precise metes and bounds description of the revised proposed critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effects of Critical Habitat Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that the activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility is in addition to the requirement in the same section of the Act that Federal agencies ensure their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be expected to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR 404.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly state that such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical. The requirement to consider potential adverse modification of critical habitat is an incremental consideration above and beyond the review necessary to evaluate the likelihood of jeopardy and incidental take in section 7 consultations. In section 7 consultations, the Service considers the potential for adverse modification of the primary constituent elements identified in the critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat a brief description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may be affected by such designation. The Service has identified the following list of activities that, depending on the season of construction and scale of the project, may result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat without necessarily jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Sand and gravel extraction in river channels or marshes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement of dredged materials on levees of banks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Bridge and marina construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construction and implementation of each of these actions requires authorization by the Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Based on the Service's review of all existing or proposed projects that may affect the delta smelt, the great majority that would likely result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat also would be likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species. The Service has not identified any proposed actions that might jeopardize the delta smelt without adversely affecting its critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Considerations of Economic and Other Factors <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area to be included within the critical habitat boundary. The Secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat should it be determined that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such an area as part of the critical habitat unless it is determined, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such an area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species concerned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impacts of designating critical habitat are in addition to the economic and other impacts attributable to listing of the species. Impacts attributable to listing include those resulting from the taking prohibitions under section 9 of the Act and associated regulations. ``Take,'' as defined in section 3(18) of the Act, includes harm to a listed species. ``Harm'' means an act that actually kills or injures wildlife. Such an act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including feeding, breeding, or sheltering (50 CFR 17.3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

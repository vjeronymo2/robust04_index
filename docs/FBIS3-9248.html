			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Genka Markova commentary: "Whose Should Initiative Be?] </F>   [Text] Trying to conceal the fact that there is  essentially a cabinet crisis is not only a moral issue, but also  an affair of state. The unpleasant thing is that in such cases  the curtain falls by itself and then the public notices the fact  that the main political actors are nude, long before they  themselves realize it. They are helpless as children in the  present situation. The leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  [BSP], for example, unanimously plead with Professor Berov to  return to his post as soon as possible. Performing medical  miracles they try to make the public believe in the political  revival of the cabinet, which long ago exhausted the formula of  its formation as a result of its insolvency. Naturally, the BSP  will do this only until the moment it serves its interest, and  in any case not before an agreement with the international  finance institutions is signed, something which will serve as  the main claim of the Socialists in the forthcoming elections.    As far as the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] is concerned,  the present situation is another gift from heaven. The question  is how will the SDS utilize it. After the 15 March meeting of  its National Coordinating Council, the SDS called upon the  president to begin consultations with the political forces.    What could one expect from such a proposal? First of all,  after the recent attacks on the presidency the proposal is more  than an admission of the president's role in political life.  The idea to begin consultations with the political forces is  the best way of finding a solution to the current crisis, which  soon will develop from a cabinet into a parliamentary crisis.  The increasing fluctuation of deputies from one faction to  another will only prepare the ground for this development.    Our society is talking about new elections. Now someone  should take the initiative, which will produce practical  results. The five no-confidence proposals failed, but now the  situation is rather different. Deputies of the New Alliance for  Democracy categorically stated that they will not support the  cabinet. Deputies from other factions, including the BSP, will  most probably do the same. Now is the moment for the SDS to  assume the initiative. Instead of waiting for the president to  do the job of all other political factors in the country, the  SDS now should propose a formula for beginning political  consultations. Today this means a readiness to assume  responsibility.</p>

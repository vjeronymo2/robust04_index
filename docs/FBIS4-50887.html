			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Members of the  Sino-Portuguese Working Committee on the three major issues in  the transitional period in Macao met here today for the 12th  time to discuss and seek effective ways for the settlement of  these issues.    Han Zhaokang, Chinese representative from the  Sino-Portuguese  Joint Liaison Group, told reporters after the meeting that the  Chinese Government attaches equal importance to the settlement  of the three major issues, namely the localization of public  servants and law, as well as officialization of Chinese  language, stressing that all of them are equally important to  the smooth transition and transfer of power in Macao.    He pointed out that no matter the localization of public  servants or the localization of law, language is a question that  can not be ignored. So the three issues are of equal  importance, he added.</p>

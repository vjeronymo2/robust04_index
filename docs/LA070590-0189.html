			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONGRESSMEN TELL SHAMIR OF STRAINS IN ISRAEL'S IMAGE IN U.S.  </P> <P> Visiting U.S. congressmen told Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today that  Israel's image among Americans had been damaged by lack of progress toward  peace in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Shamir's office said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Reps.  </P> <P> Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Larry Smith (D-Fla.)(D- and Eliot L. Engel  (D-N.Y.) reported that congressional support for Israel remained firm but that  public backing had waned.  </P> <P> U.S.-Israeli relations have been badly strained by Israel's failure to open  talks with Palestinians, as proposed by Secretary of State James A. Baker III.  Shamir's new right-wing government has set tough conditions for negotiations  with Palestinians.  </P> <P> Shamir said violence was down in the 30-month-old uprising in the occupied  territories because the United States suspended talks with the Palestine  Liberation Organization after an abortive raid on Israeli beaches in May.  </P></p>

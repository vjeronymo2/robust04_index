			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW VENUS IMAGES DAZZLE WITH 'PANCAKE' VOLCANOES;  </P> <P> SPACE: MAGELLAN SPACECRAFT ALSO REVEALS MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS SEEMINGLY COVERED  WITH FOOL'S GOLD.  </P> <P> The Magellan spacecraft has sent back dazzling new pictures of the surface of  Venus showing mysterious pancake-like volcanoes and mountains and valleys that  appear to be covered with gold.  </P> <P> Fool's gold, that is, not the real stuff. The new images were released one day  after the spacecraft broke communications with Earth for the third time, but  this time it took only minutes for controllers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory  in Pasadena to regain control. Magellan project manager Anthony Spear said  changes in Magellan's computer software that were radioed to the spacecraft a  month ago allowed engineers to resume photographing the surface of Venus within  three orbits, compared to several days of lost time after the two earlier  incidents.  </P> <P> Engineers and scientists were delighted Friday that controllers had been able  to correct the problem so quickly, and they were absolutely enchanted by the  images the spacecraft sent back.  </P> <P> Normally, the tortured landscape of Venus -- with its volcanoes, craters,  mountains and ancient rivers of lava -- is hidden from view, but the radar  system aboard Magellan pierces through the dense clouds that envelop the  planet. The system produces images that look like shots of the Earth from a  high-altitude aircraft.  </P> <P> But the scene on Venus is quite different from the blue oceans and green  forests seen on Earth.  </P> <P> Photos released by JPL on Friday depict a barren, rugged landscape, pockmarked  with huge craters and twisted and torn by dynamic forces that have left the  surface of Venus a weathered and foreboding place. Among the most intriguing  images is one showing seven pancakes that apparently were formed by a series of  oozing volcanic eruptions.  </P> <P> The pancakes measure about 15 miles in diameter and are about 2,500 feet tall,  said Magellan project scientist Stephen Saunders. They are startling in their  near-perfect symmetry, and they stretch across the Venusian landscape like  cookies dropped on a tin plate.  </P> <P> The photo of the pancakes, like the thousands of other images being created at  JPL from narrow strips of data collected as Magellan glides around the planet,  should help scientists sort out the history of Venus and the dynamic processes  that are still reshaping the planet that is most like the Earth.  </P> <P> Saunders said scientists hope to learn something about the consistency of the  magma that lies beneath the Venusian surface by studying the tidy string of  volcanic pancakes.  </P> <P> Magellan continues to turn up mysteries as well as answers to questions that  have troubled scientists for years. For example, some of the images show great  fields and mountain slopes that appear to be covered with snow.  </P> <P> "It looks like snow, but we are talking about (a surface temperature) of 700  degrees Fahrenheit, so it certainly isn't ice," said Gordon H. Pettengill of  the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, principal investigator for radar  science.  </P> <P> To investigate this, Pettengill used Magellan's radar to measure the radiation  emitted by the surface of the planet. The "emission," as it is called, depends  mostly on the composition of the surface, and it offers clues to the chemical  nature of the material on the ground.  </P> <P> Based on the "emissivity" of the areas that look as though they are covered  with snow, Pettengill believes the substance is most likely iron pyrite, also  known as fool's gold.  </P> <P> But that answers one question while posing another.  </P> <P> "We don't know where it comes from," if indeed it is iron pyrite, he said. On  Earth, the material is associated with volcanic activity, and Venus has plenty  of volcanoes, but normally water is also required. Pettengill suggested that  the material may form on Venus in the absence of water because of the high  temperatures on the planet.  </P> <P> The Magellan images also show what appear to be enormous riverbeds winding  through the hills. But these were never rivers like those on Earth. They were  once rivers of molten lava, so hot that it burned its way into the surface as  it flowed for hundreds of miles, creating scars across a landscape that is void  of life.  </P> <P> So far, Magellan has covered more than 18% of the surface of Venus, an area  roughly equivalent to all of North and South America.  </P> <P> "We expect to get something like 80% of the planet" in the first phase of the  operation, said Spear, the project manager. That is even better than the goal  of 70% set before the mission began Sept. 15.  </P> <P> A second phase is to begin May 1, during which Magellan will continue to map  the surface of Venus as the planet spins within the spacecraft's polar orbit.  JPL, which manages the Magellan program, is run by Caltech for the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration.  </P> <P> Spear said Friday that it is still not known for certain why the spacecraft has  severed communications with JPL three times, but the leading candidate is  electronic "noise" somewhere in the system.  </P> <P> Every now and then, Spear said, the noise overwhelms the system and "zaps the  computer." At that point, the craft turns its largest antenna away from Earth  "and stares at the weeds," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US workers lobby Tate meeting - Union claims that dispute at Staley has soured relations A US TRADE union told shareholders attending Tate &amp; Lyle's annual meeting in London yesterday that a dispute at a factory in Illinois was 'souring' the business. Leaflets handed out at the entrance to the Barbican Centre, where the concert hall stalls were packed for the meeting, claimed that demoralised workers were less productive and that the dispute was giving the sugar and starch group 'a bad name.' 'Labour relations problems at AE Staley are bad business for you,' declared the leaflet, produced by the Allied Industrial Workers. It represents 760 hourly-paid workers at the Decatur factory, where management wants to reduce high costs through flexible working on shifts and in teams, incurring some job cuts. Mr Ed Feigen, a shareholder representing the union at the meeting, accused the local management of showing 'no willingness to negotiate' and of seeking to provoke a strike so that workers could be replaced. 'Is it possible for Staley to get its employees to be more productive and efficient if they are treated like the enemy?', he asked. He urged the main board to intervene. Mr Neil Shaw, Tate's chairman, replied: 'The need to be competitive is the most fundamental requirement. Without that we don't have jobs.' He had 'absolute confidence' in the local management. Mr Larry Pillard, Staley's chief executive officer, said: 'Staley operates nine other plants where it has an excellent employee relationship. 'At Decatur, they have developed a set of working practices that are simply out of date and not competitive with practices in other parts of Staley or the rest of the industry. Changes have to be made.' He said he believed in 'employee partnership' and denied that a lock-out was being sought. Shareholder reaction ranged from a muttered 'hmph, load of nonsense' to a sympathetic request for the management to bring in a peace maker. After the meeting Mr Dave Watts, union branch leader, said he hoped shareholders would press the board to seek a 'common sense solution'. He also refuted a statement made at the meeting that the dispute was not about money, claiming that cuts in benefits would cost workers Dollars 3 an hour out of average pay of Dollars 13.40. Staley has offered a 10 per cent pay increase over three years and says workers have been involved in 'designing shifts' at the three other corn plants, only one of which is unionised. It denied accusations of 'union bashing'. Tate acquired Staley in 1988 for Dollars 1.48bn - funded mainly by Dollars 800m debt, of which nearly half has been paid off, and a rights issue. Last year its profit contribution, before interest, fell by more than Pounds 30m to about Pounds 65m. Declining US performance lay behind Tate's first profits fall for 14 years - it made Pounds 189.5m (Pounds 230.8m) pre-tax on Pounds 3.37bn sales. One of Mr Shaw's main themes was that with the global sugar market growing by 2 to 2.5 per cent a year and starch by 5 to 6 per cent, 'we have no need to do anything other than continue to be more and more efficient.'</p>

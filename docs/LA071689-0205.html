			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KING STUMBLES, FALLS INTO TIE WITH SHEEHAN  </P> <P> Betsy King learned the hard way that it's impossible to coast in a major golf  championship.  </P> <P> King blew a three-stroke lead on the final two holes finished with a  double-bogey-bogey finish Saturday, dropping her into a tie with Patty Sheehan  in the third round of the U.S. Women's Open at Lake Orion, Mich..  </P> <P> Sheehan had a two-under-par 69, while King shot a 72. They were tied at  three-under-par 210, two shots ahead of Colleen Walker, the only other golfer  under par.  </P> <P> Marie-Laure de Lorenzi-Taya, a French citizen living in Spain, who shot a 71,  was next at 213.  </P> <P> King started four under par and got to seven under par with a birdie on the  13th hole, before the tough Scottish-style course began to strike back.  </P> <P> King, 33, began her collapse with a bogey at the 520-yard, par-five 15th hole,  where she put her drive in the tall heather that lines Indianwood's fairways.  </P> <P> On No. 17, a 188-yard, par-three, King missed her tee shot on the left side,  left her second shot short and in the rough, then hit her third shot 10 feet  past the hole. She two-putted from there.  </P> <P> King's 150-yard second shot to the final green went 20 feet above the pin. She  ran her first putt five feet past the hole and missed the comebacker.  </P> <P> Mike Hurlbert shot a three-under-par 68 to hold off Hal Sutton for a one-stroke  lead after three rounds of the Anheuser-Busch tournament at Williamsburg, Va.  </P> <P> Hurlbert has a total of 14-under-par 199. Sutton, seeking his first win in  three years, came from four strokes back with a 65.  </P> <P> Walter Zembriski rode a five-birdie front nine to a five-under-par 66 and a tie  with defending champion Orville Moody for the lead after two rounds of the  Greater Grand Rapids Open senior tournament at Grand Rapids, Mich. Moody shot a  70.  </P> <P> The leaders were at eight-under-par 134, one stroke ahead of Dale Douglass, who  had a 69.  </P> <P> Mike Allen, who had never finished higher than fifth in three years on the  European tour, holed shots from off the green three times in a round of  eight-under-par 63 that lifted him to a two-stroke victory in the Scottish Open  at Gleneagles.  </P> <P> Allen, 30, a native of San Francisco who lives in Phoenix and does not play on  the U.S. PGA Tour, had a 272 total and earned $80,000.  </P> <P> Ian Woosnam of Wales and Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain tied for second place.  </P></p>

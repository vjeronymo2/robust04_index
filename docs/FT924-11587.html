			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / International Company News: Advanta buys Kempinski stake ADVANTA Management Group has acquired 50 per cent of Berliner Kempinski, the hotel chain, for an undisclosed sum, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Twenty-three per cent was acquired from Lufthansa and the rest from Rolaco of Geneva. Advanta also has a 20-year option to buy Lufthansa's remaining 20 per cent, with the right to exercise the option after seven years. Rolaco has retained 10 per cent. Earlier this month Lufthansa and Advanta confirmed that they were holding talks on Kempinski. The move by Lufthansa to divest its Kempinski stake came after an unsuccessful attempt to merge the hotels with Air France's Meridien luxury chain.</p>

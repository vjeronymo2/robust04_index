			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / International Company News: Consortium buys E German coal mine Eastern Germany's highly-regulated utilities industry is set to be prised open after an Anglo-American consortium yesterday completed the purchase of one of the region's largest brown coal mines. PowerGen of the UK, and NRG and Morrison-Knudsen of the US yesterday acquired Mitteldeutsche Braunkohlenwerke (Mibrag) from the Treuhand privatisation agency. The consortium will invest more than DM1.3bn (Dollars 765m) between now and the year 2004. It has agreed to guarantee 2,100 jobs until the end of the decade in the three mines, two briquette plants, and a small generating plant which it has acquired. The remainder of the Mibrag complex, employing about 3,600, will be hived off from the consortium and placed under a separate company. Before German unification, Mibrag, which straddles the eastern states of Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony, employed more than 55,000 people. The consortium will target the investments primarily on modernising the mines and introducing the environmental technology required to reduce sharply the sulphuric oxide content of brown coal, a soft coal widely used in energy-production in eastern Germany. Mr David Petersen, president of NRG, said Mibrag would produce about about 20m tonnes a year. Although energy consumption had fallen sharply in eastern Germany because of the decline of the region's manufacturing base and growing competition from the gas sector, the consortium has secured coal delivery contracts. Mr Petersen said these would guarantee the economic viability of Mibrag. Mibrag's coal will be delivered locally to the 1,600-MW power plant at Lippendorf, owned by Veag, eastern Germany's main utility company; to Meag, a regional utility group; and to Schkopau, an 800-MW power plant. Schkopau is being built by VKR, the electricity arm of PreussenElektra, the large German utility company. The consortium has managed to secure a 44 per cent stake in Schkopau and will sign the agreement tomorrow. Mr Petersen said the consortium's acquisition of Mibrag and Schkopau was a 'milestone in the participation in the German energy industry. This will mean a more open and competitive industry.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Milosevic: "A Bitter Lesson"] </F>   [Text] We should hope that the bells of Croatian diplomacy  are ringing in alarm. The United Nations, the West, and NATO,  which Croatia so wholeheartedly relied upon as allies to help it  solve its greatest problem -- the reintegration of the occupied  areas -- have shown their true face. Morally corrupt,  cold-hearted, cynical, and incapable of preventing the tragedy  of Gorazde, these Croatian allies have crossed the Rubicon of  dignity and morals. Instead of responding to the latest Serb  tricks, lies, and crimes with strong military pressure, these  rich, powerful, and influential societies are openly discussing  lifting the sanctions imposed on Belgrade.    Those who believed that the West could not fall any lower  after Vukovar, Sarajevo, or Bijeljina have seen that there is no  end to the abyss. Croatia should find it indicative that  lifting the sanctions is discussed by UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali as well as the Belgrade supporters in Moscow, and  that even the U.S. Administration has been making completely  confusing announcements regarding the issue.    The fact that the Americans are prepared to consider lifting  the sanctions if the Serbs withdraw from Gorazde and at least  reduce the attacks in other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly  shows that the West and the international community consider  Croatia the least of their concerns. Not taking even the UN  resolutions into consideration, Butrus-Ghali has shown that the  peaceful reintegration of the occupied Croatian territories is  not on the list of his political priorities. This is why  Croatia can do nothing else but respond to this (un)expected  development of events by taking the diplomatic steps that will  prevent the jaded world power-wielders from leaving it alone  with the problem, the solution for which they impose, but do  nothing to implement.    The lesson is bitter, but it is a good one, and we should  hope that it has arrived on time.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Japanese money supply picks up Money supply grew in Japan last month at an increased pace, after slowing since April when government spending was stalled by a parliamentary dispute over passage of the budget. The Bank of Japan said yesterday that M2 plus certificates of deposit grew a preliminary 1.9 per cent in July against the same month last year, and confirmed its earlier estimate of a 1.5 per cent increase for June. The central bank expects the July figure will not be far exceeded in the current quarter - the strongest growth this year was April's 2.2 per cent spurt. Last month's rise stemmed partly from tax rebates on salaries. The rebates, part of a package to stimulate the economy unveiled in the spring by the then government, accompanied summer bonus payments to employees. Their effect had yet to show through fully in household spending data for June, released yesterday by the Management and Co-ordination Agency. These showed an inflation-adjusted decline of 0.9 per cent from a year earlier, although moderated from a 1.7 per cent drop in May. The agency said July figures might show an upturn, as many families received proceeds from the tax cuts late in June. The summer heatwave, which is increasing sales of drinks and air conditioners, is also expected to help. Demand for electricity in July jumped 13.4 per cent from a year earlier, according to the Federation of Electric Power Companies yesterday. Household power demand rose 20.2 per cent, while big industrial users drew just 5.6 per cent more. But key Japanese industries, which have struggled through the longest recession since the second world war, are making preparations for a revival, according to a survey released this week by Nippon Credit Bank, a big lender to manufacturers. Automotive and electronics producers, two engines of economic growth, plan to increase capital spending this year after three years of decline, the NCB findings indicate. Car makers were stepping up outlays on plant and equipment by 1 per cent in the current fiscal year to March, and the electronics sector by 11.9 per cent. The increases will not be uniform. A Sony executive said yesterday, for example, that his company would do no more than maintain last year's level of spending. Across the Japanese private sector as a whole, capital expenditure planned for the year was still down by 1.1 per cent from the previous year. But the cut would be more modest than the 8.1 per cent reduction recorded in 1993, and the bank said the period of reduced spending commitments was nearing an end. The legacy of the country's burst asset 'bubble' of the late 1980s lived on yesterday in land values set annually by the National Tax Administration Agency. According to its calculations, land in Tokyo is worth at least a fifth less than a year ago.</p>

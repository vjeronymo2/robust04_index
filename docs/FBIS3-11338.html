			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by William Franca from the Brasilia Bureau] </F>   [Text] The Chamber of Deputies on 16 March rejected  President Itamar Franco's veto of an article of the law that  establishes public employees' salaries and increased their  salaries to the same level as those of the justices of the  Supreme Court. This represents a real increase of 23.66 percent  as of March. Ministers will also benefit from the measure and  receive a 95.14 percent hike. The move was voted on in a secret  session and must be approved by a majority in the Senate (which  did not have a quorum on 16 March).    If the Senate ratifies the decision, federal deputies,  senators, ministers, and Supreme Court justices will receive in  March the equivalent of 6,123.51 URV's [Real Value Unit] (in  other words, 4,699,606.77 cruzeiros at the 16 March URV rate).  This decision will generate "a domino effect" because the  internal rules and regulations of Congress allows for the  revision of the salaries of all other employees to maintain  parity. This will also occur in the state legislatures and  municipal town halls where salaries are pegged to those of  federal deputies, the National Accounting Office, and the  Attorney General's Office.    Within the executive branch, the rejection of the veto will  permit employees of state and semi-state enterprises, such as  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation], the Central Bank,  and the Federal Police to have their salaries readjusted. No  estimation has been made of how much this will increase the  payroll.</p>

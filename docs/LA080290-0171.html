			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> THEATER REVIEW: 'WIZARD OF OZ';  </P> <P> MUNCHKIN CITY;  </P> <P> BASED ON THE 1939 MOVIE, THE SHOW AT THE ENCORE THEATER HAS INTRICATE DANCES  AND FINE SLAPSTICK.  </P> <P> With a cast of more than 50 singers, dancers and actors, "The Wizard of Oz,"  currently playing at the Encore Dinner Theater in Ventura, is an ambitious  production. More important to the audience, though, it's a highly entertaining  show -- as the song goes, a whiz of a "Wiz."  </P> <P> The stage production is an adaptation, by Frank Gabrielson, of the 1939 MGM  film. All of the movie's most popular songs are included, though some  characters are eliminated and the plot is changed somewhat to facilitate  staging.  </P> <P> Thus, we meet Dorothy, Uncle Henry, Aunt Em, various witches, the trio of  Scarecrow, Tin Woodman and Cowardly Lion, and the Wizard himself. But the  flying monkeys we remember as henchmen to the Wicked Witch of the West have  become "Spirits," and Dorothy seems to have misplaced her little dog, Toto.  </P> <P> On the other hand, this production has plenty of Munchkins, those tiny citizens  of Oz portrayed by little people in the film and by a whole passel of  youngsters on the Encore stage. And there's a henchman for the Wicked Witch of  the West who resembles Boris Karloff as Frankenstein's monster. The Sprits  dance to Gounod's "Funeral March of a Marionette," a melody more closely  identified with Alfred Hitchcock than with Oz.  </P> <P> Prepared for those practically negligible differences, it's easy to enjoy this  "Wizard" on its own terms. Director Gary Bruce Sayles and choreographer Aron  Mandelbaum don't just manage to keep everybody onstage from constantly bumping  into one another (an accomplishment in its own right), they give the characters  interesting things to do, ranging from rather complicated dances to a fine  piece of slapstick in which the evil spirits almost successfully divert Dorothy  and her friends from the road to Oz.  </P> <P> Shani Harriott is a talented Dorothy, winning hearts early on with her a  cappella rendition of the verse to "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" (prerecorded  backing tracks come in for the chorus and most of the rest of the songs).  </P> <P> The trio of fellow travelers play their parts pretty much like their movie  counterparts, with loose-limbed Kevin Davis particularly notable as the  Scarecrow, Al Schurmann nonthreateningly bellicose as the Lion and Joseph Louis  Garces III not too stiff as the Tin Man.  </P> <P> The young Munchkins turn in commendable performances, with Merrick McMahon  appearing as the Mayor and Casey Anderson turning in an amusing evocation of  the movie Munchkins' tiny little voices.  </P> <P> As if he didn't have enough to do, director Sayles also appears as Uncle Henry  and an official of Oz, though nothing is made of the physical resemblance  between some Oz people and the folks back home in Kansas, as the film did.  </P> <P> The songs come across nicely, with the human voices combined with those  prerecorded tracks. Paula Jones is credited as musical director. Also worthy of  note is the scenery, including several backdrops illustrating numerous stops in  Kansas and Oz. Mike Bollow is the stage manager.  </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: "The Wizard of Oz" plays Thursday through Saturday nights,  with Sunday matinees, through Aug. 18.

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar tumbles in New York THE DOLLAR fell through the psychologically important level of DM1.60 against the D-Mark yesterday following the release of a very disappointing set of US economic indicators, writes James Blitz. The US currency bottomed out in London at DM1.5958 and later recovered a little to close at DM1.5995, more than 1 1/4 pfennigs down on the day. It weakened sharply again in the US, however, dropping back to finish at DM1.5920. The dollar also hit another all-time low against the Japanese yen, with the new record standing last night at Y113.70. The US currency later finished at Y114.05 from a previous close of Y114.90. In New York it ended at the Y114.05 level. The decline of the US currency was exacerbated yesterday by poorer than expected weekly jobless figures, which rose 380,000 when the market had been expecting an increase in unemployment of 347,000. These were seen as a bad omen for today's non-farm payroll figure for March, the most important indicator in the dollar market. A weaker than expected indicator from the National Association of Purchasing Managers also depressed sentiment towards the dollar. The market had been expecting the overall index to be 54 per cent but it was slightly weaker at 53.4 per cent. A weaker than expected payroll index - down to 46.9 per cent from a previous 48.7 per cent - again depressed sentiment about today's main indicator. An additional factor weakening the US currency yesterday was the Bundesbank's decision not to change its officially posted interest rates at its weekly council meeting. There had been few expectations of a cut in the Bundesbank's rates, since the discount rate was reduced only two weeks ago. Nevertheless, yesterday's was the last Bundesbank council meeting for three weeks, and this helped to dampen sentiment. Dealers remain concerned by a differential between official US and German short-term interest rates that is still close to 5 percentage points. In spite of the Bundesbank's decision, the pound rallied sharply against both the D-Mark and the dollar yesterday. The market continued to be swayed by the governor of the Bank of England's comment on Wednesday that he was seeking a stronger exchange rate for the currency. Sterling closed 1 1/4 pfennigs up against the D-Mark at DM2.4400. Against the weak dollar, the pound raced up to Dollars 1.5255, a net gain of two cents on the day. In New York the pound was even stronger, closing at Dollars 1.5300. The French franc strengthened against the D-Mark following the Bank of France's decision not to cut interest rates. The franc closed at FFr3.393 from a previous FFr3.396. However, the lira again suffered a collapse, closing sharply weaker against the D-Mark at L995.1 from a previous L989.7.</p>

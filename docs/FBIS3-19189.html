			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Spanish Government has given to understand that  in Brussels on Tuesday [15 March] a fisheries agreement could be  reached with Norway, which would permit this Nordic country's  entry into the European Union [EU]. However, according to  official sources quoted today, Saturday, by the Madrid daily EL  PAIS, there is no compromise in sight on institutional  adaptations and changes in voting. Meanwhile, the Spanish  Government has won the support of all the political parties,  including those of the opposition, in the joint congress-senate  commission of the Spanish Cortes [parliament] for the position  being upheld in Brussels in the face of its Community partners.    Today, the aforementioned Madrid newspaper carries an  article  by Vicente Albero, the Spanish minister of agriculture,  fisheries and food, in which he reflects on the common fisheries  policy and defends the Spanish position as regards its partners.  Albero reiterates the point that on the subject of fisheries,  Spain has a great interest in a country like Norway joining the  European Union, but he stresses that this does not justify the  abolition of the common wealth by pleading geographical  exceptionality or greater efficiency of management of resources.  In his article, the Spanish minister of agriculture and  fisheries recalls that the Spanish fishing industry is the  biggest and most complex of the whole of the European Union. He  warns that Community enlargement must not and cannot represent a  step backwards as regards what has hitherto been achieved.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 4 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today  unanimously approved Bohumira Kopecna in the post of the Czech  attorney general. Previously -- from January 1, 1994 -- Kopecna  was charged with temporary heading of the Attorney General's  Office as deputy attorney general until the appointment of an  attorney general.    Bohumira Kopecna, LLB, was born on July 28, 1946. She  graduated at the Law School of Prague Charles University and in  1971 she began to work at the District Prosecutor's Office in  Bruntal, north Moravia. Later she worked at District  Prosecutor's Office in Sumperk, north Moravia, and from 1975 she  was prosecutor in the department of general crime at Municipal  Prosecutor's Office in Brno, south Moravia.    In 1990, Kopecna was appointed deputy prosecutor at  Brno-Countryside Prosecutor's Office, where she worked until  April 1993. Then she returned to Brno Prosecutor's Office where  she worked until December 1993, when the Czech Justice Minister  Jiri Novak appointed her deputy attorney general.    Kopecna has never been member of a political party. "I am  neither member of any party nor I do intend to join any party,  but I favor the Civic Democratic Party (ODS). It is true, that  I voted for them in the last (June 1992) elections," Kopecna  told CTK on Tuesday. She also said that if she is proposed to  the post of the attorney general, she would accept, also because  it was unbearable to exercise simultaneously the functions of  the attorney general and deputy attorney general. "It is  necessary to separate these functions," she said.</p>

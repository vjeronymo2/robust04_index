			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Once a draft application has been prepared, the PHA shall make a copy available for reading in the management office; provide copies of the draft to any resident organization representing the residents of any development involved; and provide adequate opportunity for comment by the residents of the developments and their representative organizations prior to making the application final; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Providing to HUD and any resident organization representing the development a summary of the resident comments and the PHA's response to them; and notifying residents of the developments that the summary and responses are available for reading in the management office; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) After HUD approval of a grant, notifying residents of the development and any representative organizations of the approval of the grant; providing any resident organization with a copy of the HUD-approved implementation schedule; notifying the residents that the schedule is available in the management office for reading; and developing a system to facilitate regular resident monitoring of the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Resident Training, Employment, and Contracting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Vacancy Reduction Program provides an ideal opportunity to enhance resident training, employment, and contracting. In furtherance of HUD goals and priorities, PHAs should, to the greatest extent possible, provide such opportunities for residents under this program, including development of programs under section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) (Section 3). Section 3 requires best efforts on the part of the PHA to give low- and very low-income persons training and employment opportunities generated by Vacancy Reduction Program assistance, and to award contracts for work to be performed in connection with Vacancy Reduction Program assistance to business concerns that provide economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons. A PHA shall include in its vacancy reduction plan the projected number of residents the PHA expects to be trained or hired, and the number of business firms that provide economic opportunity to low- and very low-income persons to be contracted with for vacancy reduction activities, whether directly by the PHA or through business concerns with which the PHA has contracts for vacancy reduction activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Required Results <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Except as provided below, funds provided under this NOFA must be expended and units reoccupied within 24 months from the date of funding, and management improvements must be implemented fully within 3 years from the date of funding. However, the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing may approve alternative schedules proposed by PHAs with significant management improvement needs. Funds awarded under this program that are not obligated on a timely basis may be recaptured. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) During the funding period, move-ins to developments funded under this program must at least equal the number of move-outs plus the number of units funded under this program (excluding units that are vacated for modernization and later reoccupied after modernization). At the end of the funding period, the PHA's current vacancy rate must be reduced to the extent of the number of units funded under this program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Selection and Funding Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sufficiency of Application.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to be considered for funding, an application must be complete and consistent with the terms of this NOFA, and the vacancy reduction plan must generally be consistent with the recommendations of the assessment team. The Department recognizes that some variance will exist since some of the assessments already conducted concentrated on units that could be repaired for $10,000 or less. In determining the amount of funds to be reserved for each approvable application, HUD will review the request for consistency with the recommendations of the assessment team and will consider any other information HUD may have available. When an approvable vacancy reduction plan submitted in response to this NOFA needs improvement or supplementation, HUD will require any necessary changes or additions to the plan, and will assist the PHA in revising its plan, before execution of the amendment of the ACC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Management Deficiencies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a PHA does not adequately address management weaknesses that contribute to its vacancy problem and have been reported by the assessment team, its application will be deemed ineligible for funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Funding Decisions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When a PHA is requesting funding for eligible units in which rehabilitation costs will exceed an average of $8,000 (see paragraph (1)(a)(ii) in the definition of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D of this NOFA), HUD will determine whether the PHA's plan to fund the cost above an average of $8,000 per unit is reasonable. However, no PHA may receive greater than 15 percent of the total amount of funding available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CIAP Agencies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD will fully fund all eligible units and associated costs (as defined in Section I.F of this NOFA) for which CIAP agencies apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> CGP Agencies.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> From the remaining funds HUD will fund eligible applications from CGP agencies to the extent funding is available. Of the total funds remaining available for CGP agencies, 75 percent will be made available for units eligible under paragraph (1)(a)(i) in the definition of ``eligible unit'' in Section I.D, ``Definitions,'' of this NOFA. The other 25 percent will be made available for units eligible under paragraph (1)(a)(ii) of that definition of ``eligible unit''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the amount of funds available is sufficient to fund fully (including the costs of management improvements, lead-based paint control, and accessibility for the disabled) all CGP agencies in either category of funding, HUD will fund those requests fully. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the total funding requested by CGP agencies in any category exceeds the total amount of funds available in that category, the amount to be reserved for each CGP agency will be determined as follows, except that an agency will not be funded at a level exceeding its budget request: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) If the amount of available funding is sufficient, each CGP agency will be funded for its eligible costs (exclusive of management improvements and the costs of lead-based paint control and accessibility for the disabled). If funds remain available after funding the requested costs under this paragraph, each CGP agency will receive a pro rated share of the remaining funds, according to the ratio of eligible related costs (i.e., management improvements and the costs of lead-based paint control and accessibility for the disabled) requested by the agency to the total of eligible related costs requested by all CGP agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If the amount of available funding is not sufficient to fund all eligible costs costs under paragraph (3)(b)(ii)(A) of this Section I.J, the funding allocated to each CGP agency will be its pro rata share of funds, determined by using the same ratio as the number of eligible units in the CGP agency in that category for which funding is requested to the total number of eligible units in that category for which funding is requested by all applicant CGP agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

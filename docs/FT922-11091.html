			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Time Warner may reschedule Dollars 7bn of loans TIME WARNER, the debt-laden US media and entertainment company, is seeking to reschedule Dollars 7.2bn of bank loans in what could be the biggest US corporate debt restructuring of the year. The New York-based company, which recently saw the ousting of Mr Nick Nicholas, president and co-chief executive, has employed Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust as the agent banks to handle most of the debt rescheduling. Chemical and Bankers Trust have begun marketing a Dollars 6.2bn loan for TW that would replace other bank loans taken on in 1989, at the time of the costly Dollars 14bn merger of Time with Warner Communications. Although TW's operating subsidiaries are profitable, the heavy debt burden has pre-occupied top management and resulted in large losses for Time Warner since the merger. Among the reasons why Mr Nicholas was ousted in February was his disagreement with Mr Steve Ross, the Time Warner chairman, over how to solve the company's debt problems. The Time Warner debt rescheduling plan calls for the maturity of the Dollars 6.2bn new loan to be stretched out beyond current commitments. At present Time Warner is supposed to make huge annual repayments of principal that could have crippled the company - some Dollars 2.3bn next year and Dollars 1.4bn each year from 1994 to 1997. The interest rate on the new loan is expected to be about one percentage point above the London interbank offered rate (Libor), which should be about 50 to 75 basis points higher than the present average cost on bank debt. Interest rates on Time Warner debt have been high in part because the company came into existence as one of the biggest and last of the highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) of the 1980s. Time Warner's total debt is Dollars 8.7bn. The company also has another Dollars 6.3bn of preferred stock that was generated by the 1989 merger. Debt servicing cost Dollars 966m in 1991, which pushed the loss to Dollars 99m for the year. But the cost of dividends on the preferred stock plunged Time Warner into a much larger Dollars 692m deficit last year. The preferred dividend costs led to an ultimate Dollars 150m loss in the first quarter of 1992, which eclipsed the company's Dollars 3m net profit. Along with the Dollars 6.2bn new loan, Time Warner is presently completing a Dollars 1.1bn private placement among institutional investors. The company should also receive Dollars 1bn from Toshiba and C. Itoh of Japan, the Japanese companies that are buying 12.5 per cent of Time Warner Entertainment (TWE), a new subsidiary that will contain the film, cable television programming and cable operating assets of the group. But that money will go out of the company again since TW plans to spend another Dollars 1bn to buy shares in American Television and Communica-tions (ATC), a publicly quoted cable operating subsidiary that will be part of TWE. Yesterday, as word of the debt rescheduling began to spread, Time Warner's share price declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 103 5/8 .</p>

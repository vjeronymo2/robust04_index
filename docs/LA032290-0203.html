			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> ELECTION RIVAL BEGINS ROHRABACHER ATTACK  </P> <P> Democratic congressional candidate Guy C. Kimbrough kicked off his campaign  Wednesday at the Huntington Beach pier by attacking the environmental record of  Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita).  </P> <P> Kimbrough, a professor at Mt.  </P> <P> San Jacinto College who lost to Rohrabacher in 1988, criticized his rival for  supporting an increase in offshore oil drilling in the wake of Orange County's  recent tanker spill. Kimbrough said he opposes any additional drilling off the  California coast.  </P> <P> "As usual, he misses the big picture," Kimbrough said. "His position is  wrongheaded and shortsighted."  </P> <P> Rohrabacher declined to comment on Kimbrough's charges Thursday. "My position  will be that until the primary is over, I will not be answering to charges  made," he said. He will respond to his Democratic opponents, he explained, only  after one of them wins the party's nomination in the June 5 primary.  </P> <P> Kimbrough and computer operator James Cavuoto are seeking the Democratic  nomination to challenge the freshman Rohrabacher. The predominantly Republican  42nd Congressional District straddles the boundary between Orange and Los  Angeles counties, stretching along the coast from Huntington Beach to Rancho  Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Rohrabacher defeated Kimbrough in the 1988 general election 64% to 33%.  Kimbrough raised only $11,889, compared to almost $500,000 for Rohrabacher.DAVE  LESHER  </P></p>

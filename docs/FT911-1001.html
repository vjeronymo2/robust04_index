			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Arts: Terror spiked with jet-black humour - Cinema MISERY (18) Odeon Leicester Sq NIGHT SUN (12) Renoir and Chelsea AY] CARMELA (12) Lumiere ZANDALEE (18) Cannons West End PERFECTLY NORMAL (PG) Prince Charles Imagine that you have finished typing your latest novel. Your New York publisher Lauren Bacall is dying to see it. You hop into your car to leave your snow-swirled country hotel. But on an icy corner you skid off the road, somersault down a mountain-slope and disappear from the world under six feet of snow. That is the good news. The bad news is that you are then rescued and cared for by the maddest owner-occupier in the whole Midwest. As played in Misery by Oscar-winning Kathy Bates, she resembles a giant tea-cosy who has escaped from a mental asylum. While tucking you into bed and attaching a dripfeed, she ringingly insists that she is your 'number one fan'. She loves your romantic novels about the heroine Misery Chastain, and gee golly, Paul, is this your latest book? Can she read it? Can you stop her. I am afraid she is not going to like your new book, Paul. And when she dislikes something she tends to reach for an object either blunt or sharp. A sledgehammer, say, or a kitchen knife . . . Luckily, even though Paul is broken-legged and cannot escape, he is played in this Stephen King-based thriller by actor James Caan, tough even when terrified. And his story is directed by Rob (When Harry Met Sally) Reiner with a wit and malicious relish that makes his sufferings piquant to others if not to himself. I am dashed if I can remember a film virtually confined to one room that gave its audience this kind of rollercoaster ride. Spryly scripted by William (Magic) Goldman, Misery will have you digging your nails into your well-upholstered neighbour under the delusion that she is your chair-arm. At least, if you are lucky, she is not Miss Bates. This actress, though unrelated to Norman, has the same blend of childlike charm and homicidal passion. A roly-poly face slashed by a saucer grin surmounts a body like a barrage balloon. She can coo, sigh, laugh, scold. She can also - ready with those earplugs - scream with anger. If Miss Bates is the hostess with the leastest, Mr Caan is the guest with the dwindling choice of escape scenarios. He could crawl broken-legged to the front door, but his bedroom door is locked. Or he could poison Miss B with his hoarded tranquillisers, but she tends to spill her drinks. Never mind. There is always Sheriff Roberts Farnsworth in the local town, though he seems to be about 99 years old and may take a while to put two and two together. As with all great thrillers, Misery combines terror with a jet-black humour. Some ancestral memory of Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust, where the jungle-marooned madman Mr Todd held the hero prisoner with enforced Dickens readings, may have inspired King's tale of literary detention. But Misery adds a modern dimension: the sophisticated celebrity pinioned by his schmaltz-reared fan. It is not just the kitchen knife but the kitsch that hurts: the china animals and Liberace records. It is not just the murder threats but the murderous gush. 'I'm your number one fan, Paul]' But as the late Julius Caesar discovered, it is your friends who get you in the end. Night Sun, by Paolo and Vittorio Taviani, is a radiantly mysterious epic. Based on Tolstoy's Father Sergei, it assembles a typical Italian movie cast  -that is, scarcely anyone is Italian - in a story of sacred and profane love. Setting: 18th century Italy, from the court of Naples to rural Sicily. Stars: Julian Sands, Nastassja Kinski, Charlotte Gainsbourg. Sands, whose flayed-borzoi features are the definition of asceticism, is the royal aide-de-camp who spurns a career-advancing marriage to the King of Naples' former mistress (Kinski). To a monastery he goes. And thence, seeking further purity of self-denial, to a hermit's cottage in Sicily. 'I know why he's doing it,' proclaims his mother; 'to rise above those who humiliated him.' Yes indeed. Also to find his own dark night of the soul in which to create a sun of self-illumination. Alas, he has scarcely worked up his initial miracle-working powers before earthly matters intrude. First, his retreat threatens to turn into a tourist attraction for la tutta Sicilia. Secondly, two successive female visitors (Patricia Millardet, Mlle Gainsbourg) play siren to his aspiring saint. But if Sands finds his miracle-working gift jeopardised, the Taviani brothers do not. Though Night Sun comes in the second league of their work, after Padre Padrone and with more compromised curios like Good Morning Babylon, it proves they are among the few living film-makers whose images can catch the breath. A tree spilling a white petal on a boy's hand; a silver curtain of rain slicing across the night sky and into the earth like a violent benediction. Night Sun is about the merciless beauty of divine grace, and the difficulty of tending it even in the world's darkest corners. The film has a surreal passion unique to the Tavianis and a poetic seriousness undreamt in most parts of the movie globe today. Carlos Saura's Ay] Carmela from Spain is a hackneyed old heart-clutcher about the Human Spirit versus the Fascist Imperative. Captured by Franco's army, what can song-and-dance veterans Paulino (Andres Pajares) and Carmela (Carmen Maura) do to avoid betraying their Republican loyalties?They have been asked to perform in front of the Generalissimo himself. But Carmela - she is so excitable - might blow the number in which she is supposed to insult the Republican flag by doing a semi-striptease in it. The film plays like To Be Or Not To Be rugby-tackled by The Colditz Story. Laden with Spanish 'Oscars', it is goodhearted, patriotic and creakingly undistinguished. Why Britain needs to see it is a mystery, unless the luscious Miss Maura (of Women On the Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown) is now considered an offer no filmgoer can refuse, whatever film she appears in. Finally, two for Curio Corner. Zandalee is a tale of naked passion in New Orleans. Hurling off their clothes and West Coast accents, Nicolas Cage and Judge Reinhold vie for the love of Mr Reinhold's nubile wife Erika Anderson. She, the titular Zandalee, is torn between her novelist spouse, whose writer's block appears to have spread to the rest of his body, and his passionate painter friend, whose love-making noises would surely attract the Bourbon Street branch of the Noise Abatement Society. From bedroom to bayou we follow them, our minds boggling that this ill-kempt farrago was directed by the talented New Zealander Sam Pillsburg (The Scarecrow). The Press show audience was in uproarious mood, not least when Mr Cage's artist, a specialist in nudes, expatiated on the problems of sexual harassment at work. 'When that big red snatch is comin' at yer like a freight train, it's pretty hard to paint, I'll tell yer]' Yves Simoneau's Perfectly Normal from Canada is mad but manageable. Powered by a svelte dream-logic, burly con-person Lonnie (Robbie Coltrane) and pintsize brewery worker Renzo (Michael Riley) strike up one of those friendships that only happen in films. Will the shy Renzo accede to the shyster Lonnie's proposal to start a restaurant with an operatic motif? Will they end up together in full drag singing the duet from Norma while the first-night customers twirl their linguine? Of course they will. But first the plot shoots off in a dozen directions, from psychotic ice-hockey coaches to picnics in the snow. The dialogue is sprightly, and visually Simoneau's bug-eyed wide-angle images suggest Citizen Kane reprocessed for fairy-tale Canada.</p>

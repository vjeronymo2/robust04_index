			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Building society lending declines but savers return: Strength of consumer demand unclear as new home sales rise British savers flocked back to building society accounts last month, providing a surprise twist to two weeks of growing evidence of strong consumer demand. At the same time, April figures showed a drop in net new mortgage commitments by building societies and a sharp slowdown in bank and building society lending. There were signs, however, that tax increases which took effect last month have so far had only a slight impact on the gradual recovery in the UK housing market. Taken together, the statistics published yesterday gave no clear picture of the UK economy. The decline in lending and rise in savings implies a lack of confidence on the part of consumers and businesses. But the Housebuilders Federation said yesterday that sales and prices of new homes were rising faster than at any time since the recession began in 1990. A survey of more than 400 housebuilders showed that the housing recovery, which slowed slightly in March, resumed its upward progress last month. The Bank of England meanwhile announced that M4, its broad measure of the money supply, and bank lending in April were weak. The annual growth of M4 slipped back to 5.7 per cent in April, from 5.9 per cent in March, while M4 lending was just Pounds 500m, compared with the Pounds 2bn expected by City analysts. A contributing factor was a Pounds 911m drop in lending by the biggest British banks. This, according to the British Bankers Association, was the first monthly decline since December 1992. Net new mortgage commitments by building societies totalled Pounds 3.1bn last month - down from Pounds 3.7bn in March but broadly in line with April last year. The number of new commitments was 54,000 last month, compared with 50,000 in April 1993, said the Building Societies Association. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the BSA, said the fall in net new commitments came after a very sharp rise in March which had been linked to the timing of the Easter weekend. But he emphasised the increase in societies' net lending compared with this time last year. The net inflow to societies of Pounds 385m in April ended a five-month period of withdrawals from the sector and represented the highest level of deposits since May last year. Heavy withdrawals resulted in a net monthly outflow of Pounds 653m in March, the highest since September 1986. Although, as Mr Coles pointed out, the turnround in the pattern of savings over March and April was the strongest for several years, the inflow for April was still weak compared with the Pounds 1.1bn recorded in the same month last year. Savers have been turning to investments such as unit trusts or national savings products. Societies have had to rely more heavily on the interest automatically credited to accounts, and the wholesale money markets, to finance lending. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said that although competition from unit trusts and national savings products might be waning, societies were facing more competition from the high street banks for personal customers. Although the weak bank and building society lending figures may reflect the impact of April's tax increases, analysts warned that the figures were highly erratic. The Treasury said the recent trend, which showed slow growth in lending, was consistent with a low inflation environment.

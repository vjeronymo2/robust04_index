			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Arts: Today's Television The last in C4's series about Nomads (9.00) describes the life of the Eveni who live in the coldest inhabited region on earth, the Verkhoyansk mountains of Siberia where temperatures fall to minus 70 centigrade. There are 15,000 of them and, since they live by following the reindeer herds, it seems they are not easy to find. They were almost eradicated during the communist era, and the tribe's survival is threatened again by the political and economic upheavals of what was the Soviet Union. Today's episode in Present Imperfect (9.30 BBC2) is concerned with Max Clifford, a PR man whose clients have included Pamella Bordes, Derek Hatton and, most recently, the Minister Of Fun's own special provider of fun, Antonia de Sancha. Mr Clifford is credited with helping these people polish their stories and then negotiating the tabloid deals which have made them so profitable. BBC2 screens a Late Show Special devoted to Michael Powell, the English film director who formed a famous partnership with Emeric Pressburger (11.15). His best known movies include 'The Spy In Black' and 'The Life And Death Of Colonel Blimp'.</p>

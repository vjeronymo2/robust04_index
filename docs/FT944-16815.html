			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Vietnam's dollar ban confuses investors: Hanoi move to end parallel money halts hard currency spending Sweeping regulations outlawing the use of the US dollar in most transactions in Vietnam and favouring the local currency, the dong, appear to have dealt a psychological blow to investors who have depended on foreign currency revenues for profits. The new rules have been announced by the prime minister but left to the central bank, known as the State Bank, to implement. Under them, hotels, airlines, taxis and shops are, as of October 1, no longer allowed to advertise prices in dollars and will only accept payment in the not freely convertible dong. The measure also requires Vietnamese organisations to channel their hard currency earnings through banks, rather than holding cash. Already in the capital Hanoi and the south's Ho Chi Minh City, mini foreign exchange counters have sprouted in hotels and restaurants, where tourists and business people must exchange dollars for the local unit to pay bills increasingly made out in dong. Foreign investors are confused as to precisely how the rules will be enforced and are worried about the effect it may have on investor confidence. Their biggest problem is working out how, under the rules, projects whose earnings projections depend on dollar revenues will survive in an environment where revenues are now earned in a currency which is impossible to repatriate. 'At the moment people won't spend (hard currency) money until the position is clarified,' said Bill Magennis, chief representative of Australian law firm Phillips Fox. The move in effect wipes out foreign companies' ability to receive earnings in dollars and therefore to meet hard currency obligations abroad. Indications from the State Bank are that clarifying guidelines will soon be issued, possibly listing some exemptions. But until this is clearer, the mood among foreign investors is likely to remain one of concern. 'Unless you can get some sort of counter trade sorted out, you're going to be stuck with profits in a non-convertible currency,' said Tony Foster, resident partner of London-based law firm Freshfields. 'You've got no assurance that you can get your money out of the country.' There are also fears the move may drive the currency underground. 'Everyone's going to get dollars wherever they can and that's going to create a black market,' Mr Foster added. There are a few exceptions under the 1992 Law on Foreign Investment, which allows for exporters, infrastructure investors and certain import substitution projects freely to convert dong earnings into hard currency. But since Vietnam opened up to foreign investors in the late 1980s, the greenback has been the currency of choice for most transactions, with business people and tourists preferring to pay in dollars rather than unwieldy bundles of dong. Now, everything from restaurant meals to purchases of foreign-made machinery for investment projects will have to be made in dong. Although the local unit has in the last two years stabilised against the dollars at around 11,000 dong to the dollar, the highest denomination note is 50,000 dong. Policymakers are hoping the move will dampen inflation, which rose an alarming 1.6 per cent in September from the previous month, endangering the government's target of single-figure inflation for the whole year. Inflation in the first nine months was 9.9 per cent, government statistics show. Hanoi signalled its determination to eliminate the dual currency system in statements earlier this year, aiming to siphon an estimated Dollars 800m in dollar bills in circulation into the banking system and curb the growth of a 'shadow' economy in a country of 72m people. Vietnam is particularly keen to ensure that roughly 300 Vietnamese enterprises that trade primarily in dollars will in future channel their hard currency through the banking system. 'Dollars are now the means of payment in the shadow economy,' said one Vietnamese economist and top government planner. 'But by circulating Dollars 800m in Vietnam, Hanoi is providing Washington with Dollars 800m credit without interest. The regulation is necessary because we need to get this into the banking system.' Hanoi has also launched a modest domestic bond sales programme targeted at local Vietnamese, with the aim of coaxing an estimated Dollars 2bn in gold and dollars currently stockpiled in people's homes. The idea is to try to shore up foreign exchange reserves and attract more overseas loan for development. Foreign investors - particularly in the hotels sector - are likely to be keen to seek exemptions from the ruling so that they will be able to convert their dong earnings into dollars. It is understood that the State Bank has set a deadline of the end of this month by which applications should be made. According to one State Bank official, they may receive a sympathetic hearing. 'In principle, the State Bank says this is all right, but there will have to be guidelines published detailing exactly how far this goes,' he said. Foreign bankers generally welcomed the move as a way of removing the parallel currency system, but pinned the chances of success on how the rules are enforced. 'I think that in the long term, it's a good move,' said one Hanoi-based banker. 'It actively encourages some bona fide transactions to go through the banking system. Certainly, the intention is not to scare away foreign investors. But the way the transition is managed will be crucial.'</p>

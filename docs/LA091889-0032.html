			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL FUNDS FOR SCHOOL PROGRAM  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council made a big mistake when it voted to give the Los  Angeles Unified School District $4.5 million for an after-school recreation  program for latch-key children.  </P> <P> Don't get me wrong; the program reportedly is a fine one. My concern is not  about the program itself, but how it is being financed.  </P> <P> The City Council took action despite the fact that it has little knowledge  about the school district's $3.8 billion budget. It's hard for me to believe  that the district itself could not have spared the money for the program, an  expense of less than one-tenth of 1% of its total budget. But, nobody took the  time to find out.  </P> <P> Equally disturbing is the fact that the City Council repeatedly cries poor when  it comes to funding the services for which it is responsible. We can't spare  the money to shorten the six-year backlog on tree trimming. We can't spare the  money to buy more no-parking signs so that street sweepers can do their job,  and as a consequence, we continue to waste tax dollars sweeping ineffectively.  Recently, the City Council decided it couldn't spare $3 million to fund a new  61-officer Police Department foot patrol in high-crime areas.  </P> <P> City residents and taxpayers are not well served when the mayor and the City  Council can't find the money for critically needed improvements in city  services, but blindly fund another jurisdiction's program with no questions  asked.  </P> <P> ERNANI BERNARDI  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilman  </P> <P> 7th District  </P></p>

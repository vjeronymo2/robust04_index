			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 12 Feb -- The telephone conversation between  the Russian and U.S. presidents over the Bosnian problem took  place on 11 February, rather than on 9 or 10 February as  expected earlier. This delay caused speculations in the media  over the state of repair of the Russian Federation  communications system.    On this matter, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told  ITAR-TASS today that "there are absolutely no technical  communications problems on our part, it would be better to ask  the other side about this." "All allegations that one cannot get  a line to Moscow are absolutely unfounded," he emphasized.    Andrey Kozyrev also said that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin  is in good shape and he has had a phone conversation with him.  "There are no problems at all in this respect either," the  minister remarked.</p>

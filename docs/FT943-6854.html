			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Disappointing order levels restrain growth at Weir Disappointing order levels in the second quarter held back Weir Group, the pumps and engineering products company which yesterday announced a Dollars 210.5m (Pounds 136m) US acquisition partly funded by a Pounds 96m rights issue at 252p and a 10.6 per cent increase in interim profits. Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 18.5m in the 26 weeks to July 1, against Pounds 16.8m, despite a Pounds 1.3m fall in interest income to Pounds 334,000. However, the company cautioned that the comparative figure was affected by a Pounds 2.43m exceptional charge for redundancy costs. Earnings per share increased to 8.3p (7.4p) and the interim dividend is raised 7 per cent from 1.925p to 2.06p. The shares closed 2p higher at 304p although analysts expressed disappointment about the company's flat order book. Lord Weir, chairman, said order intake for the first quarter was strong but fell in the second quarter. For the first half of the year he said the order intake closely matched turnover at Pounds 213m (Pounds 223.6m) and for 1994 as a whole he said turnover was likely to be similar to last year's Pounds 449m. Lord Weir said business conditions had shown little change. 'While there remain many opportunities in the market, particularly overseas, competition is still strong and we are not minded to take business at inadequate margins simply for the sake of volume. 'As has been the case now for some two years, demand for spares has still to recover to historic levels.' Although he acknowledged that the level of order intake in the second half was 'obviously not a helpful factor in the remainder of the year', he expressed confidence that the group would nevertheless produce satisfactory results and, 'a creditable performance in the circumstances'. COMMENT Weir had been looking for a suitable acquisition to boost its international sales. The US acquisition was welcomed yesterday as a sensible deal at a reasonable price. EnviroTech's products are seen as complementing Weir's specialist engineering products and will provide the group with much improved international sales and marketing coverage. Analysts, however, were disappointed by the news on the order book and the group's slow growth. Pre-tax profits should still top Pounds 39m this year, but the shares, which are trading on a forward multiple of about 17, look fully valued compared with others in the sector.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> INNER CITY CULTURAL CENTER HOSTS BARRO ROJO DANCERS  </P> <P> With its primal images of proletarian struggle, Barro Rojo works in a  modern-dance style that seems as classic as Isadora Duncan's "Marche Slave" and  as contemporary as the latest activist performance art.  </P> <P> In its Los Angeles debut Saturday at Inner City Cultural Center, this  eight-member company from Mexico City presented six short, intense pieces  expressing solidarity for the downtrodden. Hands desperately reaching out  dominated all of them, as did a sense of oppressive weight and fierce communal  pride. These artists know what modern dance was created to do -- and, for all  their beauty and technical skill, they wasted no time on personal display.  </P> <P> Fueled by the deepest anger, Laura Rocha's "Atadura" showed four women in  fringed shawls confronting the implications of this archetypal garment and then  furiously hurling it away. Mime-based, her "Crujia H" depicted two men so  trapped and brutalized that they could relate to one another only as deadly  enemies.  </P> <P> Arturo Garrido's three group vehicles each exploited the company's technical  expertise and might have looked slick except for the extra stretch and  muscularity of the execution. Whether in jeans (" . . . Y Amanacera!"),  overalls ("Aztra") or traditional loose white pants tied at the ankles ("El  Camino"), his men would fling back pinioned hands and brandish clenched fists.  No less committed, his women excelled at his signature stag-jump: arms flung  back as the contorted body heroically lunged into space.  </P> <P> Serafin Aponte's "Buscando Tierra" initially explored the range of movement  possible for someone badly injured, a concept Paul Taylor took much further in  "Dust." Nevertheless, this solo proved inventive in its contrasts between  large-scale choreographic motion and intimate pedestrian activity -- and for  such odd, compelling step sequences as the passage in which Francisco Illescas  kept swiveling in place, his weight repeatedly shifting from toes to heels and  back.  </P> <P> Barro Rojo takes nothing for granted -- not even this pitifully limited  physical freedom and mobility. Indeed, it celebrates endurance most of all and  embodies it in dancing of selfless stamina. This is an exciting, important  company that deserves to be much better known north of the border.

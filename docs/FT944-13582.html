			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Docklands line to be sold: Loss-making railway to be franchised for seven years before privatisation The London Docklands Light Railway, which links the City with east London, is to be franchised to a private-sector operator in 1996 before being sold off completely seven years later. Announcing plans for the privatisation of the 15-mile railway, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, yesterday said the government would also seek bids from private consortia to build an extension costing between Pounds 110m and Pounds 130m under the Thames to Greenwich and Lewisham. The decision to franchise the DLR before selling it completely reflects in part the railway's large losses. The DLR expects to earn revenues of only Pounds 7m this year against operating costs of Pounds 18m - but is expected to move into profit during the period of the franchise. A declining level of subsidy is likely to be provided until then. The DLR, which uses driverless trains, carried its first passengers in 1987 but its early years were dogged by technical problems and the need for an upgrade to cater for passenger numbers, which were larger than planned for. A new management team which joined in December 1991 has modernised the railway's signalling, improved reliability and built a new extension to the east. In the past 12 months the number of passengers has risen by 40 per cent to 45,000 a day. The DLR is expected to prove attractive to franchise bidders, including possibly its own management, because, unlike British Rail routes, it will be offered as a fully integrated railway, owning its own track and operating its trains. It is owned by the London Docklands Development Corporation. Bidders for the 2 1/2 -mile Lewisham extension will be invited to pre-qualify through the official journal of the European Union early next month and a shortlist will be announced in January. The winner, which will design and maintain the line but not operate train services, will be announced in about 12 months. The winner would be awarded a fixed-term concession for a period of up to 25 years and be paid on the basis of the availability and performance of the track as well as passenger numbers. This arrangement would allow the franchise operator and eventual buyer of the DLR to have full control of all DLR services while paying the construction consortium for the use of the Lewisham link. A decision on whether to build an underground station at the Cutty Sark in Greenwich, a popular tourist destination, will depend on the private sector agreeing by January 1995 to put up Pounds 14m to meet its costs. Otherwise the Lewisham line will go ahead with only four new stations. Expressions of interest have come from Italy, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong as well as the UK. Work is expected to take as long as 3 1/2 years.</p>

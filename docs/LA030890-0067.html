			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO : BARITONE SAX IS IN GOOD HANDS WITH  NICK BRIGNOLA  </P> <P> Though difficult to master, the baritone sax can produce amazing sounds in the  right hands. Unfortunately, few jazz players have chosen to make it their  instrument of choice.  </P> <P> Baritone sax player Nick Brignola's appearance this Saturday at 8 p.m. at the  San Diego Convention Center is a rare opportunity to hear what this horn can  do.  </P> <P> The concert is the second in the three-part "Salute to the Masters" series  being presented by the San Diego Jazz Society. Brignola's show will be a  tribute to jazz saxophonist Charlie "Bird" Parker, generally considered one of  the half a dozen most important jazz artists of the century.  </P> <P> Brignola began his musical education as a schoolboy clarinetist, and switched  to alto sax as he began to get serious about jazz.  </P> <P> "Then I found the baritone and that was it," Brignola said. "I was able to  express my personality more."  </P> <P> "Bird" was known for the lightning be-bop lines he invented on alto, and one  might expect that Brignola would have a tough time rekindling Parker's memory  on the larger, more air-consuming baritone.  </P> <P> "No matter what instrument I pick up, it translates the music inside me,"  Brignola said. "The instrument is just a vehicle. I feel I can play different  horns with equal facility, but I've worked hard at it. I may be one of few who  can do it. It's hard, rather like a trumpet player picking up a tuba."  </P> <P> Brignola, who names baritone sax predecessors Harry Carney and Pepper Adams as  influences, has long been a favorite of jazz purists. A New York Times writer  last year referred to his "full, hard-bottomed sound and . . . urgent,  swaggering attack." In various jazz polls, he's consistently named by critics,  fans and peers as the top baritone player.  </P> <P> During the '50s, Brignola leaned toward the West Coast cool-jazz sound being  pioneered by players such as Paul Desmond, Stan Getz and Bud Shank. "It was  easy to learn -- palatable music," he said. But when he sought something more  challenging, he became a be-bop convert, with Parker as his main guru. (Parker  died when Brignola was still a teen-ager, and the two never met.)  </P> <P> "On a Different Level," Brignola's new recording, should be in stores any day.  It pits Brignola with drummer Jack DeJohnette, pianist Kenny Barron and bassist  Dave Holland.  </P> <P> "The improvisations were going to be very esoteric, so we decided to use  standards so listeners could hang their hats on it," he said. "There's music by  Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington, Tadd Dameron. It  was designed to let me do my thing like I do on the job. Some cuts are a little  longer than normal air play time."  </P> <P> The lack of great commercial success doesn't bother Brignola, who said he is  lucky to sell 15,000 or 20,000 copies of his recordings. "Pure jazz was never  meant to appeal to the masses. Anybody selling over 40,000 records would be  suspect."  </P> <P> Saturday night, Brignola, who plans to bring both soprano and baritone saxes,  will be supported by pianist Frank Strazzeri -- whose meandering improvisations  sometimes call to mind Thelonious Monk -- plus trumpeter Jimmy Noone, drummer  Tootie Heath and bassist John Leitham. The material will lean heavily on  Parker's own compositions and his versions of popular jazz standards.  </P> <P> The new album by San Diego's own Checkfield, "A View from the Bridge," is the  strongest yet from the duo of Ron Satterfield and John Archer. The pair, both  experts with mixing boards, synthesizers, guitars, vocals and keyboards,  brought in top players, including San Diegans Peter Sprague, John Rekevics,  Mark Hunter, John Leftwich and Duncan Moore, plus out-of-towners such as  guitarist Pat Kelley, flutist Steve Kujala and violinist Darol Anger. Where  earlier albums from Checkfield were technically polished but lacking in punch,  the new project is more dynamic.  </P> <P> Out of 11 songs, all composed by Checkfield, "Conjuring" stands out, with its  African and tropical rhythms providing the backbeat for Kujala's soothing  flute. Anger's soaring violin lines are impressive on several cuts. The album  includes more singing than past Checkfield efforts. Archer and Satterfield have  serviceable voices, but their lyrics sometimes get too singsong and cute. The  album is due to be in stores next week.  </P> <P> San Diego flutist Lori Bell and her musical soul mate, L.A. pianist Dave  Mackay, play Words &amp; Music Bookstore in Hillcrest Friday and Saturday  nights, and the Salmon House restaurant on Mission Bay on Sunday night. They'll  work as a duo Friday and Saturday and be joined by drummer Barry Farrar and  bassist Bill Andrews on Sunday. Bell and Mackay are shopping around a demo tape  that includes five new songs in the more commercial, light-jazz direction they  began with the song "The Goose Is Loose" from their last album, "Take Me to  Brazil." At Words &amp; Music, their repertoire will include several originals,  plus music by George Gershwin, Michel Legrand and Charlie Parker. Bell's song  "Waltz for Joe," written for San Diego pianist Joe Azarello, is included on a  new Japanese release from local pianist Mike Wofford titled "All Alone."  </P> <P> RIFFS: Open Channel, the new electric-jazz band fronted by San Diego guitarist  Jim Storey and including top local saxophonist Steve Feierabend, plays the Del  Mar Hilton this Friday and Saturday nights and again next weekend. Vocalist  Cath Eckert will perform with the band and may join it permanently if the  chemistry is right. . . . Sunday night from 7 to 8, the Claude Bolling Big Band  is featured on "Le Jazz Club," the French program imported to KSDS-FM (88.3). .  . . Jazz artists such as local pianist Glenn Horiuchi have incorporated  authentic Oriental influences into their music. Friday night at 8, the real  thing can be heard at UC San Diego's Price Center Theatre, as Silk and Lace,  the orchestra of the Chinese Music Society of North America, performs several  classical and modern Chinese works.  </P></p>

The  beginning of the nuclear age was announced by an act of war in  the war that the United States neither began nor provoked. It  took place at the time when the consequences were not known.  The Chernobyl accident took place at the time when the  consequences were known. Nevertheless, our subservient state  leadership did practically nothing to protect the society  against the aftermath of this accident. The crime of public  endangerment, which then took place, has not been punished.    A journalist must not swallow any bait, nor can he miss any  alarming news. The rumors about SS-20 missiles "forgotten" by  the occupational power [on Czech territory] are among the things  that simply cannot be missed. That is true despite the fact  that one must know how to use a flare, or a warhead, and an  explosion accidentally triggered by a layman is less likely than  by an incompetent manipulation with a hand grenade.    The situation was worse when unverifiable rumors referred to  a warhead with a chemical warfare agent. It was just the more  "poignant" as both the Soviets and Czechoslovakia once promised  that they would not keep such warfare agents.    Moreover, the treaties in which the USSR and former  Czechoslovakia vouch that they will not use bacteriological or  virological weapons would make a respectable library. It is not  only that they promised not to use the weapons -- they actually  promised not to have them.    Of course, some disease cultures, bacteria, and viruses are  stored and cultivated for scientific reasons, even in the  civilian sector. There are, however, long series of treaties  and agreements that specify where and how. Under no  circumstances, however, at a single location or even a single  country. If they have, for instance, smallpox in Stockholm,  then they do not have typhoid, which in turn is, let us say, in  Milan. These treaties and agreements are also binding for the  Czech Republic.    Nevertheless, the cultures, and in a form ready for combat  use, have been and are here. In our army, completing its  transformation and under the leadership of a Christian minister,  who should know something about it? Our top brass, as is well  known, are founding businesses, consortia, etc. You will find a  small civilian business under the name of Klinlab also in the  Central Military Hospital building. Similar cultures were  brought there from Techonin in eastern Bohemia, where they were  cultivated for the Warsaw Pact. They are stored in the Central  Military Hospital contrary to all the aforementioned  documentation. It is simply a commonplace company, equipped,  however, at the expense of the Army, i.e. at the expense of the  ordinary taxpayer. All this with the knowledge of the reformed  General Nekvasil. Even his economic deputy, Kalousek, knew  about it, for he approved the purchase of the equipment for the  Klinlab company, which was certainly not cheap.    As we have managed to ascertain, the serum banks stored in  the Military Hospital building contain gel ready for immediate  use. Hence, a catastrophe can be set off by trickling out small  pox, bubonic plague, or psitacosis etc., in the subway for  instance.    An unintentional release could threaten Prague with, at  least, the fate of Sverdlovsk (it is now called Ekaterinburg  again), where a bacteriological warfare agent was released into  the ventilation system of the local "pharmaceuticals factory"  and, subsequently, mysterious epidemics broke out in the city.  An unknown epidemic pneumonia was the most common cause of  death.    In the Czech Army, the bacteriological and virological death  received the mark PTZD [prisne tajne, zvlastni dulezitost] --  top secret, privileged information. The Central Military  Hospital in Prague, in the building of which the Klinlab is  located, is a military zone, where the police has no business.  At the same time, it is also accessible to hospital visitors on  the weekends, and, of course, to outpatients. This means that  it is generally accessible. The building itself can even be  accessed underground.    The building has been visited occasionally by a certain  Colonel Zaykov and Mr. Frolov. Colonel Zaykov used to be a KGB  attache, while Mr. Frolov was an adviser at the Foreign Trade  Ministry. Currently, they both hold valid cards for foreigners  with permanent residence here, and engage in business. How  about selling these cultures to, let us say, Libya. Let us hope  that the appropriate authorities will deal with this case in all  seriousness.</p>

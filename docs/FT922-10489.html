			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: GM tunes up its recovery plans - Some urgency at the slow-moving car maker SUDDENLY, a large foot appears to have hit the accelerator marked 'reform' at General Motors, the troubled but slow-moving US vehicle manufacturer. In quick succession over the past week the world's largest vehicle company has announced plans for a Dollars 2.3bn international share offering; a reorganisation of the management structure in its loss-making North American car operations; and the group's first quarterly profit after 18 months of red ink. At first glance all this might seem a rapid and dramatic response to the extraordinary boardroom coup which shook GM at the start of this month. That was when the company's non-executive directors, frustrated by management's slow pace of reform, clipped the wings of Mr Robert Stempel, the GM chairman, by removing him from the leadership of an important board committee. They also demoted two of his lieutenants, including Mr Lloyd Reuss, the group's president and head of North American operations, who was replaced by Mr Jack Smith, head of GM's highly profitable international operations. Certainly, since the coup, GM has been setting about restructuring itself with a much greater sense of urgency. Yet the road it is following is basically the same as that outlined by the 'old' management team between December and February, when Mr Stempel announced plans to close 21 plants by the middle of the decade, cut 70,000 jobs and radically overhaul the North American management structure. That said, Mr Smith has added some significant new twists to the strategy. GM's basic problem in North America is its bureaucratic, slow-moving, nature. This means it has failed to react - until now - with sufficient vigour to its loss of market share to Japanese rivals, and has tended to avoid labour confrontations by buying off the powerful United Auto Workers union. It produces a bewildering range of cars, serving overlapping markets, which bear seven different brand names and have a decidedly mixed design reputation. To sustain its 35 per cent car market share, it relies heavily on discounted sales to fleet operators. Its past failure to close excess capacity means many of its plants are running way below break-even, while its contract with the UAW means it pays members irrespective of whether they are actually working. All this could be glossed over during the industry's up-cycle in the late 1980s, but the recession of the past year has exposed the company's fundamental weaknesses. Its losses of Dollars 4.5bn in 1991, the highest ever reported by an American company, eroded its balance sheet and liquidity, and created a very negative climate on Wall Street. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, lowered its rating on GM's senior debt in mid-March, on the grounds that the group's North American reforms looked inadequate to bolster liquidity. Even more seriously, S&amp;P threatened to do the same for GM's commercial paper, which provides cheap funding for its important financing arm. The share issue which GM announced last Friday, but which appears to have been approved by the board many weeks ago, forms a major plank in the company's efforts to convince Wall Street that it has sufficient liquidity. The company will also issue Dollars 500m of shares to its underfunded pension scheme. All this, together with several recent tranches of preference stock, will bring to more than Dollars 6bn the amount of equity capital GM will have raised since last summer. The success of the issue will depend on Mr Stempel and his colleagues convincing investors during an international road show that the company really is getting to grips with its operating problems. They will get a little help from this week's first-quarter figures, which were modestly better than analysts had been expecting. The group made Dollars 179m, compared with a loss of Dollars 1.1bn before special items a year ago. North America was still heavily in the red - to the tune of Dollars 1bn, according to analysts' estimates - but the losses were much reduced. Detroit rival Ford also reported a return to profit yesterday, and recovery from recession over the next year should float the industry as a whole away from the financial rocks. Yet GM's profit levels are derisory for a business with quarterly turnover of Dollars 32bn, and investors will need convincing its recovery plans can not only produce a sustained improvement, but do it mighty quickly too. Mr Stempel hinted in a speech this week that he did indeed plan to speed up his leisurely schedule of 21 factory closures. So far only 14 of those to be shut have been identified. And his plans to reorganise North America's management structure have also been accelerated since the coup. The idea, first outlined by Mr Stempel in February, is to cut out bureaucracy and speed decision-making by scrapping the framework established in 1984 by Mr Roger Smith, GM's previous chairman. Roger Smith set up three cumbersome divisions. Two of them made and sold cars - Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM of Canada and Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac - and one did the same for trucks and buses. All this has been ditched in favour of a single umbrella organisation, headed by Jack Smith. There is a single team in charge of passenger car engineering and manufacturing, a similar one for trucks, and a single group to oversee all US vehicles sales and marketing. The result should be a more coherent, co-ordinated approach to the business, and could eventually mean rationalisation of the model range, or even total elimination of one of the brand names. The top managers for the new structure were appointed last week and the biggest gainer is Mr Michael Losh, 45, who has been put in charge of all sales and marketing. For running the struggling Oldsmobile division, where he was credited with considerable marketing flair. However, the structure announced last week contains one large change from the pre-coup, pre-Smith scheme. A new post, head of worldwide purchasing, has been created, and it is to be filled by Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a 50-year-old Spaniard, who is head of GM purchasing in Europe. When Mr Smith was turning round GM Europe in the mid-1980s, Mr Lopez played a key part in the strategy of cutting components costs by buying cheaper ones from non-traditional suppliers around the continent and beyond. Mr Lopez's new role suggests Mr Smith will try the same tactic in North America, which could spell trouble for GM's in-house parts operations, which have been shielded from competition. It could also spell confrontation with the UAW, which is opposed to further out-sourcing of parts. Another important ingredient in the GM's successful European operations has been the introduction of three-shift, round-the-clock working at its factories. Mr Smith may try to replicate this in the US, again risking difficulties with the UAW, which is smarting from the 21 closures. The union does not appear in a particularly strong position. It suffered a serious defeat earlier this month at Caterpillar, the heavy equipment group, where a management threat to replace strikers led to a return to work. But even if GM's management changes proceed smoothly - a big if, given the turmoil that followed the 1984 plan - Mr Smith will need to tread softly and carry a very big stick if he is to bring the UAW along with the revolution.  ---------------------------- General Motors Quarterly        Net Income  ----------------------------               DollarsM (loss)  ---------------------------- Q1 1992         179.0 Q4 1991      (2,467.8) Q3 1991      (1,056.7) Q2 1991        (784.5) Q1 1991      (1,100.0)* Q4 1990      (1,617.0) Q3 1990      (1,978.8) Q2 1990         900.1 Q1 1990         710.0 Q4 1989         700.2 Q3 1989         516.9 Q2 1989       1,454.2 Q1 1989       1,553.0 Q4 1988       1,398.3 Q3 1988         859.2 Q2 1988       1,506.7 Q1 1988       1,092.1  ---------------------------- * before special items Source: company reports  ----------------------------</p>

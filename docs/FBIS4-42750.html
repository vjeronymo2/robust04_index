Beginning on 1 July, the three countries will each  have the presidency of the council for six months in succession.  Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish Prime Minister  Felipe Gonzalez said at the end of the German-Spanish talks in  Schwerin on 7 June that in view of the "specially friendly  relations between the three countries," there was a "great  chance for the three to start work jointly." Kohl briefed the  Spanish prime minister on the talks he held with French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand last  week. The chancellor said he had "personally the impression"  that he had also reached a "very high degree" of agreement with  Felipe Gonzalez on problems related to the "building of Europe."    Kohl said that prior to the meeting of EU chiefs of  government on the Greek island of Korfu on 24 June, there would  be "intensive" talks with the governments of the partner states  in the European Union [EU], not least to achieve agreement on  the succession of outgoing EU Commission President Jacques  Delors. Kohl said he had also discussed this topic with  Gonzalez. He added that bringing about such a coordinated  approach prior to the Korfu meeting also referred to the white  paper submitted by Jacques Delors, which contains, among other  things, proposals on employment, economic recovery, and the  improvement of the infrastructure within the EU.    At the Schwerin meeting, differences of opinion between  Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt and the Spanish economics  minister came to light on whether the EU Commission should in  the future have the right to raise loans on the capital market.  Reportedly, the option sought by both sides was not to give the  relevant permission generally, but at best only on a  case-by-case basis.    Kohl said he agreed with Gonzalez that a "consistent  continuation of the policy of European integration" was "of  importance for the whole continent." He had discussed with  Gonzalez the problem of bringing the Central and East European  states closer to the EU. It was "an essential goal" of both  politicians to further deepen relations with the EU neighbors;  this held also true for the Mediterranean countries, which are  of particular interest to Spain.    Germany, France, and Spain also intended to cooperate in  preparing the EU conference in 1996, which would examine the  question of whether the conditions for further steps on the road  to monetary and economic union were met. Kohl said it was a  "good coincidence" for the three countries to hold the EU  presidency in succession; this should, however, not be  misunderstood as "hegemony of the three."    The chancellor stressed that monetary union, which is  envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty, is linked to stability  criteria. He said these criteria were more important for the  implementation of monetary union than the "time schedule." Kohl  said he was "absolutely satisfied for people to say that we are  working for it as fast as possible." Gonzalez added that for  the Spanish Government, too, stability was the most important  thing. He said there was "a certain strictness" regarding the  convergency criteria, and "a certain flexibility" regarding the  timeframe agreed upon.    Kohl also said that the Federal Republic had reached the  limits of its possibilities regarding financial aid for the  Central and East European states. The Federal Government  believed that new funds for EU programs or projects should be  paid by member states on a new basis of assessment. He said in  this context that it was advisable to make the per capita income  in member states the basis of assessment. Commenting on  economic difficulties of the Spanish Volkswagen subsidiary,  Seat, Gonzalez said the Spanish Government would hold talks with  the Volkswagen management. The Spanish Government was willing  "to a certain extent" to do something to preserve the jobs;  however, only such aid could be granted as was in line with EU  directives.</p>

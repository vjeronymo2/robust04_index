			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> SCHRODER SHAKES YOU UP IN 'THE STRANGER WITHIN'  </P> <P> "The Stranger Within" is that rare TV commodity: an artfully made, crackling  good thriller that scares you to your toes.  </P> <P> The CBS drama airs at 9 tonight on Channels 2 and 8, its constant, ominous  undertone gradually building toward an explosion of violence.  </P> <P> This is slow-evolving terror without gimmicks or cheap manipulation. Credit  John Pielmeier's sound script, some very good direction by frightmaster Tom  Holland and first-rate performances by Kate Jackson and Rick Schroder in a  story about the reunion of a mother and son 16 years after his abduction as a  3-year-old.  </P> <P> Or is Mark (Schroder) really whom he says he is? When he shows up at the rural  Minnesota home of Mare Blackburn (Jackson) without warning and tells an  initially persuasive tale about his origins, his sensitivity, earnestness and  craving for affection all ring true. Yet there is something sinister about Mark  and his ability to exploit Mare's vulnerability and guilt feelings about not  being a "good mom." Moreover, Mare's skeptical boyfriend (Chris Sarandon)  begins to find holes in Mark's story.  </P> <P> The plot is eked out neatly and tautly in a rugged winter setting that  emphasizes the protagonists' isolation, with that former cherub Schroder  chillingly credible as a volatile character whose sweetness appears to conceal  a possibly dangerous, seething anger, and Jackson on the mark as the mommy  whose maternal instincts may override her judgment.  </P> <P> There are only a few tip-offs here. Mostly, "The Stranger Within" delivers some  good old-fashioned jolts. If you like a good scare, this one's for you. HOWARD  ROSENBERG  </P></p>

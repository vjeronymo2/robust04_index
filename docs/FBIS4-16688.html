			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Peresada report under the rubric "The New World </F> Order in Action": "The Bosnian `Flop'"]    [Text] Brussels, 15 Apr -- Is the North Atlantic alliance  headquarters here in Brussels taking into account the position  of Russia, which reacted highly negatively to the NATO air  strikes against "Serb targets" in the Gorazde region? It goes  without saying that it is. The only question is -- how.    These days I am in constant telephone contact with the  alliance's press service, which, in its turn, sends out daily  reports on Bosnia by fax or by express mail. Here, for example,  is one of the latest reports containing information on  Wednesday's North Atlantic Council session on this subject. It  took place after several demarches by Moscow and the statement  by President Yeltsin, who was unhappy that the West had made the  decision to bomb the Serb positions without consulting with  Russia. There was also a statement from the Russian Foreign  Ministry, which warned against any new NATO ultimatum to the  Bosnian Serbs, and the session of the State Duma which condemned  NATO's raids. What decisions were reached in Brussels against  that backdrop?    As for new ultimatums -- nothing was decided. None of the 16  member countries even raised that question either with regard to  Gorazde or to other regions declared "safe areas" by the United  Nations. Obviously there is no need for that because, unlike  the situation around Sarajevo, the mechanism for the use of  force in the Gorazde region could be worked out without prior  threats.    Now about the raids themselves. On the eve of Wednesday's  North Atlantic Council session I talked about this with several  NATO diplomats. Some shrug their shoulders in incomprehension,  others spread their hands in equal bewilderment, while others  answer the question with a question: "What do you want? After  all, the legal basis for this exists and Moscow itself took part  in its creation."    In view of Russia's interests in the Balkans one can and  undoubtedly should be incensed at NATO's bombing raids and  condemn them, but that should be done now, before it is too  late. In the recent past those who are responsible for Russian  foreign policy had somewhat different priorities in the Bosnian  crisis and in relations with the West in general than they do  now. Is it not clear that it is largely due to those priorities  that NATO, without abandoning strong-arm decisions in principle,  has managed not only to create for itself the image of a "Balkan  peacemaker" but also to ensure for itself an international legal  basis for practical "assistance in establishing peace" in the  former Yugoslavia?    That is how NATO regards UN Security Council Resolution 836  adopted on 4 June 1993 in connection with the raids in the  Gorazde region. Russia voted for it. A mistake? Moscow  prefers not to talk openly about that right now, but you can  judge for yourselves. The NATO people, however, with such a  "legal backing" behind them, are saying clearly: "We are acting  on the basis of the Security Council decision in giving `close  air support' to the UN forces in Bosnia when danger threatens  them. These actions are being carried out with the sanction of  the UN Secretary General's representative and the UN command in  Bosnia. We are merely carrying out orders."    In such a situation what need is there for consultations  with  Russia?</p>

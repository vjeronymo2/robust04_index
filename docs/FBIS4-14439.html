			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Metchikov: "It Is Not a Duma That Has </F> Been Elected, But a Council of Administration Heads"]    [Text] Kursk -- Last Sunday, 36 deputies were elected to  45 seats in the Kursk Oblast Duma. The citizens' level of  participation was as a whole fairly high at 47 percent.    In short, the elections took place, but now with hindsight  you think: What was the point of holding them at all? No  representative power as such has come into being in the oblast.  Twenty-one of the 36 new deputies are rayon administration  heads. Meaning that they themselves will write the local laws as  well as executing and monitoring them....    This situation is not new, but in our parts, where it is  "getting worse" with every successive election, it is  interesting that the townspeople long ago surrendered their  voting rights to the rural areas. It was actually there that  voting went amazingly smoothly, But the elections could be said  to have been boycotted in eight out of 12 districts in Kursk.  In four of the oblast center's districts the turnout proved to  be the minimum allowed, and, as it is not hard to divine, it was  on the whole elderly people who voted here. They accordingly  entrusted deputies' powers to a former oblast military commissar  and pensioner for some years now, M. Ovsyannikov, and one of the  leaders of the oblast Communist Party organization, N. Ivanov....    V. Aseyev, first secretary of the Russian Communist Workers  Party Oblast Committee, and another communist, successfully got  into the Oblast Duma from the mining district of Zheleznogorsk,  and the nuclear power workers' city of Kurchatov, as promised,  made a show of not turning up at the polling places -- the  turnout was only about 12 percent here -- because their wages  have not been paid for a long time. It is a paradox of the  times when, it would seem, the need to qualitatively change the  authorities is greater and more acute in those places where the  people do not wish to participate in voting for them.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Nigeria currency allocation cut Nigeria's acute foreign exchange shortage forced the country's central bank yesterday to cut its weekly allocation of hard currency, prompting fears that the government's foreign exchange policy will lead to declining production, profitability and investment. The Central Bank of Nigeria's second allocation this year of foreign exchange to industry fell from Dollars 200m (Pounds 111m) a fortnight ago to Dollars 100m. Foreign exchange has been in short supply since December 1992; some manufacturers say stocks of raw materials and spare parts have been declining and replacement or new plant is overdue. The 10-week gap between the last allocation in 1993 and the first in 1994 worsened the problem. Bankers say the expected average of Dollars 50m a week will remain well below demand. Bulk orders of spare parts or raw materials can be scaled down in proportion, but this is little use when importing costly capital goods. Importers can no longer make up the difference with export proceeds sold at market rates. Prospective foreign investors have been deterred by the new policy, which has ruled out agreement with official external creditors. 'This is a very serious situation,' a leading manufacturer warned yesterday. 'We have had a disruption of almost three months, then a new system which is not working well enough. No reasonable stock cover can cope with continuing under-supply of foreign exchange. Businesses are already thinking of scaling down production by April.' In the first budget presented by Gen Sani Abacha, Nigeria's military leader, the government in January set out to ensure an adequate supply of currency to industry and control inflation. Like last year's currency auctions, the allocation is pro rata according to demand, which encourages inflated applications. The 1994 budget pegged the exchange rate at N22 to the dollar, more than double the value of the black market naira, banned the open foreign exchange market and cut interest rates to 21 per cent, less than a quarter of the estimated inflation rate. Some manufacturers say the CBN is making the best of a difficult situation. It has fought off pressure for ministers or civil servants allocating all forex direct to each end-user. This would have taken Nigeria back to the days of export licensing in the 1980s.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Excerpt] The Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] met  in Maputo yesterday. It expressed its understanding for the  government's request to complete the confinement of its troops  into assembly areas by 1 July and their demobilization on 15  August. This increases by one month the schedule set by the UN  Security Council. The CSC expressed its appreciation for  Renamo's [Mozambique National Resistance] decision to comply  with the schedule set by the Security Council.    UN representative Aldo Ajello said the dates can only be  meaningful if the problem of the formation of the new army is  resolved. [passage omitted]    [Ajello] "What I said was that all those dates will be  meaningful if the problem of the formation of the new army has  been resolved. We can only deal with that problem once all  soldiers have been demobilized. There will be soldiers selected  for the new army who would be (?waiting) at assembly areas. The  assembly areas would have to be closed on those dates -- namely,  on 1 June and 15 July for Renamo, and on 1 July and 15 August  for the government. The manner in which we will organize the  formation of the new army is a vital question that ought to be  addressed in tandem with the confinement and demobilization of  troops. This aspect was pointed out to the (?government). We  all agree on how to go about it, though what we need to consider  is the solution to that problem.    [Unidentified correspondent] "Do you not think the new dates  will complicate matters for the National Elections Commission  [CNE] since it wants to start registering voters?    [Ajello] "It could complicate [words indistinct] the next  CSC  meeting will discuss this issue with the CNE chairman. That is  an important issue. I am aware that the CNE chairman expected  the whole process to be completed by June when registration of  voters is due to start. I will meet with him to see what  implications the government's position will have on the CNE. I  will ask him to brief the CSC on that issue.    [Correspondent] "The registration of voters is scheduled to  start within about two weeks, but the whole country is still far  from being free to everybody. Do you think [words indistinct]?    [Ajello] "That issue was discussed at length today and two  important decisions were made. First, the accord signed by the  presidents of the Republic and of Renamo at the August and  September 1993 summits should be implemented as soon as  possible. Specifically, Renamo advisers should be integrated  into provincial administrations and [words indistinct] people to  carry out such duties.    "We will give the green light to all political parties and  individuals to move freely throughout the country. Whenever  there is a problem, the CSC should be informed at once. The CSC  will then contact Renamo with a view to resolving disputes at  once. What we have now is Renamo's firm commitment that the  whole territory is open.    "Another important aspect is that Renamo has accepted that  members of the Mozambican and UN police forces will be deployed  in its former areas to monitor the situation. This will speed  up the integration of Renamo areas into state administration.  That is an important issue which we have discussed for a long  time now. Today we formally agreed that [words indistinct] I  personally discussed this issue with the Renamo president  yesterday. I am waiting for Interior Minister Manuel Antonio to  return from his trip to discuss with him ways of deploying  Mozambican policemen and UN police personnel in former Renamo  areas."    The government delegation to the CSC was headed by Minister  John Kachamila. Ministers Guebuza and Hunguana have gone to  Rome. Kachamila said the government had proposed the new dates  at informal meetings for further action. He noted that before  consensus was reached by all sides, the UN Operations in  Mozambique proposed those dates to the Security Council,  unilaterally. [passage omitted]    [Unidentified correspondent] "Since it is impossible to form  a new army before elections are held, what is the government's  view about the suggestion that the 15,000 men who have not been  trained should be sent home on leave and be called up after  elections are held?    [Kachamila] "The government does not agree with that because  there is no reason for not creating the armed forces provided  for in the General Peace Accord. It is a force of 30,000 men  and manpower is available. There are financial problems, but  what we need to do is resolve them. So, we do not think the  solution is to send those men on leave [words indistinct] our  position is to complete the formation of the new armed forces."    Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation, asked the  government to reconsider its position. Domingos reiterated his  party's position to comply with the Security Council dates.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] "Do you think you can meet the deadline set  by the Security Council?    [Domingos] "Yes, we think we can. We are able to do it with  all the assistance that the UN technical unit can give us. It  is not only a question of Renamo demobilizing its forces. There  are technical mechanisms to be complied with so that  demobilization may take place with all the required guarantees.    [Correspondent] "Certain quarters say Renamo is calling for  an army of 15,000 men because you do not have enough manpower?    [Domingos] "That is not a position defended by Renamo. It is  a proposal that Renamo has accepted. Renamo is open to other  positive proposals that could be taken into account for the  effective implementation of the peace accord."    A spokesman for the international observers at the CSC  stated  their firm support for the UN Security Council decisions on the  Mozambican peace process. [passage omitted]</p>

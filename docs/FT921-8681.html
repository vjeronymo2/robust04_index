			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Sunderland's civic boat comes in PERHAPS it did stop raining, just for a minute, as the mayor raised the flags and released 7,000 red and white balloons, marking Sunderland's ascent to city status yesterday. Outside the civic centre the balloons drifted through the grey February sky, pursued by energetic small citizens of Britain's newest city. Inside, beside a table laden with civic teacups, Mr David Thompson, the mayor, spoke of his delight that, 60 years after its first attempt, Sunderland had at last won such status. 'Our fortunes began to change when Nissan came in,' said Mr Thomson. 'We were quite intent when we lost our shipyards that we wouldn't go down.' A total of 23 towns, from Armagh to Wolverhampton, competed to be named a city by the Queen to celebrate the 40th anniversary of her accession. Sunderland, the 51st city in England and Wales, is one of 11 declared since 1900. The most recent was Derby in 1977 to mark the Queen's silver jubilee. It was also announced yesterday that the mayor of the city of Chester, and his successors, are to be lord mayors. Sunderland, said Mr Thompson, had been 'quietly confident' of winning the honour. That may surprise the council officials who, barely a fortnight ago, were privately doubting its chances. Perhaps they had been studying the form. William Hill, the bookmaker, had quoted Sunderland as ninth favourite at 14-1. Chelmsford had been favourite at 4-1, Brighton next at 7-1. The Wearside town's keenness to win the title, which confers no money or additional powers, reflected its determination to enhance its image in the fight for new investment and employment. Sunderland, which dates back to the seventh century, suffered a big blow to morale when its last shipyards closed three years ago, ending a 600-year-old industry. Now promoted as 'the advanced manufacturing centre' of the north, it has attracted Pounds 1bn of investment in a decade - notably the Nissan car plant - but still has high unemployment. 'Maybe being a city will bring more work,' said Mr Stephen Martin, aged 19 and jobless, out shopping with his wife and baby daughter. A few citizens - obviously reading the wrong script - complained that the litter and graffiti had lowered the civic tone. Others seemed split between delight at getting almost equal with Newcastle upon Tyne - which has city status and a lord mayor - and confusion that a place with no cathedral could be a city at all. But Nina McDougall, aged 11, running after balloons, had no doubts. 'It'll mean more playgrounds. Sunderland's even better now it's a city.'</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSHI STAND AT THE BIG A SEEN AS A LITTLE FISHY  </P> <P> Famished fans stood in line six-deep Friday night in their quest for hot dogs  and beer on the opening night of Angels baseball at Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> But next door at the sushi stand, it was strictly no waiting. The employees  stood uncomfortably in their pressed white uniforms as passers-by pondered the  latest Far East offering on the stadium's already multicultural menu.  </P> <P> Some said they loved the idea of having the Japanese delicacy at the Big A.  Others acted as if someone had parked a Nissan on the White House lawn.  </P> <P> In either case, sushi seemed to be on everyone's tongue, if not in everyone's  mouth.  </P> <P> Even television announcer Joe Torre noted the presence of the seaweed-wrapped  lumps of sticky rice and raw fish. "That's class," he said. "That's class."  </P> <P> Most said the sight of "Sushi, Sushi" on the Field Level near first base came  as a surprise.  </P> <P> "I love sushi. We eat sushi twice a week. But in a ballpark? I don't know,"  sniffed Walter Mitchell of Newport Beach as he prepared to bite into chicken  yakatori, a chicken-on-a-stick offering. "You don't come to the ballpark to eat  sushi."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Ernie Estrada and Nancy Briggs of El Toro were not simply pleased  that the Big A has started offering sushi; they were ecstatic.  </P> <P> "We can't believe it. Do you know how many times I wrote in saying 'You ought  to have sushi'?" Estrada said.  </P> <P> Well, actually he only wrote once, but, as Estrada pointed out, at least he was  worked up enough about the subject to write, which is more than most people  would do.  </P> <P> Estrada said that baseball sushi solves a dilemma for him and Briggs. He would  always go for a sausage, and Briggs would always get the roast beef sandwich.  Now, at last, they are in culinary agreement.  </P> <P> Angel fans already can munch on a range of fare, from cinnamon rolls to nachos,  popcorn to ice cream. So why not sushi? reasoned the stadium's food staff.  </P> <P> Sushi has already become a mainstay at Padres games in San Diego, and samples  were received last year in Anaheim for test marketing, said officials of ARA,  which handles the stadium's concession stands.  </P> <P> "It packages well. It looks good. The raw materials in sushi . . . are so  healthy. You're not serving up cholesterol and a lot of fat," said concessions  manager John Trosper.  </P> <P> At $4.25 to $5.25 for the California rolls -- the only type of sushi served --  it is certainly pricier than the hot dogs ($1.75). But "Sushi, Sushi" manager  Hiro Watanabe said he thinks it will be a hit.  </P> <P> "Everything is going well," he said reassuringly while gauging public opinion.  </P> <P> The reaction that stood out most prominently in his mind, however, was that  "some lady cried, 'Oh, come on!' " as she passed by the stand.  </P> <P> Sushi saleswoman Lea Sawyer, though, quickly recalled that another fan  exclaimed, "Oh, what a nice idea!"  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MCENROE MAY BE BARRED FROM WARMUP TOURNEY  </P> <P> John McEnroe could be ruled out of a Wimbledon warm-up event for sidestepping  the rules of the Men's Tennis Council, according to the head of the sport's  governing body.  </P> <P> McEnroe was hoping for three full weeks of grass-court play before going into  Wimbledon June 26. But the American, who cited a back ailment for withdrawing  from the French Open, may not be allowed to start his Wimbledon preparation at  next week's Beckenham, England, tournament.  </P> <P> Beckenham clashes with the second week of the French Open and the head of the  Men's Tennis Council said McEnroe would be breaking the rules if he competed.  </P> <P> "There is a rule preventing players competing in another tournament which is  being played at the same time as the one they have already pulled out of," said  Council Administrator Marshall Happer in New York.  </P> <P> McEnroe has asked for permission for the rule to be waived.  </P></p>

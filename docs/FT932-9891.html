			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Trade News: US farmers in warning over Gatt THE American Farm Bureau, the most consistent advocate of farm trade reform within the Uruguay Round, is warning that the US agriculture lobby may withdraw its support if US negotiators accept EC offers on market access for commodities, Nancy Dunne reports. US and EC agriculture negotiators in Washington are scheduled to start today the final push to get agreement before G7 leaders meet in July in Tokyo. Mr Dean Kleckner, president of the Farm Bureau, has travelled thousands of miles during the seven years of the Round negotiations, accepting what he says is increasingly less for the US farm sector as the EC has proved intractable on concessions. However, the final straw could be what Mr Kleckner calls 'padding of the EC's tariff equivalents' under the tariffication process, which converts quotas into tariffs. The Dunkel draft for a final act to the Uruguay Round proposes that Gatt countries grant increased market access of 3-5 per cent. According to Mr Kleckner and Mr Paul Drazak, also of the Farm Bureau, the French are pushing for a settlement which could actually reduce market access in products which already have more than 3-5 per cent.</p>

Sales rose 12 per cent to CDollars 565m and pre-tax profit was CDollars 57.2m (USDollars 42.5m), against CDollars 29.5m. But after special tax factors, final net profit was CDollars 53.8m or 56 cents against Dollars 62m or 70 cents a share a year earlier. At the nine-month stage, net profits rose to CDollars 157.5m or CDollars 1.66, up from 56 per cent or 46 cents a share on sales of CDollars 1.65bn, against CDollars 1.57bn.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Guardian faces probe by MPs over fake fax: No early move on Benn's breach of rules The Guardian's use of a fake fax to investigate Mr Jonathan Aitken's stay at the Paris Ritz was yesterday referred to both the police and the powerful Commons privileges committee. Amid fresh allegations about the business activities of Mr Aitken, Treasury chief secretary, Downing Street confirmed that Mr John Major, the prime minister, knew about the fake fax nearly six months ago, but took no action. It also emerged that no immediate action will be taken against Mr Tony Benn, the former Labour cabinet minister, who broke Commons rules on Tuesday by releasing confidential details of a privileges committee meeting. The committee was investigating allegations that two Conservative MPs were prepared to take cash for tabling parliamentary questions. After a rancorous debate marked by Conservative allegations of theft and fraud against Mr Peter Preston, The Guardian's editor, MPs voted for a privileges committee inquiry by 313 to 38, a majority of 275. Mr Preston, who has admitted using the Commons logo on a letter to the Ritz seeking details of Mr Aitken's bill, will be called before the committee in the next parliamentary session. He said that The Guardian had sent the fake fax to acquire a documentary basis for questions about Mr Aitken's behaviour. 'We could not sit on it because something unpleasant might be done to us,' he said on Channel Four news. Mr David Wilshire, the Conservative MP whose complaint prompted the debate, said he had also asked the police to investigate Mr Preston's 'criminal' use of the logo. MPs on both sides also made repeated allegations against Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of the Ritz, who was The Guardian's chief source for allegations of impropriety against Mr Aitken. Mr Wilshire accused Mr Preston and Mr Fayed of involvement in 'a criminal conspiracy'. Mr Brian Sedgemore, a Labour backbencher, described Mr Fayed as 'pathologically corrupt'. Downing Street confirmed claims by Mr Fayed that Mr Major and Sir Robin Butler, cabinet secretary, were aware of the faked fax in May, but took no action. Officials said Mr Major viewed The Guardian's action as 'reprehensible', but told Mr Aitken that it was up to him to take action against Mr Preston. if he wished. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, ruled that calls for Mr Benn's expulsion from the committee could not be debated until after its next meeting on November 21. Mr Aitken denied allegations in the Daily Mirror that he was involved in undeclared deals that gave control of the TV-am television station to Saudi investors.

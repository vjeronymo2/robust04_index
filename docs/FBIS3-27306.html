Mr Xie underscored the close ties between the two neighbours  after meeting a group of Hong Kong delegates to the Guangdong  People's Congress.    But he stopped short of suggesting any high-level visits  between the two governments to boost co-operation. Such visits  have been seen as politically sensitive since Governor Chris  Patten tabled his political reform package to the legislature.    In addressing the delegates, the party official gave an  account of Guangdong's development blueprint from 1990 to 2010  and admitted that the future might not be all that rosy.  According to Mr Xie, Guangdong will have to establish a market  economy, perfect its legal system, and improve its present  people's congress system and anti- corruption work in the coming  six years. "My view is that our targets in the first 10 years  (1990 to 2000) are relatively easy to achieve but difficulties  await us in the second (decade). "That's why we have to lay a  very solid foundation... now." He said that Guangdong would  pay extra attention to the development of agriculture, basic  infrastructure and education, and science and technology in the  run-up to 2000.    Meanwhile, the Government hopes to adjust the province's  industry mix, clean up the environment and control population  growth in that period. "Whether we can succeed in the second 10  years will very much depend on how we fare in these areas," Mr  Xie said.    He highlighted the role of Hong Kong in Guangdong's  ambitious  plans. "The realisation of these targets is closely linked with  the prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao," he said. The territory  could continue to contribute to Guangdong's economy by serving  as a channel for "investment markets, management know how, and  information."</p>

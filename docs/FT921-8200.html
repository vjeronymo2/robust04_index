			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Gatt members set to oppose US on tuna import curb GATT members yesterday lined up to back endorsement of the controversial disputes panel ruling against US curbs on tuna imports. The ruling was raised at the regular meeting of Gatt's governing council not by the complainant, Mexico, but by the EC. The EC has been directly affected by last month's US court ruling extending the ban on tuna imports from Mexico and Venezuela to re-exports of these imports by, among others, France, Italy and Spain. Some 20 countries are thought to be affected. Rich and poor countries urged adoption of the panel report, completed last August. Under US pressure, Mexico had agreed not to take the case further. It has become a cause celebre for environmental groups, mainly in the US, which claim Gatt rules prevent action to curb pollution or protect endangered species. The US banned imports of Mexican tuna, saying Mexican fishing fleets kill too many dolphins in their tuna nets. The panel said the US ban contravened Gatt rules, because discriminatory trade measures could not be used to impose environmental laws outside a country's own jurisdiction. Those urging adoption of the report said Gatt rules did not stop governments taking domestic measures to protect the environment nor concluding multilateral environmental pacts. But the panel argued that countries could not restrict imports of a product merely because it originated in a country with environmental policies different from its own. Mr Andras Szepesi, Gatt panel chairman, argued that if countries wished Gatt to allow trade sanctions in response to different environmental regulations, they should do so by amending Gatt rules or waiving Gatt obligations rather than distort the interpretation of existing rules permitting limited exceptions. This, he said, would enable Gatt members to limit the range of policy differences justifying trade sanctions and to devise safeguards to prevent abuse. Mexico said it would support multilateral measures to reduce incidental dolphin kills in fishing nets. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the administration was seeking a solution to accommodate the interests of all those involved. But it could not overturn decisions of the US courts and at this point, the only way to change matters might be through legislation. The council will return to the issue in March. Other issues discussed by the Gatt council included: * The council agreed Romania's request for a working party to renegotiate its 1971 membership terms; * The US was granted a waiver from Gatt's non-discrimination (most-favoured-nation) rule to extend preferential trading arrangements to Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru; * Canada agreed to the adoption of a disputes panel report upholding a US complaint on discrimination against beer imports by Canada's provincial liquor boards.</p>

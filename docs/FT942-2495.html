			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Travel: In search of the Japanese spirit - Christopher McCooey experiences early morning on Mount Fuji Four o'clock on a July morning on the rim of a dormant volcano. It was dark and chilly, the wind swirling out of the 700-ft crater behind me. I was not alone, just one of hundreds gathering on the summit of Mt Fuji, at 12,388ft the highest point in Japan. Some people had slept for a few hours in mountain huts on the trail or at the summit. Others, like myself, had climbed through the night and were resting - conversing in low voices, sharing chocolate and anecdote in time-honoured mountain tradition - and waiting for the sunrise. Climbing Mt Fuji is more than just getting to the top of a mountain. For the Japanese it is a religious experience, confirmation of their true Japanese spirit, and to be there at dawn, to pay homage to the rising sun, is the ultimate high. The eastern sky began to lighten perceptibly as more and more parties of climbers, some urged on with whistles and megaphones, snaked their way to the top. Their progress could be monitored by watching their torches swinging from side to side, following the trails below. At this altitude it is necessary to rest every few steps as the final few hundred feet are the steepest and the loose volcanic ash and clinker make it very tiring: three trudges up, half a slide down, wheeze, rest, gulp for oxygen, gaze at the stars. Altitude sickness, a red-hot steel needle inserted behind the eyes and twisted slowly for effect (or so it feels), may be a problem. If you are prone to this, take altitude pills. Fuji is an almost perfect volcanic cone about 60 miles south-west of Tokyo. On days when strong winds have swept away the pall of pollution that inevitably hangs over Tokyo, a city of nearly 12m, the graceful mountain, snow-capped in winter, can be seen from downtown. The volcano must be considered dormant rather than extinct. Since 800 AD, seven eruptions have been documented; the most recent took place between December 16 1707 and January 22 1708. It was in that eruption that the cone lost its perfect symmetry. There is a hump on its south-east slope called Hoei-zan (san or zan means mountain in Japanese, which is why Fuji is often called Fuji-san, or Fuji-yama, yama also meaning mountain). Ash spewed out from Hoei-zan and covered the capital, called Edo in those days, to a depth of 6in. When I was there, Hoei-zan, at 8,864ft, was as black as spilt ink against the patchy low cloud that hung wispily in the valleys below. I could make out areas of coniferous trees planted in angular blocks on its slopes, and then a huge area, lighter in colour, along Fuji's southern flanks. This is a kind of tableland that was denuded of its forest cover when Hoei-zan erupted. Today it is an area of open moorland used by the Self-Defence Force as a training ground for its troops, tanks and jets. Beyond that were swathes of lights from towns and cities, part of the most dynamic industrial region on earth, the Pacific seaboard from Tokyo to Osaka. It had taken me four hours to reach the crater rim from where I had left my car at the road-head. The trails are steep, but easy to follow. If you are reasonably fit then a steady plod will get you to the top. I reached into my rucksack for a sweater as the chill wind at the top quickly nullified the body warmth caused by my exertions. I found a sheltered hollow. My wife had prepared onegiri for me, and I began to munch on the rice ball wrapped in dried seaweed. In the centre was a pickled plum, tangy and sour, and I sucked on the stone, enjoying its refreshing taste. On peak summer weekends as many as 40,000 people climb Fuji. Like any mountain area, accidents occur, and Fuji has claimed its share of lives. Some Japanese have actually chosen this sacred mountain as the place where they want to die. On the north side is an area of virgin forest called Aoki-gahara, the Sea of Trees. One of the trails that goes from the base of the mountain to the summit passes through this area. Hikers are advised to keep to the trail as it is easy to get lost, and minerals in the rocks cause compasses to malfunction. Japanese bent on suicide drown in the Sea of Trees; they wander off the trail and get lost, spending their last earthly hours on the slopes of their beloved Fuji. Each year the police and the Self-Defence Force combine to search the area; on average 20 bodies are found. With proper equipment it is possible to climb the mountain during any month, but in the winter it should be regarded as a serious alpine expedition. Several thousand climbers are on the summit at dawn on January 1, to greet the New Year. However, the safest time to climb is during July and August when all of the mountain huts are open. Even so, care is needed because of rock slides. In August 1980, 12 people - mostly schoolchildren and elderly people - were killed by a rock slide as they descended Fuji by the sunabashiri (sandslide) on the north side. This is a large patch of volcanic sand, and it is possible to get from the summit down to the car-park in an hour if you run and slide. The sky had changed from black to deep purple and was now lightening to blue. The moon was a pale yellow in a panoply of silver blue stars and orange planets and, tracking through them, a satellite. In the growing light I became more aware of my immediate surroundings. The garbage that desecrates the mountain is unbelievable. Down below there were huge screes of rusting cans beside each hut; on the trails were candy wrappers and soda cans discarded by climbers; around me at the summit were empty boxes that had contained rice meals, smashed beer bottles, orange peel, cigarette ends and wooden chopsticks used once and dropped. It seems incredible that the Japanese venerate this mountain so deeply yet treat it so shabbily. At the summit there is a post office as well as numerous vending machines selling sake and beer and soda. Snack stalls offer hot noodles at prices reflecting the altitude. The toilet facilities are primitive. There are souvenir shops selling charms and trinkets and, if you have a hiking stick, you can get it branded to prove that you made the conquest. It is estimated that just under half the 400,000 who climb the mountain every year are female - which is only right when it is remembered that the guardian divinity of the mountain is a female one: the goddess who makes the flowers bloom. I was lucky, for conditions were perfect the day I climbed. Thousands of feet below, smoke-grey cloud covered the forests and rice fields, factories and cities. High above, the thin shavings of cirrus had already caught the sun's rays and were bright gold, while out in front a blood-red dawn seeped perceptibly along the eastern horizon. And then the huge orb of the sun rose majestically out of the mighty Pacific to a chorus of 'Banzai]' . . . 'Cheers]' . . . 'Long Live the Emperor]' . . . 'Long Live Japan]' When to go: the mountain climbing season is from July 1 to August 31. The mountain huts charge about Pounds 40 with evening meal and breakfast, less without. The huts are spartan and very crowded at weekends. No camping is allowed on Mt Fuji. All trails are about the same in difficulty: steep and with loose rock and ash. Try and avoid weekends, which are busy. Fuji does not require special mountaineering skills in the summer season, just reasonable fitness and perseverance. A stout pair of hiking boots is essential, with gaiters recommended to protect your ankles from the sharp clinker and help keep out the cinders that work their way into your socks. Warm and wind-proof clothes should be worn or carried as it may be hot at the bottom and freezing at the top. Take your own food, snacks and drinks.</p>

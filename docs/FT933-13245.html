			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Unisys overcomes sluggish market UNISYS, the US computer manufacturer, increased operating profits in the second quarter, in spite of sluggish market conditions which reduced sales. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 103m, or 39 cents a share, fully diluted. This compares with last year's Dollars 88.4m, or 35 cents, before a tax benefit, which raised income to Dollars 105.4m or 45 cents per share. The average number of fully diluted shares in the latest quarter was 198.6m, against 167.8m a year ago. The increase reflects the issue of Dollars 345m of 8.25 per cent convertible subordinated notes in June 1992. Revenue for the quarter was Dollars 1.93bn, down from Dollars 2.09bn in the same period last year. 'Profitability has improved year to year despite increased economic weakness in Europe and Japan,' said Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive. 'Further improvement in gross profit margins coupled with continued reduction in operating expenses has resulted in an operating profit margin of 11.3 per cent, the highest in five years,' he added. Unisys would 'retain tight cost and expense controls to deal with the uncertain economic environment and continue to focus on revenue opportunities with good margins', Mr Unruh said. Unisys said its debt, net of cash, stood at Dollars 1.4bn at the end of the second quarter. The company's debt-to-capital ratio fell to below 37 per cent, compared with a high of 61 per cent two years ago. Unisys's credit rating has recently been upgraded by both Moody's and Duff and Phelps, the credit rating agencies. The company said that declines in sales of hardware in Europe and Japan were partly compensated for by growth in revenues from software, services and systems integration. European orders and revenues were also negatively affected by currency translation, the company added. At the half-way stage, net income was Dollars 363.6m or Dollars 1.48 a share, including a net gain from one-time items in the first quarter of Dollars 203.8m, or 83 cents a fully-diluted share. In the same period last year net income was Dollars 153.7m, or 56 cents a share, including Dollars 17m or 10 cents a share, from the tax benefit. Revenues were Dollars 3.83bn, against Dollars 4.1bn for the first six months of 1992.</p>

Kessel, one of two attorneys representing  Ramos in her San Fernando Superior Court trial on charges that include murder  and kidnaping.  </P> <P> "All her actions were done at gunpoint by Mr. Comtois," Kessel said in his  opening statement. "There's only one perpetrator, who has been put to justice,  and that's Roland Comtois."  </P> <P> Comtois, 60, was sentenced July 31 to the gas chamber after he was convicted of  murder, attempted murder, kidnaping, attempted sodomy and other charges.  </P> <P> Ramos is accused of luring Wendy Masuhara, 14, who was shot to death, and a  13-year-old girl into Comtois' camper on Sept. 18, 1987.  </P></p>

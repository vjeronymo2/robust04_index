			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: DTI distances itself from RICS' stance on QMH probe THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry yesterday distanced itself from a decision by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to suspend its inquiry into the widely divergent valuations on the assets of Queens Moat Houses, writes Andrew Jack. The DTI said: '(RICS') activities are entirely a matter for them.' The Institution decided on Friday that it would stop examining the circumstances behind valuations which differed by nearly Pounds 500m provided by Jones Lang Wootton and Weatherall Green &amp; Smith. QMH has said the valuations - which were delivered within five months of each other - had been commissioned using the same information and prepared on the same valuation basis. The Institution's action followed legal advice and was prompted by the DTI announcement at the end of last week that it was launching an inquiry into QMH. Its decision came in spite of assurances that it would seek urgently to assess the valuations and make a statement 'in a matter of days'. The three members of the assets valuation standards committee, convened to consider whether there was a disciplinary case to answer, were informed after the decision had been taken. Mr Richard Wright, a partner with lawyers Dibb Lupton Broomhead, said professional bodies typically did suspend inquiries once a DTI investigation had begun, but there was no legal reason to do so.</p>

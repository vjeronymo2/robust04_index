			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / UK Gilts: Inflation news helps ease the recovery blues THE gilt market shrugged off the economic recovery blues, but is thought susceptible to further attacks of this debilitating illness in the weeks ahead. The first sign of this could come as early as today when the Central Statistical Office announces figures for growth in UK output in the first quarter. Should this lead to the first hard evidence that the UK recession is over, watch out for cries of alarm from the gilt market which could affect this Wednesday's big gilt auction. Last week's rash of economic data gave further signs that a slow upturn may be on the way, a development that gilts traders reckon could kick off a spurt in inflation and bring a halt to the run of cuts in UK interest rates. The biggest concern on this score came on Thursday when long gilts lost nearly half a point on news that UK unemployment fell last month for the second month running. The 26,000 fall in the March job queues, after a revised 25,500 reduction in February, arrived with other indicators from the car and housing sectors pointing to a pick up in demand. At the end of a week of promising economic data, the government said shop sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in March compared with February, and were 4.1 per cent higher than in the same month a year ago. However, by the end of the week gilt investors had perked up, on the grounds that inflationary trends were more favourable than these straws in the wind would indicate. Pointing in this direction was that average earnings growth dropped again in February to a year-on-year 4.5 per cent from 4.75 per cent in January, the lowest increase for 25 years. For manufacturing, the rate dropped 0.25 percentage points to 5 per cent, while for the services sector average earnings dropped to 4.25 per cent, compared with 4.5 per cent. The figures on wage inflation came after several months in which wage increases have been severely dented, and indicated that a take off in earnings demand may be some way in the future. Business Strategies, a consultancy, and Gallup, a market research group, weighed in with a joint report saying the recession was still not over and that consumer confidence in the first quarter of this year was less than the far from high levels in the same period a year ago. The survey estimated that consumer spending grew by a minuscule 0.1 per cent in the first quarter compared with the final three months of last year. A third pointer was Friday's release of monetary data showing a Pounds 1.2bn fall in bank and building society lending last month. Indications from the retailing industry, meanwhile, are that consumers are still some way from spending more money in the more luxurious end of the food sector, a sign that any upturn may be extremely slow. Sentiments sparked by this kind of doleful news pushed life into the gilt market on Friday, with long gilts regaining much of the previous day's loss. While yields on 10-year gilts changed little on the week, those on short-dated bonds were pushed up by up to 10 basis points on the week. This was on the assumption that the UK government was unlikely to be in a hurry to cut base rates, in spite of the surprise reduction in German interest rates during the week. The size of the government borrowing requirement will for some time send shudders through the market, with the record Pounds 9.5bn deficit for March underlining theories that borrowing for the current financial year could top the Pounds 50bn mark. The outcome of this Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3bn of 7.25 per cent bonds due 1998 will be a good guide as to underlying demand for the instruments. Many gilt investors fear that the bonds' value may fall over the next two years should the more extreme worries about the build up of government debt turn out to be accurate.</p>

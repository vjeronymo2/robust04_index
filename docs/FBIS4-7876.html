			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just heard from the Presidency Press Center  that President of the Republic Zhelyu Zhelev has met with  Ventseslav Antonov and Chavdar Kunchev [chairman of Bulgarian  Foreign Trade Bank]. They were the principal participants in  formulating the strategy and philosophy for conducting the  negotiations on settling the Bulgarian foreign debt.    The president expressed his serious concern over the fact  that they had left the Foreign Debt Commission. During the  conversation, it became clear that the both of their decisions  to resign were prompted by fundamental differences with the  remaining members of the Commission. In response to Dr.  Zhelev's request, both of them will meet with Prime Minister  Berov.</p>

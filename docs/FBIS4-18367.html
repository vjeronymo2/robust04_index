			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mustafa Necati Ozfatura from the "Foreign Policy" </F> column: "NATO"]    [Text] NATO is a military alliance against Russian and  communist imperialism. The Soviet Union is dissolved. The  Warsaw Pact is annulled. The West-East Cold War is over and  communism has collapsed; but NATO, devoid of its functions,  remains. On 18 February 1952, Turkey joined NATO, which was  established on 4 April. Turkey trusted NATO and has come out a  loser. Turkey, which maintained the largest number of soldiers  to defend against the Soviet Union after the United States,  remained underdeveloped because of the burden NATO's military  expense placed on the country. While Turkey fulfills all its  responsibilities toward NATO, NATO has not fulfilled most of its  responsibilities toward Turkey. NATO member countries have not  supported Turkey but in fact acted antagonistically toward it.  Turkey's extremely West-oriented policy and support of NATO has  left it isolated in the world. Turkey which pinned its hopes on  NATO has been let down. Superpowers can never have friendships.  They can only relate to self-interest. Turkey, which made  extraordinary sacrifices for NATO from 1952 to 1990, was stabbed  in the back by NATO members who supported the PKK [Workers Party  of Kurdistan] and deployed the Poised Hammer.    The West betrayed Turkey which receives little aid from NATO  but carries the Alliance's heavy load. And this is a  characteristic of the West. The West is no different from a  scorpion or from a snake. Countries which side with the West are  bound to get its poison at their weak moments. The West sees  its interest in Turkey's disaster. The U.S. and European Union  [EU] policy toward Turkey is to destroy it mainly economically  and morally and then to use it. In short, the Western policy  toward Turkey can be described as "collapse it and use it."    The United States and the EU supplied the basic intrigue to  begin the chain of Turkey's disasters. The West remained  silent when the Greeks massacred Turks in Cyprus with NATO arms.  However, when Turkey saved its brothers in Cyprus in line with  existing agreements and international law, the West imposed an  arms embargo on Turkey. President Lyndon Johnson gave Turkey a  memorandum, saying: "I would like to tell you in all sincerity  that the United States will not agree to the use of  U.S.-supplied military equipment in any intervention Turkey  might undertake in Cyprus."    Unfortunately, intellectuals and politicians raised in  Western culture pinned their hopes on the United States and  Europe. However, had we tried to stand on our own two feet with  our own resources we would have found our true identity, our  true place in the world. Following in the footsteps of the West  (the formula of the late Ismet Inonu) has been the reason for  our disaster.    According to the United States, all the world's resources  are the common property of mankind, but the sources of the  United States belong to the United States only. There is no  basic difference between 1945 Yalta and 1990 Malta. The only  difference is in the method. In Yalta, the United States and  Russia [as published] divided the world into their areas of  influence. They divided the world into East-West, Warsaw Pact  and NATO, thereby preventing progress for the developing  countries and continuing to exploit developing countries by  selling arms to them. They deceived the world through Cold War  scenarios. When the world realized how deceitful the scenarios  were, Bush and Gorbachev decided in Malta to go on with the Cold  War, but this time to disband the Soviet Union and replace it  with Russia. The United States and Russia, who were enemies in  the past, are now in the same ranks. The only superpower in the  world today is the United States, and its greatest supporter is  Russia. The West which did not allow Russia to come down to the  Adriatic for centuries, has just placed it in Bosnia-Herzegovina  which the West prepared. Do not be surprised if, soon, through  U.S-Russian cooperation, Russia is placed in Turkey's straits.  Maybe the East-West Cold War ended in Malta, but a cold war  between the North (Christianity) and the South (Islam) was  decided on there.    The new enemy of the West and of NATO is Islam which is  hiding behind a fundamentalist mask. At the time, NATO's enemy  was red, now it is green, in other words, the color of Islam.  NATO's true face emerged when it remained a silent observer  before the Serbian cruelties in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Today, NATO  has adopted a front against the Islamic world.</p>

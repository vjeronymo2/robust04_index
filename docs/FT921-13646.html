			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (8): White gold loses its shine - Cotton growing is in decline EGYPT can still claim to produce some of the best quality cotton in the world. But it has singularly failed to breathe life into an industry which has been in steady decline for 20 years. Cotton remains one of the most important crops produced in Egypt. Exports are Egypt's fifth largest source of foreign exchange earnings, after oil revenues, worker remittance, tourism and Suez Canal earnings. Cotton output fell sharply in the early 1970s and in the past decade dropped a further 40 per cent. This year, planted acreage is expected to show a further sharp decline. Despite increasing export prices, export earnings have fallen steadily. Gross revenues for lint were Dollars 200m for the 1989-90 crop but are expected to decline to Dollars 170m for the 1990-91 crop. Cotton is important to Egypt for reasons other than foreign earnings. The textile industry is a major public sector employer, with about 230,000 workers in 31 public sector plants - operated by the Textile Industries Corporation under the Ministry of Industry. It is precisely because of its importance that the government is reluctant to relinquish control and cotton continues to be one of Egypt's two remaining controlled crops (the other is sugar cane.) Cotton production and procurement is mandatory and marketing and export remain government monopolies. Farmers almost unanimously do not like to plant cotton. Known in the past as 'white gold' in Egypt, it is now referred to as the 'government's crop'. Many farmers still find it more profitable to pay the minimal fines for not growing cotton or to divert resources to the production of other more lucrative crops. The government openly admits its policies actively discourage farmers from growing cotton. Mr Hassan Khetr, the ministry's under secretary in charge of agricultural economics and statistics, talks of the 'disease' of government control that has worked as a disincentive to farmers. 'The government was squeezing cotton producers - they were getting 25 per cent less than what they deserved,' he says. The government has outlined three objectives and insists that it is committed to them: to reform the pricing policy by increasing the procurement price of cotton to a level closer to its world price; eliminating subsidies; eventually privatising the cotton sector.</p>

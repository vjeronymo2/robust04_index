			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FORUM TONIGHT ON HYPERION  </P> <P> A community forum will be held tonight at Recreation Park in El Segundo to  discuss a proposal by the Hyperion Treatment Plant to construct at least a  dozen large processing tanks that will obstruct the ocean views of some  homeowners.  </P> <P> Hyperion officials Saturday raised 50 large weather balloons about 100 feet  into the air to demonstrate how views could be blocked by the tanks, which are  being built as part of a project to increase the capacity of the facility.  </P> <P> The homes are on the bluffs directly above the sprawling plant, which is  operated by the city of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The demonstration prompted a group of El Segundo residents to organize a  grass-roots effort to block the construction of the tanks, which would be 105  feet tall.  </P> <P> The forum, at 7 p.m. in the George Gordon Clubhouse, was called by El Segundo  City Councilman Scot Dannen. The park is at 300 E. Pine St.  </P></p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / International Company News: Du Pont in red after charge DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, will record a 1992 net loss, following Dollars 5bn of one-time charges the company said it would be taking to conform to new US accounting standards concerning employee retirement, healthcare and insurance benefits as well as income taxes. Mr Edgar Woolard, chairman of Du Pont, yesterday bemoaned the rising cost of healthcare in employee benefit programmes, noting that Du Pont's plan, which covers 145,000 employees and their families, cost Dollars 500m in 1992, twice the level of 1987. He said that poor economic conditions around the world, and stiff competition from non-US companies that do not have to pay directly for employee healthcare, had eliminated the option of passing such costs on to consumers. Yesterday, the company said that in addition to the accounting charges it would record a Dollars 275m fourth-quarter charge related to redundancy incentives and payments in the petroleum, fibres and imaging systems divisions. To comply with the accounting changes Du Pont will restate financial results for the first three quarters of 1992, which as of last September 30 totalled Dollars 1.4bn of net profits on sales of Dollars 28.7bn. Some Dollars 4.8bn of the Dollars 5bn of accounting charges will be recorded for the first quarter of last year, while a further Dollars 200m will be spread over the year. Du Pont's share price rose Dollars 1 yesterday to Dollars 48 1/8. The Du Pont writedown translates into a Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 3.70-a-share special non-cash charge for Seagram, the global drinks group, in the year ending January 31 1993, writes Robert Gibbens. Seagram, Canada-based but accounting in US dollars, is adopting the same US accounting standards as Du Pont for fiscal 1993. It holds 25 per cent of Du Pont. The non-cash charge will turn Seagram's expected fiscal 1993 profit of Dollars 1.87 a share into a loss of about Dollars 1.83.</p>

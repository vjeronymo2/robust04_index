			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Banks seek support for Algerian debt refinancing: A European Community loan guarantee is at risk if there is no accord EIGHT international banks meet in Paris today to decide whether they have sufficient support from 130 or so of their peers to proceed with a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 840m) loan intended to refinance Algeria's principal commercial bank debt between October 1 1991 and March 31 1993. A total of Dollars 1.4bn out of Dollars 1.5bn was committed before the first round on December 26 of Algeria's now cancelled elections and still apparently is. But continuing reluctance of some lenders might delay the completion of the package. Failure to reach agreement would endanger the second and smaller disbursement of an Ecu400m (Pounds 287m) loan guarantee agreed by the European Community last autumn. The guarantee was provided on the understanding that commercial bank debt would be refinanced. Under normal circumstances places could be taken by other private institutions, but some banks made their commitment conditional on the deal gaining support of all Algeria's commercial bank creditors. However, most key banks are determined to ensure final success of the package. The immediate consequence of the agreement to launch the refinancing reached four months ago between the Algerian banks led by Credit Populaire d'Algerie and the eight 'core group' of international banks led by Credit Lyonnais was to allow Algeria to defer about Dollars 350m worth of principal repayments which were owed to commercial banks in the last quarter of 1991. But Algeria will need more than an agreement with its bankers if it is to succeed in reducing what has been for four years a crippling repayment burden. The ratio of debt service to exports was 74 per cent last year, 57 per cent of which was accounted for by repayments of principal. Algeria can be likened to an oil company with a cash flow problem. The debt is not large if related to export earnings of just over Dollars 12bn last year and a projected Dollars 11.3bn in 1992, a figure due to rise as Algeria opens its existing wells to foreign oil companies and increases its exports of natural gas to European buyers such as Italy. Rescheduling, which Algerian rulers are adamant they want to avoid, would not only entail a loss of good credit standing but would be strongly opposed by Japanese banks which are owed two-thirds of the country's bank debt. Japan has also extended a balance of payments loan to Algeria and supported co-financing with the World Bank. Altogether Japanese institutions probably hold nearly as much Algerian paper as French ones. The high debt service ratio is slowly but surely throttling private and state industry. It has forced a sharp cut in imports. Many factories are running at one-third of their capacity, laying off workers and running up huge debts with Algerian banks as they are increasingly starved of raw materials, semi-processed goods and spare parts. Unemployment is nearly 50 per cent among the 16-24 age group, thus providing fertile ground for the Islamic Salvation Front. Roughly Dollars 5bn of Algeria's Dollars 23.9bn foreign debt is owed to commercial banks, Dollars 3.5bn in the form of medium- terms loans, the balance made up of 12-month trade finance. Credits from international financial institutions account for Dollars 3.6bn, bond issues and lease financings for Dollars 1.3bn each, with the remaining Dollars 15.3bn made up of bilateral and supplier credits. Nearly half this figure is accounted for by French government guaranteed credits which France has, to date, insisted it will not consider refinancing. This reluctance has proved a major obstacle to the policy of refinancing its debt doggedly pursued by the Algerian authorities. Whereas Italy offered Algeria Dollars 2.7bn to refinance state guaranteed loans falling due between January 1991 and January 1993, France has been adamant that it will do no such thing. Senior officials acknowledge that a lender can easily refinance bilateral military debt - hence France's agreement initialled with Iraq on the eve of the invasion of Kuwait to refinance an estimated FFr50bn (Pounds 5.11bn) worth of military credits guaranteed by the state credit guarantee organisation, Coface. Unfortunately Algeria's estimated FFr36bn debt with Coface is civilian and according to senior French Treasury officials not susceptible to such treatment. Senior members of the Ministry of Finance in Paris have been unconvinced of the policy of refinancing, not least because they are fearful of creating a precedent while their Ministry of Foreign Affairs colleagues are mindful of extending a helping hand to a country that they feel is key to future French interests at a time when it desperately needs support. France will have to decide whether it considers Algeria's financial stability to be one of its strategic interests, as the US did with Mexico during the latter's 1982 debt crisis. A move to support Algeria taken in Paris would undoubtedly strike a positive response in other capitals, such as Brussels and Tokyo.</p>

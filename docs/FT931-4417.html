			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Education drive urged on business MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday urged business executives to become more involved in education to ensure that young people leaving schools and colleges had the skills employers needed. Mr Patten said at a CBI conference in London that business was being given more information about school performance through league tables on examination results. Employers who were unhappy about the standards of education of school-leavers should take it up with the schools concerned. 'As a business customer you would not stand on the sidelines and make general statements about the performance of your suppliers,' he said. 'You would do something about it.' Mr Patten said businesses had increasing opportunities to become involved in education, through governing bodies, education-business partnerships and Training and Enterprise Councils. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said at the same conference said school league tables should be compiled by an independent body such as the Audit Commission or Ofsted, the new schools inspectorate.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): When tick becomes too heavy a cross to bear You supply a long-established customer with Pounds 10,000 worth of goods only to hear a week later he has gone out of business. Your normal credit terms are 30 days, so you are still three weeks away from payment. You then face the prospect of the liquidator or the administrative receiver selling your consignment of goods to pay off the bank or one of the other creditors. The problem is that although you feel the delivery you made ought still to belong to you, in law it does not. Unless you agree other terms with your customers, the goods become theirs the moment your delivery lorry drops them at the loading bay. How can you reduce the risk you run without demanding cash in advance or some other change in terms which might persuade the customer to switch to a rival supplier? One method is to put a 'retention of title' clause into your terms of trade. This is unlikely to frighten off sound customers but, if handled properly, can increase your chance of being paid. Detailed advice* has been drawn up the London Chamber of Commerce to clarify the confusion. Making a retention of title clause stick can be difficult unless all the legal niceties have been met. All your terms of trade, including retention of title, must be communicated to your customer before or at the time the contract is made, the chamber advises. It is not sufficient to print the clause on your invoices since these go out after the contract has been struck. It must be printed, prominently, on all brochures and price lists, credit application forms, quotations and customer order forms. You must also make sure that your document outlining the terms of trade is the last document to be sent out since this will usually be the one which is held to be legally binding. If you receive an order on a customer's own order form, you must, without fail, send your own 'acknowledgment of order' form containing your terms. If you print your retention of title clause on the back of any forms, you should put a note on the front drawing the customer's attention to it. And make sure the terms are printed in readable, clear type. If your customer goes bust and you need to apply the clause, get in touch immediately and make arrangements to recover your goods. If you cannot take the goods away immediately, you should make an inventory or take photographs. These must be signed and dated by your representative and by your customer. *Retention of Title Clauses: A Simple Man's Guide to Implementation.

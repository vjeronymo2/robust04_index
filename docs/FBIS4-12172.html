			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, has cautioned  the developed countries that it would be counterproductive to  create problems for the developing countries in free flow of  resources, capital, technology, and market access. Opening the  golden jubilee session of the United Nation's Economic and  Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific -- ESCAP -- in New  Delhi today, he said the third world countries should resist any  move to put extraneous concerns on the trade agenda after the  conclusion of GATT treaty. He said the Western countries are  trying to use social and environmental issues for nullifying the  comparative advantage of the developing countries. Urging the  rich countries to understand the aspirations of the Third World  countries to catch up with the rest of the world, he said a  great opportunity will be lost if instead of concentrating  efforts to globalize the benefits from GATT, fresh impediments  are introduced in the form of unjustified controversies. Calling  upon the members for adopting the real declaration on  environment protection, Mr. Rao said it is a comprehensive  declaration with a broader charter which not only addresses the  present ecological and developmental problems, but also aims at  preparing the world for the challenges of the next century.  Appreciating the role of the commission, he said it provides a  vast scope for mutual cooperation among the nations of the  region in the development of infrastructure. Highlighting the  importance of massive investment in the social sector, he said  poverty alleviation must be addressed on priority basis, if the  goal of sustainable development is to be achieved. He called  for sharing the benefits of human capital formation and  technological development among the countries of the commission.  The prime minister urged the members of the Asia Pacific region  to give highest priority and unconditional support to the  imperatives of economic cooperation, including trade,  investment, technology transfer, and tourism over the other  aspects of mutual relations.    The Commerce minister, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, was unanimously  elected chairman of the session. His name was proposed by China  and was seconded by Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Mongolia.    The executive secretary of ESCAP, Mr. Rafiuddin Ahmad, in  his  report to the conference asked member countries to remain on  guard against imposition of new forms of nontariff barriers  after the new GATT deal comes into force. He said already  attempts are being made to impose restrictions to affect the  exports of the developing countries. About the ESCAP agenda, he  outlined an action plan for greater focus on infrastructure  development in the region. One hundred and forty billion  dollars will be needed every year to improve the network of  road, communication, and power generation facilities. Since the  external assistance will not be forthcoming to the required  extent, pragmatic measures will be necessary to mobilize  resources through private sector participation and efficient  operation. This action plan will be adopted as the New Delhi  Declaration.    Our correspondent covering the conference reports that  Armenia has been admitted as a member of the ESCAP though it is  not a part of the Asia Pacific region. This has been done as a  special case following a request from the former Soviet  Republic. Today's discussions are covering recent economic and  social developments in the region and their impact as also the  need for sustainable development.</p>

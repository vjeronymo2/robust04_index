			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Inter-American Commission for Human Rights  has ended its visit to Haiti after investigating the human  rights situation in Haiti. The delegation met with the media on  20 May. Rothschild Francois reports live:    [Francois] Good Afternoon! The visit of the Inter-American  Commission for Human Rights delegation, which came to  investigate the human rights situation in Haiti, has concluded.  The members of the delegation pointed out that the situation is  grave. They said they were able to meet with many people who  were victims of human rights violations in Haiti. They also  recorded cases of summary executions, abduction, and arbitrary  arrests, mostly within the sector of the population favoring the  return of President Aristide to Haiti.    The OAS delegation stressed that according to the  testimonies  they collected, the responsibility for those human rights  violations falls entirely on the military, armed civilians as  well as members of FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the  Advancement and Progress of Haiti].    The delegation also denounced the many cases of rape  reported, especially by women whose husbands or relatives are  supporters of President Aristide, especially in the slum areas  of Port-au-Prince. For members of this delegation, these  violations fall within the scope of crimes against humanity.  [passage omitted]    It should be noted that during this news conference, members  of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights recommended an  increase in the number of civilian mission observers in Haiti.  The commission believes that the mission is doing a good job so  far.    It should also be noted that the delegation solicited a  meeting with the military heads, including the head of the Army  and of the Port-au-Prince police, neither of whom responded, and  the delegation is due to leave Port-au-Prince in a few hours.  The delegation promises to make a detailed report, within the  framework of the situation of human rights in Haiti, to the OAS  General Assembly, due to be held in Brazil next month.    Further details will be provided in our next broadcast  regarding this detailed report by members of the delegation of  the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, which stayed for  a week in Port-au-Prince, having come to investigate the  situation of human rights in Haiti. According to statements to  the press prior to their departure, the delegation considers  this situation is worsening each day.</p>

			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Airline price-fixing charges The US Justice Department yesterday charged eight big US airlines with antitrust violations for allegedly fixing prices through a computerised fare system, Reuter reports from Washington. After a three-year investigation, it accused them of operating their computer system in a way that unreasonably restrains price competition in the domestic airline industry. The department said it reached settlements with United Air Lines and USAir, which agreed to change their fare-filing practices. The proposed settlement includes a prohibition on communicating future pricing intentions. The other airlines are American, Delta, Northwest, Continental, Trans World and Alaska Airlines. The suit alleges that the airlines agreed at various times to increase some fares and eliminate discounts for travel.</p>

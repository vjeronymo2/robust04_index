The Statistics Department reported that the improved trade  position was due to stronger demand, which induced higher export  growth compared with that of imports. Exports expanded by 18  percent from the 10 months in 1992 to RM100.2 billion as against  a 14.3 percent growth in imports at RM96.3 billion. [passage  omitted]    For the 10-month period under review, the acceleration of  export growth was largely contributed by significant increases  in the exports of manufactured goods (+36.8 percent), machinery  and transport equipment (+29.7 percent) and miscellaneous  manufactured articles (+10.7 percent). These three major  components contributed to 67.9 percent of total export earnings.    The department reported that exports of mineral fuel, the  second largest contributor to export value, experienced a  reduction of 5.2 percent in earnings when compared with the same  period in 1992.    The growth in imports was largely contributed by higher  imports of machinery and transport equipment (+16.6 percent),  which accounted for 55.7 percent of total import receipts.    Malaysia's major trading partners during January-October  1993  were Japan, the United States, Singapre, Taiwan, Germany, the  United Kingdom, South Korea and Hong Kong, which collectively  accounted for 75.4 percent of the total trade.</p>

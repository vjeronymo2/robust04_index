Palestinian and Israeli sources said the current round of  talks is being held in a positive atmosphere. They noted a  common desire to achieve progress.    Hasan 'Usfur, deputy head of the Palestinian delegation in  the Security Committee, told MENA that in yesterday's session,  the negotiators completed discussion of a number of issues,  notably the deployment of the Palestinian police force in the  Palestinian autonomous regions, especially around the Israeli  settlements.    Joint Palestinian-Israeli patrols on the side roads (which  link the Israeli settlements with the main Gaza road leading to  Jerusalem) and on the road between Gaza and Jericho were also  discussed, he said. Those subjects, he added, were discussed  within the scope of the joint security draft agreement reached  in Taba during the recent round of negotiations.    'Usfur said the size of the Palestinian police force in Gaza  and Jericho will be discussed today.    It should be noted that the Palestinians want the force to  consist of 10,000 personnel, while Israel want it to be around  6,000 strong.    A compromise of an 8,000-strong force is expected.    'Usfur said the negotiators also discussed yesterday a  general amnesty for Palestinian detainees in accordance with a  timetable ending before 13 July, the date when the  implementation of the actual self-rule plan begins.    Representative of the International Committee of the Red  Cross in Israel and the occupied territories on Wednesday  submitted to chief Palestinian negotiator Dr. Nabil Sha'th a  list of 9,400 Palestinian detainees.    The Palestinians are also demanding the return of 68  Palestinians deported by Israel during the Palestinian intifadah.    'Usfur said the Civilian Affairs Committee postponed  discussions of the transfer of water authority from the Israelis  to the Palestinians and on water sharing to the next round  because the Israeli water expert did not attend the talks.    'Usfur said discussions on the transfer of authority on  antiquities have been completed. He stressed the importance of  transferring this power to the Palestinians and also the  importance of transferring the authority on government lands and  the property of absentees to the self-rule authority.    The negotiators also discussed town organizing and planning  within the transfer of the public works authority. They also  discussed the transfer of the general communications authority.    Palestinian sources in the Civilian Affairs Committee  stressed that tangible progress has been achieved in the current  round. They noted that to date the transfer of some 30  authorities to the Palestinians has been achieved.    The Palestinian sources said the next round, which will  begin  in Taba on Monday, will be decisive because it will tell whether  a final round can be held in Cairo with Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin signing  the executive agreement on self-rule in Gaza and Jericho first.    The current round of Palestinian-Israeli talks opened  yesterday morning under the chairmanship of Palestinian  President's adviser Nabil Sha'th and Israeli Deputy Chief of  Staff General Amnon Shahaq.    This round is expected to conclude tomorrow, Wednesday.</p>

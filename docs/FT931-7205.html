			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Company News: Mexican cement group 13% ahead CEMENTOS Mexicanos, the world's fourth-largest cement company, lifted net profits to 1,725m new pesos (Dollars 548m) last year, a real increase of 13 per cent over 1991. The rise shows Cemex has weathered the slowdown in the Mexican economy. Domestic cement sales rose by 7 per cent last year, with an increase of 12 per cent in the fourth quarter. Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, chief executive, said: 'Cemex has continued to grow and to upgrade operations despite the modest economic deceleration in Mexico. 'Domestic demand for cement showed a significant increase during the second half of the year. We believe this is an indication that the sector has begun to recover from the slowdown during the first half of the year.' Cemex's operating profits reached 1,689m new pesos, 16 per cent more in real terms than 1991. Cemex's Dollars 1.8bn purchase of the Spanish cement companies, Sanson and Valenciana, late last year hardly affected the results. The higher interest on the debt taken out by Cemex was largely offset by the Spanish companies' earnings of Dollars 8.5m in the last quarter. The Spanish companies' margins were 7 per cent, compared with 25 per cent in Mexico.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher Yesterday's profits warning from Albert Fisher completes the company's transition from glamour stock to problem case. Investors have had their patience tried before, by mishaps with Polish mushrooms and Dutch cockles. The latest, involving Chilean grapes and apples, sounds more serious: so much so that seven weeks from the year-end the company cannot be quite sure about maintaining its Pounds 22m annual dividend, despite having Pounds 10m of net cash in the bank. Faced with a likely halving of its second-half profits, Fisher is in something of a cleft stick. If a sudden drop in fruit and vegetable prices can do this kind of damage, so much for the notion that the company adds value to what it sells. So much, too, for any claim to quality of earnings and a high p/e. If, on the other hand, there are factors yet unknown behind yesterday's announcement, the market is wholly justified in hitting the shares as the price of uncertainty. With the shares down 38 per cent yesterday to 41p, Fisher's market value has fallen from nearly Pounds 800m to Pounds 240m in little more than 15 months. The perplexing thing is that if full-year profits come out at Pounds 63m, as the optimists suggest, a held dividend would be almost twice covered by earnings. The yield would then be over 12 per cent, on an earnings multiple of less than 6. It was doubtless this, rather than any sense of urgency, that caused half a dozen Fisher directors to dive into the market and buy shares yesterday. Others tempted to follow their example might care to reflect on the reasonably safe stock market generalisation that when shares have fallen this far, they seldom come back.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar responds cautiously to good inflation data The dollar rose yesterday after weaker than expected August US producer inflation figures improved confidence in the outlook for US asset markets, writes Philip Gawith. There was little follow though buying, however, with market participants wary ahead of today's retail sales and consumer inflation figures. Most observers believe the dollar's bear trend is still intact. After touching a high of DM1.5450, it slipped back to close in London at DM1.5423, from DM1.5421. Against the yen it finished at Y99.915 after spiking up to Y100.2. Elsewhere, the Bundesbank council, as expected, left its official interest rates unchanged, ahead of Sunday's national elections. Sterling had a steady day, with the trade-weighted index finished unchanged at 79.9. The topsy turvy fortunes of the rouble continued, with the Russian currency rising by 20 per cent against the US dollar, to Rs2,994 from Rs3,736. The dollar repeated the recent pattern of taking its lead from the US bond markets. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, commented: 'The dollar responded to better than expected inflation numbers, and it has been worries about inflation that has been driving the dollar down this year.' But as Mr David Cocker, economist at Chemical Bank, noted: 'Both (bonds and the dollar) stopped at technical points, which suggests the market has not got fundamental momentum behind it.' Most of the market activity was interbank trade, with longer-term investors sitting on the side, without a clear view of the direction of the dollar. For the past month it has traded in a very narrow band, of barely more than one pfennig, against the D-Mark. Mr Cocker commented: 'It is very difficult at the moment to see what is going to shake the market out of its inertia.' Against the yen, the short term outlook for the dollar appears negative. Mr Chris Dunne, analyst at Forexia, the market analyst, said that on a chart basis, the dollar looked to be 'a screaming sell'. He said it was likely to fall towards Y98 in the next two weeks, where it had good support. Over the next three months, however, he said the dollar was likely to move towards Y105. 'The market is forming a longer term bottom, but hasn't yet got the nerve to test the upside.' Mr Hannah said the yen uptrend remained intact, but added: 'The tide is turning. There is no doubt about that.' He said Japan's trade surplus was shrinking, as a result of economic recovery, and the stronger yen. Japan's trade surplus had been lower than expected over the last two months, he said. The outlook for German interest rates depends on the outcome of the elections. The market has convinced itself that Chancellor Kohl's coalition will be returned to office. If this is the case, then the background of falling inflation and lower money supply figures could allow one last cut in official rates. The discount rate is currently 4 1/2 per cent, and the Lombard rate 6 per cent. An upset, however, would put events in a different light. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Kidder Peabody in London, comments: 'If the D-Mark comes under pressure because of the shape, or lack of shape, of the government, then rates go up. When the government is weak, the Bundesbank is at its strongest.' In the more likely scenario of a Kohl victory, Ms Cottrell is strongly of the view that rates will not rise. 'The Bundesbank will not put up rates just for the sake of it.' She notes that the turmoil in France, and smaller European countries, that such a move would cause, would precipitate safe-haven flows into the D-Mark. The Bundesbank would want to avoid this, as it would aggravate M3 money supply problems which are only now coming under control. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 1.36bn of assistance, at established rates, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 1.35bn. With a large portion of the shortage cleared in the early round, rates eased slightly. Three month LIBOR closing at 5 7/8 per cent from 5 15/16 per cent. Futures markets responded positively to the good inflation news in the US. Short sterling and euromark futures both rose across the board. The December short sterling contract continued its recent rally, to finish seven basis points higher at 93.62. The equivalent euromark contract closed at 94.78, from 94.70.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Russian cabinet is unveiled as Fyodorov quits: Prime minister declares 'the age of market romanticism is over' Mr Boris Fyodorov, mainstay of Russia's market reforms, quit last night as finance minister when a new cabinet emerged after three days of crisis talks. His departure throws into doubt the government's commitment to transform the state-dominated economy and represents a shift away from attempts to stabilise the country's finances. It may foreshadow an increase in inflation while the government tries to focus on other policies such as ending monopolies and stimulating economic growth. The resignation came hours after Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, announced a cabinet in which Mr Fyodorov was offered the finance ministry but was stripped of the rank of deputy prime minister. Mr Fyodorov refused because his conditions were rejected and because he opposed an economic blueprint. Although details of the blueprint were not yet known, its spirit was clear from remarks by Mr Chernomyrdin, who said 'the age of market romanticism is over'. Strengthened after apparently convincing President Boris Yeltsin to endorse his cabinet line-up, Mr Chernomyrdin set out his proposals for a 'corrected policy' which he insisted did not mean a retreat from reform. The government would try to increase revenues and pay more of its bills, but saw a dilemma in trying to meet spending promises. Implying that Mr Fyodorov was not indispensable in the fight against inflation - the enemy number one - Mr Chernomyrdin said the government would emphasise 'non-monetary means' to fight it, like industrial demonopolisation and wage restraint. Such policies have been proclaimed in the past by the government, but have not so far delivered results. The prime minister also attacked Mr Fyodorov for daring to set conditions for joining his government. These included the removal of Mr Victor Gerashchenko as central bank chairman, which looked likely to be rejected. Although Mr Chernomyrdin said under the new constitution, the chairman was nominated by the president in consultation with parliament, Mr Gerashchenko's press office felt confident enough to announce that he was staying on. Mr Anatoly Chubais, who remains deputy prime minister responsible for privatisation and is the only senior radical reformer left in the government, reiterated charges that Mr Gerashchenko was diametrically opposed to the reform course pursued so far. Mr Fyodorov has described the central bank chief as the top opponent of policies to fight inflation by restricting the growth of money supply and budget expenditure. Further indications of the new government's course came from Mr Alexander Shokhin, previously deputy prime minister for foreign economic relations, who accepted the job as economics minister. Mr Shokhin, a middle of the road reformer, said the government would try to 'cling to a corridor between hyperinflation and a stop in industrial production'. In the new cabinet, Mr Oleg Soskovets, who has taken a moderate path on reform, retains the post of first deputy prime minister. Last night the US said it would encourage Russia to implement reforms and would work with it to the extent that it pursued policies Washington believed could succeed.

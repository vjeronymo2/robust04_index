			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> MAILER CRITICIZES GARBAGE CONTRACT  </P> <P> The controversy over the city's garbage-removal contract grew hotter last week  when a consultant for a waste-hauling firm sent a mailer urging residents to  pressure the City Council to allow competitive bidding for the trash franchise.  </P> <P> The mailer, sent by Ellis/Hart Associates on behalf of Western Waste Industries  of Irvine, criticizes a recent City Council decision not to allow competitive  bids for the residential trash-collection contract.  </P> <P> The mailer included a clip-out "trash tax protest card" addressed to the  council that said, "I . . . believe that the free enterprise system demands  that before you raise our taxes, you require competitive bidding. I will  remember this trash tax increase on election day."  </P> <P> David Ellis, chief executive officer of the political consulting firm, said his  client is protesting a 3-2 council decision last month to award an exclusive  contract to Waste Management Inc. of Irvine, which has held the franchise in  Mission Viejo for about 20 years.  </P> <P> "Competition in trash hauling will guarantee the best rates and service," he  said. "Right now, there is no competition in Mission Viejo. All we're asking  for is a chance to compete."  </P> <P> On Monday, Ellis said he had received more than 1,000 cards. Another mailer is  scheduled to be mailed Thursday, asking residents to attend next Monday's  council meeting, at which members will make a final decision on awarding the  contract to Waste Management.  </P> <P> Some members of the council denounced the mailer, calling it a political move  aimed at Councilman Norman P. Murray, the only council member running for  reelection in November.  </P> <P> Murray was one of three council members, along with Victoria C. Jaffe and  William S. Craycraft, who voted last month in favor of Waste Management.  </P> <P> "I think it's very sad that Mission Viejo has been chosen as the pawn for trash  wars," Jaffe said. "This is a throwback to the '50s, when intimidation and  threats were commonplace between trash companies."  </P> <P> Murray called the mailer "a blatant attempt to pressure me prior to my vote. If  there is a way for Western to sway me, this isn't the way to do it."  </P> <P> Mayor Christian W. Keena, who favors competitive bidding for the franchise,  said the mailer was a "regrettable move."  </P> <P> But pointing to the Waste Management contract, which at $11.85 per household is  the highest among Orange County cities, Keena said that many citizens "are  absolutely shocked about the way we do business, about the fact that we would  have higher rates."  </P> <P> City Manager Fred Sorsabal has defended the contract, saying that the new deal  pays for several additional services not contained in the city's previous pact  with Waste Management.

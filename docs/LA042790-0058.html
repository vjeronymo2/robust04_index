			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. BROADCASTER WILL BUY KJQY-FM FOR $20 MILLION  </P> <P> Legacy Broadcasting of Los Angeles has agreed to purchase KJQY, an  easy-listening format FM station in San Diego, for $20 million, sources said  Thursday.  </P> <P> Legacy Chairman Carl E. Hirsch confirmed that a sale is due to close in May but  declined to discuss the price.  </P> <P> The seller is Command Communications based in Dallas, which acquired the  station in January. A previously announced deal to sell the station to Westwood  One, a broadcasting-publishing concern in Los Angeles, fell through.  </P> <P> KJQY, or "KJOY" as it is known, currently has an easy adult listening format.  It scored a 5.3% market share in the most recent Arbitron audience survey  ratings, ninth best among San Diego FM stations.  </P> <P> Hirsch said that format changes are in the offing for the station to make it  appeal to younger audiences but he declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Last December, Hirsch's Legacy chain sold all 10 of its stations, including  KTWV-FM of Los Angeles, to Group W as part of a complex $727-million merger,  one of the largest deals ever in radio broadcasting. Legacy remains a 15%  shareholder in Group W. The rest is owned by Westinghouse Electric.  </P> <P> Legacy is also in escrow to buy two other stations, WMJI-FM in Cleveland and  WYHY-FM in Nashville from Jacor Communications for $31.25 million. All three  station purchases will close simultaneously, Hirsch said Thursday.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Retired Brigadier General Juan Ramon Rosa  Rodriguez was installed this morning as the new National  Antinarcotics Secretariat (Senad) executive secretary, replacing  Division General Mario Escobar Anzoategui, who tendered his  resignation last year.    Rosa Rodriguez ia a military officer who went into  retirement  a few years ago and served in the 3d Army Corps. Rosa Rodriguez  took a course on drug trafficking in the United States.  Therefore, he is supported by the U.S. diplomatic mission.    The president of the Republic, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, took  considerable time in appointing the Senad head. The Senad  reshuffle prompted "diplomatic" frictions between Wasmosy and  U.S. ambassador to Paraguay Jon David Glassman.    It was actually the U.S. ambassador who announced that the  new Senad head would be appointed sometime this week, at the  latest. According to military sources, there were three  candidates: One of them rejected the post and the other two  were not approved by the U.S. mission. [passage omitted]    The president of the Republic, engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy,  has given "absolute liberty" to the new Senad head, retired Gen.  Juan Ramon Rosa Rodriguez for the latter to properly discharge  his new duties. Rosa Rodriguez noted that if he does not  properly discharge his duties, it will not be because he is  unwilling to do so, but because he does not have the elements  required for it.    The president said: "I fully trust you and I ask everyone  here and all the organizations to provide the support required  for an all-out struggle against money laundering and crime."    Addressing Gen. Rosa Rodriguez, the president added: "You  have all my support and the support of all levels of government  to fight this scourge without any protection. [sentence as  published] You have absolute liberty and the support of the  national government to fight this evil."    Moving on, the president thanked U.S. Ambassador Jon  Glassman  for the assistance the U.S. Embassy has supplied our country to  fight drug trafficking "because, sadly enough, our country is  being used by criminals as a transit country."    The president concluded by saying: "I hope that all of us,  united, some day may be able to wipe out this damned trafficking  from America's Southern Cone."    Rosa Rodriguez    The new Senad head said: "Thank you very much for trusting  me, Mr. President. I cannot promise more than dedication and  honest effort, but I can assure you that if Senad does not  properly meet your expectations, it will never be because of ill  will, laziness, or malice, but it will be because our capacity  and our means are not enough to fulfill your wishes."    This may be interpreted as a call to re-equip Senad, whose  potential, according to Senad Assistant Secretary Colonel Cirilo  Velazquez, is very small compared with drug traffickers'  potential.</p>

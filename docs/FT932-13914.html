			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Ropner shows 27% decline to Pounds 3.82m Ropner, the Co Durham-based engineering, property and shipping group, reported profits before tax of Pounds 3.82m for the 1992 year on turnover of Pounds 15.5m. The outcome, struck after exceptional profits of Pounds 422,000, represented a 27 per cent decline on last time's profits of Pounds 5.27m after exceptional credits of Pounds 805,000. Turnover in 1991 amounted to Pounds 14.6m. Directors said that difficult trading conditions and the impact of recession had shown 'little sign of abatement'. There were, however, the 'first glimmerings' of a property revival but no marked increase in demand for the group's engineering products. Earnings per share emerged at 11p, down from 15.8p; the recommended final distribution is held at 4.75p, maintaining the total for the year at 8.25p.</p>

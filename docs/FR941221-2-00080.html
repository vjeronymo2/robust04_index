			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Purpose of the Demonstration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Projects funded through this solicitation are to provide reemployment and retraining services_as described in sections 314(c) and 314(d) of JTPA_to non-managerial workers at risk of dislocation in the health care industry. The goals of this retraining program are to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) assist workers faced with dislocation to qualify for and secure new jobs in the most efficient and cost effective manner; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) provide assistance that is integral to necessary conversion of health care facilities in an effort to reduce or prevent closure or mass layoff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this demonstration is to test early intervention for non-managerial health care workers whose jobs are being eliminated in order to qualify them for better jobs with their current employer or to increase their mobility within the health care industry, in increasing demand occupations, as an administratively feasible alternative for responding to worker dislocation resulting from broad restructuring in the health care industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

Grantees will be expected to make available participant records and access to personnel, as specified by the evaluation contractor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, DOL will establish, for each demonstration project site, an oversight group made up of federal, State and substate staff. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Part II.

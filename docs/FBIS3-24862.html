The airport has also been occupied by  heavily armed soldiers. We have just received this news from an  AFP photographer who was on the scene.    Tension has remained high in the Burundi capital since  clashes broke out on Monday [31 January]. There is said to be  relative calm at the moment. The violence of the last two days  has claimed 46 lives, according to the latest toll from the  Burundi police.    This morning opposition parties met with the army high  command to ask the army to mediate in their talks with the  government on the appointment of a successor to assassinated  president Melchior Ndadaye.    Still on the subject of Burundi, the Organization of African  Unity is still unsure about sending troops to Burundi. An  advance group of 200 soldiers drawn from several African  countries was due to arrive in Burundi to protect the ministers  of the Kinigi government, but the operation has now been delayed  by the latest outbreak of violence.</p>

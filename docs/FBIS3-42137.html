North Korea never had a military nuclear programme. The  research in atomic energy was of an exclusively peaceful  character, he noted.    The ambassador said the former Soviet Union rendered  assistance to North Korea in various spheres. In those years,  Soviet specialists, including nuclear energy experts, worked in  the republic. However, now there are no Russian atomic experts  in North Korea.    According to Son Sung-pil, Japanese mass media are  initiators  of various fabrications on the topic. It is not by accident,  because "Japan has all the necessary components for creating  nuclear weapons," he said.    "It is quite possible that certain circles of that country  are interested that the world community's attention is attracted  by the fuss about the alleged threat from North Korea, using it  as a ground and excuse to create their own atomic bomb," the  ambassador stressed.</p>

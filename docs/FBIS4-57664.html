			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, </F> Mexican presidential candidate for the Party of the Democratic  Revolution, PRD, by unidentified station announcer in Mexico  City on 19 May from the "Outlook" newscast]    [Text] Regarding all the problems that have surfaced during  the last few days within the PRD [Party of the Democratic  Revolution] top leadership, we were able to speak briefly with  Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who interrupted his presidential  campaign to come to Mexico City for the agreements the National  Executive Committee takes to achieve party unity during these  very difficult moments in national politics. This is what PRD  presidential candidate Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas had to say.    [Begin recording] [Cardenas] Nothing that I know of, nothing  out of the ordinary. As far as I understand, we are working  normally.    [Announcer] Why did you recently say the media are  conducting  a smear campaign against you?    [Cardenas] Because this is the way we feel. I have noticed a  smear campaign in articles and in commentaries. I realize I am  only speaking in general terms, but more than one article seeks  to run down what the National Democratic Front may represent,  which is nominating me, and my own candidacy.    [Announcer] I ask because to generalize is indeed dangerous.  I suppose you are not referring to us, Radio ACIR?    [Cardenas] Not necessarily.    [Announcer] Engineer Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, yesterday you  denied alleged links with arms trafficking operations for the  anti-Sandinist contras, sponsored by the CIA in Mexico. There  is a book by Terry Reed and John Cummings entitled "Bush,  Clinton, and the CIA Involved," which implicates you in gun  running operations for the contras. Do you deny this and are  you suing these writers?    [Cardenas] Absolutely. I can also say this information  surfaced in Mexico several months ago and we now see that  various media, which one would have thought them to be serious,  are reprinting this.    [Announcer] Are you going to sue through foreign lawyers?    [Cardenas] We are going to seek consultation to see where we  stand. If a lawsuit is called for, we shall do just that.    [Announcer] PRD leader Heberto Castillo [as heard] said the  PRD's situation is very sensitive now and he mentions the  possibility of a substitute president or an acting president.  All this has to do with the case of Samuel Del Villar's as head  of Federal Electoral Institute. What can you tell us about this?    [Cardenas] I do not see any major problem. I believe this  represents the normal, in-house changes in a party where we  openly discuss things for all the public to observe. We do not  resolve our problems behind closed doors, but in the open. This  may seem odd for a political party.    [Announcer] Regarding this same topic, what will happen when  it comes down to a debate between a representative of your  party, the PRD, and the director of the electoral registry?    [Cardenas] It will probably take place. The party will have  to consider the terms of the debate, how will it take place, and  then decide who will represent the PRD. What is not acceptable  is that the Government Secretary should say who will represent  the PRD in such a debate. Samuel Del Villar or others may  possibly attend. The party's directorate will have to decide  this.    [Announcer] We were commenting in this "Outlook" newscast of  the ACIR Group that some political observers say that the true  issue in the PRD's is power squabbling between the several  groups that comprise the PRD. How do respond to this?    [Cardenas] I believe this is a mistaken outlook; there are  no  power quotas. All the main posts are already defined so there  can be no reason to argue.    [Announcer] I thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

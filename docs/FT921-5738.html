			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Honduras ends talks on forest project THE government of Honduras has abandoned talks with the Chicago-based paper company Stone Container over a controversial forestry project following protests led by environmentalists. The company was seeking a 40-year concession to exploit up to 1.6m hectares of pine forest and tropical woodlands in the undeveloped eastern province of La Mosquitia for the production of wood pulp for its US factories. The government's decision to scrap the deal, announced by the state forestry corporation head, Mr Porfirio Lobo, marks on unusual victory for public opinion in Honduras. A proposed agreement, signed last September, had been widely criticised following leaks of its contents. Its cancellation leaves a question mark over the Honduran government's forest policy. Opponents also included the National Association of Industrialists and the Association of Sawmill operators, concerned that the agreement flouted a 1974 law requiring 51 per cent Honduran participation in forest enterprises. Stone launched a publicity campaign at the end of January, arguing that it would use environmentally sound labour-intensive logging techniques and reforest areas which have been destroyed by migrant 'slash and burn' farmers. The government attempted to negotiate a supplementary contract to meet protestors' points. But the administration of President Rafael Callejas, facing the run-up to the 1993 presidential elections, finally decided to wash its hands of the affair, declaring that a 90-day deadline had been reached without agreement on the supplementary contract.</p>

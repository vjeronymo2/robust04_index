			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Foreign Affairs: Problem awaiting a solution - After the Gulf war, the west can no longer afford to regard Turkey as an insoluble difficulty President Turgut Ozal must be furious. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait last August, he has acted with bold and imaginative statesmanship, going against the tide of Turkish public opinion to secure long-term strategic advantages for his country. He used the crisis to reassert not only Turkey's strategic importance to the west, but also its credentials as a European state. He called for democracy in Iraq, and took steps to remove some anti-democratic clauses in the Turkish constitution - notably those banning parties based on group interests and banning press publications in languages (such as Kurdish) that are forbidden by law. Even more remarkably, Mr Ozal invited Iraqi Kurdish leaders to Ankara, where they were told by senior foreign ministry officials that the president would support a federal solution for Iraq, giving autonomy to the Kurdish and Turkmen minorities. There were even hints that he was contemplating something similar in Turkey itself, as a way to isolate and defeat the violent separatism of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan. Perhaps most remarkably of all, Mr Ozal has established direct and friendly ties with Soviet Armenia. This week, as if to cap all these efforts, Mr Ozal publishes the English edition of his book, Turkey in Europe and Europe in Turkey. Alas, the actions of his local subordinates on the Iraqi frontier have ruined the effect. The dominant images of the past few weeks, as far as western public opinion is concerned, have been those of Turkish soldiers barring the road to Kurdish refugees, beating and even shooting them. Finally, in a spectacular public relations own goal typical of Middle Eastern rather than modern European governments, the authorities in south-east Turkey arrested and expelled a leading British journalist who had reported, on the evidence of British and American servicemen, that Turkish soldiers were looting refugee supplies. Clearly Turkey has a long way to go before public opinion in western Europe will be persuaded that it is a country eligible for EC membership. Many Turks recognise this, including (privately at least) some of those whose difficult task it is to represent the Turkish government in other European capitals. 'We have to solve our own problems first,' they say. 'But if we succeed, by 2000 it will be Europe knocking on Turkey's door, not the other way round.' That second part of the proposition remains hard to swallow. Perhaps by then Turkey's high growth rate - 9.2 per cent last year - will have significantly narrowed the gap between its purchasing power and the EC average, at present a ratio of roughly one to three. Perhaps the birth rate will have begun to fall. (But hardly enough to change the expectation that Turkey will 'eventually have a bigger population than any Community member state', to which the European Commission referred with some alarm in its avis on Turkey's membership application in December 1989.) Perhaps Turkish inflation - 60 per cent last year - will have been brought under control. Perhaps public opinion in western Europe will by then have grasped the economic case for opening the EC labour market to able-bodied people from relatively backward countries, willing to do the low-paid jobs that no longer find indigenous takers, and able, through their social security contributions, to support the growing number of old age pensioners. Perhaps the prejudice with which so many west Europeans currently regard their Moslem fellow-citizens will have been so far overcome that they will welcome a Moslem country as a leading member of the EC. ('To embrace Turkey,' says Mr Ozal's book, 'Europe's view of her own history will need to be as secular and universal as ours is.') Perhaps the Cyprus problem will have been solved, and Greece will therefore have lifted the veto it currently imposes even on the release of agreed EC aid to Turkey, let alone Turkish membership. Perhaps freedom of expression and association will have been guaranteed to all Turkish citizens, including those who campaign by non-violent methods for Kurdish independence; and perhaps the humanitarian standards of Turkish soldiers and policemen will be no worse than those of their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. (There are signs, unfortunately, that this convergence is occurring from both sides.) All the above developments are highly desirable. Few of them are very likely. The first two may not be more than marginally affected either way by government decisions. The others require, as a necessary if not sufficient condition, determined action by public authorities - some in Turkey, some in the EC, some in both. Up to now the general west European attitude has been to regard Turkey as an insoluble problem, but one which could safely be left unsolved, especially once the decline of the Soviet threat seemed to reduce its strategic importance. The Gulf war, and Turkey's role in it, have made that attitude more difficult to sustain. They have led, among other things, to renewed US pressure on Europe to accommodate Turkey. 'Turkey has earned the right to join the EC,' an article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs boldly asserts. More immediately, the US wishes to see Turkey, as an important member of Nato, included in any attempt to organise a 'European pillar' of the Atlantic Alliance, for instance through the Western European Union. This pressure is hotly resented by those, such as the French government, who wish WEU to develop, if at all, as an arm of the future European Political Union rather than of Nato. They hope to see WEU membership sooner or later coincide with that of the EC, and they do not regard the membership of these European bodies as being any business of the US. Britain, by contrast, opposes any expansion of WEU membership for the time being, and especially any suggestion that Greece be admitted while Turkey is kept out. Europeans are right to feel their institutions should not be treated as mere adjuncts of Nato, but wrong if that leads them to ignore Turkey's role in a European 'defence identity' which seems likely to be called on to manifest itself, if anywhere, in the Middle East and/or the Balkans. Turkey's views should be taken seriously in any discussion of future European security arrangements, and the question of its relationship to the future European Union cannot be left to fester. Hard though it is to believe that all the obstacles to Turkish EC membership could be removed within the next nine years, that does not mean we should wait nine years before even attempting to solve them. A more positive approach would be an open-ended negotiation on all the issues. In this, Turkey and the EC together would seek to define the long-term relationship that would best suit both their interests; the stages by which it could be reached; and the conditions to be fulfilled before proceeding from one stage to the next. Perhaps, as with economic and monetary union among the 12, they should also assign a target date or deadline to each successive stage. Geographically speaking, Turkey is in eastern Europe; and for Turks, as for other east Europeans, membership of the EC is not a purely economic matter. It is the anchor by which they hope to attach themselves to the democratic industrialised world. If western Europe were to say 'yes' unconditionally the device would not work. Happily there is no danger of that. But it will fail equally certainly, and perhaps disastrously, if western Europe shows no interest and has nothing to offer.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Cummins in profit at halfway stage CUMMINS Engine, the world's biggest independent manufacturer of diesel engines, yesterday consolidated its return to the black by unveiling underlying second-quarter net earnings of Dollars 17.5m, or 93 cents a share. Earnings in the latest quarter were distorted by an extraordinary gain and the cumulative effect of accounting changes which brought the company's net income to Dollars 22.4m, or Dollars 1.22. In the same period of 1991, Cummins suffered a net loss of Dollars 17.2m, or Dollars 1.29. Sales in the three months rose 8 per cent to Dollars 948.1m from Dollars 877.6m. During the latest quarter, Cummins completed the sale of 2.3m shares of common stock with proceeds of Dollars 126.5m, most of which will be used to retire debt. Cummins said its gross margins improved in the second quarter thanks to increased volumes. The company said its results were also helped by cost-cutting and lower product coverage costs. Sales in the latest quarter were boosted by strong demand for both its heavy-duty and mid-range engines. Cummins expects North American heavy duty truck engine sales of about 120,000 units for the year, provided the economy does not deteriorate. Cummins controls about 38 per cent of that market. Looking to the third quarter, it said results would be influenced by volumes for which the outlook was uncertain, given the continued concern about the strength of the economic recovery. For the first half of 1992, Cummins had net income of Dollars 31m, or Dollars 1.70 on sales of Dollars 1.83bn. A year earlier, the company suffered a net deficit of 27 cents a share on sales of Dollars 1.69bn. There was little reaction on Wall Street to the figures, and shares in Cummins added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 66 1/2 in light mid-morning trading.</p>

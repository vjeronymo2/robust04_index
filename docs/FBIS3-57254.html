From this, plant growing dropped 5 percent and  cattlebreeding  declined 22 percent.    The production of grain and sugar beet reduced 18 percent  and  30 percent, respectively, over the last two years.    The total yield of potatoes and vegetables, however, is on  the rise. It increased for at least one-third because of the  expanding areas sown with these crops.    Farmers owned 90 percent (71 percent in 1991) potato  planting  areas and 95 percent (65 percent in 1991) vegetable sowing and  planting areas.    The total amount of meat produced in 1993 was 281,000 tons,  or 76 percent, the total amount of milk was 1,219,000, or 82  percent, the total amount of eggs 387,000,000, or 65 percent,  compared with 1992.</p>

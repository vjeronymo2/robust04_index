			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / US trade deficit narrows to Dollars 9.7bn in August The US trade deficit for goods and services narrowed 13 per cent to Dollars 9.7bn in August from Dollars 11.2bn in July, but the merchandise trade deficit was the second largest since July 1987 at Dollars 14.3bn, though down 10 per cent from Dollars 15.9bn in July. US exports of aircraft and capital goods helped boost foreign sales of goods and services for the month to a record Dollars 59.8bn, up from Dollars 56.3bn in July. Imports rose too, but more slowly, from Dollars 67.5bn to almost Dollars 69.6bn. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said substantial jumps in exports of aircraft, motor vehicles and parts were 'rebounds from unusually low levels in July related to planned shut-downs in some aircraft and auto plants.' He said the growth trend in exports 'reflects both the underlying competitiveness of the US export sector and accelerating recoveries in some of our major trading partners. In particular, our goods trade deficit with Western Europe declined by Dollars 748m in August.' For the first eight months of 1994, the trade deficit rose by 51 per cent over the same period a year ago - from Dollars 47.76bn to Dollars 72bn. Any significant improvement will require a narrowing of the bilateral deficit with Japan. Instead, the gap has continued to rise, hitting Dollars 41.9bn during the first eight months of the year, compared with Dollars 37bn during the same period of last year. US officials have been warning Japan for months the deficits are 'politically unacceptable.' Any slowdown in the US economy next year could produce calls for import curbs on Japan from the new Congress. Mr Lawrence Chimerine, chief economist with Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank, attributed the rise to record volumes of imports and 'only a limited acceleration' of US exports to Japan. 'Earlier predictions of a decline were incorrect because they did not factor in that the US cannot produce many of the products it buys from Japan and that Japanese companies are not raising dollar prices in proportion to the strong yen,' he said. Deficits were also recorded with China (Dollars 3.2bn) and western Europe (Dollars 1.6bn). Merrill Lynch economists yesterday predicted improvement, saying: 'Europe and Japan are coming out of their slumps and should grow faster than the US next year for the first time since 1990. That should lead to rising US net exports and a shrinking US current account deficit.'</p>

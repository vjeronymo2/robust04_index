			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Personal View: What a difference a decade makes The world is full of free advice for the Bundesbank these days, most of it encouraging a much sharper drop in interest rates. The critics argue that the German economy is in recession and that the Bundesbank's tight monetary policy poses a risk not only for Germany but for the rest of Europe too. This may be true, but the Bundesbank's cautious, measured approach is still the best policy. Many in the markets expect a repeat of the experience of August 1982 to March 1983, when the Bundesbank cut interest rates sharply and quickly. During this period the discount rate fell from 7.5 to 4.0 per cent, which, at 50 basis points a month, was twice the rate of decline seen from September 1992 to the present (even with the larger-than-expected repo rate cut in April). But the comparison of these two periods is misleading because the economic climate in Germany was strikingly different in 1982-83. First, inflation was clearly headed downward; the surge in commodity prices that led to high inflation in 1980-81 was being reversed in 1982. Also, the strength of the D-Mark helped the situation. In trade-weighted terms, the currency was up about 9 per cent in summer 1982 relative to a year earlier. It rose another 6 per cent by spring 1983. Accordingly, import price inflation dropped to 1.5 per cent in 1982 from 14 per cent in 1981. Consumer price inflation peaked at 7.4 per cent in late 1981, and then fell to under 3 per cent by the end of 1983. Germany's current 4.2 per cent inflation rate is not due to international commodity price gains. Import prices have fallen since 1989. Instead, higher wages, service prices, rents and indirect taxes have been the main contributors to inflation. While wage growth and perhaps service-sector inflation will slow this year, rents and indirect taxes continue to rise. If the Bundesbank were to ease rapidly and let the D-Mark fall, imported commodity price inflation would compound the domestic inflation problem. A second difference between the early 1980s and today is German fiscal policy. In 1982 and 1983, in spite of the weak state of the economy and the loss of a half million jobs during 1981, the government cut real government expenditures and raised indirect taxes. As a result, the public deficit declined from a 1981 peak of almost 5 per cent of GNP to about 3 per cent in 1983. This helped to provide a framework in which interest rates could be cut radically. The same cannot be said of the present fiscal stance. Following recently agreed tax increases, the public-sector deficit is expected to improve from this year's 7 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent by 1995. But that figure is still high, and therefore the Bundesbank is understandably reluctant to cut short-term interest rates aggressively. The current account deficit compounds the problem by making Germany dependent on foreign capital inflows. Hence there must be a credible policy framework to attract foreign investors. In contrast, the current account went from deficit in 1981 to surplus in 1982. Another difference from 10 years ago is the structure of interest rates  - both inside and outside Germany. The current German yield curve offers relatively low-cost financing at the long end. The private sector has responded by increasing its use of lower cost long-term financing. This partially mitigates the impact of high short-term interest rates on the private sector. By contrast, in summer 1982 when the easing cycle began, the German yield curve was flat at around the 9 per cent level, meaning that real interest costs were much higher at the long end of the yield curve. When the Bundesbank finished easing in 1983, 10-year bond yields were 300 basis points higher than three-month money rates. In the second half of 1982, the US Federal Reserve slashed the Federal Funds rate, allowing the Bundesbank to cut rates without putting extreme pressure on the D-Mark. This alleviated the fear of adding to imported inflation when cutting German rates. Currently there is little prospect of further cuts in US rates, so as the Bundesbank brings down German rates it will become cheaper to sell D-Marks for dollars. Thus, cautious cuts are the best way to protect the external value of the German currency. Finally, it must be remembered that central banks have essentially only one instrument with which to affect the markets - the level of overnight interest rates. With but one instrument to work with, it is not possible to move toward two targets. Anyone who expects the Bundesbank to ignore its own domestic concerns by cutting interest rates sharply so as to stimulate other European economies is likely to be disappointed.

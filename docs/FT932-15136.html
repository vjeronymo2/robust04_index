			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Teachers give strong backing to test boycott THE second-largest teaching union, the NASUWT, yesterday underlined its commitment to boycotting all tests for assessing pupils on the national curriculum. Delegates to its annual conference in Bournemouth unanimously endorsed a motion upholding the total boycott which the union had already announced. The motion stated that 'the resentment of teachers against their existing heavy workload' would be 'greatly exacerbated by the miserable salary award made to teachers for 1992-93'. The confirmation of the boycott on tests adds to the pressure on the government to abandon the tests for this year. The move follows votes last week by the other two leading teachers' unions, the NUT and the ATL, to ballot members on similar action. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NASUWT general secretary, yesterday stepped up the union's opposition to the government's education reforms when he produced a pile of documents for the national curriculum which he said ran to 8,085 pages. He told the conference: 'I don't know what more evidence we have to present to the world that the system is fundamentally flawed and that Mr Patten must act not next year but now.' The leadership, however, suffered a defeat on the issue of school league tables and examination results at the hands of its delegates who voted for a harder line. The executive was defeated when delegates declined to back a commitment to present strong alternative league tables to the Department for Education - which would have taken additional factors into account - in favour of outright opposition to league tables. There was applause when one delegate told the conference that co-operating with the tables would mean 'giving future league tables the legitimacy now denied to them by almost every leading commentator'.</p>

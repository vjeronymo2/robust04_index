			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: NatWest There are echoes of old follies in National Westminster's decision to spend Dollars 500m on Citizens First Bancorp. At nearly 2.5 times net assets, the price looks high. If NatWest itself were trading on the same multiple of book, its price would be nearer 800p than 472p. It thus looks vulnerable to the accusation of paying through the nose to build up its US business. But that does not necessarily warrant yesterday's 3 per cent slide in its share price. In the group context this is a small deal which will add only around 1 per cent to total assets. Citizens will enhance NatWest Bancorp's distribution network and bring useful efficiency gains. Because of that it may have been worth paying a little over the odds. Still NatWest is buying when US bank earnings are at a cyclical high. The acquisitions trail would have been cheaper a couple of years ago, although it was then still wrestling with its own problems in the US. Nor is the strategic relevance clear. The wholesale business of NatWest Markets requires a US presence but retail banking need not be global. The diversification argument has lost credibility given the simultaneous impact of the recession on both sides of the Atlantic. The justification must be that NatWest can see a high return in the US. That may be possible at the moment, but relative returns may look less favourable once UK provisions are back to normal. NatWest Bancorp will then have to sweat harder given the price paid for Citizens.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / US and EU push for Gatt breakthrough: Brittan prepared to work through the night The US and European Union will today attempt a breakthrough in the Gatt world trade talks, amid fresh signs that France is prepared to soften its hardline stance toward a deal. Senior officials in Brussels said that Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's chief trade negotiator, remained ready to negotiate 'through the night' with Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, with the aim of producing a draft accord within the next 48 hours. The Brittan-Kantor talks in Brussels are widely viewed as the last chance for the Europeans and Americans to resolve their differences in time for the December 15 deadline for a comprehensive deal among the more than one hundred governments that are party to the talks. Amid a flurry of last-minute diplomacy, Sir Leon has made clear that the EU will not accept a deal unless the US meets specific demands covering agriculture, the audiovisual sector, and the aeronautics industry - a reference to US objections to European subsidies for Airbus Industrie. As a result, Mr Eduard Balladur, prime minister, this week shelved earlier threats to veto a deal and signalled he was ready to sign an agreement, if 'French national interests are protected'. The more flexible line from Paris also follows high-level warnings from Germany and the UK that failure to reach a Gatt agreement would jeopardise prospects for an economic recovery in Europe and risk splitting the European Union. Brussels officials said Sir Leon intended to push for a comprehensive draft accord with Mr Kantor, in order to submit the outline agreement to a special meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow. This would allow EU governments and parliaments to have a chance to assess the deal before it could be initialled on December 15. The Kantor-Brittan talks will cover a broad market access package for goods and services, the creation of a Multilateral Trade Organisation (MTO) to resolve trade disputes, and a new steel industry regime. Separately, Mr Rene Steichen, European Commissioner responsible for agriculture, will meet Mr Mike Espy, US agriculture secretary, to discuss possible 'clarifications' to the November 1992 EU-US Blair House accord which limits farm export subsidies. France has threatened to veto a Gatt deal unless it obtains alterations to the Blair House accord, possibly through more flexible treatment of food stocks and a reordering of the timetable for reductions in cereal export subsidies. Sir Leon Brittan hinted last week that the Clinton administration might agree to changes in Blair House. Trade experts in Brussels said yesterday that France could also be mollified if it could exclude the sensitive audiovisual sector from a Gatt deal and obtain assurances that the US intends to curbing unilateral action in trade disputes. This could be achieved either through a strong MTO or through new measures beefing up the EU's anti-dumping procedures.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / The FT500 (13): Pride dented as corrections accelerate - Europe's top employers must come to grips with the need to cut costs if they are to retain their competitiveness and high rankings in the league tables / Germany GERMAN industry's high ranking among the world's leading employers has long been viewed as a source of pride. The creation of new jobs has traditionally been seen as an affirmation that the unwritten social contract between capital, people and government - cornerstone of national economic success - is still working in time-honoured fashion. But times and attitudes are changing. Massive corrections are under way. All eight of the German groups featured in the list of Europe's top 25 employers have in the past few months announced or accelerated unprecedented job-cutting programmes. Daimler-Benz provided the most telling instance: 12,000 jobs lost last year and a further 28,000 to go by the end of 1994. Similar projects are planned across the the manufacturing sector, where, according to the Arthur D. Little consultancy, there is ample scope for a 10 per cent overall reduction in payrolls. One reason for the cuts, which is expected to boost unemployment by 400,000 this year, lies in the relatively short-term aim of moderating the impact of recession on company results. Other recent reactions to the economic downturn, which has idled almost 20 per cent of west German manufacturing capacity and sent business confidence to its lowest level since 1982, include cuts in planned capital spending of 7 per cent for 1993. Longer-term, however, German industry at all levels appears to be coming to grips with the realisation that if it is to retain its competitiveness and its high rankings in the overall international league tables, it has to do more to reduce its costs and keep them down. If there were any remaining doubts, they were dispelled towards the end of the year when Klockner-Werke, a high-cost, under-sized steel and engineering group laden with DM2.7bn debts, was driven to seek protection from its creditors in the bankruptcy courts. Arguably the most constructive step in long-term savings strategies last year was the laboured but ultimately successful takeover of Hoesch by Krupp. The merger of two of Germany's grandest steel and engineering companies, according to Mr Gerhard Cromme, head of Krupp, will unleash synergistic savings running into hundreds of millions of D-Marks a year. The international steel industry has since tumbled into a cyclical-recessionary slump but this is more likely to delay rather than diminish the benefits foreseen by Mr Cromme. Similar changes are being wrought lower down the corporate scale. Independent machine tool manufacturers such as Gildemeister, Maho, Deckel and Taub, although so far fighting shy of mergers, have pooled their international sales, distribution and service networks in an effort to cut losses. Meanwhile, the number of business insolvencies rose last year for the first time since 1985 to 9,500 and is forecast to hit 12,000 in 1993. This latter tendency has not gone unnoticed by Germany's banks. Most of the larger operators improved profits and their standing in the European league last year, as they enjoyed the last months of the unification boom, but all remarked that the risks from bad debts were mounting. A senior executive at BHF Bank, which enjoyed a 17 per cent increase in 10-month profits, spoke of a 'sword of Damocles'. Deutsche Bank, which reported a disappointing 5 per cent fall in 10-month operating earnings after a 3.2 per cent decline after six months, had already warned that because it was by far the biggest bank in Germany its results would show the effects of the economic downturn sooner than the rest. But it fell to Daimler-Benz to illustrate just how dramatic and how sudden the slump was. The group, which encompasses flagship brands Mercedes-Benz, Deutsche Aerospace and AEG, announced out of the blue in November (after the cut-off date for compilation of the FT500) that due to unexpected circumstances, 1992 profits would fall by around 25 per cent. Since then short-range expectations for most sectors' performance have been downgraded accordingly. Deutsche Bank Research, for example, recently revised its forecast of an average fall of 0.5 per cent in corporate earnings this year to more than 3 per cent - a figure which concealed a decline of 9 per cent among manufacturers. Yet in spite of the gathering gloom, there are still voices to be heard which insist that the present mood among business leaders does not properly reflect actual conditions. They say that while confidence has been hit by the threat of recession, it was unjustifiably high in the first place. Optimism had been inflated by the early surge in demand which followed unification and the related hopes that the collapse of the communist empires further east would bring immediate and incalculable benefits to German business. These voices of reason talk of a 'correction' and 'normalisation' of market conditions and corporate expectations. Although companies are reducing their spending plans and their workforces, they are cutting from an extraordinarily high levels. Total capital investment in Germany this year is still expected to reach a new nominal record of DM300bn: high by any standards at just under 10 per cent of gross domestic product. This compares with an annual average of 8 per cent of GDP in the second half of the 1980s, a period when German companies were enthralled by the prospect of the European single market, and when more than 3m new jobs were created. Despite current weaknesses, most businesses are well equipped with new plant and ready to feed the economic recovery expected later this year in its key export markets. As a recent analysis from the Bayerische Hypo Bank said: 'After almost a decade of relative prosperity, the recession looming on the horizon will not be a serious disaster for most German companies'. Even though it was slow to focus on the true picture, business is coming to grips with the painful and awkward process of 'correction', and there are some signs that the other parties to Germany's social contract are making the necessary adjustments. Overshadowed by the real threat of even more job losses, recent pay negotiations and settlements have been calm, swift and modest in marked contrast to last year's upheavals and inflationary pay-offs. Government has so far been less successful. With no signs of self-generating economic recovery in the former GDR, Bonn confronts the prospect of multi-billion D-Mark transfers for years to come. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl has yet to convince the electorate that his cost-sharing 'solidarity pact' between state, regions, business and unions is needed if unification is to succeed. As the Bayerische Hypo Bank report noted: 'The financial consequences of . . . German unification could prove even more onerous than they have been until now. It will be necessary to bring about a conciliation of interests between social groups, and for these groups to adjust their demands to the economy's real capacity, as moderation is the best guarantee of an early return to the growth path.' Realisation of a solidarity pact will demand sacrifices and concessions far greater than those so far extracted by companies from their workers. But without them there is a danger that as the rest of the world makes its way back on to the track of economic growth, Germany could be left floundering in a social, political and economic mess entirely of its own making.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         EUROPE'S BIGGEST EMPLOYERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank                                                 Top 500 1992  1991   Company                    Cntry   Sec   Rank   Employees  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1      2     Siemens                     Ger    541     8     402000 2      1     Daimler-Benz                Ger    401    13     381511 3      4     Unilever plc/NV             Nuk    451     4     298000 4      3     Fiat                        Ita    401    94     287957 5      6     Volkswagen                  Ger    401    87     267009 6      5     Philips                     Net    541   101     240001 7      7     BT                           UK    223     3     219000 8      9     ABB Asea Brown Boveri     Swe/i    541    40     214399 9     10     Alcatel Alsthom             Fra    533    17     213100 10     8     BAT Industries               UK    171     9     212316 11    11     Nestle                      Swi    451     5     201139 12    12     Generale des Eaux           Fra    221    42     198550 13    13     Hoechst                     Ger    622    45     179332 14    14     Bayer                       Ger    622    34     166325 15    15     Peugeot                     Fra    401    84     156800 16    16     Thyssen                     Ger    633   131     148557 17    18     Michelin                    Fra    574   107     135610 18    20     Royal Dutch/Shell           Nuk    212     1     135000 19    17     Electrolux                  Swe    402   195     134229 20    24     STET                        Ita    171   138     129936 21    22     Imperial Chemical Industries UK    622    28     128600 22    21     BASF                        Ger    622    56     128105 23    23     British Aerospace            UK    523   464     123200 24           Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez    Fra    221    89     122929 25    25     Mannesmann                  Ger    566    96     122305  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

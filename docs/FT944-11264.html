			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Amsterdam After a good set of company results last week, attention now turns to the two Anglo-Dutch heavyweights, Royal Dutch and Unilever, quoted both in London and Amsterdam, writes John Pitt. Hoare Govett said it was broadly neutral toward energy stocks, and was targeting an oil price of Dollars 16.70 a barrel for Brent by the end of this year, rising to Dollars 17.30 by the end of 1995. While Royal Dutch would benefit from its announced redundancy plans in Europe, as well as the recovery in the chemicals sector overall, the broker said that while the stock looked reasonable value against the market, it did not expect it to outperform a rising market. Hoare was more positive on Unilever, and recommended taking a buy position since the current low valuation was primarily the result of 'negative sentiment with no material impact on fundamental results'.</p>

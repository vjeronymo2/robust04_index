			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Spheres of influence There is a new world order, after all. It is not the one most people imagined when President George Bush used the phrase in 1990 to elevate the struggle against Saddam Hussein of Iraq. But it is based, in one respect, on the precedent set by that struggle. When the United Nations Security Council decided that force should be used to liberate Kuwait, it did not follow the letter of the UN Charter, under which member states should have made armed forces available to the Council itself, so that it could 'take such action by air, sea or land forces as may be necessary'. Instead, the Council authorised member states to use 'all necessary means' to enforce its earlier resolutions; and an ad hoc coalition of member states did so, under US command. A similar formula was used in 1992, when the US went into Somalia; and last week an identical carte blanche was given for an invasion of Haiti. In both cases a two-stage operation was envisaged: first a swift, muscular intervention 'authorised' by the Security Council but carried out by 'member states', in other words the US acting with or without allies; second, a more traditional and longer-term peacekeeping operation under UN command. In Somalia the US initially joined in the second stage, but kept its 'Quick Reaction Force' under separate command - a formula which caused maximum confusion and ended in disaster last October. The UN force is still there, but without US participation. In Haiti it appears the US does not intend to take part in the second stage at all. The Somali experience seems to have convinced the Clinton administration that US ground troops should not be deployed as peacemakers or peacekeepers outside the western hemisphere in situations where they are likely to come under fire. Comprehensive peace They are deployed preventively in Macedonia; they have been offered for Bosnia if, and only if, the parties accept a comprehensive peace agreement; and now they have been sent to Rwanda and Zaire in a strictly humanitarian role which, as Defence Secretary William Perry has been at pains to emphasise, will not include peacekeeping. Meanwhile, in June, the Security Council authorised France to intervene in Rwanda in a role closely analogous to the US role in Somalia, and to what will be the US role in Haiti if the invasion goes ahead: a quick 'in and out' operation, intended to create conditions in which a UN peacekeeping force can deploy, and to hold the line until that force arrives. Embittered by its experience in Bosnia, France insisted on acting on its own in Rwanda and is not willing to leave any troops as part of the UN force there. Troubling development And in July the Council gave a formal UN blessing to the Russian army's presence in Georgia. This is a deeply troubling development. Although the Georgian government now accepts the Russians as 'peacekeepers', it did so only after suffering severe defeats at the hands of Russian-assisted Abkhazian separatists, and when it desperately needed Russian help against supporters of the ousted Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdjia. The price paid for this help included agreement to join the Commonwealth of Independent States, which Georgia had previously refused. Thus Russia transparently exploited conflicts within Georgia to bring that country back under its control, and the UN has now effectively ratified the deal. It is no secret that the Russians insisted on this before agreeing to support the Haiti resolution. A clear pattern thus emerges. The permanent members of the Security Council, scalded by their experience in Bosnia and Somalia, are increasingly reluctant to deploy their forces under UN command. Instead each is willing to act only where it conceives its national interest or prestige to be at stake, and then looks to its colleagues on the Council for a UN rubber stamp. This is a travesty of the Charter and is bound to cause increasing resentment among other UN members. If the permanent members are to live up to their responsibilities they must be prepared to put their forces genuinely at the UN's disposal, rather than using the UN to ratify their division of the world into spheres of influence.</p>

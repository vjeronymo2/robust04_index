			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Rifkind joins privacy campaign The furore over the recent resignation of Air Marshal Sir Peter Harding as chief of defence staff has won an influential convert to the cause of privacy legislation. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has decided that the government should push for privacy laws even if it risks a head-on clash with the press. Mr Rifkind is understood to think the security angle used by some newspapers to justify dwelling on the affair is preposterous. The government has been determined for some time to introduce criminal offences for electronic eavesdropping and the use of long-range lenses to take photographs on private property. These would apply to everyone, and not just to journalists. But its original timetable has been subject to numerous delays. It could be summer before a white paper is published - nearly a year after it was promised. The prime minister may, however, decide not to include new privacy measures in the 1994-95 legislative timetable, in line with a strategy of shelving radical legislation being urged on him by an influential group of cabinet ministers. Sir Peter resigned earlier this month after a newspaper alleged that he was having an affair with the former wife of a retired Conservative politician.</p>

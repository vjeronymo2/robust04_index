			<p>BFN     [Text] On the issue of North Korean nuclear arms  development, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa stressed on 29 April  that Japan needs to "deal with the situation within the scope of  the Constitution." At the same time, he disclosed his view that  Japan needs to give logistics support to the U.S. military  should the United Nations decide to impose economic sanctions  against North Korea. Moreover, on the government's  interpretation--which prohibits the use of the right of  collective self-defense--of the Constitution, Kakizawa said:  "Will such an interpretation allow the Japan-U.S. security  treaty to function well in dealing with an emergency? The  people need to talk about it. It is about time for us to review  the issue." In this way, he disclosed his view that the people  should discuss interpretation of the Constitution in a direction  to approve the use of the right of collective self-defense. He  made these comments during an Asahi TV program.    Regarding the right of collective self-defense, Atsushi  Kanda, director general of the Defense Agency [DA], suggested on  28 April that there is a possibility that Japan may need to  change its interpretation of the Constitution. On how Japan  will deal with the North Korean issue, the ruling  coalition--while giving consideration to the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ], which attaches importance to the limit of  the Constitution--reached an agreement, saying, "Japan will be  prepared for an emergency situation within the scope of the  Constitution." However, ministers in charge of diplomatic and  security policies made comments one after another on the right  of collective self-defense. It seems that they made the remarks  to suggest a possibility that the Hata administration, following  the SDPJ's secession from the government, will start to review  the government's interpretation of the Constitution.</p>

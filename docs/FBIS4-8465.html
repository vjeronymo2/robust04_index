			<p>BFN     [Text] On 13 April 1994 Khristodhoulos Tsalikis, Greek  ambassador in Tirana, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and  was handed a note saying that owing to the lack of an agreement  on the necessary personnel of the diplomatic staff of the  Republic of Albania in Athens and the Republic of Greece in  Tirana, the Albanian side considers that these staffs should  each be reduced to six diplomats.    The Embassy of the Greek Republic in Tirana should take the  necessary measures to send home, within 10 days, all diplomatic  staff in excess of this number.</p>

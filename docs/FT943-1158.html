			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Management: Desert Island Manager - Elizabeth Esteve-Coll Elizabeth Esteve-Coll has been director of the Victoria and Albert, the UK's national arts and design museum, since 1988, where she has instituted wide management change. Before starting a career in librarianship and the arts, she sailed the world with her Spanish-born naval husband. You're allowed one item of office equipment besides telephone and fax. I can't function without my Filofax - its popper keeps busting because it's so full. How would you cope? Would you still try to run the V&amp;A, or would you leave the answerphone on? I'm quite self-sufficient and practical. I would try to keep in touch, but I would probably settle down to wallowing in peace and quiet. I do ring in to the V&amp;A nearly every day if I'm away, but I also realise that no one is indispensable. You find a footprint in the sand: whose would you hope it was? Francois Mitterrand has an amazing record of achievement both in the arts and politics. As French president, he has focused on cultural monuments and services, for which he will be remembered. He is also a very charming man. If you couldn't return, what would you regret? The V&amp;A has 20 1/2 acres of roof. Each year we get a bit done, and I would like to have got that finished. If you could retrieve one item from the V&amp;A collections as your ship went down, what would it be? Although it is not the most transcendental or beautiful thing in the museum, I'd like to have the Great Bed of Ware. Said to have held 26 people, it could be bed, shelter, life raft and even wildlife sanctuary. What would you miss most? I would miss staff and colleagues enormously - for their enthusiasm, passion and commitment. They are world experts and you learn something new every day. You can take a film, a book and some music. I'd take one of those wonderful multi-episode films. I love Marcel Pagnol's work - his early Marius and Fanny are favourites - or I would take Jewel In The Crown, as I love India. At last I would have time to finish reading A Suitable Boy by Vikram Seth, and I would want to listen to a Gregorian chant  -the Santo Domingo De Silos recording. What food would you like? Vast quantities of salad and very good oil, Spanish or Italian. How would you get about? On a fat, slow Dales pony. We could amble about the island, and I would get a good view as well as having a companion. What scheme would you spend your enforced leisure on? I could spend the time having great thoughts about French Romanesque sculpture, hypothesising on how the sculptures came to be where they are and who made them. I would sneak along my many photographs of sculptures, and papers on the subject.</p>

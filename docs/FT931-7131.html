			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Italy's 'honest party' trips up: La Malfa's plight is seen as poetic justice ONCE Mr Giorgio La Malfa learned yesterday he was under investigation for alleged illicit financing of his Republican party, he had little option but to resign from the leadership. Ever since Milan magistrates began investigations into political corruption a year ago, Mr La Malfa has sought to present the Republicans as 'the party of the honest'. In May he even boasted how the party was not involved. Some of Mr La Malfa's critics felt his being caught in the magistrates' investigatory net was a form of poetic justice. But Italian politics risked losing - albeit temporarily - one of the few national figures capable of renovating the moribund postwar party structure. Son of the long-time leader of the Republicans, Mr Ugo La Malfa, the 53-year-old economist has been in the forefront of those arguing for a shake-up of the traditional party system. His open manner, clear membership of a new generation and apparent personal integrity gave him an influence out all proportion to the size of the Republican party. His party won just 5 per cent of the vote in last April's general elections. The party's tradition as a stronghold of the Italian liberal intelligensia and its potential as a government coalition partner gave added weight to Mr La Malfa's position. He took over as party leader in 1987 and became the first Republican to break the postwar alliance with the ruling Christian Democrats. He refused to join the seventh Andreotti government in June 1991. This was done largely out of pique because the party was not offered the portfolios of its liking. Nevertheless, Mr La Malfa was able to represent this subsequently as a policy decision - cutting free from a discredited system of coalition government. Since then Mr La Malfa has effectively been in opposition, flirting with the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the populist Lombard League and dissidents in the Socialist and Christian Democrat parties such as Mr Mario Segni, the referendum movement leader. In these contacts he has sought to find a new and wider majority to rule during the current transition period with the specific task of introducing electoral reforms and supervising economic austerity. A minority within his party has challenged this oppositional role at a time of such national emergency. Well before his resignation the Republicans had begun to be implicated in the ever-widening corruption scandal. In particular a former Republican appointee on the board of Enel, the national electricity authority, has begun to make a series of damaging allegations about the latter's pay-offs to political parties, including the Republicans. These developments obliged Mr La Malfa to call a special party congress on March 12 to consider the party's involvement in political corruption and to seek a new endorsement for his mandate as party leader. Then last week Mr Giorgio Meddri, former political secretary of the party and a close friend, was arrested for allegedly receiving illegal funds for the Republicans. It is still uncertain whether the party will accept Mr La Malfa's resignation. But in the meantime the plight of Mr La Malfa, symbolising the progressive decapitation of the Italian political class by the corruption scandal, is likely to speed up discussion of ways to limit the scope of the magistrates' investigations. Mr Giovanni Conso, who became justice minister 12 days ago, said his ministry was working on proposals to tackle the phenomenon of corruption that took account of both the legal and politico-economic considerations at stake. He said it was vital to come up with a quick solution.</p>

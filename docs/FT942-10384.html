			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Consumers more self-reliant, says survey The emergence of 'self-reliant' consumers, more willing to take responsibility for their health and economic well being, is one of the principal trends identified by Mintel, the market research group, in a report reviewing social changes over the last 20 years. The past decade in particular has seen responsibility shift from the state to the individual, says the report. 'Council house sales, problems with the NHS, and the move away from state pensions have forced people to take more responsibility for their own lives and made them more confident in their ability to go private, or go it alone.' The change is reflected in the increased role of personal pensions and health insurance, as well as in personal transport, self-employment and home ownership, says the report. 'It is also evident in the move away from mass marketing and fashion. Today's consumer is more likely to make a choice based on their own style rather than current fashion or national norm,' says Mintel in its report. Spending has shifted away from goods towards services. In particular, there has been a decrease in spending on food, alcoholic drink and tobacco and an increase in spending on non-utility, especially leisure, services. Other large-scale lifestyle trends over the last 20 years identified by Mintel include: Greater interest and awareness of health issues, leading to reduced smoking and greater attention to healthy eating. Increased interest in environmental issues. Growth of the home as an increasingly important leisure centre. Increased individualism, leading to greater segmentation within consumer markets. Increased mobility, leading to greater use of superstores and out-of-town shopping centres. A growth in home and personal security because of rising crime. These changes mean that many areas of consumer spending growth that did not exist or were in an embryonic state 20 years ago are today taken for granted, says the report. These sectors include satellite TV, video recorders, home computers and the DIY superstore. Consumer Habits 1994. Mintel International Group, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE.

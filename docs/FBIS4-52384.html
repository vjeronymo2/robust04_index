			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Pang-hui] </F>   [Text] The ROK exported armored cars overseas in September  1993 for the first time. It sold 42 K200 armored cars, made by  Daewoo Heavy Industries, to Malaysia at $25 million. Modeled  after the U.S. FMC company's armored personnel carrier, this  armored car was developed in the early eighties, and served  Malaysia's peacekeeping troops in Bosnia as a capital armored  car.    The ROK began to export weapons full scale in 1974, but its  weapon exports were constantly under U.S. Government  supervision. In 1983, the ROK set its best record in exporting  weapons to third countries by selling $300 million worth of them  that year, but since then, arms sales have continued to decline  so that in the early nineties, the ROK finally stopped selling  weapons. ROK sale of M16 rifles to Indonesia without prior U.S.  knowledge put the ROK in a difficult situation with the United  States in 1983. A bigger incident, however, took place six  years later in 1989, when the ROK sold some defense industrial  supplies to Jordan. Despite the ROK's explanation that it sold  military uniforms, the United States held fast to its view that  the export item was software-related to precision weapons. This  incident resulted in a virtual suspension of weapon exports by  the ROK, which had previously ranked third for ten years among  in weapons exports by third world countries, including China.    The United States is checking ROK weapon exports based on  legal grounds in the Weapons Export Control Law and the  regulations on the international transportation of weapons.  These laws stipulate that the ROK should not sell weapons to a  third country without the United States' prior approval.  Although these laws have exceptions, getting prior approval  from the United States through diplomatic negotiations is very  complicated and not easy. While ROK national defense industrial  companies were able to export weapons with U.S. approval during  the period from 1981 to 1984, they have virtually been suspended  since 1985.    After fundamentally blocking the ROK from selling U.S.  weapons produced in the ROK to third countries, the United  States began to curb the ROK's export of weapons produced with  imported foreign technology or produced in cooperation with  foreign countries. The United States stipulated in contracts  with the ROK that the ROK not sell any weapon produced in the  country to other countries, and this has repressed ROK defense  industrial exports of not only such basic weapons as M16 and  various trench mortars, but also the ROK-type K1 tanks and  155-mm self-propelled guns, which have comparatively high  competitive strength.    To make matters worse, the United States demanded high  royalty fees for military technology that the ROK defense  industrial companies introduced unilaterally. At the 21st  annual ROK-U.S. security consultative meeting held in 1989 after  tiresome negotiations which began in 1984, the two governments  agreed to the ROK paying eight percent of the sale price as  royalty to the United States.    Although the ROK Government has asked the United States to  ease those regulations through various channels, this demand has  not been met because some U.S. munitions businesses regard ROK  defense industrial companies as their rivals and because the ROK  Government imposes dampers. An official with a domestic defense  industrial company said: "We stopped bringing up this  bothersome demand in 1990 when ROK weapon exports were virtually  suspended."    The only way out of this situation is to independently  develop ROK weapons for exports. We were able to export the ROK  armored cars in 1993 because the localization rate of the item  was almost 95 percent. However, Mun Chong-in, a political  science professor at the U.S. University of Kentucky, who is  well versed in the ROK-U.S. defense industrial cooperation,  said: "It is highly possible for the United States to raise the  issue of intellectual property rights in this case, too." That  is, the United States is likely to demand the protection of  intellectual property rights for U.S. parts and technology used  in manufacturing ROK-type armored cars. The imposition of  restrictions on the ROK's weapons exports to third countries  seems to be the most difficult issue in cooperation between the  ROK and the United States in the defense industry field.</p>

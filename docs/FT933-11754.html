			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Survey of Resource Management - Buying-in Services (3): Well pleased with progress - Profile: Sir Peter Levene, Efficiency Adviser PUTTING almost Pounds 1.5bn of work out to tender in a single year is an ambitious target in any large organisation. For the civil service, this 60-fold increase in its market-testing programme has required a step-change in the way it approaches the delivery of government services. Overseeing the change is Sir Peter Levene, the investment banker who acts as the prime minister's efficiency adviser. Sir Peter, 51, is deputy chairman of Wasserstein Perella, the US investment banking concern, and chairman of the Docklands Light Railway. He declares himself well pleased with progress in this first round of the current programme, which is due to be completed at the end of September. 'We got off to a slow start because of all the argy-bargy over the employment rights of civil servants whose jobs were contracted-out. And the process was foreign to many departments which had to learn how to do it. But people have now 'got the bit between their teeth' and are making progress. 'I really have no idea how much of the work is being contracted-out, since the tests are still going on. There is no doubt, however, that some very substantial contracts are being placed.' Sir Peter has also been pleased at the interest shown by the private sector in bidding for civil service work. A conference organised in January to attract private sector interest was so over-subscribed that it had to be repeated to accommodate the 1,200 business executives who wished to attend. However, there were a lot of misconceptions at the outset, according to Sir Peter. He is anxious to counteract the view that the market-testing programme is an attempt to contract-out large parts of civil service work. 'The programme asks whether work done by government departments could be done better by an outside body and whether the present team doing the work could come up with better ways of doing it. 'Armed with that information, you can then decide how to go forward - whether the work stays in house unchanged, or stays in house on a rather different basis, or an outside body does the work. 'The object of the exercise is to find the best way of doing the work. If it ends up being contracted out, that is one solution, but it's not the only one.' That may not be what many in the private sector want to hear. There is a feeling among some contractors that the way in which contracts have been parcelled up and the inside track enjoyed by the in-house team have loaded the dice too heavily against them. Sir Peter is unapologetic, however - 'when you launch a programme like this, departments which have little experience in it will make mistakes or have different approaches,' he says. If contractors believe that they could come up with a better solution under a different set of rules, they are free to do so, he adds. 'They shouldn't be afraid to put in a non-conforming bid. 'To be on the safe side, they should also put in a conforming bid and say that if the specification can be relaxed or changed in the following ways, they could bid in this more innovative way.' And if bidders have complaints about how the programme is being implemented, they should raise them with the department concerned - 'complain to the person running the programme, if necessary to the permanent secretary, if necessary to the minister,' he says. 'If you don't get any answer from them, tell us and we'll see what we can do. We can only learn by what people tell us.' 'Us' in this case is the six-strong Cabinet Office efficiency unit which co-ordinates the market-testing programme and advises departments on how to implement it. 'We deliberately have a small team at the centre because we don't want to run a huge centralised exercise removed from the people who actually understand the work. It's important that market-testing should be done by each department which understands the work - they must be masters of their own destiny.' Although he is based in the private sector, Sir Peter is no stranger to the ways of Whitehall. He was first brought in by Mr Michael Heseltine who, as defence secretary, appointed him as personal adviser in 1984. In 1985, he became Chief of Defence Procurement on a special contract said to be worth Pounds 100,000 a year which drew political fire from Labour MPs and disquiet among career civil servants. However, the effectiveness of the new procurement regime he put in place was increasingly recognised by the time he completed his contract in April 1991. As in the Defence department, Sir Peter has found that encouraging a more entrepreneurial approach has encouraged lateral thinking among civil servants - 'people are now saying that if they are 'given their head,' they can show us how to do the job better,' he says. 'The objective is to run the government's business in the most efficient way possible. 'Market-testing puts everything under the microscope and makes departments look very carefully at what they are doing. I think people are now beginning to understand that that is what it's about.'</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Cemetery managers call for right to reuse graves The government is under growing pressure to empower local authorities to disinter human remains and reuse graves as part of a national strategy to cope with the shortage of space in Britain's cemeteries. Under proposals drawn up by the Institute of Burial and Cremation Administration, authorities would be allowed to make room for new bodies in old graves by placing the original occupants' remains in new caskets and burying them deeper in the ground. Authorities would be able to do this on plots where 75 years had elapsed since the last interment. Living relatives would retain the right to renew their family's rights over the site for a further 75 years. The association, an organisation representing those responsible for managing the country's cemeteries and crematoria, plans later this year to research the public's response to its proposals. If it is favourable, the association expects to put its plan to government next year. It is not clear how ministers would react, but the idea has not been ruled out. Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish office minister, recently said: 'The reuse of graves would involve the disturbance of remains, which would be unacceptable to many people, and the implications would need careful and sensitive consideration.' According to Mr Ian Hussein, the association's national secretary, ministers would sooner or later have to face up to the issue of reusing graves because of a worsening problem with burial space in London and other large cities. He said three London boroughs were already unable to provide new graves. Others would run out of space over the next 35 years - a period in which he said Britain's annual death rate was projected to rise from about 650,000 to nearer 850,000. He said the proportion of people choosing burial as opposed to cremation or other methods had levelled off at about 30 per cent, after falling for many years. The proposals are designed to overcome a number of problems associated with cemeteries becoming full. If a cemetery stops staging new burials, for example, it loses its primary source of income. In addition, the less frequently old cemeteries are visited, the more they tend to become vulnerable to vandalism and dereliction. Mr Hussein said that local authority cemeteries in England and Wales already ran at an annual Pounds 60m deficit - which was funded ultimately out of local taxation. The practice of reusing graves is common throughout Europe and in Australia.</p>

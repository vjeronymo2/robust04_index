			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] "I am pleased to meet the  German people, President Weizsaecker, and my friend Helmut Kohl  with whom we are in constant touch by phone and letter," Russian  President Boris Yeltsin told ITAR-TASS at Cologne-Bonn airport  on arriving to pay an official visit to the FRG.    Speaking about the aims of his visit, Boris Yeltsin said,  "This is a planned visit. We have to assess the results of the  work that has been done during the year since my previous visit  to Germany in the political, economic, and social arenas. We  also have to discuss the withdrawal of Russian forces from  German territory." In this respect the Russian president  recalled that the final date for the pullout, "up to the last  soldier," has already been set as 31 August. "And we are  proceeding exactly to schedule," the president said.    B. Yeltsin pointed out that 38 major joint projects have  been  drawn up since his last visit to Bonn. "The time has come to  examine their implementation and also to discuss a couple of  dozen future joint projects." In addition, the Russian head of  state said, "We have to exchange views with the German  leadership on the political situation in Germany and Russia and  look at international issues, including flashpoints."    President Boris Yeltsin was met in the airport, bedecked  with  Russian and German state flags, by Heinrich Seimen [name as  transliterated], the head of the protocol department of the  German Foreign Ministry, and by Russian Ambassador to Germany  Vladislav Terekhov and his German counterpart Otto von der  Gablentz.    The automobile procession left the airport for the  government  guest house, Petersberg, where Boris Yeltsin will stay during  his visit.    The official ceremony of his welcome, with military honors,  will take place in the afternoon at Villa Hammerschmidt, the  Bonn residence of the FRG federal president.</p>

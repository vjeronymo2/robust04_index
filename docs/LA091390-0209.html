			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> DEAD RINGER: Nowadays, who would hire a lobbyist who looks just like Saddam  Hussein? Lots of people, hopes Jerry Haleva, above, longtime aide to former  Orange County state Sen. William Campbell and now a fledgling Sacramento  lobbyist. . . . Haleva so resembles the Iraqi leader that he's been signed by a  Hollywood look-alike agency in hopes of a movie role. Since Hussein became big  news, people stare, Haleva says, but so far his resemblance has caused no  problems. "But if he drops one chemical weapon, I lose the mustache."

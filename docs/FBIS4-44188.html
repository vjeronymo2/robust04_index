			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Helmut Maier-Mannhart: "Inconsistencies </F> Surrounding the Greenback"]    [Text] The most striking economic paradox these days is  that, while the American economy is at a real high, the dollar  rate has dropped in a way that is usually only characteristic of  the approach of a heavy storm. Moreover, in the past few weeks  U.S. interest rates increased strongly, which generally favors a  country's currency. Yet neither this nor a concerted action by  the central banks could stop the downward trend of the greenback.    If one tries to find reasonably plausible reasons for it one  will meet with the somewhat dubious role of the American  Government. Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser,  has just emphasized that Washington was not at all interested in  a falling dollar rate. Yet, in the recent past there were also  differing statements that could not or would not blur the  impression that a lower dollar rate could very well be used as a  weapon in the trade war with the Japanese, who obstinately  refuse to comply with the American desire for a reduction of  their enormous export surplus. Regardless of how much Washington  may deny all this, it shows how important confidence in a  country's constant monetary policy is and to what extent the  loss of such confidence will affect the foreign currency markets.    One critical point regarding the economic figures of the  leading economic power is its chronic deficit in the balance of  goods and services, which will climb to $140 billion this year  -- with trends pointing even further upwards. The rising  economy has created a virtual boom for imports, which is having  an increasingly negative effect on the trade balance and,  consequently also the balance of goods and services. The result  is that the trading partners are piling up dollars, which  increase the dollar offer when exchanged into the individual  national currencies. The role of speculation is unclear, even  though one can assume that it supports the trend.    If people on the other side of the Atlantic are now toying  with the idea of stabilizing the exchange rate through  increasing interest rates, one can only warn them. The only  effect would be an increase in the price of money in Europe,  too. Yet, for economic reasons this is absolutely not wanted.  Only a confidence-building economic and monetary policy in  Washington will, in the long term, lead to exchange rates that  are guided by purchasing power. Until then, one will have to  live with the unstable situation at the foreign currency markets  and their negative impact on the financial markets.</p>

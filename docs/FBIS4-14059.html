			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Siege Removal, Peace, Christopher Tour"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. receptiveness toward Jordan's legitimate  demand that the blockade of Jordan's only outlet to the sea be  ended meets the requirements of mutual respect and Jordan's  legitimate right that it be spared undue pressure to promote  certain goals.    Now that Christopher has informed His Majesty King Husayn  that measures are being taken toward lifting the siege of the  Port of al-'Aqabah and acknowledged Jordan has incurred losses  as a consequence, follow-through is needed to propel the peace  process forward and to advance the cause of security and  stability in a region plagued by turbulence and turmoil since  the founding of the state of Israel.    On the eve of Secretary Christopher's Middle East tour, it  is  worth making this point: If we are to sell true peace to the  peoples of the region, then promises of peace, stability, and  prosperity need to be converted into physical realities based on  justice and Israel's compliance with what it takes to bring  peace to the region; namely, the UN resolutions granting the  Palestinian people's right to repatriation and mandating the  withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories.    The pessimism and frustration that has gripped the region  since the negotiations got stuck on all tracks must be laid at  Israel's doorstep. For, they are the result of the obstacles  Israel has placed in the path of the efforts to promote a just  settlement under which Palestinian and Arab rights are assured.    If the negotiations are to emerge from crisis and a regional  explosion is to be averted, Israel's regimen of terror,  aggression, and repression of innocents must end. It is hoped  that Christopher's tour will set out to achieve these goals and  that the removal of the blockade on the Port of al-'Aqabah will  be followed by other steps. One of these would be to shift the  pressure on the Arab parties involved in the negotiations to the  party where it rightly belongs -- Israel, the true enemy of an  equitable peace and stability.</p>

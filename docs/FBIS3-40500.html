A multi-block method was applied to the calculation grids.  Complex configurations of bleed holes and throat slot were  simulated in order to compare the solution with experimental  (test) data. As a result, detailed information on the flow --  which is usually difficult to obtain experimentally -- was  obtained.    At this inlet under the supersonic flow-through conditions,  the flow was found to be two-dimensional in 90% of the  spanwise  direction. In the vicinity of the side-walls, however,  three-dimensional separation occurred along the cowl shock. The  separation induced a vortex, and the vortex was stretched and  swallowed into the throat slot. The ramp bleed ahead of the  cowl-shock-impinge line was found to plan an important role in  preventing the separation region from spreading. A  static-wall-pressure comparison between the results and the  experimental (test) data showed reasonable agreement.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   In recent years, assiduous research efforts have been going  on in Japan as elsewhere on supersonic air inlets for  applications in such vehicles as the next generation of  supersonic airliners and space planes.[.sup]1[/] Research to  date has been focused on elucidating the operating  characteristics, bleed characteristics, and bleeding role in  supersonic mixed-compression air inlets using experimental  techniques[.sup]2[/] and two-dimensional mathematical  analysis.[.sup]3[/] The experimental techniques do provide  much useful information, but there are limits as to model size,  blower time, and blow frequency, making it very difficult at  present to obtain detailed knowledge of complex internal flows.    The purpose of our research is to elucidate flow sites  inside  supersonic air inlets -- which are difficult to gain accurate  knowledge of experimentally -- by means of three-dimensional  mathematical analysis, and then use this information in  subsequent research.  <H5>  2. Calculation Grids </H5>   For the calculation grids we used multi-block mapping. With  the multi-block method, grids can be generated relatively easily  for even the most complex shapes, and the analysis codes which  use this require no special handling for each object shape. In  Figure 1 is shown the relationship between objects in the grid  space defined regularly by I, J, and K, and objects in actual  physical space (x, y, z). In Figure 2 are shown the calculation  grids used. The number of grid points in the x, y, and z  dimensions are 103 x 80 x 90 (but the y dimension is calculated  with the half width of 40 points). For the bleed holes in the  ramp, a square, porous wall was simulated, and the throat bleed  holes are made slotted. The grid point coordinates are defined  by all of the air flow paths (including the inside of each bleed  hole). Inside the main duct, a fine grid is employed so that  boundary layers along the wall can be ascertained precisely.  This air inlet has a height:width proportion of 2:3, with the  outlet shape not choked off in a circular shape but made a  square shape (and the same flow path shape as was used in  experiments described subsequently).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-11A></FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-11B>                       Figure 2. Calculation grids </FIG>    <H5>  3. Analysis Code </H5>   The basic equations used are the Reynolds mean Navier-Stokes  integration equations. Coakly's q-_o_ model is used for the  turbulence model.[.sup]4[/] Separation is determined by the  limited volume method and cell boundary numerical flux by Roe's  approximating Rieman analysis, to which TVD conditions are  applied.[.sup]5[/] For this calculation, the ADI method is  used for the y-z plane and the Gauss-Seidel method for the x  dimension. The equations are spatially solved, with the  first-order-precision negative solution method used for the time  integration.  <H5>  4. Analysis Conditions </H5>   We made the Mach number 2.5, the Reynolds number  10[.sup]7[/] based on the standard of inlet height of the  item being tested, with _a_ = _b_ = 0. In this  analysis, we  made the area of the exhaust louver-type exhaust port constant  without particularly regulating the bleed volume. In these  tests, moreover, since the objective was to ascertain the  interference in the supersonic section between the sidewall  boundary layer(s) and the diagonal shock wave(s), we did not  generate a terminal shock wave, but employed conditions such  that outflow was still at supersonic speeds at the main duct  outlet.  <H5>  5. Analysis Results </H5>   In Figure 3 [not reproduced] is represented an equal Mach  contour diagram on the center surface. The two ramp shock waves  and cowl shock waves, and the entropy compression continuing  therefrom, were attained as designed, and the results obtained  were almost the same as those from the two-dimensional  analysis.[.sup]3[/] The throat shock wave is a diagonal shock  wave that is generated when the bleed causes the flow to strike  the back of the slot. Since we have set low back-pressure  conditions, the flow is accelerated behind this and flows out at  supersonic speed. In Figure 4 [not reproduced] is shown an equal  Mach contour diagram at the 95% span position. In this  way, in  the vicinity of the sidewall, we find separation in the vicinity  of cowl shock wave injection point. The third-column ramp bleed  hole(s) prevent this separation region from spreading,  indicating the importance of bleeding at this position. As a  result of varying the cross-section delineated by the equal Mach  contour diagram in the span direction, we found that  two-dimensionality is maintained to approximately the 90%  span  position.    In Figure 5 [not reproduced] we have an equal Mach contour  diagram at the x = constant cross-section as seen from different  perspectives, (a) and (b). (The wall surface on the near side is  not represented.) The separation region in the vicinity of the  cowl shock wave injection point is sucked into the aft throat  bleed hole(s), and we can observe a thick boundary layer region  in the sidewall cowl region(s) also.    In Figure 6 [not reproduced] we see flow trails from  particles emitted from three places very close to the sidewall  as seen from (a) the side, (b) diagonally from the front, and  (c) directly from the front. Looking downstream, the  three-dimensional separation region at the left sidewall becomes  a vortex which rotates clockwise along the cowl shock wave and  is eventually sucked into the throat bleed place. The flow which  passes through the cowl shock wave is subjected to a sudden  reverse-pressure gradient. The inner layer region of the  sidewall boundary layer has lower kinetic energy than the outer  layer, so the flow turns toward the ramp side (up). That is why  a clockwise vortex is generated.    When we view the movement of this vortex in moving pictures,  we find that the speed of rotation increases the closer the  vortex approaches to the throat bleed hole(s), with the  occurrence of vortex stretching.    In Figure 7 we compare the wall static  pressures.[.sup]2,6[/] At (a) is shown a static pressure  distribution in the flow direction, with comparisons made  between the values on the center surface in this analysis (solid  curve), the two-dimensional NS analysis values (dotted curve),  and the test values (symbols).[.sup]3,7[/] In the external  compression region (x &lt; 1.7), the two-dimensional and  three-dimensional values agree perfectly, but a slight  difference develops in the internal compression region (x &gt;  1.7). We think this is due to the influence of the sidewall.  Nevertheless, there is relatively good agreement between the  two-dimensional and three-dimensional analysis and test values.  At (b) in Figure 7 we have diagrammed the static pressure  distributions in the span direction at the positions indicated  in (a) (i.e. Sec. 1, Sec. 2). The agreement with the test values  is good.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-13A>           Figure 7. Wall Static Pressure Distributions (Compared </FIG>    <H5>  6. Concluding Remarks </H5>   The following facts were established as a result of  conducting the three-dimensional analysis on the supersonic air  inlet.    (1) With this air inlet, under conditions of supersonic  outflow, the two-dimensionality of the flow is maintained to  approximately 90% in the span direction.    (2) In the vicinity of the sidewalls, three-dimensional  separation occurs along the cowl shock wave, and the  third-column ramp bleed helps prevent this region from spreading.    (3) With respect to the static pressure distribution at the  wall in the center plane under conditions of supersonic outflow,  there is almost no difference with the [results of]  two-dimensional analysis, and there is good agreement with the  test values. There is also good agreement between the spanwise  static pressure distribution and the test values.    With these findings in hand, we plan to conduct  three-dimensional analyses in cases where the flow is  decelerated to subsonic speeds by the terminal shock wave.

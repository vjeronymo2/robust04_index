			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVE THE LIONS  </P> <P> This could be, and should be, the year of the lion in California, with passage  of legislation that would spare the state's mountain lion population from sport  hunters who have one basic desire: to have the stuffed head of a big cat  displayed on a wall at home. Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City) is  correct when he says that shooting these animals for fun is outrageous.  "Frankly, just this kind of mentality is why we only see the grizzly bear on  the California state flag," Katz said.  </P> <P> Katz is sponsoring a bill to reclassify mountain lions from game animals to  specially protected mammals that could be killed only by permit when they  damage or destroy livestock or threaten lives. The Katz bill also would  appropriate $15 million annually to buy land that is natural habitat for the  elusive lions, for deer and for endangered or threatened species.  </P> <P> The status of the lion is somewhat in limbo after a long moratorium on sport  hunting of the animal expired in 1986. The state Fish and Game Commission  scheduled lion hunts in each of the last two years, but fortunately the hunts  were halted by lawsuits. A bill sponsored by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside)  to extend the moratorium passed the Legislature, but was vetoed by Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> State fish and game officials have argued that the lion has made a comeback  after its numbers dwindled over the years at the hands of professional hunters  and trappers, and as development encroached on the cat's natural territory. But  private animal experts have questioned the department's estimate that there now  are as many as 6,000 cats in the state. They believe the number is far smaller  than that. While the lion is not officially listed as a threatened or  endangered species, the sad fact is that it is too late for some species by the  time officials get around to affording them official protection. That must not  happen with the mountain lion in California.  </P></p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Three 'household name' insurers may face Lautro charges LAUTRO, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, is considering charges of widespread mis-selling against at least three of Britain's largest and best known life insurance companies. Lautro has not named the three companies, which are all publicly quoted. In at least one of the cases, thousands of investors may be eligible for compensation. Charges against the companies centre around their failure to control hard-sell sales tactics used by tied agents - those who sell a company's products exclusively, but are not directly employed by the company. The companies are accused of failure to monitor the sales agents to ensure that they were giving best advice to investors. They are also accused of failing to exercise due care in the recruitment and training of sales agents. While several 'household name' insurance companies have been the subject of Lautro disciplinary actions, most actions have involved smaller, less well-known insurers. Lautro, which yesterday released its report on its enforcement activities for the 12 months to June 30, said that in the latest year it had seen signs of improving compliance with its rules on selling. But it noted 'that a small number of the largest and most serious cases to occupy the Monitoring Committee recently involved 'household name' life offices.' Nevertheless, there were signs of improvement in the industry in the extent to which it complied with Lautro rules on selling insurance. 'Members performance appears better overall, though there is clearly still further room for improvement,' the report said. For instance, only 13 per cent to 16 per cent of life offices inspected showed serious compliance shortcomings - down from 35 per cent during the first round of inspection visits. Since Lautro began levying fines in 1992 for breaches of its rules, it has collected nearly Pounds 1m from companies. Complaints from the public continued to grow, rising 35 per cent in the period to 2,774. But Lautro noted that the rate of growth was lower than the 50 per cent recorded the year before. Lautro's Monitoring Committee concluded in its report 'that the overall improvement in standards needs to proceed further before Lautro can begin to feel any real satisfaction at the success of its efforts'.</p>

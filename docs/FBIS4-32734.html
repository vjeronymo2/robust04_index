			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wade Daniels: "Hold Your Tongue or Pay the </F> Price"]    [Text] Bratislava--Slovak Deputy Premier Roman Kovac has  asked Bratislava's police to investigate whether an accusation  made against him by Vladimir Meciar, the former premier he  helped oust, could be grounds for criminal charges.    Meciar's charge, first voiced at a May 4 rally attended by  7,000 of his supporters, is that Kovac pocketed $5 million US  earmarked for Slovakia by the U.S. government. That same  evening, deputies of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  (HZDS), now in the opposition, made the same accusation against  Kovac in Parliament, in a failed attempt to remove him from  office.    Neither Meciar nor any of the HZDS parliamentarians have  revealed how or from where the funds might have been diverted.    Kovac, vice chair of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DU),  is one of many disgruntled former HZDS members sitting in the  new government which ousted Meciar and his allies in March.    After hearing the accusations in Parliament, Kovac said he  wanted Meciar to make his claims in public, to Kovac's face, so  he could defend himself.    A few days later Kovac got his wish, when both men were  invited to the Sunday afternoon political television talk show  "Kroky" ("Steps").    Meciar at one point turned to Kovac and said, "I'm giving  you  a chance and telling you out in the open and in front of the  television: You confessed publicly that you accepted $5 million,  which you have at your disposal. There were plenty of witnesses."    "It's not true..."    "Talk about it. Prove it."    "I will," Kovac replied, and added that he would take Meciar  to court.    If what Meciar said were anywhere near the truth, Roman  Kovac  would be one of the richest men in Slovakia. But Meciar didn't  stop at the $5 million US--already a preposterously large sum of  money (for either the Slovak or the U.S. government) to go  unnoticed and unaccounted for.    He went on to claim that last year, as deputy premier, Kovac  had accepted a bribe of 450 million Austrian schillings from the  German firm Siemens. This was apparently a reference to  Slovakia's purchase of medical equipment from Siemens--a deal  that many in Meciar's administration participated in and found  no reason to fault at the time.    Siemens officials are calling the accusations entirely  false,  and have protested what they say are attempts to entangle their  company in political controversies. The officials said they were  considering taking "legal steps" against anyone "who insists on  this false statement."    Kovac has made no mention of this accusation in his call for  an investigation, asking police to look into the possibility  that Meciar's claim about the $5 million US constituted an  attack on a state executive (section 156 of the criminal code)  and the crime of slander (section 206).    The May 4 effort to remove Kovac and the accusations levied  against him are widely seen here as part of a campaign to  tarnish the image and credibility of the new government going  into the nationwide elections, scheduled for late September.    Deputies of the new ruling coalition are now gearing up for  further attacks from the feisty Meciar. And meanwhile, with his  own party comfortably ahead in the polls, the head of HZDS seems  none too worried about the talk of legal action against him.    Actually, Meciar seems to relish the role of incorrigible  demagogue. On May 13, as a guest on Bratislava's Radio Twist  talk show, he quipped that moderators of political television  shows ought to vote for him too, since without him, they would  have no material for their shows and find themselves jobless.</p>

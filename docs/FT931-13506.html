			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Spain cuts key rate as peseta finds calmer waters THE BANK of Spain yesterday gave a strong signal that it believes that the peseta has put its currency troubles behind it. The bank announced a half-point cut in the key money rate at the repurchase tender of its bank's certificates. The bank said the decision to bring down the benchmark intervention rate from 13.75 per cent to 13.25 per cent was 'a response to the progressive normalisation of the currency markets as they recover from the upsets of the autumn of 1992'. The monetary authorities had raised the rate from 13 per cent to 13.75 per cent on November 23 to shield the peseta against speculators following a 6 per cent devaluation of the currency. The peseta had already been devalued by 5 per cent two months earlier when the September upheavals in the European Monetary System forced the pound and the lira out of the system's exchange rate mechanism. Yesterday's move by the bank had been expected by the markets, as it came in the wake of a set of indicators that the peseta had been restored to health. By the end of December, Spain's reserves, which had been hard hit in the battle to secure the peseta, improved by nearly Dollars 3bn to finish 1992 with Dollars 50.4bn (Pounds 33.1bn), and the currency has recently remained comfortably above the Pta72.78 to the D-Mark parity that was set in the November realignment. Underlining the peseta's strength, the currency was fixed yesterday at its parity of Pta70.78 to the D-Mark, down from Pta7.80 before the announcement of the rate cut. Banco de Santander was the first of the big commercial banks to lower its preferential lending with a 0.5 cut from 12.95 per cent to 12.45 per cent. Fuelling the confidence of the Bank of Spain, price rises slowed appreciably in the last months of the year to give Spain a 5.4 per cent year-on-year inflation rate at the end of December. The continuing depressed state of the economy is likely to bring the inflation rate below 5 per cent in the early months of this year. Anticipating an easing of the intervention rates, there has been a strong foreign-led rally in the Spanish bond market in recent weeks. Spanish debt held by non-residents rose to Pta1.87bn (Pounds 10.68m) at the end of last year from a Pta1,600bn low in mid-November and last week alone non-residents bought Pta155bn of government paper. The Bank of Spain prepared the ground for yesterday's cut by injecting Pta596bn into the interbank market on Thursday, against a requirement of only Pta200bn, which brought the overnight rate down from 14.60 per cent to 14.05 per cent. Analysts said there was room for further cuts in the benchmark rate as the differential in real interest rates between the peseta and the other EMS currencies remains very high. Three month Europeseta rates stand at around 600 basis points higher than the Euromark. In February last year the intervention rate stood at 12.40 per cent, and the government, which faces elections this year, will be tempted to bring the current rate down further if the peseta remains strong and the inflation figures continue to improve.</p>

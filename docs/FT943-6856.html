			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Problems in US behind fall at Willis Corroon A poor performance in the US depressed interim profits at Willis Corroon, the insurance broker. Pre-tax profits fell by 14.3 per cent to Pounds 54.1m, compared with Pounds 63.1m at the half-way stage last year. Earnings per share on continuing operations fell by 8 per cent from 8.6p to 7.9p. The quarterly rate of dividend, however, is maintained at 1.65p. Brokerage and fee turnover - including discontinued operations - fell by 2 per cent to Pounds 362m (Pounds 371m). Interest and investment income fell to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 27.1m). The decline was concentrated in the first quarter, when news of problems in a number of US retail operations emerged. There were improvements in the second quarter, with overall turnover rising by 3 per cent. Even so, over the six months profits generated by the North American brokerage operations fell to Pounds 1m, compared with Pounds 8.3m at the same stage of last year. Willis attributed its US problems to 'tough market conditions and strong competition'. In addition, business has been lost following the defection of a number of construction risk specialists to a rival broker. Moves to replace these staff and strengthen other parts of The North American direct, reinsurance, and aerospace operations have increased costs, with expenses up by 6 per cent in the continuing operations to Pounds 328m (Pounds 308m). Mr Roger Elliott, executive chairman, also pointed out that 'local issues' had adversely affected some of the company's US offices and were now being addressed. Analysts are not convinced that management action will prove adequate, however. 'Willis's problems appear far from over,' said Ms Julianne Jessup, of Kleinwort Benson. Expenses from discontinued underwriting operations amounted to Pounds 3.7m, compared with Pounds 12m last time. Movements in exchange rates benefited the results by Pounds 3.7m. Share of profits of associates amounted to Pounds 5.6m (Pounds 5.3m). Interest payable totalled Pounds 2.6m compared with Pounds 3.5m. COMMENT There is little in Willis Corroon's latest results to encourage investors, who have seen the sharesmarked down sharply in recent months. Conditions in the US retail sector remain especially tough, with competition - especially in the the casualty market - under pressure. And following the recent increase in expenses, the group could find that it is running simply to stand still. On a positive note, successful hedging will offset some of the impact of the expected weakness of the dollar. Even so, pre-tax profits for 1994 could be as low as Pounds 65m, putting the shares - at yesterday's closing price of 153p - on a prospective multiple of 15. Despite their recent fall, they still do not look particularly cheap.</p>

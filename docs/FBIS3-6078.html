			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says he will study the  offer by Datuk Joseph Pairin to step down as Sabah chief  minister in order to resolve the political crisis within the  state. The prime minister said many factors need to be  considered before he could make any decision on the offer.  Speaking to reporters at his Hari Raya [end of fasting month]  open house in Kuala Lumpur, he said it was difficult to make a  decision because many events had occurred since the state  elections last month. He said his decision had to take into  account the actions of several Parti Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United  Party, PBS] assemblymen who had resigned to join the Barisan  Nasional [National Front].    Pairin, who is PBS president, told his younger brother,  Datuk  Dr. Jeffrey Kitingan, who is the Bingkor assemblyman and Sabah  Foundation director, of his wish to step down as chief minister.  Interviewed by reporters at the prime minister's residence, Sri  Perdana, this morning, Dr. Jeffrey said Datuk Pairin wants to  play a different role and is prepared to withdraw as a means to  avoid political crisis. Dr. Jeffrey is expected to convey  Pairin's offer to Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir and Deputy Prime  Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim at a separate meeting in the  federal capital tonight.

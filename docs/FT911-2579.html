			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Fox move to Thames TV aids franchise bid SIR Paul Fox has joined the board of Thames Television just a few days after retiring from the BBC as managing director of network television. The arrival of Sir Paul, who is president of the Royal Television Society and who will attend his first Thames board meeting on Wednesday, is a boost to the ITV company in its campaign to retain its franchise. Thames, the largest ITV company, will be challenged for its franchise in next month's bids by Mr Michael Green's Carlton Communications and by a joint venture linking Mr David Frost, the broadcaster, and Mr Richard Branson's Virgin group. Sir Paul, former managing director of Yorkshire Television, also confirmed yesterday that he would be chairman of Daybreak, an Independent Television News-led bid to oust TV-am, the breakfast television company. Apart from ITN, the Daybreak consortium includes Carlton; The Daily Telegraph; MAI, an advertising group; NBC, the American network company; and Taylor Woodrow, the construction company. Sir Paul was critical yesterday of TV-am's Gulf war coverage. He said ITV had decided to follow TV-am each morning with news from ITN to put right the deficiencies of the breakfast company. Later today, another ITV bidder will announce its plans - Television Northern Ireland (TVNI), which will bid for the franchise held since the early days of ITV by Ulster Television. The Duke of Abercorn, the former Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, is to chair a consortium backed by Thomson Regional Newspapers, publishers of The Belfast Telegraph newspaper. The consortium brings together a number of leading Ulster businessmen, including Mr Roy Bailey, president-designate of the local CBI. TVNI's programme controller, Mr Alan Wright, was the original producer of the local magazine programme, Good Evening Ulster, and until recently was head of programmes at Chrysalis Television. In what has turned out to be a ferocious battle for the Northern Ireland licence in spite of the political sensitivities, another bidder, Lagan Television, has entered the fray. Lagan is being advised by Mr Bryan Cowgill, the former managing director of Thames Television. The Lagan consortium, which says it is oversubscribed, includes boxing promotor Barney Eastwood, and Mr RJ McCartney, QC, a leading local lawyer. TVNI and Lagan will argue the need for better-quality local programmes in Northern Ireland and will express a desire to make a more significant contribution to the ITV network than Ulster has so far done. It is unlikely that the Northern Ireland television franchise will go simply to the highest bidder. The Independent Television Commission will almost certainly want to weigh Ulster Television's experience of coping with Northern Ireland's political troubles against the bidders' promises of more exciting local and network programming.

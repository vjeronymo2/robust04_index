			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; place and </F> date issued not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] The course of events in Bosnia-Herzegovina continues  to be followed with great attention in Ukraine. The latest  reports from Sarajevo show that, following the accord on a  cease-fire reached between the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims, and  with the mediation of the UN forces command, both sides have  begun the process of withdrawing heavy artillery and placing it  under UN supervision.    Hailing these positive movements, Ukraine calls on the  conflicting sides to continue their efforts, the final aim of  which should be an agreement on transferring all weapons to UN  control, full withdrawal of Serbian formations from Sarajevo,  and the occupation of their positions by sub-units of the  peacekeeping forces. The demilitarization of Sarajevo and  transfer of the town to UN management will stop the senseless  bloodshed and serve as a starting point for reaching a fair and  peaceful settlement.    Ukraine considers that refusal by any side in the conflict  to  cooperate further with the UN with regard to implementing the  accords reached should be viewed as a challenge to the world  community and disregard for UN decisions, and may lead to the  use of force, as envisaged in the UN Charter and Security  Council resolutions 836 and 844.    Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs appeals to the  political leaders of the conflicting sides and to the peoples of  Bosnia-Herzegovina with an insistent call to show political  wisdom namely now, and notwithstanding insults, reproaches, and  distrust, to adopt a definitive stance for the benefit of peace  in the region.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Equity Issues: Wellcome offer likely to follow BT pattern THE international offering of shares in Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals company, is likely to be modelled on the Pounds 5.5bn BT share sale last December, bankers said yesterday. Wellcome Trust, which funds medical research, said this week it planned to sell a portion of its 73.6 per cent stake in the company, possibly reducing its holding to 25 per cent. This would entail a share sale in the region of Pounds 4.5bn. Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank, has been appointed global co-ordinator for the sale. The only precedents for such a large secondary sale of stock are BT and the Pounds 7.5bn sale of BP shares, which was disrupted by the stock market collapse in October 1987. The BT sale broke new ground for a UK offering in several respects: The global co-ordinator for the deal, SG Warburg, ran a single global book for the issue, rather than reserving a portion for UK institutional investors; The shares were priced following a 'blind auction' in which institutional investors were encouraged to place indicative bids for stock in the three weeks before the pricing. This may not be copied by Wellcome, although a book-building process will take place in the weeks before the final pricing. Investors received an over-allocation of stock, which was bought back by the lead bank to stabilise the share price immediately after the sale. These techniques were used to introduce competition among investors bidding for the stock. the However, the discount cannot be eliminated entirely, since investors will demand an incentive to buy new shares rather than the outstanding stock. In the BT sale, institutional investors paid 350p for new shares, against 342p in the secondary market. However, investors paid for the new shares in installments, reckoned to be worth 20 to 25p per share. Instead of offering Wellcome shares partly-paid, Wellcome Trust could offer warrants for the purchase of more shares at a future date. It is committed to retaining a 25 per cent holding for five years. Officials of Instituto Bancario San Paulo di Torino, one of the largest Italian banks, were in London this week making presentations to institutional investors ahead of its L6,250bn equity offering. UK bankers reported a positive response to the presentations and expect the deal to be priced on March 9 towards the lower end of the L12,000 to L14,000 per share indicated range. On the same date, shareholders in Banco Commercial Portugese, the largest Portuguese bank, will meet to approve plans for the second stage of privatisation. In addition to a one-for-10 rights issue and a bonus issue to existing shareholders, the bank is planning an American depositary receipt programme in the US and the launch of a convertible bond issue in the international market. If approval is received, the bond issue is expected to raise around Es30bn, but will probably be denominated in Ecu.</p>

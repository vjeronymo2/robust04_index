			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Auditors Have Done Their </F> Calculations. Who Will Shed A Tear?" -- from the "IZVESTIYA-TV"  section]    [Text] In January it became known that the Control  Administration of the Russian president's administration had  began an audit of "Ostankino's" financial and economic activity.    The presumption of innocence (a sacred juridical principle)  was crushed by rumors, malicious gossip, and verbal and printed  extrapolation of the repeatedly surfacing individual criminal  and semicriminal episodes in "Ostankino's" history.    In its very first edition "IZVESTIYA-TV" -- although without  specific names, with approximate figures, and anonymously (for  which we were, perhaps fairly, censured) -- peppered the Russian  State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company ["Ostankino"]  with accusations of virtually total corruption.    Without the slightest hint of malice, we note that the  rumors, the major premises of the article "`Ostankino':  Everything for Sale," and the warnings of experts have proved  to be not without basis. The high-quality and thorough audit  has revealed violations and has unambiguously exposed financial  machinations and "slip-ups" reflected in "Ostankino's" losses,  which run into millions and billions of rubles [R]. Here are  just a few figures and statistics from the extensive  documentation on the results of the audit.    In 1993 R441 million worth of unpaid advertising was  broadcast by just five studios. Overall last year the company  should have received -- according to expert assessments -- at  least R60 billion from advertising, but received just R11.2  billion.    "Ostankino" concluded contracts that were known to be  unprofitable with the "Inmac" Joint-Stock Company and a number  of Western firms (here Yu. Bandura, "Ostankino's" former deputy  chairman, especially distinguished himself). Manipulations  manifestly far from altruistic were exposed, involving  advertising time in the "Aleskandr-shou" program, broadcast 16  January this year. "Ostankino's" leaders conducted business  with excessive loyalty -- and clearly to the detriment of the  company's own interests -- with the "Premyer SV" advertising  agency, which will cost the company R12.3 billion.    In 1993 the volume of broadcasting was reduced by almost  one-third by comparison with 1991, but the number of studio  personnel by only 17 percent. And this, while the quality of  programs fell and in the midst of a financial crisis.    Over the past two years "Ostankino" has lost many buildings  and much equipment, and most importantly of all, the Television  Technical Center. But perhaps the most terrible loss is its  loss of prestige, its good reputation in the eyes of the public  and millions of viewers.    We do not know what administrative and juridical measures  will be taken, but it will be very difficult to recoup the moral  and professional losses suffered.</p>

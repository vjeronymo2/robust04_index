			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / London launches new Ulster talks: Mayhew seeks to keep initiative ahead of Sinn Fein conference The British government last night launched a fresh round of meetings with Ulster politicians as it sought to maintain the initiative in efforts to bring peace to the province. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, was expected to use a meeting with Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, to set out ideas for a political settlement between Ulster's constitutional parties, as he promised earlier this month. It was also thought he might ask the UUP to postpone publication of its own proposals - understood to involve little more than the establishment of devolved government in Northern Ireland - until after the party conference later this month of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing. London and Dublin are anxious to deprive Republican leaders of any excuse before this conference for rejecting December's Downing Street Declaration by the British and Irish governments. President Bill Clinton yesterday reiterated his support for the joint declaration and the efforts 'in that context' of the British and Irish prime ministers, during a 30-minute telephone conversation with Mr John Major. The conversation coincided with news that Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, is to be invited to make a second visit to the US to head a St Patrick's Day parade through San Francisco. A recent 48-hour trip by Mr Adams to New York caused friction in UK-US relations. While Sir Patrick and Mr Molyneaux were meeting last night it emerged that a planned Northern Ireland select committee at Westminster is caught in party squabbling about its composition. Labour - currently waging a procedural war against the government - is pressing for four of its MPs to join a 13-member committee and for one of them to serve as chairman. The government wants the number of Labour MPs restricted to two. The bilateral talks with the province's constitutional parties continue later this week with a meeting between Sir Patrick and Dr John Alderdice, leader of the non-sectarian Alliance party. No date has been set for a meeting with the mainly Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party. The hardline Democratic Unionists are boycotting the talks process. Both leading unionist parties were irritated by Sir Patrick's decision to provide Dublin with details of the ideas he would like to be pursued before they were informed of them.

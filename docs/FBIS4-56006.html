			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik is chairing the  Slovak Government's regular session today -- its 12th session,  to be precise. The cabinet should discuss about 20 points,  including the new version of the defense doctrine. [passage  omitted] Michal Tvarozek reports:    [Tvarozek] [passage omitted] I asked Defense Minister Pavol  Kanis for an interview. First of all, I put it to him that the  defense doctrine was already on the agenda of the previous  government -- the government dealt with it at the beginning of  March this year. Has anything in the doctrine been changed by  the Moravcik cabinet?    [Begin recording] [Kanis] This new version of the doctrine  is  quite different in that the draft passed by the government  today, albeit passed with the proviso that certain appended  comments should be taken into account, spells out clearly the  foreign policy affiliation of the Slovak Republic. The emphasis  is on closer relations with and on the future membership of  western European and transatlantic defense structures.    The new version includes a foreign policy section and many  things in it have been clarified and are now expressed clearly.  There are none of those general cliches we saw in the variant  discussed by the previous government.    [Tvarozek] At the moment, an all-European defense system is  being set up. Does it mean that our defense doctrine has a time  limit?    [Kanis] This is an important point: just for how long should  the defense doctrine be valid? We are going through a stage  when we are coming closer to Western European and transatlantic  defense structures and our defense doctrine will therefore be  valid up to the moment that we become a member of these  structures. As soon as we become a member of these structures  we will adopt their military doctrine as well.    If we take into account the fact that the Slovak Republic  has  the weakest military potential, the weakest economic and even  the weakest human potential, then our thinking must recognize  that the first prerequisite of our successful defense is our  membership of some collective defense system. In other words,  one has to emphasize that it is, above all, our successes in  foreign policy and in foreign-defense policy that constitute a  guarantee of our security.    [Tvarozek] In connection with this document, the government  today also discussed the so-called presentation document  [prezentacny dokument]. What is it?    [Kanis] Just as the defense doctrine is a kind of pillar as  regards our internal political activity and our own forces, the  presentation document is the concrete expression of the  Partnership for Peace framework document -- and therefore the  second pillar on which our security is based. This document is  extremely important because it gives concrete expression to the  framework document and in fact also expresses our  self-projection and self-reflection regarding our security up to  the end of the millennium. The defense doctrine and the  presentation document therefore constitute the basic documents  of our security and defense policy. On their basis a specific  security policy for this millennium will be implemented. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UN's plans anger Somali strongman GENERAL Mohammed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's most powerful warlord, said yesterday he opposed a United Nations Security Council resolution passed last Friday ordering the deployment of a further 3,000 blue berets in his country. But he stopped short of past threats that he would attack armed UN troops who entered the territory he controls without his consent. 'This decision has been announced without consultation . . . and without our consent and we believe it will not be constructive,' he said in Bardere, 300km west of the capital Mogadishu. 'We believe we can solve the security situation by our own means.' He urged the international community to feed his gunmen and help rebuild a police force instead of dispatching foreign troops to Somalia, where Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, is expected tomorrow as head of a three-hour European Community fact-finding mission. Gen Aideed conceded that some of his forces had been involved in banditry and looting of relief food destined for starving civilians, including last Friday's chaos at Mogadishu airport where gunmen carried off 300 tonnes of food and 199 barrels of fuel. 'They are hungry,' he said. Minutes away from the general's headquarters, hundreds of children are facing imminent death from starvation. Mothers struggled to gain entrance to the guarded gates of feeding centres where Somali relief workers dished out gruel. At a centre at a disused hospital three children and six adults died before noon yesterday. Their limp bodies, wrapped up in castaway sacks from bags of food aid, were brought out and paraded before reporters. The UN World Food Programme has so far flown in four C-130 Hercules flights to Bardere carrying food. Another German aircraft was due to arrive yesterday.</p>

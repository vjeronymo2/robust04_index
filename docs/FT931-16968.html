			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Citizens corps to the rescue President-elect Bill Clinton is an unswerving advocate of voluntary national service. He says he feels 'passionate' about the idea and recently told congressional leaders it would rank alongside deficit reduction and healthcare reform as one of the top legislative priorities of his first term. The phrase national service may cause confusion in Britain. Rest assured, Mr Clinton is not a soulmate of the blimpish retired colonels who favour conscription as a means of 'knocking sense' into unruly teenagers. The service Mr Clinton has in mind would be civilian and voluntary. He wants to give young people an opportunity to finance higher education by doing community work. As such, national service would be an amalgam of two of the US's most admired social programmes: the GI bill which put a generation of second world war veterans through college, in the process creating one of the world's best-educated workforces; and John F Kennedy's Peace Corps, which fired the idealism of a subsequent generation of college graduates by encouraging many to do voluntary service in the third world. The scheme is appealing because it offers some hope of alleviating several intractable problems. The financial strain of putting children through college is one of the biggest anxieties of the middle-income families who supported Mr Clinton in November. Few students from such families qualify for federal subsidies which anyway now fall well short of the spiralling cost of college tuition. National service offers a novel means of paying for college - or vocational training - without getting horribly into debt. And, like the original GI bill, such an easing of access to post-secondary education would raise the quality of the future workforce and hence improve US competitiveness. Equally important for enthusiasts, it is a way of fighting urban decay and tackling acute social problems. Imagine the effect of mobilising hundreds of thousands of energetic school leavers to rebuild slums, clear refuse, feed and house the homeless, provide care for the elderly, serve as assistants to nurses, police officers and social workers and so forth. If 500,000 youngsters a year enrolled in this kind of 'citizens corps' - a not unreasonable number - a transformation of inner-city life might become feasible. The young could literally help rebuild America. But the potential benefits do not stop here. In its recent book Mandate for Change, the Progressive Policy Institute (a thinktank close to Mr Clinton) advocates national service as a 'democratising and integrating force in an increasingly Balkanised nation'. It envisages a citizens corps as a 'common civic endeavour for youths of all backgrounds, who would meet on terms of strict civic equality'. It would be a way of emphasising that the rights of citizenship carry reciprocal responsibilities and thus of forging a new and more productive relationship between government and the individual. It would also allow youngsters to mature physically and emotionally and thus derive greater benefits from higher or technical education. Finally a citizens corps could serve a useful role in cushioning the military 'downsizing' following the end of the cold war. It is widely recognised that the US armed services have done a better job of training young people and overcoming racial tensions than most private employers. Yet military recruitment is set to fall by more than a third in coming years. Why allow all this expertise to go to waste? Much of the talent in the armed forces could surely be redirected to train youngsters to tackle US domestic problems. As with any innovative idea, there are potential snags. The most obvious is the cost. Enrollees would receive a subsistence income (say Dollars 5,000 a year) plus vouchers towards the cost of college. To be worthwhile, the vouchers would have to cover most of the tuition costs at a public university, which is currently about Dollars 20,000 over four years. If enrollees earned Dollars 10,000 in vouchers for each year of national service, the per capita cost would be Dollars 15,000 a year without allowing for the costs of running the projects. The annual cost of a 500,000-strong citizens corps could easily run to Dollars 15bn, three times the Dollars 5bn annual cost of the current loan programme which caters for 3.7m borrowers. However, this would still be just 5 per cent of the annual defence budget. It would not be easy to design demanding national service programmes for talented school leavers nor to ensure that enrollees came from all social classes. Indeed unless colleges were given a financial incentive to seek national service graduates, the poor and minorities would be over-represented, as they are in the armed forces. The entry into the labour force of large numbers of young volunteers on subsistence wages could also be disruptive, upsetting established workers who might feel their worth had been diminished. There are also philosophical doubts: should the young be made to feel they have an obligation to 'serve' the state? Such objections have to be taken seriously and will probably ensure that a national service corps is built up far more slowly than Mr Clinton would wish. But national service seems to be an idea whose time has come. It could prove one of the defining achievements of Mr Clinton's presidency.</p>

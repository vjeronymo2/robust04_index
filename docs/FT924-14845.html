			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) to cut workforce by 7,500 in next two years Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the Daimler-Benz subsidiary which includes most of Germany's key aerospace contractors, is to cut its workforce by 7,500 in the next two years because of reduced orders, writes Quentin Peel. The cuts, more than 10 per cent of the 70,000 employees in companies ranging from Deutsche Airbus to MBB and MTU, will affect all main divisions. The job losses, which may include redundancies as well as natural wastage, do not take into account possible cancellation of the European fighter aircraft programme, in which Dasa is the German partner. The company is also a partner with France's Aerospatiale in the Tiger anti-tank helicopter project, another scheme where German participation is now in doubt. No major defence contracts were expected in the next two years, a spokesman said.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Valeo resists sector decline VALEO, the French maker of car components, showed resistance to the downturn in the European car market by announcing first-half net profits of FFr383m (Dollars 68m), a fall of 6.1 per cent over the same period last year. The company said the result was achieved despite the depressed European car market and reflected improved operating profit margins outside Europe and the benefits of its cost-cutting programme. The results included extraordinary charges of FFr223m. Sales during the first six months of 1993 fell by 4.6 per cent to FFr10.59bn. Valeo said that most of this decline was the result of exchange rate movements and was achieved against a background of an 18 per cent fall in the European automotive market. Valeo ascribed the relative strength of sales to expanding technology and the growing internationalisation of its operations. The company said the continued depressed outlook for the European car market meant that it would pursue its policy of industrial and commercial adjustments and would seek to strengthen its position in growth markets such as Asia and the US. The company's balance sheet strengthened during the period. At the end of June, net consolidated debt stood at FFr1.77bn compared with FFr2.15bn at the beginning of the year. The debt to equity ratio declined from 30 per cent to 23 per cent during the same period. Spending on research and development during the first half was FFr531m, while capital expenditure was FFr636m.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Observer: Cold comfort An American woman has won Dollars 2.9m damages because her McDonald's coffee was hot. She had put the cup between her legs - to remove the cap - but it spilt and she suffered serious burns. The jury said it wanted not just to award appropriate damages, but also to deliver a message to the fast food industry. Said the foreman: 'The coffee's too hot out there . . .'</p>

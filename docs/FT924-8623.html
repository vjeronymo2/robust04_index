			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Prowting shares hit by warning of dividend cut SHARES OF Prowting, the Middlesex-based builder, yesterday fell from 82p to 71p after the company warned that it planned to cut its final dividend by almost half. The company, which builds 'everywhere south of Birmingham', announced that it had made only Pounds 119,000 pre-tax profit during the six months to end-August, compared with profits of Pounds 3m last time. A Pounds 600,000 increase in interest charges to Pounds 2.4m was only part of the reason for the setback. House sales rose during the half from 131 to 154 units but margins were under severe pressure with average prices falling from Pounds 103,00 to Pounds 86,000. Losses per share of 0.3p compared with earnings last time of 2.7p. Mr Terry Roydon, chief executive, said the company was maintaining the interim dividend at 1.7p. It was thought prudent, however, given continuing difficulties in the housing market to give shareholders early warning that it proposed cutting the final from 3.3p to 1.7p, reducing the total for the year to 3.4p (5p). Mr Roydon was more optimistic, however, that a recovery in the housing market might get underway in the New Year, led by lower interest rates which, he said, could fall to 6 per cent. Most ingredients for a recovery were in place, particularly if the government announced plans to allow local authorities to buy repossessed homes for rent, said Mr Roydon. This would not help the group in the current financial year when it was expected that even the proposed reduced final dividend would have to be financed out of reserves. Borrowings, which peaked in the spring at Pounds 42m, have since fallen to Pounds 33.5m. Gearing, at 59 per cent at the end of last year, is expected to fall to about 50 per cent by the year end. COMMENT Prowting's strength is its land bank of 5,300 plots with planning permission or zoned for housing, equivalent to more than 15 years' supply at current production rates. The average plot cost of Pounds 12,700 is one of the lowest in the sector. This should stand the group in good stead when the housing market ultimately recovers. However, there are less heavily borrowed builders with similar plot costs. Trading, however, remains difficult. The group will do well to break-even this year and recovery, when it occurs, is likely to be slow. A yield of almost 6.5 per cent may not be enough to attract buyers for this tightly-held stock.</p>

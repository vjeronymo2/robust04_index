The  following is the story of the arrest, as told by of detainee  'Abd-al-Majid al-Majali to security men in the presence of  witnesses:    Last Sunday, a person from al-Zarqa' visited 'Abd-al-Majid  in  al-Qasr. The two knew each other. The visitor had a small  carton with military hardware in it and asked 'Abd-al-Majid to  guard it until he returned in a few days to carry out a commando  operation against Jews from southern Jordan.    'Abd-al-Majid asked the person if the weapons were licensed.  The visitor said they were not, so 'Abd-al-Majid refused to  keep them inside his house but agreed to hide the carton  elsewhere, It ended up in the storage room of a house facing a  mosque belonging to a school for the Islamic Center Society.  Working hours were over on that day and the school's guard did  not know about it. The imam of the mosque refused to hide the  carton inside the mosque, so 'Abd-al- Majid hid the carton  inside a storage room that is separate from the house.    After that day's fast-breaking meal, a group from the  security forces came from Amman. They headed directly for the  place where the military hardware was hidden. They searched the  place and seized the carton of ammunition. Afterwards, they  arrested the defendant who hid the carton. Full security  procedures on the incident were taken. 'Abd-al-Majid confessed  the entire story without any pressure and in the presence of  many witnesses.    When the security forces made inquiries, the school's  administration denied any knowledge of the incident and stressed  that the mosque is a public place frequented by many people.    The incident did not answer the following questions: How did  the first defendant from al-Zarqa' manage to tell the security  forces where the carton of military hardware was hidden on that  same day? Doesn't this indicate that he wanted to trap Islamic  institutions by taking advantage of some simple people? Why  weren't the weapons hidden outdoors or in one of the defendants'  houses instead of being hidden in a public place? Why does this  incident come now, closely following a wave of arrests on  security issues? [passage omitted on the Islamic Center  Society's social works]</p>

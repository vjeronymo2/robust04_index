			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: European Court rules against Ladbroke The European Court in Luxembourg yesterday threw out an attempt by Ladbroke to break the French state-owned betting monopoly, the Pari Mutuel Urbain. In the first of several cases it has brought to the European Court, Ladbroke argued that the PMU's monopoly restricted competition and was contrary to the Treaty of Rome. The hotels, betting and retail group argued that the European Commission had a duty to take up its complaint. The European Court of First Instance decided the Commission was under no duty to act because the treaty's competition provisions did not apply to betting and gaming. Ladbroke said yesterday that the PMU's monopoly over French racing made the UK group's betting operations in other European countries less competitive. Ladbroke has 600 betting shops in Belgium, where it claims to be the biggest operator. While Ladbroke shows Belgian and UK racing in the shops, the PMU prevents it from showing French races, which would be a popular attraction. Ladbroke's competitor, the Belgian PMU, is allowed to show French racing, Ladbroke said. The French monopoly also forced Ladbroke to close its only German betting shop last year. The shop was in the eastern sector of Berlin. Although it showed German and UK racing, Ladbroke said it needed to show French racing to survive. Had the shop been in the western sector of Berlin it would have been able to show French races. This was because the PMU had concluded an agreement with a West German agent in the days when the city was still divided. Ladbroke said it would have been able to negotiate an agreement with the agent, but the agency agreement did not extend to the eastern sector of Berlin. Ladbroke said it had approached the PMU to grant it rights to French racing in east Berlin, but this had been refused. The group said it could appeal against the decision, but had not yet decided whether it would do so. It said its other European Court cases were still awaiting a decision. These include a bid to increase competition in the Belgian market.</p>

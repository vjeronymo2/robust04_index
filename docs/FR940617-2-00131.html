			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with the comment regarding the difficulty of basing a State allocation formula on anticipated arrivals and have dropped this factor from the formula. In the interest of consistency, we have changed the notice to require States to allocate FPP funds using a formula which reflects arrivals during FY 1993 to local jurisdictions, the same formula used by ORR to allocate FPP funds to States. We have no specific guidance regarding the distribution of administrative costs between county and State; this is an issue that should be resolved between the county and the State. All costs claimed against grants must be in conformity with HHS grants regulations at 45 CFR part 92 and other applicable Federal requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to performance requirements for the FPP program, we have not added any new reporting requirements. As in FY 1993, States are required to provide program performance information on the FPP program consistent with the reporting requirements contained in 45 CFR 92.40, under the terms and conditions of the social services grant awards to States. In addition, we have simply clarified that the information to be reported must include the four items listed in this notice. Regarding program outcomes, States may provide available outcome data from individual contracts. In regard to suggestions for additional requirements for FPP projects, we have decided not to consider additional requirements since this is the last year of the FPP set-aside program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Five commenters addressed the issue of ORR's use of 15% of social service funds for ORR discretionary grants. Two commenters indicated support for the 15% discretionary use, while two commenters objected it. One commenter recommended that there should be equitable distribution of discretionary funding with input and involvement of States, an expansion of selection panels, more lead time to develop proposals, and the development of meaningful evaluation criteria. Another commenter felt that the notice should describe the focus of discretionary funds for FY 1994, as has been done in previous years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We continue to believe that it is necessary to maintain a portion of social service funds for discretionary use in order to carry out national initiatives and special projects that respond to changing needs and circumstances in the refugee program. Regarding the issue of equitable distribution, discretionary funds are awarded on a competitive basis, based on the quality of applications in relation to the evaluation criteria, rather than on the basis of a population-based allocation formula. Therefore, the geographic distribution of funds awarded on the basis of merit may not be the same as a distribution by formula. Regarding more State involvement in discretionary funding, since States are frequently competitors for ORR discretionary funds, along with other applicants, it is not possible to involve States in funding decisions without creating a conflict of interest, a violation of Federal grant rules. We do not believe our selection panels need to be expanded; ORR selection panels have traditionally been broad-based, involving a varied group of experts from the resettlement field and other disciplines. We agree that sufficient lead time is necessary to develop proposals; we are committed to allowing as much lead time as the grant process timetable will bear. We also agree that the use of meaningful evaluation criteria is essential in the review of grant applications; such evaluation criteria are included in our grant announcements. We have not included a description of our discretionary focus for FY 1994 because we have been in the process of revamping our discretionary program agenda this year. FY 1994 grant announcements have recently been made available in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Three commenters expressed support for the concurrent provision of English language training with employment and employment-related services. One commenter recommended that the provision of English language training be tied to the provision of vocational training and that the notice reflect this emphasis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not believe that English language training should be tied exclusively to one type of employment-related service such as vocational training. Our intent is to encourage the concurrent provision of English language training in concert with other employment-related services to speed the process of a refugee becoming employed and self-sufficient. At the same time, we want to discourage the provision of English language training in a sequential manner, as a prerequisite to receiving other employment-related services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requested clarification regarding the meaning of ``appropriate coordination'' with reception and placement (R &amp; P) agencies to ensure the provision of seamless services to refugees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

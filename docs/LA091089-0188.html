			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: AIR FAIR ALICE FURLAUD'S DISPATCHES FROM PARIS BY ALICE  FURLAUD (GIBBS SMITH: $9.95; 190 PP.)  </P> <P> With the current vogue for "re-creations" of events in television newscasts,  Alice Furlaud can rightly be considered a pioneer in broadcast news reporting.  Incisive and witty, Paris correspondent Furlaud sprang full-blown from the  heads of the staff at National Public Radio in response to their complaint that  there were "far too many serious stories going on the air from abroad."  "Couldn't we get some silly stuff from our London bureau?" asked one editor at  the historic meeting where Alice was born. "No, our reporter there is all  Euromissiles and Thatcher health policy," replied another despairing editor.  The intrepid crew promptly invented a dream reporter whose "live" coverage  became a tradition at the bureau. The resulting radio spots, 45 of which are  transcribed here complete with description of background sounds, are a  hilarious spoof of standard radio fare.  </P> <P> The genius of these reports is their fidelity to daily life, whether the  subject is Paris fashion, planned parenthood for pigeons or an interview with  France's largest producer of snail's eggs. The details are extraordinarily  accurate even when the situations are wacky, and all is delivered in a deadpan,  news-reporter tone. In "La Legion d'Amour," she uncovers the dark truth of the  many couples engaged in amorous activities on the streets of Paris: They are  employees of an obscure government agency (acronym COMSI), hired to perpetuate  Paris' image as "the city of lovers."  </P> <P> The description of the background noises, too, pokes delightful fun at the  efforts of radio journalism. The piece on the French Society for English  Bulldogs opens over "a loud wuffle, snorting sound with a faint menace in it,"  which fades as Furlaud begins: "This is not a maddened pig, or a fire-breathing  dragon or a threshing machine. It's a squat, bowlegged creature somewhat  resembling a dog -- a very ugly dog. In fact, it's Beau, the champion English  bulldog of France. . . . Can I pet him? I'm going to pet this lovely champion  of France." Sonja Bolle  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / UK Company News: Survival plan will cost BM some Pounds 42m BM GROUP, the troubled construction equipment concern, yesterday announced details of its survival plan, which will cost nearly Pounds 42m in redundancies, closures, disposals and write-offs. Discussions are continuing with its 10 banks over its greatly increased debt, breaches of covenants on interest cover and net assets and a disposal programme to relieve the situation. Bank debt and finance leases stood at Pounds 105m in December. Interest-paying stock finance and bills of exchange amounted to additional loans of Pounds 41m. Net assets are likely to be less than Pounds 120m by the June year-end and gearing near 100 per cent. Mr Moger Woolley, chairman since October, said about 1,000 jobs were being cut from a workforce of 6,900. Substantial costs arise from putting the pension fund on a more prudent footing. Nearly Pounds 14m is being deducted from last June's net assets of Pounds 171m to adjust for deferred tax. This year, the fund's Pounds 41.6m surplus is being reduced by Pounds 11m, to be taken as part of the Pounds 41.6m exceptional charges. The impact will be partly offset by a tax credit. Two main disposals are planned to relieve debt. The disposals and the restructuring would help bring down total borrowings to about Pounds 114m by December, of which about Pounds 79m would be bank debt or finance leases. The group's results for the six months to December 31 were little affected by the survival tactics, which follow a review by Robert Fleming as the new merchant bank and Price Waterhouse as the new auditors. Pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 8.66m (Pounds 17.3m) on sales of Pounds 263.4m (Pounds 229.3m), which were boosted by Pounds 57.3m from Thomas Robinson, acquired early last year. In construction equipment sales declined sharply, especially in the last quarter. Earnings per share fell to 4.2p (14.9p). The interim dividend is slashed to 0.5p (2.1p).</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK feed cake sliced into bigger portions - The three top producers now have 52 per cent of the market UK CATTLE, pigs and poultry may not know it, but the business of feeding them is becoming increasingly sophisticated. 'You've got to have animal feed plants that are like ice cream factories or bakeries in terms of their standards of hygiene and efficiency,' says Mr Paul Kirk, executive director in charge of agribusiness at Dalgety, the food and agriculture group. That is one reason for the growing concentration of the compound animal feed market in the hands of national producers. The latest move came last week when Dalgety announced that it was paying Pounds 15.7m for Unigate's Oldacre business, the largest regionally-based manufacturer, to take its share of the national market from 17 per cent to 21 per cent. This puts it neck-and-neck with BOCM Pauls, the company formed last year by Harrisons &amp; Crosfield when it merged its own subsidiary, Pauls Agriculture, with the BOCM Silcock animal feeds business it bought from Unilever for Pounds 67m. BOCM Pauls has 22 per cent of the market, putting the share of the national producers, including J. Bibby in third place, at about 52 per cent. Industry analysts say the Dalgety acquisition has raised a question mark over Bibby, part of the South African Barlow Rand group, given that it is now a long way behind its nearest rivals in a shrinking industry. Some of the independent regional millers and co-operatives that share the rest of the market are also likely to come under pressure. Hygiene standards are becoming increasingly onerous and putting the squeeze on smaller producers, according to Mr Kirk. 'The amount of food safety legislation applying to animal feeds is larger than that which applies to human food,' he says. The industry is likely to gravitate towards manufacturers that are either big enough to benefit from economies of scale or small enough to hold niche markets, says Mr Kirk. 'Being stuck in the middle might not be the most comfortable place to be.' European Community milk quotas, introduced in 1984, have helped to make the animal feed market stagnant, and last year's reforms of the common agricultural policy, designed to cut farm over-production, are expected to restrict future growth. 'That doesn't mean there isn't a good business opportunity in a market that's contracting, provided there is rationalisation,' says Mr George Paul, chief executive of Harrisons &amp; Crosfield. 'What we're aiming to do is to be significantly the most economic producers of feed, running a small number of quite large modern mills at as close to design capacity as we can.' BOCM Pauls is due to complete a sweeping rationalisation programme by the end of this year. It has closed 13 mills, axed 600 jobs - 25 per cent of the workforce - and increased the average capacity of its remaining 20 mills from 75,000 tonnes a year to 120,000 tonnes. It is investing Pounds 10m in upgrading production. Dalgety has added Oldacre's eight mills to its existing 19 mills. Mr Kirk says the purchase is a good geographical fit with the existing business, although industry observers expect some rationalisation here too, albeit more limited. This year the company is spending Pounds 14m on replacing machinery, upgrading older plants and increasing capacity, which is now an average of nearly 100,000 tonnes per mill. The size of the two market leaders will enable them to spread their research and development costs at a time when discerning consumers are forcing changes all the way down the food chain. 'The large retailers are increasingly interested in the methods of production of what ends up on their shelves,' says Mr Martin Wood, BOCM Pauls managing director, at the company's Ipswich headquarters. Supermarkets now want to know the proportion of lean meat in broiler chickens, for example, or the protein content of milk. At the same time, UK farmers need to cut costs to compete with successful exporters like Denmark and the Netherlands. That means, for example, using a feed that will enable the delivery of as many cattle as possible to the abattoir on the right day and at the right weight, he says. To meet these demands, BOCM Pauls is converting some of its mills from general feed production to diets specially designed for cattle, pigs or poultry. Its 350-strong sales force has also become 'species-specific'. The newly merged company had a disappointing first half performance because it had failed to secure adequate advance supplies of raw materials before the pound was devalued upon quitting the EC's exchange rate mechanism last September. The impact was felt not only in costlier imports, which account for 30 per cent of its raw materials, but also in the price of vital home-grown cereals. EC support prices are fixed in European currency units, so the sterling-denominated price of UK cereals shot up by some 20 per cent as the pound plummeted. That cast a shadow over the merger. But the pound's devaluation was not all bad news as it gave British farmers  -including the company's 10,000 customers - an unexpected and welcome boost to profits. That has increased confidence, particularly in the dairy sector, where farmers are also being wooed by milk buyers and processors in the run-up to next year's abolition of the Milk Marketing Board's monopoly. The immediate challenge for the market leaders will be to hold on to their new slice of the cake. BOCM Pauls lost 2 percentage points of market share to its rivals during its merger, but analysts expect the Dalgety acquisition to cause less of an upheaval because Oldacre is smaller and likely to require less integration. It should also soon become clear whether price competition is on the cards, as manufacturers begin to strike contracts with farmers for the winter feed season.</p>

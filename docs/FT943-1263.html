			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Cookery: In the grip of the grapes - They're at their best just now, says Philippa Davenport - and the luscious Italia variety is best of all Grapes are a best buy in Britain just now, and best of all are the sort called Italia. They can be black or white and many countries now send supplies to the UK but, for my money, only white Italia grapes from Italy are truly enticing. The fruit from other sources never seems half so plump, muscat-sweet and fragrant. While the season lasts, I am happy to eat these grapes round the clock. For breakfast, I will tuck into a bunch on its own, or halve and seed a handful of the fruit to add to a bowl of yoghurt, together with a few almonds and perhaps a drizzle of honey. For lunch, what could be better than a hot, lightly-curried chicken or fish broth aromatised with lemon grass, poured over a spoonful or two of steamed rice, and finished with a floating garnish of soured cream crowned with a few peel- - ed grapes for a cool and silky contrast. One of my favourite salads at this season combines grapes with prawns, the latter seasoned with toasted and ground coriander seed and torn basil leaves and laid on a bed of shredded Little Gem lettuce. Also excellent is a salad of creamy, mildly tangy goat's cheese with cos, Italia grapes and toasted pine kernels. In France, a typical bonne bouche of the grape-picking season consists of chicken livers sauteed and tossed with a few peeled and pipped grapes, warmed in butter with a splash of wine and served on soft rounds of toast. Delicious for a snack lunch or as a fairly substantial appetiser at dinner. Those who prefer fresh fruit and compotes to puddings proper may share my enthusiasm for an end of summer fruit salad made simply with sliced bananas, halved and seeded grapes, plus plenty of freshly scooped melon balls dressed in a light lemon or lime syrup infused with a couple of sprigs of mint. VENDANGE CHICKEN (serves 6) Soothing and pure, this is a practical choice for a small party as most of the work can be done ahead. But be sure to re-heat the chicken only briefly, as described. That way, the meat will remain succulent and fresh. Prolonged re-heating always risks over-cooking poultry, making it stringy and dull. The chicken poaching liquor is re-used here to produce a copious quantity of intensely flavoured sauce. Make the most of it by serving the bird in a generous ring of rice that will soak up every drop. Ingredients: a high-quality roasting chicken weighing about 4 lb; 6 oz white Italia grapes; 2 glasses dry white wine; a bunch of fresh tarragon;  1/4 pt double cream; 1 oz butter; 1 oz plain white household flour. Wash the chicken and put it into a flame-proof pot, preferably oval, which will hold it snugly. Pour on enough hot, not boiling, unsalted water to cover the thickest part of the thighs. There is no need to immerse the breast. Cover tightly and poach gently for 50-60 minutes. Transfer the covered pot to a sink containing enough cold water and ice cubes to come halfway or more up the sides of the pot. Leave the pot in the sink for about three hours, replenishing the cold water and ice cubes from time to time to speed the cooling process. When the chicken is cold, strip off and discard the skin. Lift the flesh from the bones, wrap it in greaseproof paper to keep it moist and refrigerate it. De-grease the cooking liquor, return the bones to the pot, half cover and simmer until reduced to 1-1 1/4 pt intensely chickeny stock. Season, chill and de-grease again. (Do everything up to this stage the day before serving.) Boil the wine until reduced by half, then mix it with enough stock to make about 1 1/4 pt in all. Make a sauce with the butter, flour, stock and wine mixture, with cream and seasonings to taste. Cover to prevent a skin forming and set aside. Cut the chicken into bite-size, quill-shaped pieces. Halve and seed the grapes; peel them if you wish. Chop some tarragon. Shortly before serving, bring the sauce back to simmering point. Add the chicken, cover, and simmer very gently for eight-10 minutes. Stir in the grapes and tarragon. Switch off the heat, cover and leave to stand for five minutes. Check seasoning, pile into a ring of boiled rice, and decorate with tarragon.</p>

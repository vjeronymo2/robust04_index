HERE IS HOW  SOME OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP SPORTS COLUMNISTS SAW THE DECISION.)  </P> <P> How dare Pete Rose insult us. How dare he stand before TV cameras, his stupid  spiked hair sticking straight up, and evince no real remorse, take next to no  responsibility for his actions and then, blithely and chillingly, say he hopes  to be back in baseball posthaste.  </P> <P> Having dishonored himself and his sport, all Pete Rose wanted to talk about was  how soon he might be reinstated.

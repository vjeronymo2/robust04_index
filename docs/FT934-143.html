			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Christmas sales lift stores Shares in leading high street retailers streaked ahead yesterday as speculators became increasingly convinced that the run up to Christmas and initial indications from post Christmas sales may be pointers to a significant upturn in consumer spending. The food retailing sector, the market's worst performing area this year, also shared in the upsurge. Store shares have consistently underperformed the wider market recently but began to stir last week as some of the market's action funds - which take advantage of perceived short-term market opportunities - took out small bull positions ahead of official sales news from the big groups. Analysts were reluctant to adopt any significant stance on sales figures but said initial indications were good and an early reduction in UK interest rates would provide further ammunition for fund managers to move into the sectors in strength. There was an element of caution from some areas, however; 'The real danger for this sector will come when the companies issue official statements on trading. An inkling of bad news will see the sector down five per cent at a stroke,' said one retailing specialist. Marketmakers, on the other hand, adopted a more positive view and hoisted share prices throughout a busy session. GUS, the sector best performer during 1993, raced up 19 1/2 to 654p while Kingfisher leapt 36 to 778p on keen turnover of 3.3m. Marks &amp; Spencer surged 20 to a record 460p - the biggest single day's gain in the stock since the Conservative's general election victory in April 1992 - on turnover of 3.8m. Boots climbed 26 to 605p. However, W H Smith 'A' stubbornly refused to join the party, the shares closing 4 off at 514p, bedevilled by concerns about the Do-It-All business. Hopes of bumper Christmas sales in food retailing were focused clearly on J. Sainsbury, which raced up 17 to 455p and Kwik Save, 26 better at 618p. Argyll was left behind and unmoved at 277p while Asda managed a 2 1/2 gain at 57 1/2 p.</p>

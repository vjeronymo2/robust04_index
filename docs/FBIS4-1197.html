			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News by Norman Patterton] </F>   [Text] Brits, Western Transvaal, April 23 SAPA -- Chaos and  war were at South Africa's door, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB] leader Eugene Terreblanche  warned on Saturday [23 April] in the Western Transvaal where AWB  members are preparing to "secure" the territory as a "base". He  told a rally attended by 200 supporters at Brits it now made  more sense to reach for the gunpowder than head for the ballot  booth. "We don't want war, but we are not white colonists who  will be driven from the country," Mr Terreblanche said.    He dismissed the pact for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]  which Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen was to sign on  Saturday as worthless because it did not guarantee a volkstaat.  Gen Viljoen had become a "Brutus" to his own nation, and had  become a part of the "sick" political system in South Africa.  "While the rest of the AWB movement are dug in in the Western  Transvaal, we say we do not have an agreement with the African  National Congress which states South Africa should be a unitary  state."    The area from the Northern Transvaal to the Cape border was  being prepared as a base for rightwingers. Many had already  moved into the area, and many thousands were still on their way,  Mr Terreblanche said. Rightwingers would be able to live in  this area where the "gangsters" from the new government would  not be able to touch them. The hour had arrived for members of  the security forces to make a decision on their allegiance, and  whether they wanted to become "traitors" who fired on women and  children of their own nation.    Mr Terreblanche knew white security force officers were  preparing plans to act against rightwingers. "If you touch one  rightwinger we will donner [hammer] you...," he said, the rest  of the sentence being inaudible by the applause.    While the AWB had been ordered to withdraw from Mmabatho, it  would never withdraw from the Western Transvaal, Mr Terreblanche  said. "If anybody will have to withdraw, it will be the forces  they want to send in against us."    He warned that if the AWB was forced into a fight, it would  fight for the whole South Africa, and then decide where it would  place blacks.    Mr Terreblanche said a chaotic situation would arise in  South  Africa within days or weeks, and then the AWB would restore law  and order and take over the country. "Chaos and order is at the  door. You are not heading for peace and prosperity. You are on  your way to chaos. We don't want war, but we are not white  colonists who will be driven from the country." The enemy would  be levelled with the gravel, Mr Terreblanche said.</p>

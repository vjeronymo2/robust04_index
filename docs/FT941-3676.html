			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Growth in SE Asia behind JIB advance Growth in south east Asia and the strength of the US dollar helped JIB Group, the insurance broker in which the Hong Kong-based Jardine Matheson has a 61 per cent interest, increase its pre-tax profits by 20 per cent in 1993. Profits for the year to the end of December came out at Pounds 21.8m (Pounds 18.2m), at the upper end of expectations. Earnings per share amounted to 11.4p, against 9.9p. The company is recommending an unchanged final dividend of 5p per share, making a same-again total of 7.5p. Profits from south east Asia rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 7.58m (Pounds 5.29m), more than a third of the total. Overall turnover increased by 16 per cent to Pounds 213.7m, while expenses rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 197.7m. After adjusting for the effects of acquisitions and exchange rates, underlying revenues grew by 3 per cent. COMMENT Investors responded positively to yesterday's results marking the shares up 19p to close at 199p. The question, now, after a period of underperformance, is how much more does JIB have to offer? The main problem is the group's dependence on the highly competitive US market for more than a third of its business. With the long-expected turn in the market proving to be something of a mirage, JIB will do well to maintain margins. On the plus side more currency gains are possible and further growth from south east Asia seems likely. Profits for 1994 are forecast at Pounds 25m at least, putting the share on a prospective multiple of 16. The prospect of an 8p dividend this year provides yield support. Even so, some of JIB's rivals among the medium sized insurance brokers may offer better value.</p>

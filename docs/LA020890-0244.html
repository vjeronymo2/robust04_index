			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: LENA HORNE SENDS THANK YOU NOTE FOR 'GLORY'  </P> <P> We get a lot of mail around here; sometimes even the celebrated and the famous  write us to complain, explain, threaten and cajole. So my eyes lit up when I  received a letter from my good friend, the one and only legend, Lena Horne. I  can't improve in any way on Lena's sentiments in this letter, and so here, in  her own words, is what the Lady wants to say:  </P> <P> "I AM writing to ask a tremendous favor. Could you possibly get word to Freddie  Fields (whom I don't know) and tell him how grateful I am for his production of  'Glory'?  </P> <P> "After seeing this powerful picture, when I was able to calm myself emotionally  as I stood in the lobby of the theater, I realized once again that this Civil  War -- more than any other war -- was the most dreadful our country has ever  suffered. And the repercussions from it have never died away. Then my anger  took over, as I realized that never in the history of our public school  curriculum (from my time and up to now) have children been able to study the  glorious past of this country's black citizens in any depth whatsoever. It is  as if we were a ghost race, invisible except for the odd bits and pieces we've  seen on television (the civil rights times of the sixties; "Roots"; some fine  productions on public television).  </P> <P> "But even this material doesn't reach our young people in any great numbers,  and so they -- the ones who can still be saved -- aren't exposed to our black  history in any meaningful, systematic way. Please tell Mr. Fields that I wish  every school child could see 'Glory' -- as much as I wish our young  African-American directors and producers would find it possible to create a  series of short subjects about our past to be shown in the schools, where it  could then be studied and discussed further.  </P> <P> "For myself, knowing who I was and what I came from was my survival kit. I was  fortunate to be born to a family who believed it had a stake in this country,  and made a point of passing on its history to each succeeding generation. My  mother's paternal grandfather was in the mighty 54th Regiment -- one of the  ordinary freed black men who believed they were Americans, and who fought not  just to free slaves. They fought for a united nation, an undivided nation that  believed in its Declaration of Independence and its Constitution.  </P> <P> "Nowadays, that communication between generations and that sense of commitment  seem to have broken down. In this age of drugs and guns, when I find myself  feeling that this generation doesn't give a damn about its past, I have to  remind myself that the fascinating and inspiring heritage I'm talking about is  NOT readily accessible. If we could make this history available to pre-high  school students, perhaps then we could save more of them -- maybe one out of  five. The only hope remaining is the education system."  </P> <P> "From your sister, with a loving heart, and Southern roots, Lena Calhoun  Horne."  </P> <P> AND HERE are my few comments about Freddie's film. It received an "R" rating  although it may be one of the cleanest films in movie history. It has no sex  scenes and no profanity. The MPAA gave it an "R" based on the highly realistic  fighting scenes of the bloodiest battle ever fought in all U.S. wars -- the  Battle of Antietam, in which 40,000 Americans lost their lives in just five  hours.  </P> <P> Producer Fields likes to paraphrase the late Sam Goldwyn. He says, "I don't  care if I don't make a nickel from this picture, but I want every man, woman  and child in America to see it." Let's remember that Fields made "Glory"  against all the odds. Nobody in the industry wanted to handle such a touchy and  difficult subject.  </P></p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Management: Costly burden of tradition - Japan's custom of lifetime employment in return for total loyalty is being questioned Corporate Japan's social contract, of a job for life in return for perpetual loyalty, is coming under question from both sides. A growing number of industrial companies are seeking job reductions among their loyal staff, or moving redundant people to other divisions, in an attempt to cut wage costs during the recession. For them, the tradition of lifetime employment is becoming a costly burden as the rising yen pushes up costs against foreign competitors. At the same time, more employees, especially the young, are starting to accord more importance to their own interests than the company's. Only 20 per cent of staff over 50 have any other interest in life beyond working for the company, but this rises to 38 per cent for 30-year-olds and 43 per cent for 20-year-olds, according to a survey by the Economic Planning Agency. A look at how the management of two very different groups, Toyota, Japan's largest car maker and Mitsubishi Materials, a leading metals and ceramics supplier, respond to these pressures shows that employment structures are at the start of a slow evolutionary change. Toyota started to adjust the social contract last June, when it shifted 20 per cent of its 4,000 white collar administrators into new project divisions, such as strategic planning, environmental assessment or working with suppliers. The move, part of a wider cost-cutting drive, involved no redundancies as might have been the case if Toyota were a western car maker, so it is only a minor adjustment to the social contract. But it is the first time that Toyota has asked staff to take such a step. 'The moves are still at an early stage, but there have been no special difficulties,' says Iwao Isomura, vice-president for personnel. In parallel, Toyota is seeking to employ more people who will stay with the group for only a short time, to improve cost flexibility and to gain access to experts in technologies new to the car industry. 'Maybe it is a good idea to have two types of employees, a stock type and a flow type,' says Tatsuro Toyoda, group president. Although the company regularly employs temporary seasonal workers at its factories, as one of Japan's blue-chip companies, lifetime employment would be the rule for its white collar staff. Putting this philosophy into practice will, however, be very slow. The Japanese education system does not favour the type of person who wishes to map out his own career, says Isomura. Moreover, flexible employment can only work at Toyota if other Japanese companies follow suit, so that staff on the move can find new jobs elsewhere. A handful are thinking along the same lines, including Sony, a perennial Japanese management trendsetter. But some older industrial companies believe Japan should not challenge traditional employment structures lightly. Mitsubishi Materials is a classic example. 'Sony and Toyota are both post-war creations. Our philosophy, as a company with pre-war origins, is very different,' says Takeshi Nagano, chairman of Mitsubishi Materials and president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation. 'People work for us all their lives partly because they know their incomes will rise as they grow older. But we also have a kind of family atmosphere, special to the mining industry, which is one of the origins of Japanese industry,' he says. 'It makes for very stable corporate planning, even if it is not so easy in a recession,' he says. The tradition of lifetime employment will change, he accepts. But it will take a generation - so expect no revolutions.</p>

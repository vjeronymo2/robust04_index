			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Can Britain make it?: Foreign ownership handicaps electronics - FT writers make a closer examination of two sectors that have traditionally been strong, in our series on manufacturing consisting of telecommunications, consumer electronics, information technology and components - seems in better shape today than it has been for many years. The UK now has the fourth largest electronics industry in the world after the US, Japan and Germany. The industry accounted for about 15 per cent of the UK's visible exports last year. A quarter of the large-screen television sets produced in western Europe are made in Britain and 59 per cent of Europe's personal computer production comes from the UK and Ireland. The critical question is whether the health of the sector is sustainable or a transitory phenomenon which could be slowed or reversed by decisions taken abroad. US computer maker Digital Equipment's decision to close its computer manufacturing plant in Galway, Ireland, is a case in point. Mr John Gardner, managing director of computer maker ICL's UK operations, points to the difficulty of drawing conclusions in a global business where manufacturers site production according to market requirements. The Far East is falling out of favour as European manufacturers improve efficiency. Transport and distribution costs are lower when production is geographically close to a company's principal markets, he argues. The bright spots are dazzling. Applied Materials of the US, one of the world's largest makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, carries out the research and development for its most sophisticated instruments in Horsham, West Sussex. The Santa Cruz Operation, a leading US software house, last week bought IXI, a tiny Cambridge company, to acquire IXI's unique technology. These examples, however, illustrate the predicament of the UK industry. Local levels of skill and inventiveness are high but the companies are often in foreign hands. The trade association for consumer electronics manufacturers has 16 members but only one is British-owned. Mr Geoffrey Shingles, chairman of the UK subsidiary of Digital Equipment, is convinced the government should do more to encourage home grown market leaders. 'The UK has always been good at small start-up companies. What we have not done well is to grow companies able to compete at global level,' he says. The result is that Britain's trade deficit in electronics last year was about Pounds 1.4bn but there are signs of improvement. Last year electronics exports were 15 per cent smaller than imports. Ten years ago the gap was twice as large. Some of the improvement is due to recession but the primary reason is extensive foreign investment. The most obvious example is consumer electronics, where the deficit is now only a quarter of the Pounds 1.1bn reached in 1983. Sony started making television sets in south Wales in the 1970s and inward investment accelerated in the last decade. Now the list of UK-made Japanese products includes video recorders from Mitsubishi, compact disc players from Pioneer, mobile phones from NEC and TV sets from Matsushita and JVC. Mr Hugh Peltor, director of Brema, the consumer electronics trade association, says 'We have done well in inward investment.' The recovery in telecommunications has different origins. The privatisation of BT created a wave of demand for new equipment and services from BT and its competitor Mercury in the 1980s. At the same time, the privatisation freed BT to buy equipment from abroad, hence stimulating competition in the home market. In the past couple of years the investment wave has abated, so cutting imports. But at the same time, UK suppliers - chiefly the part-German owned GPT and Canada's Northern Telecom - have been sharpened by competitive pressures. Now they are waiting for the closed and regulated telecommunications markets of mainland Europe to follow the UK's liberalised example. The mainland European markets could offer rich pickings when they are opened. It is thought that Deutsche Bundespost Telekom is paying two to three times as much as BT for comparable German equipment in a tightly regulated market. Computer software has often been touted as an area where the UK should excel. The value of computer software and services purchased worldwide will soon exceed the value of computer hardware. The industry is dominated by US companies such as Microsoft and Lotus, however, and there are no signs the position will change. Nevertheless, the electronics industry gives grounds for modest optimism although nobody should expect it to become a shooting star in the UK's economic firmament. The chief concern is its dependence on inward investment, where fashions may change suddenly and without warning.</p>

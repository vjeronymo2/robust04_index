			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, may 3 KYODO -- Of some 1,000 senior  executives in 38 major Japanese construction companies, 238 were  formerly bureaucrats in government ministries or officials of  local autonomous bodies or of state-run corporations, a labor  union report said Tuesday [3 May].    Of the 238 executives, 67 were from the Construction  Ministry, 30 were from the Agricultural, Forestry and Fisheries  Ministry, 18 from the Transport Ministry and 15 from local  governments, according to the 6,500-member union formed by  workers at public corporations.    It spent about 18 months analyzing lists naming retired  bureaucrats from ministries and tracked their next steps, as  part of its efforts to look into the practice of "amakudari."    "Amakudari," literally meaning descent from heaven, is a  common practice in which retired bureaucrats are hired by  companies or public corporations having connections with the  ministries.    The union also surveyed the whereabouts of 440 retired  career  bureaucrats from the Construction Ministry, with cooperation  from construction firms' labor unions, union officials said.    Of those, 204 were working at private-sector firms, 177 at  nonprofit organizations under the jurisdiction of the  Construction Ministry, 49 were at state-run corporations, while  20 had become politicians and 12 professors, it said.  Twenty-two of the retired bureaucrats held multiple posts, it  added.    Of the 440 retirees, the union discovered that 111 had been  accepted by companies after they had worked at nonprofit  organizations or state-run corporations, union officials said.    The National Public Service law bans bureaucrats from  working  at companies related to their previous ministry duties for two  years after retirement, but they are free to go to public firms.    Some bureaucrats were hired by companies via public  corporations apparently because of the regulation, the officials  said.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Mixed feelings on Italian bonds Italy and Spain are the most favoured European bond markets for the first half of 1994, while Italy and the UK are the least favoured, according to a survey of 70 traders, economists and fund managers by IDEA, the market analysis company, writes Tracy Corrigan. The findings of the survey reflect the strong divergence of views on the Italian market. The survey also showed a wide range of expectations on the performance of the UK gilts market, with predictions for 10-year yields at the end of June ranging from 5.25 per cent to 7.2 per cent with a median of 6.45; they are currently at 6.3 per cent.</p>

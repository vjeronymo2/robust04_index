			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / What to watch for tonight - and when The situation at 20.00 Eastern time (01.00 Wednesday GMT): EASTERN  Polls in nearly half of the states here have been closed for    up to 90 minutes, with the rest closing now, except for New          York and Rhode Island, which do not shut their doors for          another hour (02.00 GMT).  The first results should emerge          from Indiana, with its earliest closing time in the nation.          If President George Bush does not win in this Republican          stronghold, his prospects for re-election are in trouble.          Key states to watch in the North-east, where Governor Bill          Clinton, the Democratic Party challenger, has been leading          in the opinion polls, are New Jersey and Conneticut. Maine,          one of the best hopes for Independent Ross Perot, could offer          pointers to his impact on the race.  To the west, Ohio and        Michigan are critical battlegrounds.          In the South-east, which has generally been Republican          territory in recent presidential elections, Mr Clinton and his          vice-presidential candidate Al Gore, both southerners, hope          for victory in North Carolina and Georgia.  Mr Bush must win          Florida's 25 Electoral College votes to keep his hopes truly          alive. CENTRAL  It is an hour earlier here, but Texas and Illinois are already      closing their polls, with all but two of the other states closing within an hour (21.00 Eastern Time/0.200 GMT).          Watch for Mr Perot's effect on the two main candidates in his          home state of Texas.  Without this state's 32 electoral votes,          Bush campaign officials say, the president cannot be          re-elected.  Mr Clinton is counting on Illinois and its 22          electoral votes.  Other key battlegrounds are the northern          states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. MOUNTAIN More than half of the polls here do not close for another two     hours (22.00 Eastern Time/03.00 GMT).  But results are          expected rapidly in Arizona, Wyoming and Colorado, which offer          Mr Clinton's best chance of winning in this time zone.          Mountain states like Idaho have provided some of Mr Perot's          strongest support in the opinion polls. PACIFIC  People here are just leaving work, and virtually all the polls      are open for another three hours (23.00 Eastern Time/04.00 GMT)   In none of the candidates has secured overall victory by now, California's 54 electoral college votes are likely to prove decisive.  Party managers in California hope that the state's          votes will still be needed: if the presidential election is          already over, voters may decide not to turn out for          congressional races. ALASKA   It is only mid-to-late afternoon in these time zones, with the 3 votes  polls remaining open for another four hours          midnight Eastern Time/0.500 GMT).  Since becoming states in          1959, however, no presidential contest has been close enough          for their electoral votes to have changed the outcome. HAWAII   While Hawaii remains a Democratic fortress, Alaska will be 4 votes  watched closely for the outcome of its elections for Congress,          in which a senator and the state's lone representative, both Republicans, face strong competition. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE: 270 TO WIN The US president is elected, not be national popular vote, but by a simple majority of the 538 Electoral College votes apportioned to the 50 states and the District of Columbia* on the basis of the number of their congressional districts.  Each state has two US senators, and a number of representatives in the House of Representatives based on population. The small state of Rhode Island, for example, has its two senators plus two representatives, giving four electoral votes; California, the most populous state, has its two senators but also 52 representatives, giving it 54 electoral votes. The presidential candidate who receives the majority of a state's popular vote wins the state's entire electoral vote.** For example, a candidate could be elected president by winning only the seven most populous states plus a handful of medium-sized states, no matter by how slim a margin.  In other words, the candidate could win in only about a fifth of the states and still become president. Indeed, the system tends to make elections seem more decisive than they are.  In the past 50 years, the Electoral College victory has generally been fairly wide, whereas the average margin in terms of the popular vote has been less than 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / CBI forecasts manufacturing-led recovery A MANUFACTURING-led rec-overy which will gather strength later this year is predicted today by the Confederation of British Industry. The CBI says manufacturers' order books have strengthened considerably recently, with export orders showing particular growth due to greater competitiveness caused by the pound's devaluation. Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's economics director, warned that the big recent weakening in demand among Britain's trading partners in continental Europe - largely caused by the deepening German recession - remained a threat to a sustained upturn. While the CBI is slightly more bullish about recovery, it says consumer and industry demand remains weak. In particular, stocks of finished goods in factory warehouses are fairly high, indicating that any extra sales of manufactured products may take some time to spark busier production lines. In its latest quarterly forecast the CBI says gross domestic product will increase 1.6 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent next year. In its previous forecast, in March, it said the figures would be 1.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent. Manufacturing output is expected to increase by a respectable 3 per cent this year, helped by the effects of devaluation, higher productivity and sluggish wage growth. In its monthly survey of the commercial outlook facing manufacturers, the CBI found that order books are at their highest levels for three years and expectations about output more optimistic than at any time since February 1989. The CBI says, however, that order books are still rated as 'below normal' by 36 per cent of businesses, with 14 per cent saying they are above normal. Views about output are more positive, with 37 per cent of companies expecting sales volumes to increase in the next four months, and only 14 per cent expecting a decline. Another finding from the monthly survey, conducted among 1,545 companies between April 27 and May 19, is that three out of four manufacturers expect their prices to remain unchanged in the next four months, indicating muted inflationary pressures. The CBI is fairly optimistic about inflation, reckoning that annual growth in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage payments, will be below the Treasury's 4 per cent target until at least the end of 1994.</p>

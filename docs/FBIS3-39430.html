			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Helmut Hetzel report: "Europol Starts Work in The Hague"] </F>   [Text] The Hague -- Europol, the predecessor of a future  European investigative and police organization, was inaugurated  yesterday in The Hague by Dutch Justice Minister Ernst  Hirsch-Ballin and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn. Hirsch-Ballin  thanked Germany in particular for the initiative to establish  Europol. The initiative was initiated by Chancellor Helmut Kohl  a few years ago.    However, in an interview with DIE WELT, Europol chief  Juergen  Storbeck (47) points out that Europol is still in the process of  being established. However, the new authority "already  functions as an information and data exchange for the 12  European Union members," stresses Storbeck, who was a former  head of the Organized Crime Department in the Federal Office of  Criminal Investigations in Wiesbaden. This is particularly  important and helpful for combating organized drug trafficking.  However, it is still unclear whether Europol will, some day,  also have executive powers.    In the long run, Europol can develop into a real European  investigative body, as is set down in the Maastricht Treaty, if  the European Union members agree.    Question to Storbeck: What can Europol/EDU (drug authority)  really do? Storbeck: "If, for instance, the Hamburg police  want information about a person who is wanted in Europe, it can  get this information from us within an hour. In the past,  something like that took days." In addition, Europol is  analyzing the development and trends of crime with the help of a  computer network, which is already working all over the European  Union. "Through this intensive European exchange of data, we  can, for instance, see when the Balkan route in drug trafficking  is shifting and we can tell our colleagues in the individual  countries affected so that corresponding countermeasures can be  taken," Storbeck says. "Or we can inform the respective  national police authorities, such as the Federal Office of  Criminal Investigations, about the emergence of new  international criminal gangs."</p>

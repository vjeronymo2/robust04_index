			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: HEALTH CARE;  </P> <P> BIRTCHER CORP. MOVES TO IRVINE, EXPECTS CONFUSION ON NAME  </P> <P> For years, Orange County has been the home of a commercial development firm,  owned by the Birtcher family, that eschews use of labels such as "company" or  "group" and simply goes by the name Birtcher.  </P> <P> Now there's a new Birtcher organization in the county, one that makes  electronic surgical instruments.  </P> <P> It has no business connection with the Birtcher development firm in Laguna  Niguel.  </P> <P> But it shares the Birtcher name because it was founded 53 years ago by a member  of the same family.  </P> <P> The Birtcher Corp., formerly of El Monte, has moved its corporate headquarters  to the Irvine Spectrum industrial park to consolidate its operations with those  of a Denver-based company it acquired last year from C.R. Bard Inc.  </P> <P> In September, about 65 employees transferred from El Monte. And by the end of  January, 80 positions will be transferred from Denver to Birtcher Corp.'s new  67,000-square-foot Irvine facility, said Dan Whelan, the company's chief  financial officer.  </P> <P> Whelan said last year's acquisition was a big step for Birtcher Corp., which  had only $6.9 million in sales. The C.R. Bard unit it bought has annual sales  of $15 million.  </P> <P> Birtcher Corp. makes surgical instruments used by dermatologists and plastic  surgeons, and the acquisition gave it a new line of surgical products to sell  to hospitals.  </P> <P> Whelan said that some confusion has arisen from the corporation stepping into  an area where the Birtcher name is most readily identified with the Birtcher  commercial developers.  </P> <P> So, to lessen the confusion and broadcast a clearer picture of its business,  Birtcher Corp. plans to change its name to Birtcher Medical Systems at its  annual meeting next week, Whelan said.  </P> <P> The sharing of the Birtcher name by two enterprises is no coincidence, said Art  Birtcher, co-chairman of the development company. He said the medical company  was founded by his uncle Cecil, the elder brother of his father, F.E. Birtcher  -- founder of the development enterprise.  </P> <P> When Cecil Birtcher died in the early 1960s, Art said, other members of the  Birtcher family sold their interest in the medical company, which, unlike the  development enterprise, is publicly traded.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Colombia's industrialists and businessmen have said  a referendum is needed to determine whether minimum doses of  drugs for personal consumption should be legalized. Alberto  Vasquez Restrepo, president of CAMACOL [Colombian Chamber of  Construction], spoke on behalf of 14 economic associations.    [Begin Vasquez recording] As we said in a communique sent to  the president today, we are absolutely dumbfounded. This  decision has really taken the country by surprise and we have  asked the president to invoke the constitutional right to  consult the people on any subject. This right to a referendum  is needed more than ever today, considering that there is no  higher body above the Constitutional Court to which this  decision can be appealed in order to abolish or modify it. [end  recording].</p>

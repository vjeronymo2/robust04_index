			<p>BFN     [Text] Share prices plunged across the board on the Korea  Stock Exchange for the second consecutive day yesterday amidst  escalating worries about the worsening crisis over the North  Korean nuclear issue.    The composite stock price index, a yardstick of local stock  prices, nose-dived more than 15 points in the morning session to  914, breaking the psychological mark of 920 points at the outset  of the session, but the early losses were partially recouped in  the afternoon session, thanks to bargain-hunting strength. The  index fell 8.54 points to close at 921.72 yesterday. The stock  market closed at 930.26 last week.    During last week, the price index lost 15.02 points, which  was equal to about 1.02 points, which was equal to about 1.02  percent drop in going market value of stocks listed on the  exchange.    Market analysts said the plunge in share prices for two  consecutive days -- Saturday and yesterday -- was caused by  investors' concern about the North Korean nuclear issue, which  took a sharp turn for the worse when the United States, in  coordination with Korea and Japan, moved to place sanctions  against North Korea as Pyongyang has failed to abide by the  IAEA's inspection procedures. The allies also weighed possible  military options.    Most investors, both institutional and individuals, remained  on the sidelines with some investors resorting to panic selling.    Such volume leaders as trading, banking and  construction-related issues, which remained steady until Friday,  lost ground as did other blue chip issues. Some  telecommunications and oil-related issues, however, were  actively traded in the morning session, thanks to enthusiasm in  selective buying.    Stock brokers said that share prices will likely remain  depressed for the time being with possible technical  fluctuations as long as tension on the Korean Peninsula remains  unchanged.</p>

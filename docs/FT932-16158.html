			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Leading Article: Nigeria in crisis IN THE FIELD of economic mismanagement, Nigeria is in a class of its own. Billions of dollars earned during the 1970s oil boom have been squandered on white elephants and kickbacks. An economic reform plan, introduced by President Ibrahim Babangida in 1986, collapsed within three years. Since then frequent promises to do better have not been kept. In short, calling for help for Nigeria seems akin to supporting parole for a notorious recidivist. Yet the case for supporting economic reform in Nigeria is stronger today than ever, despite this dismal track record. Burdened by debts and accelerating inflation, and nearing the end of a flawed transition to civilian rule which encourages the short-term instincts of the presidential candidates in June's election, there is a risk that Nigeria will experience a Kenyan-style swing to economic populism or worse. The oil and gas sector might still flourish; but export receipts would be siphoned abroad as the impoverished hinterland deteriorated further. The west might feel able to look on with equanimity in the short term. Arrears on the country's Dollars 30bn external debt are mounting; but capital flow is in the creditors' favour. Their advice to Nigeria is straightforward: proceed with the June election, but forget the idea of concessional debt anytime soon. Yet a longer term perspective demands an urgent search for a fresh approach. Ten years of deepening austerity have exacted a heavy toll on Nigeria. Sooner or later, the strains will become intolerable, risking the destabilisation of the entire west African region in the process. A surge in Moslem extremism, lying not far below the surface in Nigeria, and a rise in emigration to southern Europe are two likely consequences. The UN initiative in Somalia has already cost Dollars 1.5bn; the cost of restoring order in west Africa would be incalculable. Creditors must grasp what may be a last opportunity to persuade Nigeria's leaders that economic reform makes sense. Of course, the creditors cannot offer debt relief unless they are convinced that the budget deficit is under control - the principle of an IMF deal as a pre-condition for relief should remain inviolate. But the IMF should use this month's visit to Nigeria to draw up a 'shadow' reform programme with the reform-minded transitional council. The elected government can then inherit this programme at the August hand-over. In return the Paris Club creditors should pledge that staged debt relief will commence as soon as the budget is under control. Conditions should include external monitoring of the central bank and important ministries to ensure transparent accounting of incoming revenues and spending. Only then might the west persuade both the military leadership and the new civilian president to put prudence before populism. It may not succeed. But it would be better than simply waiting for Nigeria's disaster to happen.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY HALL IS BIGGEST DRAIN ON L.A.'S SUPPLY OF WATER  </P> <P> As the fourth year of a statewide drought unfolds, Los Angeles' biggest water  user -- the city government itself -- is consuming more than ever, and two  major city departments are violating an emergency water conservation law  adopted two years ago.  </P> <P> Department of Water and Power records show that water use by city agencies has  climbed by about 1.3% -- or 104 million gallons of water a year -- since 1986  when Mayor Tom Bradley first asked for the public's help in reducing  consumption.  </P> <P> Overall water use in Los Angeles has dropped by an estimated 4% to 8% during  the same period, according to DWP figures.  </P> <P> A week ago, Mayor Bradley called on all citizens to increase their conservation  to 10% compared to usage four years ago.  </P> <P> This week he sent a memo to all city departments telling officials that "it is  the city of Los Angeles' responsibility to set a good example for residents,"  and he asked each of them to find ways to cut their usage by the same 10%.  </P> <P> The city government of Los Angeles is the largest water consumer in the region,  but officials acknowledge that they do not have a handle on water use by the  hundreds of city facilities. In response to a Times inquiry, it took five days  for officials to determine how much water was being used by city departments.  </P> <P> DWP figures show that three departments -- Recreation and Parks, the Housing  Authority and DWP Power Generation -- are individually ranked among the top 10  water users in the city, along with UCLA, Caltrans and Anheuser-Busch Inc.  </P> <P> Bradley and other city officials said cutting water use will be difficult for  many city departments.  </P> <P> "Patterns are hard to break," the mayor said.  </P> <P> Even the DWP's own water division -- which posted a 29% increase in its water  consumption during the past three years -- is unsure just how to cut use.  </P> <P> Officials said most of the water increase was for landscaping at a new  filtration facility in the San Fernando Valley. "(During) the first year or two  of this drought-tolerant landscaping, you need to apply a fair amount of  water," said Henry Venegas, assistant director of water engineering.  </P> <P> "Asking our employees to not go to the bathroom or not take a drink of water is  not in the cards," Venegas added.  </P> <P> Like the DWP, a number of city departments said their increased water  consumption is the result of expansion of services, staff and facilities. And  many agencies -- such as the Recreation and Parks and General Services  departments -- have taken important steps to control their water use.  </P> <P> But the efforts of others appear to have fallen short.  </P> <P> For example, a Department of Airports official proudly explained that in  response to Bradley's call, the department is hosing down sidewalks once a week  instead of three times a week.  </P> <P> However, it has been illegal to wash down sidewalks, parking lots or other hard  surfaces in the city for the past two years. Under Phase 1 of the city's  emergency water conservation ordinance, it also is illegal to serve water in  restaurants except on request, or to operate decorative fountains that do not  recycle water.  </P> <P> "I didn't understand that," said Clifton Moore, executive director of the  Department of Airports. "Well, then we'll cut it down to zero."  </P> <P> James Hadaway, general manager of the Recreation and Parks Department, said his  crews have cut hosing of tennis and basketball courts from once a week to once  a month. "We view it as a safety issue," said Hadaway about the continued  hosing in the face of the ban. "We don't feel we are in violation."  </P> <P> Officials at the DWP, which enforces the conservation ordinance, said they have  not received any complaints about the two departments but have asked their  staff to look into the matter. The law calls for sending warning letters to  offenders for the first two violations, installation of a flow restricter for  the third violation and discontinued service for a fourth violation. To date,  no one has received more than a second warning letter.  </P> <P> The mayor and other city officials acknowledge that they do not know how much  water is used by individual city facilities.  </P> <P> It would take weeks, officials said, to come up with water consumption figures  for individual facilities.  </P> <P> Two years ago, the City Council ordered the chief administrative office to  design a computer program to provide such information. Officials say it will  take at least another year to finish the program.  </P> <P> When asked to comment on the situation, Mayor Bradley said this week, "They  have a lot to do. Sometimes it takes an extra push." Earlier this week, Bradley  had asked Chief Administrative Officer Kieth Comrie to make the project "a top  priority."  </P> <P> Facilities managers told The Times that without that information they cannot  gauge their consumption or the effectiveness of their conservation efforts.  </P> <P> "I don't know that anyone knows how many water meters we have," Recreation and  Parks' Hadaway said. "I'm serious."  </P> <P> His department is one of those that have adopted water conservation measures,  such as water sensors and high-technology irrigation systems.  </P> <P> The park department's water usage has gone up by about 8% during the last three  years, which Hadaway said is most likely because of new facilities.  </P> <P> At the Department of Airports, usage has gone up by 18.5%. Moore said it was  probably because of an increase in business and the opening of a new terminal.  Department records show that the number of passengers went up by just 8.9%.  Moore said he could ask his engineers to explain the water use increase but it  could take days or weeks to get an answer.  </P> <P> City departments showing a decrease in water use also have been unaware for  years of their consumption levels.  </P> <P> The Bureau of Sanitation showed the biggest drop in use, according to DWP  figures.  </P> <P> "Amazing," said bureau Director Del Biagi when told that his department cut  water use by 42% from fiscal 1986-87 to fiscal 1988-89.  </P> <P> "I have no idea why," he said. "We're not doing anything different that I know  of. I can only assume they've moved the payment from our department to some  other department. . . . I wish I had a great story to tell you."  </P> <P> Despite the consumption increase, the city has taken steps to cut water use.  </P> <P> The General Services Department has installed low-flush valves on 2,572 toilets  and 726 shower heads at 850 city facilities, including police and fire  stations, libraries and City Hall. Officials said that should save 46 million  gallons a year.  </P> <P> The Department of Airports has replaced fixtures in 100 restrooms and has a  water recycling system for its carwash.  </P> <P> Recreation and Parks moved most of its automated watering to nighttime, began  using reclaimed sewage water to irrigate golf courses in Griffith Park and  stopped using water in ponds that do not recycle water -- such as the casting  pond in Cheviot Hills Park.  </P> <P> More recently, Fire Chief Donald Manning said firefighters will conduct  training drills without water. Manning also ordered that water for testing fire  hoses be taken from park lakes and pumped back into those lakes whenever  possible.  </P> <P> "The Fire Department is acutely aware of its responsibility to conserve water  due to the critical dependence it plays in saving lives and property in an  emergency," Manning said.  </P> <P> Bradley said all departments will save more water. "They'll get the message  from the mayor," he said.  </P> <P> Late Friday, Bradley instructed the DWP to dispatch audit teams to help city  departments adopt water-saving measures.  </P> <P> </P> <P>

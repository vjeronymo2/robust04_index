			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / A Tory Icarus falls to earth: The chequered career of an error-prone politician The eternally optimistic Lord Archer may not believe it, but his admission that purchasing Anglia Television shares was a 'grave error' almost certainly marks the end of his political career. Lord Archer was 12,000 miles away from the controversy yesterday, signing copies of his latest volume of short stories on a long-planned promotional tour of Australia. But Tory MPs said there was no doubt that Lord Archer's statement delivered the quietus to his long-running campaign for ministerial or Conservative party office. A senior backbencher said: 'All this is a great shame, because he really has a lot of talent. The party certainly needs talent, but even Jeffrey can't come back from this.' It has been a roller-coaster ride. Elected to the Commons before he was 30, Lord Archer fell into severe financial difficulties after an unwise investment and was out of the House within five years. His first novel, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, restored his solvency within three years. A string of best-sellers made him a multi-millionaire within a decade. For a while Lord Archer's star was firmly in the ascendant as he used his wealth and undoubted campaigning ability to help the Conservative party. Baroness Thatcher made him deputy chairman of the party in 1985, with a brief to go out and enthuse the grassroots activists. A year later he resigned after a tabloid newspaper claimed that a gift of Pounds 2,000 to a prostitute was intended to stop her revealing that he had slept with her. Lord Archer won Pounds 500,000 damages against the newspaper in a spectacular 1987 libel case that cleared his name. But political rehabilitation has been more difficult to achieve. Many senior Conservatives, including some who have shared his hospitality, made clear in the wake of the case that his ebullient approach to life was not to their taste. Lord Archer retained the support of Lady Thatcher but the libel case consolidated a reputation for erratic behaviour which he has never been able to shake off. Lord Archer has remained an active politician, however, making hundreds of speeches to Conservative supporters on the 'rubber chicken' circuit, and throwing glittering political parties. For a while he seemed on the way to full political rehabilitation, emerging as a close friend of Mr John Major after he replaced Lady Thatcher in Downing Street. Mr Major, who admires Lord Archer's zest and loyalty, recommended him for a peerage but has not succumbed to the temptation to give him a government job. In what looked like a last throw Lord Archer's friends reported earlier this year that he would withdraw from active politics if he failed to win a ministerial or party role in Mr Major's summer reshuffle. Some Tories said Lord Archer would be a good junior minister in a relatively unimportant portfolio such as sport, but it is unlikely that the prime minister ever seriously considered giving him a job. Senior MPs were hoping yesterday that Lord Archer would continue to campaign for the party. But prospects of a return to government have been dashed by the shadow cast over his political judgment by the Anglia revelations. In the end, one minister said yesterday, Lord Archer was simply too self-confident for his own good. 'Jeffrey is the classic Icarus,' he said. 'As far as his political career is concerned, this is RIP.'</p>

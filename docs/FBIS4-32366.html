			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 22 June (MTI) -- One of the most important  results Hungary's outgoing government has achieved is the  partial compensation of the politically persecuted of the  communist era, and those whose properties were nationalized  without any refund. So far, over 1.3 million applications have  been accepted, and further 600,000 additional claims were  submitted at the beginning of this year. The state allocated  compensation coupons exceeding a nominal value of 100 billion  forints [HUF] (approx. $1 billion), and experts expect 1.5 times  as many to be distributed in the future. The new government  intends to speed up the process.    Compensation began three years ago. The parties of the 1990  government coalition (Hungarian Democratic Forum, Independent  Smallholders' Party, Christian Democratic People's Party)  focussed on compensating people who lost their porperties in the  late 1940's or early 1950's. They believed that citizens kept  in custody or deported for political reasons should be similarly  treated. Later the government included the victims of fascism  and their relatives.    The economic condition of Hungary not allowing to pay total  damages, the government only initiated partial compensation.  The opposition parties fully agreed to settling grievances on  moral levels, but excluded financial means foreseeing this would  further saddle the economy.    Being in majority, government parties could get their will  through in parliament. Over 900,000 people have been  compensated for lost properties, and over 300,000 for having  been politically persecuted.    In case of nationalized properties, the entitled ones have  received compensation coupons in proportion to their losses.  These coupons can be sold, as well as used for purchasing state  assets or land. They could be also exchanged for annuities.  Nearly half a million people acquired land through compensation.    Compensation coupons have also been introduced on the stock  exchange, their rate of exchange depending on the shares in  state companies available for them. Their rate of exchange  reached a peak at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994,  when prospering state firms that have been introduced on the  stock market regularly offered their shares for coupons. Those  who were patient enough bought shares and later could sell them  on the stock market well above the nominal value of the  compensation coupons. Many people, especially the elderly,  decided not to wait for the issuance of shares, but sold their  coupons at the daily exchange rate or below, thus obtaining a  much smaller amount than possible. Some individuals and brokers  who bought coupons at low prices managed to accumulate  significant fortunes. If spent on state properties, the  interest rates of compensation coupons are included in their  exchange rate.    The Compensation Office and its auxiliary offices, employing  a staff of 1,200, have already judged 1.5 million applications,  most of them favorably. According to general opinion, they have  successfully overcome bureaucratic delays. After four decades,  many found it difficult to certify their once-owned properties.  In cases like that, the officials only required two witnesses  for testifying the genuineness of a claim. Yet the number and  value of shares fell far behind the quantity and nominal value  of compensation coupons. Therefore, banks were flooded by huge  crowds at issuing times.    The former opposition parties that won the May 1994  elections  promised they would continue compensation as prescribed by law.  There is some uncertainty, however, over the extent of the  possible realization of their intentions. According to their  recent statements, one of the first moves of the Socialists will  be to cut central spending, and implement a tight monetary  policy. They wish to continue privatization with more  efficiency and with simultaneous efforts to reduce unemployment.  The question is how the allocation of over HUF200 billion  private investment can be fitted into this programme, knowing  there has been only HUF30 million coverage used for the  open-ended compensation coupons issued so far.</p>

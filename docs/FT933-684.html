			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: Phelim McDermott's Goldoni - Theatre The director/adaptor/performer Phelim McDermott is a fascinating oddball. Onstage, his physical talent is so eccentric and memorable that you remember him more as a mime than as an actor: witness his Quixotic-fantastico account of Matamore in Richard Jones's The Illusion (Old Vic, 1990). Yet he has rare vocal gifts too - his cleft-palate effects as Camille in the Nottingham Playhouse's 1991 Flea in her Ear haunt me - and he thinks sufficiently in purely sonic terms to have co-devised Radio 4's recent Masterson Inheritance. As that series showed, he is one of Britain's leading priests of comic improvisation. Another recent branch of his career has been directing plays. In visual terms, his Nottingham Dr Faustus last year had all the bizarre fantasy that has marked McDermott's own performances, but was weak in projecting Marlowe's poetic drama. How smart of Leeds's West Yorkshire Playhouse (which has a fine record for comedy) to have him direct a Goldoni play. Without a vivid sense of fantasy, Goldoni's plays can fizzle away into trite formula. With it, they can be inspired. McDermott's account of The Servant of Two Masters has some corny patches, but in essence it manages to be crazy, humane, bizarre, sweet, imaginative, all at the same time. In few plays are plot and sub-plot more tightly coupled than here. Indeed, which is the sub-plot? You hardly know. Beatrice, disguised as her dead brother Federigo, is looking for her lover Florindo. Clarice, who had been betrothed to Federigo though she had never met him, is horrified to find that 'Federigo' (Beatrice) has come back to life (and to marry her; horrified because she is in love with her new fiance, Silvio. Meanwhile, 'Federigo''s new servant Truffaldino is so under-fed that he also takes up employment with Florindo. For a long while, Florindo and Beatrice never meet; while Truffaldino's efforts to serve them both are the material of perfect farce - climaxing when he has to serve them both lunch, in different rooms, at the same time. The setting is Venice; and McDermott's designer, Julian Crouch, has constructed a wonderful cartoon little Venice onstage, with five or more black-and-white architectural layers packed close together, creating interiors and exteriors, upper and lower levels. The action occurs in a single day: delectably and simply shown by a portable yellow sun, which is moved from dawn to dusk in a huge arc. (In the twilight finale, the sun-disc is simply turned around, to become a moon.) Music is sparingly supplied by Geraldine Connor, mainly sung wordlessly by the cast and during scene-changes, in the vein of Alessandro Swingle Scarlatti. Toby Jones plays the title role, very engagingly, like Just William - a schoolboy in shorts, specs and cap who tries to steer the grown-ups' lives to suit his own. This brilliantly novel, touching, and huggable interpretation makes fresh sense of the old Harlequin role (and he wields his specs like Eric Morecambe). McDermott has used improvisation to build up certain comedy scenes here - but it is Jones who best understands the spontaneity that must run through Goldoni. When, in the middle of negotiating one giddy imbroglio, he turns to us and says 'I'm making this up as I go along,' we believe him - and yet that line turns out to be in the script. McDermott's other most bliss-inducing comic interpreters are three deadpan servants (John Axon, David Bliss, Malcolm Ridley) who scarcely speak a word. They provide sound effects, act as porters, try to support Truffaldino in the great waiting-at-two-different-tables scene, and heighten the comedy's whole sense of precariousness. Elsewhere, however, too much dialogue is laboured out front as if the audience was Very Stupid. Robert Kingswell's Pantalone and John Muirhead's Doctor are the most effortful and unfunny. Crouch's designs have a few minor errors of taste: eg Beatrice's cone-shaped wig of straw. But Toby Sedgwick (Florindo), William Waghorn (Silvio), Catherine Kanter (her professional debut - Clarice) and Isobel Middleton (Beatrice), keep up the mix of humanity and absurdity that is the breath of life to Goldoni and McDermott alike. At the Quarry Theatre, West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, until October 16</p>

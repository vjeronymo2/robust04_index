			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Equity Markets: US investors help ease the indigestion - London The reappearance of US buyers at the end of last week rescued London from what was beginning to look like prolonged post-Christmas indigestion. Friday afternoon is not usually the best time to take the market's temperature, but there had been previous indications that the mid-week fall of just over 100 points from the FT-SE closing peak of 3,462 at the end of December was probably no more than an acceptable bout of profit-taking. The lead is coming from the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which gained more than 3 per cent last week, much of it while the FT-SE 100 Index was moving uncertainly. Institutional fund managers, as well as private investors, are buying the Mid 250 stocks not just because the potential gains are greater, but because faith in economic recovery remains solid. The Mid 250 Index is the entry point for the range of capital goods stocks, a sector which attracts institutional cash both from home and abroad. The focus on the futures-related Footsie stocks in the run-up to Christmas may have cheated the Mid 250 stocks of their share of investor optimism. The blue chip issues which make up the FT-SE 100 list are still strongly - perhaps too strongly - influenced by the March contract on the Footsie future, which is more erratic than in the days when it carried equities to peaks every day. The FT-SE 100 stocks have become less reliable on their own account, as fund managers have shown themselves more selective. Much of last week's recovery leaned heavily on strength in BP, Shell and the lesser oil stocks, which will remain dependent on prospects for a fresh attempt by Opec to cut production and raise crude oil prices. No Opec move is likely this week, and the absence from the week's company reporting list of the big store companies offers further respite. The profits warning from Dixons proved a false alarm for the sector but any true upswing in the mainline retailers must wait upon profit figures from the leaders. Shares in Kingfisher, Sears and Marks &amp; Spencer have heavily underperformed since the market went into orbit at the beginning of December, and the confidence in recovery in the economy needs underpinning from these monarchs of the consumer spending jungle. Banking stocks, stars of the most recent advance in share prices, are poised to report 1993 results, with TSB expected to lead the way at the end of this week. But the banking results are unlikely to affect overall views on the market's direction. If the US funds still rate the UK market high on their buying lists - and a number of brokerage houses support that view - then the stock market should see the effects this week as business returns to full throttle after the curtailed post-Christmas week. Barring any upsets from the over-the-counter options arena or from global oil prices, the blue chips are likely to continue to shake off the profit-takers. But the Footsie may have to run hard to catch up with the Mid 250 Index.</p>

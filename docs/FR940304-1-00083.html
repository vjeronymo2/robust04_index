			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department conducted literature searches on purchasing and usage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions in low-income households, to determine whether the inputs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer analysis should be adjusted to account for differences between low-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and average-income households. There was no information available on which to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base any changes to the consumer analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Lighting Prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another consumer issue was raised by Valmont Electric, which stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new energy conservation standards on fluorescent ballasts would raise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail prices of such ballasts, thereby impeding the conversion from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incandescent lighting to fluorescent lighting. (Valmont Electric, No. 16 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conversions from incandescent lighting to fluorescent lighting occurs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principally through compact fluorescent bulbs, the ballasts of which are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included as part of the review of the legislated fluorescent ballast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation standards. Any revised energy conservation standards on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fluorescent ballasts will not affect the prices of compact fluorescent bulbs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and thereby slow the conversion from incandescent to fluorescent lighting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Heat Pump Water Heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the issue of consumer acceptance of heat pump water heaters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Crispaire Corporation stated that studies show consumer satisfaction with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> them. (Crispaire Corporation, No. 19 at 1). In addition, the company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided attachments with estimates of unit energy consumption and annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance factors for heat pump and resistance water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department appreciates the information provided and used the cited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies in developing data for the consumer analysis and forecasting efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Appliance Lifetimes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments discussed product lifetimes. Wisconsin Blue Flame Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that pilot lights decrease condensate, thereby extending the tank life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of gas water heaters. (Wisconsin Blue Flame Council, No. 33 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department based product lifetimes on an analysis comparing recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement sales to historical shipments, and researched the effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular design options on product life.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air Energy Heat Systems said that the lifetime of heat pumps for pool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters is approximately the same as for air conditioning, if the water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemistry of the pool is maintained in proper balance. (Air Energy Heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Systems, No. 44 at 1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department did not analyze heat pump pool heaters because no test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure is available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Modeling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were several issues raised with regard to the forecasting efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the analyses. For example, Natural Resources Defense Council suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Department model uncertainty, not point forecasts in economic growth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and consumer choice and further suggested that the Department could model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncertainties in economic growth by modeling high-, mid-, and low-growth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenarios. (Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 13 at 35&hyph;36).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that all forecasts contain uncertainties. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal method by which DOE has accounted for uncertainties has been through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity analyses, which, in the past, have been performed on equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices, energy prices, projected equipment efficiencies and market discount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates (the last of which models uncertainties in consumer choices of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department favors an explicit representation of the uncertainty in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the forecasts. Clearly, the best representation would be a statistical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of the uncertainty in each of the important variables, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coefficients used in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Model. At this time, however, such a specification of the distribution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each of the variables and coefficients does not exist. As the Lawrence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model is updated, such distributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be generated, which will allow the Department to work towards the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability to perform an uncertainty analysis in the model. Until then, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department will model uncertainties with sensitivities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Apec - future global powerhouse or mere talking shop? / The choice facing Asia Pacific nations When the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum held its first annual summit in Seattle a year ago, a curious European Commission asked to send observers. The request was rejected. 'The reason was simple,' says one Asian diplomat. 'We didn't want them to discover there was nothing to discover.' As ministers of Apec's 17 governments meet in Jakarta today to prepare for next Tuesday's summit, the stakes look much higher. The summit poses a stiff test of their political will to give substance to a grouping which has so far been long on visionary statements but short on concrete decisions. Optimists hope the five-year-old Apec will set out to become a global economic powerhouse by agreeing a long-term timetable for freeing all trade and investment flows in a region which extends from Labrador to Singapore. Apec's members include some of the world's fastest-growing economies and account for roughly half its total gross domestic product and international trade. But there are wide disparities between individual countries' levels of economic development and their views on Apec's role. Bilateral relations between some of them are acutely strained - most notably by US trade conflicts with China and Japan and by Washington's criticisms of Indonesia's human rights record. If these tensions bubble up into acrimonious disputes in Jakarta, they risk scuppering the search for harmony and casting shadows over Apec's future. The starting point for the talks is an ambitious blueprint drafted by an eminent persons' group, chaired by Dr Fred Bergsten, head of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics. It proposes that all trade barriers in Apec be abolished by 2020, and by 2010 in the case of industrialised countries. Other blocs, such as the European Union, would be invited to make reciprocal concessions in a move to force the pace of multilateral trade liberalisation. The plan's most enthusiastic supporters are Australia, which is eager to stress its Asian credentials, and Indonesia. President Suharto views the summit as a chance to set his seal on history and wants an even earlier deadline for Apec free trade. At the other extreme, Malaysia remains sceptical of the value of Apec and continues to press for a rival East Asian Economic Caucus to counter western economic domination. Still, Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, who boycotted the Seattle meeting, plans to attend this summit, and President Suharto may yet persuade him to tone down his opposition. Much the biggest uncertainties concern China and the US. The former, long lukewarm about Apec, has threatened to block progress unless Washington softens its line on Beijing's application to join the new World Trade Organisation in January. Ms Wu Yi, China's trade minister, is expected to step up the pressure when she meets Mr Mickey Kantor, President Clinton's chief trade negotiator, in Jakarta on Saturday. However, Beijing may be over-estimating Apec's importance as a bargaining chip with Washington. Much has changed since President Bill Clinton talked up Apec's future at last year's summit, in the belief that a united stand by Pacific Rim countries would induce the EU to give ground in the stalled Uruguay Round trade talks. Today, with prospects for congressional ratification of the Round on a knife edge, the administration's priorities are reversed. It seems decidedly wary of any trade initiatives which could fuel domestic opposition to the Round. President Clinton's position has been further undermined by the Democrats' loss of control of both houses of Congress in Tuesday's mid-term elections. He may therefore be hard-pressed to offer any immediate concessions on China's WTO entry, or to back any Apec decision which committed the US to lowering its trade barriers substantially. 'Mr Clinton wants a big public relations success in Jakarta which ties his hands as little as possible,' says a US trade policy expert. Though Apec leaders may agree a long-term commitment to liberalisation, he thinks they may endorse only uncontroversial proposals in areas such as customs procedures, standards and voluntary investment principles. Mr Kim Chul-su, South Korea's trade minister, also doubts the summit will set a binding timetable for liberalisation and says such an agreement may take at least a further year to achieve. Such an anodyne outcome need not constitute complete failure in the eyes of Apec's Asian members. Many see the grouping less as a forum for sweeping policy decisions than as a channel for informal dialogue, particularly with the US, their largest final market. Most would resist any attempt to turn Apec into a formal institution. They fear such a step could threaten the future primacy of the WTO and encourage the US to use Apec as a club to force them into making trade concessions. Many Asian countries also want to push ahead with efforts to free trade within Asia before embarking on any programme involving Washington. Some observers believe little progress in Apec is likely until the recent decision by the six-member Association of South East Asian Nations to try to revive plans for an Asian free trade area has borne fruit. Though the plans remain tentative and face big hurdles, Mr Chuan Leekpai, Thailand's prime minister, says Apec is 'a looser form of grouping with less depth' than Asean. In his view, Apec's main contribution to trade liberalisation will be to encourage efforts under way in other forums, rather than to launch substantive programmes of its own. Ambivalence also runs deep in Japan. Though the government appears ready to back a summit declaration endorsing broad free-trade principles, Tokyo wants to avoid any decisions which could force it to choose between its allegiances to Asia and to the US. Some Apec members have questioned the value of any declaration which does not bind governments to at least some concrete action. But even if the summit endorsed a long-term liberalisation programme, implementation would still require complex negotiations. These would have to overcome fundamental conceptual differences between Apec's members, which even the carefully-drafted Bergsten report fails to hide. 'The report is riddled with contradictions,' says Dr Young Soogil, a leading South Korean trade economist.  ----------------------------------------------------                 INTRAREGIONAL TRADE  ---------------------------------------------------- Percentage of total world trade  ---------------------------------------------------- Region           1938    55    69    79    85    90  ---------------------------------------------------- East Asia        10.0   2.2   2.9   4.2   6.4   7.9 North America     3.0   6.7   6.9   4.2   6.4   5.3 Pacific region   18.0  13.5  16.9  15.8  24.8  24.6 Western Europen  18.2  19.6  26.7  29.3  27.1  33.8  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank staff estimates, Petri  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

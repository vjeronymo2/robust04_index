			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Bronshteyn and Vasiliy Kononenko: "Leaders </F> Demonstrate New Approaches in Kazan, While Entourage Display  Proven Methods of Window-Dressing"]    [Text] Kazan -- "I have been well and truly hammered and  criticized for the treaty with Tatarstan, but I have nonetheless  proved to be right." B. Yeltsin began his two-day visit to  Tataria [Tatarstan] with this statement, which had to all  appearances been thought out in his Kremlin office. In order  that there should be no doubts as to the correctness of his  chosen way of saving the federation, the president rephrased the  sensational statement that he had made in Kazan in 1990 as  follows: "Tatarstan has assumed as many powers under the treaty  as it was able to assume. We are satisfied with what has been  left to federal organs. This is the first treaty of its kind  and it is important for me to see with my own eyes how it is  being put into practice."    There is every indication that B. Yeltsin is pleased with  the  result of the operation of the hard-won treaty on the  delimitation of powers, which has stabilized relations between  Moscow and Kazan, and intends to pay attention mainly to purely  practical matters.    In turn Tatarstan's President M. Shaymiyev, answering a  question from your IZVESTIYA correspondent, also said: "We need  to strengthen the trust that has emerged on the basis of the  treaty. In my view, it (trust) does now exist, we need to set  about organizing the economic relations that are normal for a  market."    B. Yeltsin had to demonstrate the success of the idea of  national accord founded on compromise. Against the backdrop of  events in the Crimea, the treaty with Tataria is seen by  analysts as an example of a well-considered flexible policy.  Similar treaties are being prepared for certain other regions  of Russia, in particular with Kabardino-Balkaria, Krasnodar  Kray, and Udmurtia.    B. Yeltsin was extremely interested in the experience of  crime-fighting in Naberezhnyye Chelny and the republic as a  whole. (During a conversation with your IZVESTIYA correspondent  [Russian Interior Minister] V. Yerin did not hide his delight at  the emergency measures that have in the last year made it  possible to partially curb young criminal groupings in the  republic).    As for local nationalists declaring Yeltsin "persona non  grata" in Tatarstan, they believe that the Russian president has  not kept his word that he gave in 1990 regarding Kazan's  sovereignty -- M. Shaymiyev retorted with undisguised  irritation: "Nothing ever pleases them." Nevertheless he  reaffirmed: Official Kazan favors peace with Moscow, and  window-dressing verging on insanity was organized within the  framework of this policy.    In this case the hurried asphalting of roads and streets is  a  mere bagatelle. Actions on a state scale have been organized  in places where Yeltsin is staying. Homes and balconies have  been cleaned, store windows have been done up, and streets  blocked for days. Thousands of militia personnel have been  assembled in Naberezhnyye Chelny and Kazan. Regrettably, the  military have not always remembered their duty and humanity.    During the afternoon of 30 May a fire broke out in an  apartment block on Uprising Street where the presidential  cortege was to have passed. Despite a large concentration of  militia forces none of the military came to help a woman who  leaped out of the blazing apartment onto the balcony. To her  good fortune the personnel of a store on the first floor  displayed quick thinking. They grabbed a rug off the shelf,  stretched it down over the sidewalk, and the girl jumped from  the fifth floor. She was taken to the hospital with serious  injuries and burns. Firefighters had barely put out the flames  when decorators arrived and immediately painted over the soot.    Politics is still the main thing of value, not people....</p>

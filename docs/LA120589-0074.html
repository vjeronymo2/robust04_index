			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKS RENEW CALL FOR GOVERNMENT TO RESIGN  </P> <P> Czechoslovaks renewed their massive street protests Monday as more than 150,000  people jammed into the capital's main square to demand the resignation of a  Communist-dominated government appointed only the day before.  </P> <P> The protest set up a new confrontation between the country's recently formed  opposition movement pressing for free elections and Czechoslovakia's  beleaguered Communist Party, which is fighting an increasingly desperate battle  to survive.  </P> <P> After briefly stunning the opposition by taking 16 of 21 seats in the new  Cabinet named Sunday, the Communists by late Monday showed signs of being once  again on the retreat.  </P> <P> Opposition Civic Forum speakers set a Sunday deadline for a new, more balanced  government and threatened a general strike the following day to underscore  their resolve.  </P> <P> "We demand a complete change of government by next Sunday that will reflect the  new mood of the people," declared Jiri Cerny, a Civic Forum member.  </P> <P> The new government is transitional, with its principal mandate to prepare  Czechoslvakia for its first free elections in over 40 years, possibly by next  July.  </P> <P> There were also large anti-government demonstrations in Bratislava, Ostrava and  other cities.  </P> <P> In another significant move Monday, Civic Forum said it will for the first time  nominate individuals for interim government posts.  </P> <P> "Civic Forum will support certain persons toward this new government,"  spokesman Vaclav Maly said.  </P> <P> The group's resistance to put forward specific names despite requests by  Communist Prime Minister Ladislav Adamec may have been one reason for the  preponderance of Communists in the government that was announced, analysts  believe.  </P> <P> Civic Forum also said it plans to endorse a slate of candidates for the  national elections next year but will still not declare itself a political  party.  </P> <P> The tactic is similar to that successfully employed by the Polish opposition  group Solidarity, whose endorsement guided voters to otherwise unknown  candidates.  </P> <P> The size of the crowd in Prague and the power of its response to speaker after  speaker seemed to visibly revive spirits among exhausted opposition leaders,  who had appeared shocked and in disarray after the unveiling Sunday of a new  Communist-dominated government.  </P> <P> Opposition leaders had called for an interim government "of professionals and  technocrats" to lead the country toward full democracy.  </P> <P> The crowd was filled with faces young and old, and entire families huddled  together trying to keep warm in the freezing fog.  </P> <P> Euphoria Missing  </P> <P> Monday's mass protest carried little of the elation and euphoria that came with  the first doses of freedom two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Instead, the gathering had a distinctly harder, impatient edge as speakers  demanded an end to Communist-dominated government.  </P> <P> The demands, which also including the resignation of President Gustav Husak,  were met by roars of approval that echoed through the frigid late autumn  afternoon.  </P> <P> Husak was installed as Communist Party leader after the 1968 Soviet-led  invasion that toppled party leader Alexander Dubcek and ended his Prague Spring  reforms.  </P> <P> While the initial demonstrations last month that toppled party leader Milos  Jakes' regime focused heavily on personalities within the ruling Politburo, the  issue had broadened Monday.  </P> <P> Demonstrators seemed to be rejecting communism as such.  </P> <P> "We are fed up, we are fed up!" the crowd shouted at one point, while on  another occasion, the chant, "We hate them, we hate them" rose from the  protest.  </P> <P> One sign read: "Five Crumbs Won't Feed Us" -- a reference to the five  non-Communist posts in the new Cabinet.  </P> <P> For the first time, there were also calls to punish those members of the  hierarchy who had already resigned.  </P> <P> Civic Forum protest organizers have consistently stressed the moral element of  their movement and fretted about possible violence.  </P> <P> "People can only be insulted so often," said Michal Horaceck, a Civic Forum  negotiator, expressing concern that the refusal of the Communists to yield  power was adding to tensions in the street.  </P> <P> Protest organizers Monday did not immediately call for another demonstration  for today, instead telling early risers to listen on the radio for  instructions.  </P> <P> In an agreement worked out in recent days with the government, Civic Forum was  awarded 1 1/2 hours of radio time, including the 6:30-7 a.m. slot, a time of  peak listening in Prague.  </P> <P> In a speech to protesters, a representative of the Workers Strike Committee,  Igor Pleskot, called for elections of the Communist-dominated trade union  committees by Dec. 20 and an end to party committees at workplaces.  </P> <P> Others called for the abolition of the party's praetorian guard, a body known  as the People's Militia.  </P> <P> While Monday's demonstration was smaller than some previous protests, it was  seen as enough to regenerate strong political pressure on the Communist Party  hierarchy to cede more power.  </P> <P> Some analysts questioned whether citizens would respond to a new call for  demonstrations a week after they had been suspended.  </P> <P> There seemed little hesitation among those in the capital.  </P> <P> "I've had it up to here with them," commented a middle-aged store clerk as she  put her hand level with her nose. "I will protest for weeks if I have to."  </P> <P> Responding to the powerful public reaction, Communist Deputy Prime Minister  Bohumil Urban met with a Civic Forum delegation Monday in talks that reportedly  centered on how to build a new government.  </P> <P> A Civic Forum strategist described the talks as paving the way for substantive  negotiations the group hopes to conduct with Adamec when he returns later this  week from Moscow.  </P> <P> In another development, the Czech regional government responsible for the  administration of Bohemia and Moravia suspended the announcement of its new  Cabinet lineup, apparently in light of Monday's demonstrations.  </P> <P> Tough Talks  </P> <P> Civic Forum spokesman Josef Lavrosek said late Monday that "tough" negotiations  were under way with Frantisek Pitra, premier of the Czech republic government,  for a new lineup that might contain a minority of Communists. The governments  of the Czech and Slovak republics control key areas such as justice and  education in their respective regions.  </P> <P> The Czechoslovak Communists were also buffeted by the mass resignations of  their East German colleagues and the Warsaw Pact statement in Moscow that  condemned the 1968 invasion.  </P> <P> Opposition figures predicted the additional weight of such a joint  international declaration would further damage those members of the country's  Communist leadership linked with the invasion.  </P> <P> "It's inevitable that the president and a few dozen very high officials and  members of Parliament will have to resign," said Civic Forum's Jan Urban. "It  will mean that in a very short time, they will have to rehabilitate one-half  million people."  </P> <P> In the years after the invasion, Jakes led a purge of Dubcek and the liberal  wing of the party that supported him that resulted in the expulsion of nearly  half a million party members.  </P></p>

			<p>U.S.   Aid   <F P=102> PA1804223594 Guatemala City Teleonce Television in Spanish  0400 GMT 18 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA1804223594 </F> <F P=104>  Guatemala City Teleonce Television </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] The family of Georgina Rosse Robyn, the girl who was  freed last Friday after being kidnapped on 11 April, this Sunday  visited the Presidential House to meet with President Ramiro de  Leon Carpio. Before entering the building, the girl's mother  made a brief statement.    Following the visit by the girl's family, President Ramiro  de  Leon Carpio answered questions on how the girl was liberated, in  contrast to other unsolved kidnapping cases.    [Begin de Leon recording] This was due to several elements  and factors. Here the participation and cooperation of the  Robyn family was key. They provided information and immediately  went to the authorities. Obviously luck was also on our side.  Many elements came into play here.    Other cases have been discovered in which families have  refused to publicize that the cases have been resolved. In  other words, it is very difficult to measure or rate all cases  equally.    What I can tell you for sure is that the actions we are  carrying out with the cooperation of the Army, which I announced  days ago, have strengthened civil security forces. The results  are beginning to show not only in the case of the Robyn family,  but in other cases which will later be made public.    Should these results continue, this is a signal the actions  taken by the president of the Republic, which some have  criticized, particularly about the Army's cooperation in these  investigations, are yielding results. We will continue to work  in this direction to change investigation procedures and how  results are obtained.    We will continue to train civil security forces. This is  particularly difficult because there are many countries -- I  already said this in my message to the nation -- that demand  results, like the United States for instance, but do not provide  aid or equipment. How do they expect us to cooperate in these  investigations if we do not receive uniforms or equipment.    The investigation of the Guatemalan Army's Intelligence  Department, with the participation and cooperation of the  National Police, provided information leading to the arrest of  the individuals involved in Georgina Rosse Robyn's kidnapping.  I understand the Robyn family requested the participation of  FBI agents. I do not know if they finally came or if they came  in time, but the result of this arrest was made possible by the  investigation of the Army's Intelligence Department and the  National Police.

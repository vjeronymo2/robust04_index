			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BREAKING THE CODE" SENDS A MIXED MESSAGE  </P> <P> As suits a play about a cryptographer, Hugh Whitemore's "Breaking the Code" at  South Coast Repertory has a double-edged title. It is based on the life of Alan  Turing, a brilliant British researcher who succeeded in breaking the Nazi code  in World War II, saving thousands of British lives.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Turing was also a breaker of the code against homosexuality.  And when he got into trouble with the law after the war, his usefulness to the  government ceased. He died at the age of 42, after eating an apple dusted with  cyanide.  </P> <P> A strange death. Perhaps it was a symbolic suicide, with ironic references to  Snow White's poisoned apple and the fatal fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. But  it also could have been an accident. Turing kept cyanide around the house for  experiments, and never bothered to wash his hands.  </P> <P> Jonathan McMurtry bites into the apple with relish at SCR, but the actor  doesn't necessarily suggest that Turing means this as a last gesture of  defiance to a world that insisted he conform. All we can say is that by this  time in his life, Turing has learned to appreciate the moment, rather than  theorize about it.  </P> <P> This is a victory, as is the preceding scene where McMurtry fixes a radio for a  Greek youth (James Nardini) with whom he has just made love. Finally, our  hero's soul has caught up with his body, after years of haunting it like a  ghost in a rusty set of armor.  </P> <P> Interesting -- but is this what Whitemore's play wants to say? Here, just as  when Derek Jacobi starred in the play on Broadway (no more convincingly than  McMurtry does), the play puts out a decidedly mixed message.  </P> <P> The final scenes seem to chronicle Turing's disgrace and defeat -- his  expulsion from the research community after being convicted for having  interfered with the morals of a far-from-innocent youth (John K. Linton).  </P> <P> But the strongest emotion from the stage is Turing's relief at being freed from  the rigidity of small-thinking people, even such noble ones as his former  research chief (Dennis Robertson).  </P> <P> The unexpected lightness of being, when one no longer has to encourage the  world in its illusions about one's identity! Our hero has also finally forged a  connection with his mother, a woman (Patricia Fraser) who had dedicated her  life to not looking the facts in the face. Though lost to the world, this is a  man who has found himself.  </P> <P> Why, then, should he commit suicide? If the viewer could be sure that "Breaking  the Code" intends such questions, it would pass for a extremely skillful play.  In fact, one isn't at all sure that Whitemore didn't intend his script as a  straightforward study of sexual persecution -- an intention that got blurred as  he came to appreciate the complexity of the situation.  </P> <P> Scene by scene, the story plays effectively, but in the end we seem to be  trying to have it both ways -- Turing as the victim of an unjust social code,  and Turing as the victor over the body-soul duality. We end in a slight muddle,  knowing only that we've seen another well-judged South Coast Repertory  production, this one staged by Martin Benson.  </P> <P> SCR has a penchant for the "civilized" English play, the play where all the  characters know how to put a sentence together. Set in a world of schools and  research labs, "Breaking the Code" presents a world where ideas matter and  where "codes" are to be lived up to -- Hal Landon Jr.'s detective is no  hire-and-salary cop, but a man who takes his profession seriously.  </P> <P> They all do -- including Fraser as Turing's mother, her profession being that  of the eternally wide-eyed hostess. It is hard for American actors to get this  milieu right, but Benson's cast does so, catching both their humanity and the  cruelty when someone has declared himself loyal to another code.  </P> <P> McMurtry is the center of the evening, and he doesn't miss anything in his  analysis of Turing, including his emotional level, which is that of a  4-year-old who will have his way. Can that mind-set coexist with a brain so  keen that it can solve a fiendishly difficult enemy code almost by intuition?  </P> <P> It can, and it often does. This is a definitive portrayal of the  academic-as-mutant, and there's not a moment where McMurtry loses sight of  where he wants to go with the role. But Whitemore hasn't quite provided the  information needed to send us home knowing what to think of the strange, sad,  victorious life of Alan Turing. His code remains unbroken.  </P> <P>  Plays at 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, through Nov. 30.

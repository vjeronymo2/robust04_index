			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Copper and aluminium lead rise in LME prices Base metals prices showed signs of shaking off the summer holiday blues at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. As traders looked forward to a pick-up in demand with the return of northern hemisphere metal consuming industries to full operation, all LME contracts made ground, some of them quite substantially. Copper, the exchange's flagship contract, led the way, building on Tuesday's after-hours rally with a further Dollars 26 rise to close at Dollars 2,417.50 a tonne for the three months delivery position. Traders told the Reuters news agency that copper still had a fair amount of work to do to break resistance around Dollars 2,430, but with New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) stocks falling and the forward premiums narrowing (indicating a tightening of nearby availability) they expected a challenge to be mounted soon. Aluminium was also strong, breaking resistance at Dollars 1,508 a tonne for three months metal and moving on to close at Dollars 1,518.50, up Dollars 28.50 on the day, before adding a few more dollars in after hours trading. The early rise, prompted by trade buying, was fed by short-covering, traders told Reuters. And with technical factors, constructive speculative activity was encouraged, notably from the investment funds whose buying and selling has been so influential in the metal markets during the past year. Nickel's advance accelerated meanwhile, the three months position adding Dollars 85 to reach Dollars 5,912 a tonne by the close and pushing forward to Dollars 5,935 after hours. Traders noted that the market, already nervous about the possibility of a strike at Falconbridge of Canada should labour talks there fail, responded to a forecast by Sumitomo of Japan of a strong rise in 1994-95 in demand for steel. Stainless steel producers are big users of nickel. Lead and zinc were able to join in the fun, aided by prospects of rising physical demand and, eventually, lower production because of reduced concentrate supplies. Three months lead rose Dollars 10.50 to Dollars 594 a tonne, while zinc was up Dollars 18 at Dollars 982.50. European primary aluminium output fell by between 7 and 8 per cent in May and June as multilateral production cuts took effect, according to the European Aluminium Association, reports Reuters from Brussels. 'The present decrease on an annual basis would amount to almost 8 per cent, which could become even higher in the coming months,' it said in an advance copy of its quarterly report. Output totalled 247,917 tonnes in June, down 7.1 per cent from a year-ago, 258,075 tonnes in May, down 7.7 per cent, and 260,095 tonnes in April, down 3.2 per cent. European primary aluminium output fell 4.1 per cent to 1.56m tonnes during the first half of 1994, compared with the corresponding period of 1993. Under a memorandum of understanding in March, the world's leading aluminium producers agreed to cut output by 1.5m to 2m tonnes a year to help resolve a global oversupply crisis. The EAA data covers the 12 European Union countries producers and Turkey.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin Beye  returned to Lusaka, the Zambian capital, today. He left the  Angolan capital without disclosing anything substantive  concerning the talks. As always, in his few contacts with the  press he reminded everyone of the information blackout  [preceding word in English], but the truth is that everybody's  attention is turned to Lusaka at this stage.    Observers believe that talks may gain new impetus in the  wake  of UN Special Representative Blondin Beye's contacts with  President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, in Luanda, and Jonas Savimbi,  in Huambo.    Before leaving the Angolan capital, Blondin Beye held talks  with Catholic Cardinal Alexandre do Nascimento, who expressed  the hope that there will be a happy ending to the Lusaka peace  talks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Igor Chernyak report: "Will Russian Soldiers Wash Their </F> Boots in the North Atlantic?"]    [Text] The upper echelons of the Russian Federation  Defense Ministry and Foreign Intelligence Service are treating  the idea of Russia's entry into NATO under the "Partnership for  Peace" program extremely cautiously. In brief, military and  intelligence personnel mainly fear that Russia could be deprived  of the opportunity autonomously to choose a model for future  military building and development and for reforming the Army and  Navy: The Russian Armed Forces could cease to be an independent  military organization, and in the light of that the Russian  Federation could switch from being an autonomous factor for  security and stability in the world to being an element  subordinate to another mechanism.    In the words of one participant in the recent  Russian-American seminar devoted to these problems in the  Russian Federation Center for National Security Problems, the  U.S. representatives often simply failed to dispel the Russians'  fears. They were forestalled by a representative of the Russian  Federation Foreign Ministry, who defended the partners'  interests with even greater fervor than they themselves. The  Foreign Ministry leadership's interest in joining the  "Partnership" and NATO can be explained: As a result of gross  foreign policy miscalculations in neighboring foreign states,  powerful political and military clots have formed -- Tajikistan,  Moldova, Georgia-Abkhazia, and Armenia-Azerbaijan -- which the  Russian Federation cannot resolve alone. So a gamble is being  placed on NATO peacekeeping forces. However, in the view of a  number of military experts, these would be false gains.</p>

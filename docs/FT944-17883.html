			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Industrial tribunal results 'improve' The industrial tribunal system appears to have substantially improved its productivity, in spite of government concern that it is becoming overloaded. An analysis in the latest Employment Gazette shows that 30 per cent more cases were cleared in 1993-94 than in the previousa year. More than 110,000 cases were heard by a tribunal, handled by the conciliation service Acas or withdrawn, compared with about 85,000 in 1992-93. The tribunals disposed of 69,612 cases compared with 53,445 in the previous year. That included a substantial increase in unfair dismissal cases from 33,683 to 42,757. The government is still expected to press ahead with a consultative paper on reform of the industrial tribunal system. The paper, expected next month or early next year, is likely to concentrate on making the system more efficient and on holding back its rising costs. Some employers' organisations are critical of the narrow focus government consultation is likely to take. Mr Peter Martin, a legal expert at the Engineering Employers Federation, said: 'We are concerned that the whole thing will be too narrow and will not look at issues like simplifying the law.' The Employment Gazette study and a separate analysis of unfair dismissal cases showed: About two-thirds of cases dealt with by industrial tribunals in 1993-94 did not reach a tribunal hearing because they were resolved through Acas conciliation or settled privately. The distribution, hotels, catering and repairs sector remained the biggest source of unfair dismissal cases, although its share in the total was falling.

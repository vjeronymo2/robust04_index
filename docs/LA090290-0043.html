			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UMBERG'S OCCUPATION AND PRINGLE SUPPORTERS' LAWSUIT  </P> <P> Quoting from the article "Pringle Partisans Sue Umberg Over His Title on  Ballot" (Aug. 23): "The squeaker of a victory, however, was immediately marred  by accusations that the Republicans had used dirty tricks to scare away  potential Democratic voters by posting guards at several heavily Latino  precincts in Santa Ana."  </P> <P> As many times as I have read the above accusations, I have never heard an  explanation as to how the Democrats arrived at the conclusion that the security  guards were there to scare them away.  </P> <P> If a person is doing nothing wrong, why is there any reason to be intimidated  or fearful of a security guard?  </P> <P> LILLIAN GOULETTE  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

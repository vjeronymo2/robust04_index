			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Environmental groups invited to OECD talks ENVIRONMENT campaigners from across the industrial world meet OECD officials in Paris today in what many regard as a last ditch bid to get the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation to take proper account of their environmental priorities. In an unprecedented move, the OECD has invited three environmental lobby groups from each of its 24 member countries for two days of private meetings with government delegations on its Trade and Environment Committees. UK environmentalists will be represented by campaigners from Greenpeace, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, and Safe, a consumer group. The gesture provides belated recognition of the influence of environmental groups, particularly in the US. It also implies recognition of environmentalists' calls for curbs on unfettered free trade. The meeting follows private consultations last week by officials at the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) with a number of environmental groups. The draft Uruguay Round agreement, stalled for a year by disagreements between the US and the EC over reform of farm trade, takes no account of environmental issues. Negotiators acknowledge that trade policies can have potent environmental implications, but have argued consistently that the Uruguay Round agreement would be indefinitely stalled if they attempted at this late stage to bring such issues on board. The environment along with competition policy are set to be the two principal 'post-Uruguay Round' issues. Lobbyists have argued that environmental problems linked with present international trade rules are so pressing that they cannot be deferred until after the Uruguay Round is completed. The issues of most pressing concern over the next two days are expected to be: A challenge to the 'holy grail' of trade economists that falling trade barriers lead automatically to growth, which in turn leads to a better environment. The right of governments in environmentally 'progressive' countries to take unilateral measures forcing higher standards on trading partners. Trade officials, and a number of third world governments, see this as 'eco-imperialism'. The right of governments to bar imports manufactured by processes not regarded as environmentally sound. The enforcement of environmental standards as minimum requirements, rather than ceilings to be aimed for. Environmental campaigners will be pressing for the Multilateral Trade Organisation, which the Uruguay Round proposes to set up as a powerful body to police international trade, should go beyond a commitment to seek 'sustainable development', to giving environmental aims at least equal priority to trade objectives by means of 'environmental impact assessments'.</p>

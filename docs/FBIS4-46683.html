			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Galitskiy, Aris Zakharov, and Aleksandr </F> Frenkel, Russian State Committee on Statistics: "Production  Output and Price Dynamics as of 4 May"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>   Over the period 26 April to 4 May 1994 prices for  consumer goods and services rose by 2.2 percent, including for  foodstuffs--by 1.9 percent, nonfood items--by 2.3 percent, and  for-fee services for the population--by 3.8 percent.    The greatest increases in food prices were registered in the  Central Chernozem region (3.9 percent), and the lowest--in the  Northeast region (1.0 percent); they remained at practically the  same level in Kaliningrad Oblast. Prices for nonfood items went  up most in the Urals region--by 6 percent, while in the cities  of Northwestern and Central Chernozem regions they changed only  insignificantly.    Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the  consumer market were as follows (percentage of the preceding  date):                     04/19       04/26       05/04       Average daily price                                                       rise                                                        May        April   Consumer goods   101.6       101.7       102.2       0.30       0.30  and services   including:   foodstuffs       101.3       101.6       101.9       0.29       0.23   nonfood items    101.9       101.5       102.3       0.39       0.25   for-fee          103.5       104.4       103.8       0.64       1.27  services for  the population     <H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>   Over the period 26 April to 4 May, prices in organized and  nonorganized trade rose by 1.1 percent and 5.4 percent.    Price changes by main categories of food products are shown  below (percentage of the preceding date):                         Total           Including:                                        in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All food products    101.9           101.1               105.4   including:   Meat and meat        102.3           101.2               105.1  products   Fish and fish        101.1           101.1               101.0  products   Milk and milk        101.3           101.0               103.1  products   Eggs                 101.1           101.1               100.2   Sugar                100.2           100.1               102.5   Bread and bakery     101.8           101.8               -  products   Cereals and          101.7           101.5               107.6  macaroni items   Vodka                100.3           100.3               100.0   Potatoes and         104.0           102.4               105.5  vegetables   Fruit                107.9           103.9               110.8      In organized trade over the elapsed week fruit and  vegetable prices rose at an anticipatory rate. Prices for  cabbage, onions, and apples rose by 4-7 percent. Prices for  rye-wheat bread and bread made of highest grade wheat flour,  macaroni, rice, millet, and salt went up by 2-3 percent. There  was practically no change over the week in prices for vodka,  sugar, butter, and vegetable oil.    Similar to organized trade, the greatest price increases  in nonorganized trade, mostly due to seasonal factors  and holidays, were registered with respect to fresh produce.  Prices for apples, cabbage, and onions rose over the week by  10-13 percent, carrots, beets, and garlic--by 4-9 percent.  Prices for meat products increased by 5-6 percent, and for eggs  remained practically unchanged.    The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic  foodstuffs increased over the week by 1.9 percent and as of  4 May amounted to 48,500 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly  basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured  a factor of 4.6; the highest cost of the basket was registered  in Magadan (R131,100) and the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R28,700). In  terms of the consumer basket cost, Moscow and St. Petersburg and  Moscow ranked 34th and 42d among 132 monitored cities (R53,300  and R49,800 on a monthly basis).  <H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>   Over the period 26 April to 4 May, prices for nonfood items  rose at a somewhat higher rate than those for foodstuffs. The  greatest price increases were registered with respect to  children's items, wallpaper, and medicines (2-5 percent).  Gasoline prices in 12 cities of Russia increased over the week  by 10-30 percent. With the average for Russia price of R288 per  liter, the highest price was registered in Magadan--R520 per  liter, and the lowest--in Norilsk--R120.  <H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>   Over the elapsed week the cost of certain services continued  to rise at an anticipatory rate--rents in municipal housing  (20.5 percent), municipal services (6-8 percent), and  transportation and communications services (5-6 percent). The  cost of housing and municipal services increased several-fold in  Ivanovo and Chelyabinsk Oblasts. There was a 1.5- to two-fold  increase in urban bus fares in Izhevsk, Novosibirsk, Smolensk,  Cherepovets, Blagoveshchensk, Nizhniy Tagil, and Kopeysk, and in  the cost of residential telephone service in Petrozavodsk,  Irkutsk, Serov, Nizhniy Tagil, and cities in Tatarstan.  <H5>  Wholesale Prices for Industrial Output </H5>   Wholesale prices for industrial output in April  increased by 10 percent (in April 1993--by 21 percent). As  compared to December 1993, prices increased 1.7-fold (over the  same period of 1993--2.5-fold). Also in April, as during the  preceding months, prices for producer goods increased more  significantly than those for consumer goods, which can be seen  from the following data (% of the preceding month):                        January     February     March     April     April 1994                      1994        1994         1994      1994      as % of                                                                   December                                                                   1993   Industry--total     119         116          110       110       167   including:   producer goods      120         117          111       112       171   consumer goods      113         113          109       108       152      Since the beginning of the year prices have risen the least  in electric power generation, the fuel industry, nonferrous  metallurgy, and the chemical, timber, woodworking, pulp and  paper, and food processing industries--by 6-11 percent.    In the fuel industry over the month prices for  main categories of fuels went up by 6 percent on average. The  greatest price increases--by 18 percent--were registered with  respect to gas; coal prices went up by 13 percent, oil--by 5  percent, and petroleum products--by 3 percent.    By the end of April the price of one tonne of oil in Tyumen  Oblast was R69,000, and in Republic of Tatarstan--R54,000. Coal  in the main coal-producing regions--Kemerovo and Rostov  Oblasts--cost R18,000 and R25,000 per tonne, and in Republic of  Komi--R29,000. Wholesale prices charged by gas-producing  enterprises exceeded R6,000 per 1,000 cubic meters. Since the  beginning of the year gas prices have increased fourfold,  oil--1.9-fold, and coal--1.6-fold. Electric power  rates at the end of April averaged R31 per kw-hour for all  categories of consumers, which is 1.7 times higher than in  December 1993.    In ferrous metallurgy after a relatively low rate  of price increases at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994,  prices for most categories of output went up sharply. With  respect to many monitored categories of output the rate of price  increases was considerably higher than over the quarter. For  instance, prices for stainless round billet in April went up by  84 percent (overall over the quarter--by 20 percent),  open-hearth steel--37 percent (7 percent), wire rod--22 percent  (4 percent), and hollow drill steel--by 36 percent (9 percent).  Iron ore prices increased in April by almost 40 percent, which  is three times as much as over the quarter (14 percent).    In the chemical and petrochemical industry, with  an average price increase of 11 percent, prices for some  products rose at a faster rate: carbamide and epoxy resins--by  22-25 percent; paints, varnishes, and synthetic dyes, tires for  trucks and cars--by 18 percent; the output of rubber and  asbestos industry--by 17 percent; and mineral fertilizer--by 14  percent. There have been substantial price increases (by a  factor of two to 2.3) since the beginning of the year for  nepheline concentrate, sulfur, mineral fertilizer, yellow  phosphorus, sulfuric and hydrochloric acid, drying oils,  synthetic detergents, and some other products.    Price rises continue to slow down in the timber,  woodworking, and pulp and paper industry. Over April prices  here rose on average by 9 percent (11 percent in March). Prices  for the output of the timber-logging sector increased over the  month by 7 percent, and since the beginning of the  year--1.5-fold; that of the woodworking industry--by 11 percent  and 1.7-fold, respectively; and pulp and paper industry--by 9  percent and 1.8-fold.    Similar to March, the price index for construction  material in April was higher than the industry average--113  percent. Prices for construction brick, roof slate, wall panels,  and ceramic tile increased by more than 13-15 percent;  prefabricated ferroconcrete components and parts, construction  and non-ore materials, mineral cotton and items made of it--by  11-12 percent. As compared to December 1993 the price level with  respect to cement, roof slate, asbestos-cement pipe,  construction lime, and ferroconcrete blocks practically doubled.    In light industry prices rose on average by 12  percent, including for cotton fabrics--by 9 percent, woolen  fabrics--by 14 percent, and silk fabrics--by 11 percent. Prices  for knit underwear and outer knitwear increased by 7-9 percent,  garments and footwear--by 11 percent. Since the beginning of the  year prices increased on average 1.5-fold, and with respect to  some varieties of goods (cotton thread, gauze, dressmaking linen  fabrics, silk fabrics, twine, and women's  pantyhose)--1.8-1.9-fold.    In the food processing industry in April prices  for some varieties of butter-churning, milk, fats and oils, and  fruit and vegetable industry output remained practically  unchanged. Prices for meat and fish products and the output of  milling and cereal-making industry rose on average by 4-6  percent. Since the beginning of the year prices for the output  of baking, macaroni, hard liquor, beer-brewing, salt, perfume  and cosmetics, and soft drinks sectors have increased  1.7-2.0-fold.    Price changes by industrial sectors are shown below:                                     April 1994 as % of                                    March 1994            December 1993   All industry                     110                   167   Electric power generation        111                   178   Fuel industry                    106                   181   Ferrous metallurgy               117                   156   Nonferrous metallurgy            109                   152   Chemical industry                111                   176   Petrochemical industry           111                   165   Machine-building                 112                   168   Timber, woodworking, pulp and    109                   167  paper industry   Construction material industry   113                   180    Light industry                   112                   155   Food processing industry         106                   149    <H5>  Market Saturation With Consumer Goods </H5>   Over the past two months the level of retail trade  saturation  with goods remained unchanged and measured 87  percent.[.sup]*)[/] In April of this year, as compared to  April of last year, it increased by 16 percentage  points.[.sup]**)[/]    With respect to foodstuffs, the saturation coefficient over  the elapsed month measured 84 percent as compared to 62 percent  in April of last year. Russia's consumer market is currently  saturated with butter and eggs. The saturation level is also  high (97-99 percent) with respect to beef, poultry meat, summer  salami and bologna, vegetable oil, sour cream, milk, sugar, and  vermicelli.    The situation at regional markets with such food products as  fish, cottage cheese, rye-wheat bread, and macaroni items is  characterized by the following data (in percents):                      Saturation coefficient                     Frozen     Cottage     Rye-wheat     Millet     Macaroni                    fish       cheese      bread                    items   Russian           88         51          74            83         70  Federation   Including  economic  regions:   Northern          100        20          100           80         60   Northwestern      100        33          100           100        67   Central           100        91          100           83         92   Volgo-Vyatka      80         80          100           80         40   Central           100        60          100           100        60  Chernozem   Volga             88         50          75            100        75   North Caucasus    50         50          38            88         63   Urals             100        85          86            100        71   West-Siberian     86         71          57            100        100   East-Siberian     50         33          33            50         50   Far-Eastern       88         25          75            88         50   [.sup]*)[/] ratio of number of cities where item was available for sale at  time of registration to total number of cities surveyed   [.sup]**)[/] ratio of saturation coefficients taking into account data  comparability      Retail trade saturation with nonfood items measured in April  of this year 92 percent and increased as compared to the same  month of last year by 15 percentage points, including color  television sets--by 2 percentage points; hosiery--by 8  percentage points; garments, knitwear, footwear, and  refrigerators--by 15-22 percentage points. Men's suits, cotton  socks, and women's elastic pantyhose were available for sale  everywhere.  <H5>  Petroleum Products Production </H5>   Output of petroleum products fell in January-March of this  year:                   I quarter   I quarter 1994 as %   As % of the preceding month                 1994        of                 (million                 tonnes)                              I          IV         January    February    March                             quarter    quarter                             1993       1993   Primary        46.7        85         89         96         93          98  refining of  oil   Automotive     6.7         89         91         103        89          104  gasoline   Diesel fuel    11.5        82         87         96         88          109   Boiler oil     18.9        90         93         98         98          94   Jet fuel       2.0         80         83         94         84          108   Lubricating    0.4         48         65         88         89          107  oil      In the first quarter of this year the situation was more  favorable with respect to production of fuel for the needs of  power generating stations and boiler rooms, as well as winter  fuel for transport.    As compared to the analogous period of last year, the output  of winter diesel fuel increased by 8 percent and amounted to 2.6  million tonnes. While in absolute figures the output of boiler  oil declined, its share in the total volume of petroleum  products production increased from 38 percent in January-March  1993 to 41 percent in January-March of this year. At the same  time, production of household furnace fuel decreased over the  indicated period of time by 23 percent.    Because of the decline in solvent demand, production of  petroleum products for the needs of aviation declined  considerably. The output of aviation oil and gasoline fell by a  factor of three as compared to the first quarter of last year,  that of aviation kerosene--by 20 percent. Production of aviation  gasoline decreased by a factor of six in the Omsknefteorgsintez  association, and of aviation kerosene--by half in  Kirishinefteorgsintez, and one-quarter--in the  Yaroslavnefteorgsintez association and the Moscow NPZ  [oil-refining plant].    The output of petroleum products used in automotive  transportation and agriculture declined as compared to the  corresponding period of last year. Production of diesel fuel  fell by one-quarter or more at 11 out of 18 oil refining  associations and plants of the Rosneft state enterprise,  including the Saratov NPZ--by 71 percent, Khabarovsk NPZ--by 34  percent, and Ryazan NPZ--by 29 percent. The greatest drop in  production of automotive gasoline was registered at the Saratov  NPZ (74 percent) and Khabarovsk NPZ (45 percent). Production of  diesel oil declined in Russia as a whole by 60 percent, and  automotive oil--by half. The output of kerosene for technical  uses (tractors) declined as compared by January-March of last  year by 38,000 tonnes (81 percent) [figures as published], and  at the Saratov NPZ--by 40,000 tonnes (10-fold).    The decline in petroleum products production is associated  to  a considerable extent with nonpayments. As of 1 March this year  the total accounts receivable owed to oil refining industry  enterprises amounted to R3.5 trillion. Sector enterprises, in  turn, owe R4.2 trillion their suppliers, banks, and so on.    Because of a decline in solvent demand, unsold finished  products are accumulating at oil refining enterprises. As of 1  April this year saleable remainders of technical-use kerosene  exceeded by a factor of 3.7 the volume of March output; those of  motor oil amounted to 52 percent of March output, of household  furnace oil--35 percent, and automotive gasoline--26 percent.    In the first quarter of this year there was a decline in the  volume of crude oil refining by fractionation processes: thermal  cracking--by 21 percent, and coking of heavy oil residue--by 37  percent. At the same time the volume of refining by way of  hydrocracking increased 9 percent. Overall the share of  fractionation technologies in the total volume of oil processing  declined from 10 percent in the first quarter of last year to  9.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, and the depth of  crude oil refining--from 60.5 percent to 58.2 percent.  <H5>  Fuel Trade With Near-Abroad Countries </H5>   Over January-March of this year the export of fuel from the  Russian Federation to Commonwealth countries:                      January-March 1994                     exported        % of fulfillment of    as % of                                    annual                 January-March 1993                                    intergovernment                                    agreements in I                                    quarter   Gas, billion      18.8            -                      95  cubic meters   Coal, million     1.0             -                      44  tonnes   Oil, million      6.4             26                     47  tonnes   Automotive        73.3            6                      7  gasoline,  thousand tonnes    Diesel fuel,      308             12                     23  thousand tonnes    Boiler fuel,      398             33                     23  thousand tonnes       Russian fuel is mainly exported to Ukraine, which accounts  for 37-55 percent of all automotive gasoline, oil, and boiler  oil shipped to CIS countries, and 70-80 percent of gas and  diesel fuel; to Belarus--17-32 percent of coal, gas, boiler  fuel, and oil; and Kazakhstan--16-22 percent of oil and coal. In  January-March this year exports to these countries amounted to:                  Ukraine                           Belarus                           Kazakhstan                 January-March    as % of          January-March    as % of          January-March    as % of                1994             January-March    1994             January-March    1994             January-March                                 1993                              1993                              1993   Gas,          13.0             97               4.4              88               0.3              103  billion  cubic  meters   Coal,         520              55               159              85               223              32  million  tonnes   Oil,          2.6              48               2.1              59               1.0              34  million  tonnes   Automotive    27.6             7                3.7              47               4.3              2  gasoline,  thousand  tonnes   Diesel        248              43               14.0             55               18.4             3  fuel,  thousand  tonnes   Boiler        193              18               95               29               10.7             6  fuel,  thousand  tonnes      The lag in the shipments of a number of categories of fuel  mainly results from the fact that Commonwealth countries owe  unpaid amounts to Russia. For this reason 2 percent of  automotive gasoline quantities envisaged for the quarter was  exported to Kazakhstan, 5 percent of diesel fuel, 14 percent of  boiler oil, and 38 percent of oil.    Reciprocal shipments of fuel to Russia over the elapsed  months of this year came only from Kazakhstan. Over  January-March of this year it shipped 1.3 million tonnes of oil  to the Russian market (39 percent of last year's level) and 5.9  million tonnes of coal (71 percent).  <H5>  Stock Exchange Activities in 1993 </H5>   By the end of last year there were 72 stock and funds  exchanges and exchange stock departments; of them, for all  practical purposes, 26 stock and funds exchanges and 36 exchange  stock departments were operating in the fourth quarter.    The main indicators of operations with exchange assets on  the  stock and funds exchange market in Russia in 1993 are shown in  the table:                      1993          Including by quarters                                   I         II          III           IV   Number of         62            21        45          50            62  operating stock  and funds  exchanges and  exchange stock  departments   Number of deals   93            15        14          24            40  concluded,  thousands   Exchange assets   2,046.5       8.9       202.5       1,349.4       485.7  sold, billion  rubles   including:   securities        595.1         4.6       27.7        109.0         453.8   money funds       1,445.2       4.2       173.9       1,240.2       26.9   foreign           6.2           0.1       0.9         0.2           5.0  currency      By the end of 1993 the bulk of operating stock and funds  exchange and exchange stock departments were located in the  Central and Volga regions--12 exchanges in each; six were  located in the North Caucasus, eight--in the Urals, seven--in  Siberia and the Far East, eight--in the Northern and  Northwestern regions, and eight exchanges--in the Volgo-Vyatka  and Central Chernozem regions.    Central region exchanges (mainly in Moscow) accounted for 93  percent of the total volume of exchange assets sold on the stock  and funds market exchanges in Russia, including 81 percent of  the value of securities, 97 percent of the value of the money  funds placement, and 90 percent of the value of foreign currency  in ruble equivalent. Exchanges in the Northwestern regions  handled 4 percent of the total volume of exchange assets, in the  Urals region--2 percent, and exchanges in the remaining  regions--only 1 percent.    The scale of exchange activities in operations with exchange  assets in 1993 by region of Russia was characterized by the  following data:                     Number of    Exchange    Including as % of the total                   deals,       assets                   thousands    sold, R                                billion                                             securities    money    foreign                                                          funds    currency   Stock and        92.8         2,046.5     29.1          70.6     0.3  funds exchange  market in  Russia   including:   stock and        49.7         1,853.0     22.0          77.7     0.3  funds  exchanges   exchange stock   43.1         193.5       97.4          2.6      -  departments   Northern         0.6          1.9         23.1          76.9     -  region   Northwestern     22.2         81.3        98.5          1.5      -  region   Central region   40.8         1,892.2     25.4          74.3     0.3    Volgo-Vyatka     0.6          0.6         100.0         -        -  region   Central          1.0          0.3         100.0         -        -  Chernozem  region   Volga region     9.9          7.8         80.7          19.3     -   North Caucasus   2.3          2.1         97.1          2.9      -  region   Urals regions    8.2          46.1        25.7          74.3     -   West-Siberian    3.3          9.1         87.5          5.5      7.0  region   East-Siberian    2.7          1.0         99.7          0.3      -  region   Far-Eastern      1.0          3.7         93.9          6.1      -  region   Kaliningrad      0.2          0.4         43.6          56.4     -  Oblast      In number of deals concluded and volume of exchange assets  sold, stock and funds exchanges hold a dominant position in the  exchange assets market. They handle the sales and placement of  91 percent of the total volume of exchange assets, including 68  percent of the value of securities, 99.7 percent of the value of  money funds, and 100 percent of the value of foreign currency in  ruble equivalent.    Overall in 1993, 2,192.3 billion worth of exchange assets  were offered for sale, and R2,046.5 billion sold, that is, the  liquidity (convertibility of exchange assets into money)  measured 93 percent.    Operations with money funds continued to account for the  bulk  of operations in exchange trading (70.6 percent of the total  volume of exchange assets sold), and operations with securities  were second in significance (29.1 percent). Operations with  foreign currency were of lesser significance for stock exchange  activities (0.3 percent).    Over nine months of 1993 the volume of exchange assets sold  continued to increase, mainly due to increases in the volume of  money funds placed through the market. In the last quarter of  the year the situation changed in connection with the suspension  of operations with short-term interbank credits held by the  Cashier Union at the Russian International Foreign Currency and  Stock Exchange. This resulted in a reduction of operations with  money funds from R1,240.2 billion in the third quarter to R26.9  billion in the fourth quarter; the total volume of exchange  assets sold decreased correspondingly.    The most popular form of money funds were interbank credits  (IBC). Their proportional share in all money funds placed  through the exchange stock and funds market in 1993 amounted to  98.9 percent. Among other money funds are commercial credits,  and institutional and private deposits; they accounted for 1.1  percent of total value of money funds.    The liquidity of money funds throughout 1993 remained high  (99.4 percent), including 99.5 percent for IBC, 94.6 percent for  deposits, and 70.9 percent for commercial credits. Liquidity of  private deposits is rather low--0.6 percent.    Because of continuing inflation, placement of money funds at  exchanges is short term.    Over 1993 the bulk of deposits placed through the exchange  stock and funds market were available for a period of up to  three months. The structure of deposits by period of use was  characterized by the following data (in % of total):    Period of      1993  use, months                  March         June         September         December   up to 2        86            22           35                49   3              14            76           49                45   4-5            -             1            1                 -   6              -             -            15                -   more than 6    -             1            -                 6   Total          100           100          100               100      Commercial credits were placed mostly for a period of up to  three months; interbank credits--up to two months. The structure  of credits by placement terms (use period) is shown in the table  (as % of total):    Period    1993  of use,  months             commercial credits                        interbank credits             March    June    September    December    March    June    September    December   up to 2   -        35      25           100         66       98      99           77    3         100      62      75           -           15       2       1            23   4-5       -        -       -            -           19       0.0     -            -   6         -        3       -            -           -        -       -            -   more      -        -       -            -           -        -       -            -  than 6   Total     100      100     100          100         100      100     100          100      Continuously increasing demand for credit ensured an  increase  in demand for untied money funds, which included deposits of  both enterprises and individuals. Over 1993 there was a marked  trend toward a stable increase in average interest paid on  deposits. The highest interest rates were paid on deposits  placed for a period of two to three months.    The "cheapest" deposits were available at the exchanges in  the East-Siberian and Central regions, where on average interest  rates in December amounted to 115 percent and 170 percent,  respectively. The most "expensive" deposits were found in the  West-Siberian region--216 percent (minimum rate 185 percent and  maximum--240 percent).    Bank of Russia rates on centralized credits given to  commercial banks were raised eight times over 1993--from 80  percent to 210 percent.    Average interest rates on interbank and commercial credits  in  December were lowest at Central region exchanges (mostly in the  city of Moscow) and were equal to the Bank of Russia refinancing  rate (210 percent), which is due to a high concentration of  banking capital in the region. The highest average interest  rates were noted in the West-Siberian region--251 percent  (minimum rate 154 percent, maximum--280 percent). The demand for  credit for a period of three months decreased in December of  last year, and average rates declined to 180 percent.    The spread (margin) in interest rates between credit and  deposit money funds available for a period of one and two months  declined considerably by the end of the year and amounted,  respectively, to 9 and 16 points as compared to 22 and 33 points  in September.    In 1993, 53.7 billion securities were sold on the exchange  stock market for a total amount of R595.1 billion. Operations  with securities accounted for 89 percent of the total number of  operations with exchange assets. Liquidity of operations with  them measured 81.6 percent. The most prominent phenomenon in  securities trading was active buying and selling of short-term  state bonds (GKO) and privatization vouchers. These state  securities accounted for 93 percent of the value of all  securities sold; stocks of production companies, exchanges,  banks, and investment institutions accounted for only 6.3  percent, and financial options, futures, bills of exchange, and  others--for 0.7 percent.    In connection with the Government of Russia's policy of  gradual cutbacks in the volume of the Bank of Russia's  centralized credits for the purpose of financing the republic  budget deficit and increasing noninflationary sources of  covering the deficit, in 1993 the Russian Ministry of Finance  began to issue short-term state bonds for a period of three and  six months. Their proportional share in the total value of  securities sold amounted in 1993 to 47.6 percent. They were sold  on the Moscow Interbank Foreign Currency Exchange [MMVB]. During  the first placement of short-term state bonds their liquidity  ranged from 41.1 percent to 99.9 percent. The profitability of  issues by weighted average price fluctuated within a range of  103-176 percent; for six-month bonds it was 181 percent. High  profitability made these securities attractive for investors.    The development of the privatization process was reflected  in  privatization voucher trading. The proportion of the value of  privatization vouchers in the value of securities sold in 1993  on the stock exchange market amounted to 45.4 percent, and on  exchanges in the Central Chernozem region--93.6 percent,  Kaliningrad Oblast--99 percent, and the North Caucasus and  West-Siberian regions--78.2 percent each.    The liquidity of operations with privatization vouchers  remained quite high--91.4 percent. In 1993 the value of  privatization vouchers kept growing. The average price of the  voucher in the first quarter amounted to R4,800 in Russia as a  whole; in the second quarter--R6,100, third quarter--R9,700, and  fourth quarter--R18,700. In December it was selling on Moscow  exchanges for R22,000.    Stocks comprised the bulk of trading in nonstate securities.  The proportion of stocks in the value of securities sold in 1993  on the stock exchange market amounted to 6.3 percent in Russia  as a whole; on East-Siberian exchanges it accounted for 86.2  percent, on Far-Eastern exchanges--93 percent. Most of the time  the stock offered for trading was common stock. Its share in the  value of all stocks sold reached 95.7 percent by the end of the  year; the share of preferred stocks declined over 1993 from 35.3  percent to 4.3 percent. In a number of regions--the Northern,  Volga-Vyatka, and Central Chernozem regions and Kaliningrad  Oblast--preferred stock was not traded; in the Volga, North  Caucasus, and East Siberian regions their share was extremely  small. In the Far-Eastern region overall in 1993 their share in  the value of all stocks sold comprised 42 percent. Liquidity of  stock operations measured 29.5 percent.    The predominant kind of stocks were shares with low nominal  value (from R1,000 to R10,000), which accounted for 72.3 percent  of the value of all stock sold; shares with a nominal value of  up to R1,000 accounted for 26.3 percent (in the beginning of  1993--50 percent and 37 percent, respectively).    In the second quarter there was an increase in sales of  stocks of enterprises undergoing privatization, and the share of  stocks of production companies and enterprises in the total  value of stocks sold increased from 51 percent in January-March  to 80 percent in January-June 1993. With the activization of  voucher investment funds operations there was a perceptible  increase in the share of sales of stocks issued by investment  institutions. While in January-March it was 2.6 percent, and in  January-June--2.1 percent, in January-September it was already  54.7 percent. By the end of 1993 the proportion of stocks issued  by production companies and enterprises and investment  institutions and sold through the stock exchange was almost  equal and comprised, respectively, 47.7 percent and 48.3 percent  of the total value of shares sold. Bank stocks comprised 3.3  percent and exchange stocks--0.7 percent.    Among other securities that were available for sale in 1993  but did not receive widespread acceptance were bonds of  joint-stock companies, enterprises, and organizations;  certificates of deposit and savings certificates; bills of  exchange; financial options and futures; and others. The volume  of trading in them is extremely small. They account for only 0.7  percent of the value of securities sold. Most popular among them  were savings certificates, bills of exchange, options and  futures--their liquidity in 1993 measured between 61 percent and  97 percent. Certificates of deposit and bonds issued by  joint-stock companies were noted by their low liquidity--2  percent.    Foreign currency operations played an insignificant role in  the activities of stock and funds exchanges (their proportional  share in the total volume of exchange assets sold comprised 0.3  percent). The bulk of foreign currency is sold on foreign  currency exchanges, which are issued licenses by the Central  Bank of the Russian Federation for the right to conduct foreign  currency operations.    The Bank of Russia in 1993 took steps in the direction of  increasing the network of regional exchanges through which  foreign currency subject to compulsory sales was realized. By  the end of the first half-year their number reached six, and in  the beginning of 1994--seven. All of this contributed to  decentralization of foreign currency received and redistributed.  The MMVB continues to hold the leading place in terms of volume  of operations with foreign currency.    Since June 1993 the MMVB has introduced more frequent  trading  with the purpose of meeting demand to the maximum extent  possible, which increased the volume of sales of dollars.  Distribution of the volume of sales and demand and supply over  the year is presented in the table ($ billion):                    1993         including by quarter                                I           II          III         IV   Volume of       12.7         1.5         1.7         4.8         4.7  sales   Initial         11.9         1.5         1.6         4.2         4.6  demand   Initial         12.1         1.3         1.4         4.8         4.6  supply      The official exchange rate of the ruble in relation to the  U.S. dollar is set by the Bank of Russia according to the  results of trading at the MMVB, held on Tuesdays and Thursdays.    In 1994 in the state securities market there will be an  increase in the sales of GKO and gold certificates;  privatization vouchers will be taken out of circulation. In  March of this year the Government of Moscow imposed a tax on  exchange operations involving foreign currency, which resulted  in a decrease in the volume of foreign currency trading at the  MMVB.</p>

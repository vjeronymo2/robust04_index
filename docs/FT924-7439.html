			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / China faces inflation threat CHINA'S headlong rush to develop a market economy is fuelling a surge in credit to fund inefficient capital investment, the People's Daily has said, Reuter reports from Beijing. 'The call for faster economic development does not mean that everyone must jump to the fore,' the Communist Party's official newspaper said. 'We must not take the old road of neglecting efficiency, stressing and competing only for production value, blindly launching new projects and expanding production. 'If we do not look at the reality, and do not recognise that speed without efficiency will not last long, then it will create economic chaos.' While proud that their economic policies are working, China's communist leaders fear that that mismanagement may bring a repeat of the economic turbulence of the late 1980s, when spiralling inflation helped to spur the pro-democracy protests in the spring of 1989. Inflation remains at about 5 per cent, according to official statistics, but urban areas are posting rates closer to 10 per cent, which diplomats say are still underestimated. Warnings of overproduction and the inflationary threat have become more frequent following last month's Communist Party congress, which thrilled China's budding entrepreneurs by setting its seal of approval on market-style reforms. Grandiose development schemes and plans for faster production are being unveiled across the country. Industrial projects valued at Dollars 185bn (Pounds 122.5bn) are now under construction in the state sector, a figure equal to about one half of China's annual GNP, according to official statistics. The People's Daily said the main problem facing China's economic planners was inefficiency, especially in the state sector where companies are revving up production lines to churn out piles of shoddy, unwanted goods. China's gross industrial output during the first nine months was slightly over 2,000bn yuan (Pounds 245bn) an increase of 19.3 per cent over the same period in 1991. By the end of August the total value of finished industrial goods unbought in warehouses hit a Dollars 25bn, an increase of Dollars 4.4bn from the start of the year.</p>

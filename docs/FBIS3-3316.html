			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alma-ata, March 19 (XINHUA) -- Kazakhstani  President Nursultan Nazarbayev met today with visiting U.S.  Defense Secretary William Perry to discuss arms control and  military conversion.    During the meeting, Nazarbayev expressed gratitude for the  U.S. role in helping convert his country's military  installations into civilian use. He also welcomed the  U.S.-Russia accord, which compensates Kazakhstan for its  uranium, an essential material for making strategic missiles.    Perry and Kazakhstani Defense Minister Sagadat Nurmagambetov  signed an agreement today on military conversion, under which  the U.S. will grant another 15 million U.S. dollars to  Kazakhstan, raising the amount of promised aid for this purpose  to 70 million dollars.    The U.S. is invited to participate in the privatization of  the defense industry in Kazakhstan and the conversion of  military establishments into civil enterprises.    At a brief press conference after the signing ceremony,  Nurmagambetov told reporters that the two sides have discussed  wide-ranging military cooperation, but there is no immediate  accord in sight.    Liaison will soon be established, however, to expand  military  cooperation, he added.    William Perry, on a week-long visit to four former Soviet  republics, will next go to Ukraine and Belarus after visiting a  renowned spaceflight center in Kazakhstan tomorrow.</p>

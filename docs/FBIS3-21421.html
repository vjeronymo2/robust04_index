Raja Mohan: "U.S. Softens Tone on India"] </F>   [Text] Washington, Feb. 10--The Clinton administration may  not initiate any substantive change in its policy towards India,  but a more cautious and gentler tone is evident. Apparently  there is a recognition of the buffeting that Indo-U.S. relations  have taken in the recent months, and the need to provide a  better balance in the articulation of policy towards India.    In the new perspective, the emphasis on the economic  imperative is a little more pronounced than in the recent past.  The differences on Kashmir, human rights and non-proliferation  remain, but there is a stress on the positive elements of the  relationship as well.    The Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs,  Ms.  Robin Raphel, went to some length yesterday to correct the  impression that Indo-U.S. relations "have soured because of  public disagreements over such issues as Kashmir." Speaking to  the Asia Society here, Ms. Raphel stated that the "reality is  much different," and "the fabric of our relations extends much  beyond disagreements we may have."    She referred to close cooperation in education, culture,  science and technology, besides the rapidly growing commercial  relationship. Ms. Raphel regretted that while the differences  get most of the media attention, there is a vast positive effort  to improve the relations that remains outside the spotlight.    In an important assessment, Ms. Raphel noted that expanding  Indo-U.S. economic relations could be the "harbinger of further  growth throughout the region." Suggesting that the rapid  economic integration of South Asia with the world will encourage  deeper involvement of American business, generate prosperity and  provide a better market for U.S. goods. "Everybody will win" in  the process, she asserted.    Balanced perspective: On the nuclear issue, too,  Ms. Raphel, presented a balanced perspective. Accepting that  both India and Pakistan are "nuclear capable," she noted that  there are "large constituencies" in both countries who believe  that nuclear capability is indispensable to their national  security.    The United States, according to Ms. Raphel, must "also  recognise the importance of outside factors--concerns about  China, Central Asia and Russia--in the South Asian security  equation." She asserted, however, that the United States must  convince the two countries that nuclear weapons make the  sub-continent a "more dangerous and unstable neighbourhood." The  United States must make this case "honestly and without  discounting the security perceptions of each side," Ms. Raphel  stated. She expressed the intention to work closely with India  and Pakistan to "reduce tensions and enhance confidence."    "The United States remains in favour of a multilateral  process to promote arms control, non-proliferation and regional  security," she said adding that India and Pakistan "already  accept the multilateral approach in principle," only details had  to be worked out. The U.S. emphasis on a multilateral approach  is a clear vindication of the Indian position that  non-proliferation cannot be addressed in a limited South Asian  framework. It is also clear that the Pakistani proposal for a  five-power conference on nuclear proliferation is now dead.    Less focus on human rights: Whether she meant it  or not, human rights and Kashmir came lower down in Ms. Raphel's  listing of American priorities in South Asia, after economic  cooperation, non-proliferation, and curbing narcotics  trafficking. On human rights, she noted the "long tradition of  affinity for the ideas of democratic government and respect for  the rights of the individual." Stating that these "democracies  and individual rights are in peril," Ms. Raphel called on the  freely elected governments of South Asia to "effectively provide  for the present needs and future hopes of their citizens."    On Kashmir, Ms. Raphel's comparison of the situation in the  Kashmir Valley to that in Afghanistan was a bit surprising.  While asserting that Kashmir and Afghanistan will remain high on  her agenda for South Asia, Ms. Raphel acknowledged that she is  "keenly aware of the limits that constrain U.S. policy in both  conflicts." She reiterated the now-standard formulation of the  Clinton administration that Kashmir is a disputed territory, and  called on India and Pakistan to resolve the issue through  peaceful negotiations, while taking into account--as a practical  matter--the wishes of the Kashmiri people.    In a representation of the issue in non-offensive terms, Ms.  Raphel said the United States regards India and Pakistan as good  friends who "remain trapped in what appears to be a zero-sum  game." "We would like to see them escape the tortured history of  the conflict and deal with the problem based on the situation in  Kashmir today." She also noted that the current American  approach seems "doomed to be interpreted by one side or the  other as a tilt."    In her survey of the broader trends in the region, she noted  that the forces of moderation had triumphed in South Asia,  despite the recent fears to be contrary. She acknowledged the  valuable contributions made by India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and  Nepal to the on-going peacekeeping operations in Somalia,  Cambodia, Kuwait, Mozambique and elsewhere.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Antonio Britto of the Brazilian </F> Democratic Party Movement in Rio Grande do Sul State, PDMB-RS,  by Denise Rothenburg in Brasilia; date not given]    [Text] [Rothenburg] You have been mentioned as one of the  preferred candidates in the poll carried out by Ibope [Brazilian  Public Opinion and Statistics Institute]. Will that make you  change your mind about running for governor of Rio Grande do Sul?    [Britto] For the presidency I am the second choice; for  governor of Rio Grande do Sul, I am the first choice. I already  made a commitment with the people of Rio Grande do Sul, and I  cannot go back on my word. I am candidate for governor, and I  already prepared an alliance in this regard. I have been  working for one year to be governor. I believe we can also make  a great alliance for the presidency. If we can work out an  alliance, it would be easy to find a candidate.    [Rothenburg] Apart from you, a leading candidate among PMDB  convention delegates is former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes  Quercia. Do you believe his name would be endorsed by such an  alliance?    [Britto] I do not believe a party could nominate a candidate  who would have to answer too many questions. I do not know the  truth about Quercia. I cannot say whether the charges made  against him are fair or unfair. All I know is that for any  candidate having the above problem it would be very difficult to  win votes on the streets.    [Rothenburg] Does that mean that he could not be a  candidate?    [Britto] The PMDB and the other parties have other names. We  have to act judiciously, and weave a strong social-democratic  alliance already for the first round of the election. We have  learned in politics that after working out an alliance it is  easier to find candidates. Yet without an alliance, no  candidate will stand a chance. Winning the election should not  be our only priority at this time. Collor did just that. We  must also guarantee governability. By doing this, we would be  innovating in Brazil by having a president who will in fact rule  the country. Neither Sarney, nor Collor, nor Franco managed to  do that.    [Rothenburg] But to weave that alliance it will be necessary  to overcome regional interests. For instance, do you find it  possible to unite Quercia, [Sao Paulo Govenor Luiz Antonio]  Fleury, and [Brazilian Social Democracy Party Senator Mario]  Covas in Sao Paulo?    [Britto] In this election we will have to follow that old  popular saying "we either spend our money to eat, or we just  keep our money." If we want a strong president, we must  overcome our regional interests and sacrifice some fellow  members in some states. If political parties choose to push for  regional interests, we will not have a strong alliance or a  candidate. As the popular saying goes, we will have to choose  between either food or money.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television Ffyona Campbell has been walking around the world for years but it is only recently, as she approaches her last thousand or so miles in France and the UK, that she has penetrated the public conscience, posing the question: is she a heroine of our age or a bullying autocrat?. She certainly gives the film crew following her progress hell, but there is always room for another great English eccentric. When her wandering days are over she will no doubt get a TV show. She loosens up with Janet Street-Porter in The Longest Walk (BBC 2 at 9.30). Friday night is yackety yack night. Steve Coogan's alter ego Alan Partridge is taking time to find his feet on television but last week's edition of Knowing Me, Knowing You (BBC 2 at 10) was a great improvement on the dire opener. It is strange that the American version of the same idea The Larry Sanders Show should follow on the same channel just 75 minutes later. The real thing Clive Anderson Talks Back is on Channel 4 at 10.30. You never know whether Anderson wants to elicit information from his guests or just get laughs.</p>

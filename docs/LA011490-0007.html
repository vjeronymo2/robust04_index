			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR AND REALITY  </P> <P> Regarding "Fear and Reality in the Los Angeles Melting Pot," by Joel Kotkin  (Nov. 5): The future will show that in Los Angeles, as with the United States,  diversity of the people has strengthened us, not diminished us. My life has  been enhanced by the variety of people that I have met of various races and  cultures.  </P> <P> I am now able to solve problems in a variety of ways and look at them from  different angles.  </P> <P> I work for a company that helped send people to the moon. We did not do this by  homogeneity. We accomplished this by having everyone work together and giving a  variety of inputs. In the future, there will be many more global projects like  this, and we need the diversity of people to succeed. Business is now global in  every aspect.  </P> <P> The world is changing quickly, too quickly for some people. Americans will have  to get used to change if we want to compete globally. Los Angeles should feel  lucky that these people chose us: They can help us move into the 21st Century.  </P> <P> PAUL R. MICKELSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / US output rise boosts hopes of recovery HOPES of a sustained US economic recovery were bolstered yesterday when the Federal Reserve reported a 0.5 per cent increase in industrial production in April, the third consecutive monthly increase. The figures were better than financial markets expected and partly reflected a sharp rebound in car production. However, most sectors of industry have shown a steady improvement since January. Production has now almost retraced the falls of last autumn, when the economy seemed to be heading for a 'double-dip' recession. Industrial output stands 2.5 per cent above the level in April last year. Manufacturing output rose 0.5 per cent last month and 2.9 per cent in the year to April. The improved production figures follow reports of gains in both employment and retail sales in April. On Thursday the Fed also reported a sharp rise in the money supply, bringing it just above the lower limit of its 2.5-6.5 per cent target range. Many analysts believe a quarter-point cut in short-term interest rates is still likely in the next few weeks despite the improved economic figures.</p>

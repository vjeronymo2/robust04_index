			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (2): An appetite for tittle-tattle  -Politics NOBODY could accuse Filipinos of not taking their politics seriously. Every morning in the coffee shops of any hotel worth its salt, politicians, pundits and the press spend hours raking over the embers of the previous day's political intrigues. More often than not the talk is of personalities and parties; rarely, it seems, of policy. For the next three months even the coffee-shop cognoscenti's appetite for political tittle-tattle may be tested. On May 11, the country votes for a new president to replace Corazon Cojuangco Aquino. Barring a hitch, the election will be the first time in the country's history that an incumbent has not stood for a second term and the first time since 1969 that elections have been held according to a timetable laid down by the constitution. The scale of the exercise, as much as the event, has set the country alight. When registration closed, the voters had choice of 78 presidential candidates - or 'Presidentiables' as they are locally called - eight of whom were considered 'serious' contenders. As if this were not confusing enough, voters will also elect 24 senators - from 286 hopefuls - and 17,000 local officials. Not surprisingly, politicians fear that voters will be somewhat confused. Accustomed as they are to violence during elections, the politicians are also ominously warning that the elections could be marred by bloodshed. With three months to go before polling, the serious contenders were splitting into two fields. Emerging as front-runner was Mr Ramon Mitra, Speaker of the House of Representatives and a leading member of the LDP, the largest party in the ruling coalition. Mr Mitra held pole position by dint of the strong party machinery he has developed nationwide rather than a strong personal following. (See profile, Page 4) Rapidly gaining credibility was Mr Eduardo Cojuangco, the estranged cousin of Mrs Aquino and the late President Ferdinand Marcos's most accomplished business associate during 14 years of martial law. (See profile, Page 4). Sounding less overtly in favour of the monopolistic capitalism he helped perfect under Mr Marcos, he was trying to harness the support of Filipinos disenchanted with a perceived lack of clear leadership. Also in the first field was retired General Fidel Ramos. He is a contender, largely because he received the personal support of Mrs Aquino who, confusingly, chose not to back Mr Mitra, the head of her ruling coalition. Some way behind these three were Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, an anti-graft campaigner who scored highly in opinion polls but had almost no party machinery; Mr Joseph Estrada, a movie matinee idol; Mr Jovita Salonga, the former President of the Senate and leader of the Liberal party; Mr Salvador Laurel, the Vice-President who fell out with Mrs Aquino almost as soon as she came to power when the position of Prime Minister he was to have filled was abolished; and Mrs Imelda Marcos, widow of the late president who is facing a score of corruption charges and whose greatest asset in the presidential race is said to be access to large amounts of cash. Some in this field will wither and others will come from behind. The only certainty is that any successful candidate will need the support of the Roman Catholic church, or at least its neutrality. In the predominantly Roman Catholic country, the most powerful spiritual voice is that of Cardinal Jaime Sin, Manila's turbulent prelate. Although he sometimes limits himself to utterances of Delphic obscurity - he says he lives in a 'House of Sin' - it is almost inconceivable that he will not come down in one candidate's favour. After all, he too, regularly holds political breakfasts for journalists. Equally important is the support of the Iglesia ni Kristo, a conservative Christian sect founded in the Philippines. Unlike the Roman Catholic Church's influence over its flock, which is strong but not binding, Iglesia's four million voters have tended to vote as their leader says they should vote, potentially giving one candidate a crucial block vote. Mrs Aquino's own influence on the election has been limited. Mr Ramos's campaign has been slow to take off despite her endorsement and she has also failed to lure her influential brother, Mr Jose Cojuangco, from the Mitra camp. This is a notable breakdown of the kinship on which much local political power is based. Her limited impact stems partly from her lack of interest in the pragmatic art of party building - a quality many Filipinos admire. In her last months in power, she has channelled her energies into so-called non-governmental organisations which by-pass the government machinery to deliver services and livelihood programmes directly to poor communities. But it is also a fault of a flawed constitution. By allowing a president only one six-year term, it has transformed Mrs Aquino from the supremely powerful patron early in her term, to something of a lame duck. Politicians are already talking of revising the constitution after the next elections to rectify this. They are considering reverting to a maximum of two four-year terms. They are also considering replacing the congressional legislature with a parliamentary system. When Filipinos changed from the parliamentary form in 1986, they were throwing out an institution whose main purpose had been to rubber stamp decrees issued by Marcos during martial law. Some politicians now believe that a parliamentary system, incorporating elements of the French presidential system, might swing the balance of power back towards the executive without unduly weakening the checks and balances. Few pundits suggest a parliamentary system is the immediate panacea for all the country's ills or the chronicly fragmented political scene so vividly demonstrated by the plethora of presidential candidates. It would, however, provide plenty of opportunity for lengthy coffee shop debate.</p>

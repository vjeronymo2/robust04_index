At a press conference held here, Cheng said that the  development of international port and trade centers in the  region will benefit 240 million people in a  23-million-square-kilometer area in southwestern China.    He said that the province will provide a shortcut for import  and export goods from land-locked Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan  Provinces to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Now the goods mainly  goes through coastal cities of Guangzhou in the south and  Shanghai in the east.    He said that the central government has adopted preferential  policies to encourage the locality to expand economic and trade  links with Southeast Asian countries. The central government  supports include special loans and funds allocations for  infrastructure and better-off of the eight million  poverty-stricken people in the autonomous region.    In response to a question about the region's economic  relations with Southeast Asian countries, he said that many  countries have shown great interest in investing in the areas  along the 1,600- kilometer coastal line of the region.    Guangxi has a 1,020-kilometer border line with Vietnam, and  is located near the Laos, Thailand and Myanmar [Burma].    He said that former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew  visited the coastal city of Beihai in the region last year. Now  a group of Singapore entrepreneurs are in the city to assess a  666.7-hectare area to be designated to them by the local  government.    "There is a bright prospect for the project," Cheng said,  "The two sides are consulting on the industrial structure and  scale of investment in the area."    He said that a number of cooperative projects between the  autonomous region and Thailand and Malaysia are also in the  pipeline.    Since Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai went to Guangxi  during his China visit last August, some 18 investment projects  by the Thai bank have been under discussion. The bank from  Thailand is also applying to set up a branch in the regional  capital of Nanning.    Cooperative projects under way with Malaysia include a  seafood processing plant and some 400 luxury villas in Beihai  city. The city has joined hands with Malaysia to open marine  tourist routes to Southeast Asian countries. It has placed  orders for luxury pleasure boats and will soon put them in use.    Last year, the region introduced a total of one billion U.S.  dollars of foreign funds with 2,544 investment contracts signed,  seeing the fastest growth rate of foreign investment among  coastal areas of China.    Most of the funds come from Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United  States and Southeast Asian countries.    Besides introduction of overseas funds, the region also  expanded its investment overseas. To seize the opportunity  emerging in a surge of market-oriented economic reform in  Vietnam, the region has been seeking to take part in  technological renovations of a large number of Vietnamese  enterprises that were built with Chinese aid in the 1950s and  1960s.    "We are planning to send a technological group to these  Vietnamese enterprises to see what we can do to help," he said.    He said that the region has set up a joint-venture  fertilizer  plant and a department store in Vietnam since the two countries  resumed normal diplomatic relations in November 1991.    "The two countries have a long history of friendly exchanges  and cooperation. We can cooperate in many areas, such as trade,  joint ventures, and tourism," he said.</p>

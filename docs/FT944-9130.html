			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Study warns on transatlantic ties: Call for new relationship as US-Europe interests diverge The US and European Union need to upgrade their post-cold war relationship through a new political and economic treaty, according to a study by European political and business leaders. The report's release coincides with an angry transatlantic row over the US withdrawal from the arms embargo against Bosnia, and with some public soul-searching by European politicians over how to limit the damage. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Britain's defence secretary, called this week for the establishment of an 'Atlantic community' which would shore up US-European solidarity on the basis of a shared commitment to democracy, capitalism and European culture. While giving few details, Mr Rifkind called for more transatlantic exchanges between civil servants, parliamentarians, students and industrialists. He said Europe and North America had a common interest in facing down the challenges of Islamic extremism in North Africa, economic competition in the Far East, nationalism in some parts of eastern Europe and international crime. However, this week's study says that Europeans are underestimating the degree to which US and European foreign policy interests diverge in the absence of a Soviet threat. The report sees a risk of cleavage as Americans tilt away from Europe to the fast-growing economies in Latin America and the Pacific, and as both allies become preoccupied with internal renewal and economic competition. Though not in any immediate peril, 'the transatlantic relationship founded primarily on the (Nato) alliance is adrift,' concludes the study by Transatlantic Policy Network, a non-profit group which brings together business and political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. The report recommends three steps to strengthen linkages between the US and Europe. The transformation of the present Transatlantic Declaration into an economic and political treaty between the EU and US aimed at creating a 'North Atlantic Free Trade Area' which would cover regulatory co-operation, mutual recognition of product approvals, standardisation and certification, and treatment of foreign investment. Reforming Nato around a partnership between the US and a European defence pillar. Though the authors suggest further integrating defence and military procurement in Europe, they found 'no firm foundation' for a coherent European approach on security matters. A new process for transatlantic summits which would bring together the annual Nato summit and the biennial US-EU meetings. The aim is to exploit the Clinton administration's shift toward strengthening the European defence pillar within Nato and its support for greater European political integration built around the Union. With one eye on the 1996 inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty, the report says there is a 'window of opportunity' for real power-sharing between the US and EU. The onus is on member states, including Britain, to take further steps to integrate political, economic and security policies within the EU in 1996.

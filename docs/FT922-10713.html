			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut ruled out IN SPITE of sterling's strong position against the D-Mark, the domestic money markets continued to ignore all suggestions of a reduction in British interest rates. Instead, dealers kept Germany's political and economic difficulties at the forefront of their minds, believing that a lowering of rates there is a far-off prospect. A confident prediction by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that the British economy was on the road to recovery also dampened speculation of a rate cut. One analyst suggested yesterday that the comments implied that the government saw no need to stimulate a recovery at the moment. As a result, rates in the interbank market ended mostly unchanged. The 3-month interbank rate, an important indicator of future base rate, ended at around 10 17/32 - 1/2 per cent, roughly the same as Monday's close of 10 1/2  -3/8. One-year money ended the day slightly cheaper at 10 5/16 - 3/16 per cent, after a Monday close of 10 3/8 - 1/4 per cent. Short sterling futures finished the day at figures mostly consistent with 10 1/2 per cent base rates. After a day of trading in an 11-tick range, the June short sterling contract closed at around 89.74, having finished on Monday at 89.79. This suggests that the market believes that base rates three months from now will be at 10.26 per cent. There was no hint in the discount market that rates were about to fall. Again, the Bank of England forecast a large shortage of around Pounds 950m. It later purchased Pounds 566m of bills, of which Pounds 10m were of Band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent, and Pounds 6m were at the same rates in Band-2. In addition, Pounds 550m went into repurchase agreements to mature in equal amounts on May 11 and 12 at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent. The forecast was revised to a shortage of around Pounds 1bn before taking account of the early operations. The Bank purchased bills worth Pounds 77m, of which Pounds 27m were Band-2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent and Pounds 50m were for resale to the market in equal amounts on May 11 and 12 at an interest rate of 10 7/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 24m of Band-2 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. It provided late assistance of Pounds 305m. German call money was quoted at 9.655 per cent after the Bundesbank injected emergency short-term funds into the market.</p>

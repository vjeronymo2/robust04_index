			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment White Paper Says </F> Business and Public Play Important Role; Urges To Take  Initiative To Preserve Environment"]    [Text] Director General Hamayotsu of the Environment Agency  (EA) submitted the "Annual Report Concerning the Status of the  Environment (1994 Environment White Paper)" to the cabinet  council on 31 May [1994], and it was accepted. The White Paper  points out the importance of modifying each and every  socioeconomic activity so that they have little destruction on  the environment in order to build "a sustainable society" that  can continue to develop eternally while receiving the blessings  of the global environment. The EA is asking that private  businesses and the public endeavor to change to environment  preservation type activities and to switch to lifestyles that  are environment-friendly.    The first white paper, based on the Basic Environment Law,  was submitted November 1993 and was subtitled. "Toward  Socioeconomic Activities With Little Burden on the Environment."  The 1994 white paper emphasizes that in creating "a society  capable of sustained development," as indicated in the Basic  Environment Law, the roles of private business and the public  are especially great.    The white paper analyzes that for private businesses,  preservation of the environment and development of the economy  can coexist with appropriate and aggressive investment in  environmental activities. A shout of encouragement is being  voiced to business to aggressively pursue enviornmental  preservation, saying that "a new entrepreneurial spirit which  combines the preservation of the environment and the  continuation and development of business will activate society."    In terms of the public, the white paper indicates that  business activities which are environment-friendly are aided by  consumer behavior such as the purchase of products that consider  the environment." The white paper calls for introducing an Edo  Period (1600-1868) living orientation, when personal effects  were repaired and used, in an effort to change modern lifestyles  of mass production, mass consumption, and waste.    Furthermore, to aid private business and the public in  taking  actions regarding the environment, the white paper indicated  support tasks that the administration should undertake: 1)  strengthen the mechanism for accurately supplying  environment-related information, 2) construct an economic system  so that costs for preserving the enviornment are added to  product prices, and 3) urge business to continue environmental  investment regardless of good or bad economic times.    In addition, the white paper states that the most necessary  thing today is the definition of a guide to ensure that  environment preservation actions which are taken by businesses,  the public, and the administration will produce accompanying  results, and that the "Basic Environment Plan" currently being  established is suitable to be this guide.</p>

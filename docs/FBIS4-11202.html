			<p>BFN     [Text] The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity [URNG]  organization yesterday accused Defense Minister General Mario  Enriquez of threatening the organization and violating the  recently signed agreements between the government and the  insurgents.    According to a CERIGUA report, Francisco Villagran, member  of  the URNG's political-diplomatic commission, said: Gen.  Enriquez is failing to comply with the signed agreements by  warning that any guerrilla leader who comes into the country  will be immediately arrested and prosecuted.    Enriquez made this statement on 18 April as he commented on  the possibility that guerrilla leaders may come to Guatemala to  participate in the second peace and democracy meeting, to be  held in late April.    Villagran said that the minister's statements are also a  threat, because the URNG is interested in working with the  civilian sectors, especially because its proposals will be taken  into account when reaching an agreement at the negotiating table.    The guerrillas believe that the government and the Army,  instead of implementing the recently signed agreements, are  conducting an active campaign of disinformation on the  agreements' contents. In addition, the guerrillas reported that  there is a destabilization plan aimed at hindering the  negotiation process.    The guerrillas also demanded the government comply with the  Human Rights General Agreement strictly and without any delays  and harshly punish those who try to destabilize the situation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Harbin, June 28 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China, known  as the country's largest bread basket, is expected to reap  another good harvest as major crops like maize, soybean, rice,  Chinese sorghum, millet and beets are all growing well.    Maize makes up one-third of the grain production in the  three  northeast provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, which  are growing 5.7 million hectares of maize this year.    Sown areas for major crops like maize and soybean have  largely been expanded this year as farmers have been encouraged  by price incentives and various preferential measures by central  and local governments.    An average northeastern Chinese farmer has 0.27 hectares of  arable land, well above the national average. The three  provinces have turned out over 50 billion kg since 1990. The  region's grain output reached a record high of 60 billion kg  last year, 25 billion kg of which were sold to the state, making  the region a major bread basket in China.</p>

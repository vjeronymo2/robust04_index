			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Ericsson down 14% to SKr1bn for quarter ERICSSON, the Swedish telecommunications group, yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to SKr1.01bn (Dollars 163m) for the first quarter of the year. This is the first time since 1986 the company has suffered a decline, and it comes after a period of strong growth. The latest quarterly figure compares with SKr1.18bn for the same period last year. The order book also fell, by 12 per cent, to SKr10.73bn from SKr12.19bn. Consolidated net sales rose by only 2 per cent to Skr10.65bn, from SKr10.41bn last time. The company said profits for this year would be lower than those in 1990, which were a record high of SKr4.85bn. It blamed continuing investment in technological development and the effects of weak business conditions in many of its key markets. Ericsson said its decision to increase development costs in the public telecommunications and mobile telephone sectors by SKr500m to around SKr3.7bn in the first quarter contributed largely to the drop in profits. The expenditure was in response to the move from analog to digital systems in the US, Europe and Japan. The small rise in net sales was due to 'the worldwide downturn in business conditions', while the decline in order bookings resulted partly from 'the unusually high volume of orders booked during the corresponding period of 1990, as well as delayed purchasing in 1991'. However, Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive officer, said the level of Ericsson's profits continued 'at a satisfactorily high level'. He said the company was well placed for the 1990s, thanks to its high level of expenditure in research and development and aggressive marketing. There was a 2 per cent drop in first-quarter sales in the company's public telecommunication business, to SKr5.26bn from SKr5.35bn. The radio communications division pushed up sales to SKr2.87bn from SKr2.71bn, helped by strong growth for mobile phones in the US.</p>

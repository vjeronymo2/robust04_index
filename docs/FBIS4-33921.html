			<p>BFN     [Text] A political organization, Revolutionary Cohort has  set down some conditions for defending the national territory in  case of foreign invasion. Moreover, the organization's  spokesman, Wesner Morency, recommends the resignation of the  Army commander in chief and the formation of a national  coalition government with a prime minister.    [Begin recording, in Creole] [Morency] Whatever the  situation  that makes this person or that person chief, we are now on  alert. Whether I am for or against, if bullets begin pouring  down on my roof, I must counterattack. Self-defense, however,  requires unity of command and morality within the command. Can  we in the Revolutionary Cohort afford to create a wait-and-see  policy, with those men later dragging us through the mud and  drowning us underwater. For me to respond to this state of  emergency, I must set down some conditions.    The first condition is to replace Cedras. It is a fact that  he cannot command a battle, as the president has asked him to  do. The president said: I ordered...    We are also saying that we must dismiss this government.  This  government does not represent anything. There are many trends  within the country and they must be respected, whether they are  majority or minority, so establish a national coalition  government with a prime minister.    The third element is since he, Jonassaint, is talking about  stateless people, mercenaries, we say no. The Haitian state uses  three means of mass communication: newspaper, television, and  radio. You have problems with mercenaries and stateless people,  but they are competent. You must recognize that they are  competent. It is necessary to oppose competence with competence,  not with mediocrity.    [Reporter Renois] Does the president of the country, in the  face of a threat of intervention -- as you said it, whether you  like him or not -- not have a duty to call for mobilization and  unity?    [Morency] He has the duty. But once he does it, the person  he  is fighting will say, here are my conditions. It is his duty.  But once he does his duty, I must do my duty as well. My duty is  to tell him: You want it. You are doing it. Here are my  conditions for it to succeed. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / The Markets: Sex and the labour market - Economics Notebook If a rise in the sale of apples relative to oranges had negative wider consequences, observers might call for market reform. Few, however, would accuse apples of harbouring anti-social ambitions. The trouble with the labour market is that people are not like fruit. Discern a trend, and you could find your politics being examined more vigorously than the finding itself. Analysing developments in the UK over the past 20 years is especially hazardous. Overall, employment trends have favoured women; but an article published today in the centre-left journal, New Economy*, argues that economists' research has gone the other way. The author, Rosemary Quiney, claims that in describing the decline of full-time work for men, and the accompanying growth of the female, largely part-time, labour force, researchers may be encouraging a backlash against women. Female employment in the UK has risen by 23 per cent since 1971, while the number of employed men has fallen by almost the same amount. Most researchers trying to understand this change claim to welcome the fact that female job opportunities have grown. Women have clearly benefited from the shifting character of jobs created, a rising proportion of which are part-time, and concentrated in the service sector. The same authors have understandably - if, according to Ms Quiney, incautiously - drawn attention to the down-side of recent developments, both for male employment prospects and the distribution of income across households. Male unemployment, currently 12.6 per cent, is more than double the 5.1 per cent rate suffered by women. In addition, since more than three-quarters of female part-time work is taken by married women with employed husbands, there might be a damaging side-effect for the overall distribution of income. 'Work-rich' households, in which both partners have jobs, boost their relative standing, while the homes of the unemployed slip even further down. Too often, Ms Quiney argues, these facts are implicitly drawn together into an accusation against women. Not only are women suffering less unemployment than men, but since they are already 'comfortably off', female part-timers are effectively branded as 'stealing jobs from needy men because of a selfish desire to buy pins'. This is not merely politically incorrect; it is factually questionable as well. For one thing, headline unemployment rates are notorious for understating the number of jobless women. Statistics calculated by the OECD tend to put UK female unemployment a good deal higher than the official rate. Even the adjusted figures miss out those women who drop out of the labour force to work at home, when their job prospects are low. In fact, a smaller proportion of single mothers are finding work: 22 per cent were employed in 1990-2, compared to 26 per cent in 1977-9. It is equally misleading to characterise married women's employment as a bid for extra pocket money. As Ms Quiney notes, most working women contribute more than a third of their household's earned income. Research by Mr Stephen Machin and Ms Jane Waldfogel, at the London School of Economics, has found that a disproportionate number of the women going out to work were from poorer households. This means that, far from adding to the recent trend towards greater income inequality among working households, the 'emancipation' of such women counteracted it. Many families might be in poverty, were it not for the woman's efforts. The distributive effects of the rise in the number of dual- earner households could be less favourable if one includes families in which no-one has a job. But the chart (left) shows that this is where women have not avoided their partners' fate. The top line of the graph confirms the steady rise in the number of working wives. The percentage of married couples of working age in which the woman is 'non-employed' (either on the dole or out of the labour force altogether) has fallen from 45 per cent, in 1973, to 35 per cent in 1991. However, this disguises the fact that only the wives of working husbands have been finding jobs. The middle line charts their progress: a mere 25 per cent of them are now non-employed, compared to 42 per cent 20 years ago. This is steeper than the line above, because a growing proportion of women in the same type of household have been 'sharing' non-employment with their husbands: nearly a tenth, in 1991, compared to 3 per cent in 1973. If one combines these results for married couples with the relative labour market failure of single mothers, it is clear that the problem is not rising sexual equality, per se. In a growing number of 'work-poor' homes, neither men nor women are being offered the full-time, permanent jobs which were the norm when the benefit system was created. Instead, firms are opting to employ workers on rather different terms. Accepting them can leave these families worse off, and less economically secure, than remaining on the dole. Finding a 'correct' way to describe these disturbing labour market trends ought not to distract from deciding how they might be reversed. Rather than 'shoot the messenger', find ways to reform the system which produced the message. * 'Women need the work', Institute of Public Policy Research.</p>

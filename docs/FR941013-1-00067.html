			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Development of Regulatory Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Selection of Source Category and Pollutants for Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Off-site waste and recovery operations were included as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a source category on the EPA's initial list of HAP source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories (refer to section II.B of this notice). As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously explained, the EPA intends this source category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to address HAP emissions only from those waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations that are not included in another separate NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source category or are being addressed by other EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory actions. Consequently, the following waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations that receive materials from other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are specifically excluded from the off-site waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recovery operations source category because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations have been listed by the EPA as separate NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source categories: hazardous waste incineration, municipal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid waste landfills, publicly-owned treatment works,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sewage sludge incinerators, site remediation activities, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial boilers and process heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wastes and recoverable materials sent to the facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected for regulation under the off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations NESHAP are generated by a wide variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of manufacturing and production processes as well as other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recycling, reprocessing, or waste management operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, many of the organic chemicals or groups of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals listed as HAP under CAA section 112(b) may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present in the wastes or recoverable materials sent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not appropriate to select all organic HAP listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under CAA section 112(b) for regulation under the off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations NESHAP. Some specific organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals that are designated as HAP have no or minimal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential to be emitted to the atmosphere from off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations. For other organic HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals that may be emitted from off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations, there are limits to the detectability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of some of these chemicals in wastes by the test methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently available to implement the off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations NESHAP because of properties inherent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sampling and analysis protocol. Consequently, the EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided it is appropriate to develop a list of the specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic HAP chemicals to be regulated by this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To select which organic HAP chemicals would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under the off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NESHAP, the EPA evaluated all chemicals or groups of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals listed as HAP in CAA section 112(b). Among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors included in the EPA's evaluation was an assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the aqueous and organic volatility characteristics of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each HAP chemical, the ability of the analytical test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods to quantitate a HAP chemical, and the aqueous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solubility of a HAP chemical. Based on the evaluation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA selected the specific organic HAP chemicals listed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 1 to the proposed rule (to obtain a copy of this table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the regulatory text of the proposed rule refer to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice). The EPA requests comment on the list of HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemicals that the Agency is proposing to be regulated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The list of organic HAP selected for regulation under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the off-site waste and recovery operations NESHAP contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many different types of organic chemicals. The EPA decided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop a single set of regulatory alternatives for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> off-site waste and recovery operations source category to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control organic HAP emissions as a class as opposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attempting to develop a series of regulatory alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control emissions of each individual organic HAP chemicals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the list. Consequently, the control technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered for the regulatory alternatives are directed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> towards the control total organic HAP emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is EPA's intent that the NESHAP address waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations receiving from other facilities those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials that potentially can emit significant quantities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the organic chemicals on the HAP list for the rule. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained in section II.D.2.a of this notice, the EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed definitions for different types of wastes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the Agency's waste management rules promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under authority of RCRA. However, certain wastes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable materials that have been specifically excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the definitions of waste adopted for these RCRA rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may still contain organics listed as HAP under CAA section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 112(b). Consequently, simply adopting the definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already used by the EPA for wastes under the RCRA rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could allow certain off-site waste and recovery operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that emit organic HAP to remain unregulated. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA decided that to fulfill the congressional directives of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CAA section 112, it is necessary to define the types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials to be regulated under this CAA rulemaking in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broader context than the EPA has historically used for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RCRA rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To avoid conflict with the Amex's proposed clean cross rule, as discussed above, Commentary .01 to Rule 126(g) will be amended so as to afford size precedence to orders to cross 25,000 shares or more only when members or member organizations are involved as principal on one or both sides of the cross. In addition, the amendments to Commentary .01 will clarify that such orders to cross are entitled to precedence only when they are on parity with other orders on the Floor ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , both sides of the cross must be represented at the specialist's post when a sale clearing the floor takes place). <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this respect, size precedence differs from priority. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 9. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex states that the proposal is intended to facilitate the execution of agency cross transactions on the Exchange. According to the Amex, confining the proposed size priority threshold to block size orders of 25,000 shares or more will limit the effects of the rule primarily to actively traded, liquid securities. In addition, the Exchange states that the proposal furthers the important auction market principle of price improvement by allowing another member to trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross to provide a price that is better than the proposed cross price. The Amex also suggests that the proposal preserves the auction market principle of priority by requiring that a member who wants to break up a cross by providing a better price must first satisfy all other market interest having priority at that better price before trading with any part of the cross transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objective(s) of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amex clean cross proposal is designed to facilitate the execution of cross transactions on the Exchange. As discussed below, due to the Amex's current priority rules, some Amex members have developed the practice of transporting cross trades to the regional exchanges for execution, avoiding exposure to the Amex's active trading crowd and to limit orders on the Amex's specialists' books. The clean cross proposal, in contrast, should encourage Amex members to execute their cross transactions on the Amex because the proposal will allow a member who has a customer order to buy and a customer order to sell 25,000 shares or more of the same security to cross those orders at a price that is at or within the prevailing quotation, irrespective of pre-existing bids or offers at that price. The proposal will allow another member to trade with either the bid or offer side of the cross to provide a price that is better than the proposed cross price, but the other member could not trade with the cross bid or offer at a price which is the same as the cross price. Moreover, the proposal will uphold traditional auction market principles of priority and price improvement because it will require that the member who is providing a better price to one side of the cross must trade with all other market interest having priority at that price before trading with any part of the cross. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DUERR KILLING LINKED WITH DISPLEASURE OVER DRUGS  </P> <P> Investigators now believe that Denise Marie Duerr's displeasure over her  live-in boyfriend's suspected drug-dealings led to the stabbing death of the  Garden Grove woman, whose body was found dumped near Corona two weeks ago.  </P> <P> Evidence shows that just before her death, the 21-year-old Duerr got in an  argument with boyfriend, Clyde Spontak, about drug-dealing -- a subject of  prolonged friction between the pair that had prompted Duerr to consider leaving  him, Riverside County Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan C. Lough said Monday.  </P> <P> The heated argument appears to have turned deadly, Lough said, when Duerr was  stabbed to death in the garage of her apartment building at the hands of  Spontak and another man.  </P> <P> The first suggestion of a motive in the killing came as Spontak, 22, and  Cameron Seaholm, 22, a high school friend of Spontak and Duerr who had been  staying with them, were arraigned Monday in Riverside County Municipal Court in  Corona. Both are charged with murder.  </P> <P> Both pleaded not guilty. A preliminary hearing was scheduled in June.  </P> <P> "My client, Mr. Spontak, has maintained his innocence and is shocked by this  situation. He has absolutely no idea how his girlfriend was killed," said  defense attorney Thomas L. Brown of Westminster after the arraignment.  </P> <P> Seaholm has told officers that he stole Duerr's car, but that only after he had  a flat tire did he discover her body in the trunk, police said. They said  Seaholm has told them that he did dump the body in a remote area near Corona,  insisting he had nothing to do with the killing. "It appears that both of the  defendants were clearly involved in the murder itself -- not just in a  cover-up, as Mr. Seaholm claims," Lough said Monday. Investigators, basing  their conclusions on the reports of witnesses, believe that Duerr returned home  on Sunday night, April 16, found cocaine in the apartment, and became upset  with Spontak, Lough said.  </P> <P> "There was a dispute about drugs being present in the apartment. As far as we  know, there was no violent altercation then . . . but it appears that she was  killed later that night or early the next morning in the garage," he said.  </P> <P> Duerr was stabbed 20 times, perhaps with an ice pick, investigators have said.  </P> <P> Police said Seaholm has told them that on the weekend of the killing, he and  Spontak had a quarter-kilo (about half a pound) of cocaine for sale.  </P> <P> But defense attorneys for both Spontak and Seaholm said they have seen no  evidence linking the killing to an argument over drugs.  </P> <P> Told of the prosecutor's comments, Brown said that Spontak and Duerr "seem to  have been getting along pretty well (in the period preceding the killing). The  prosecutor is really reaching awfully hard for a motive on this one."  </P> <P> And Brown, noting that Duerr and Spontak had been dating off and on for the  last 6 years, added: "Even if he were a drug dealer -- and I'm certainly not  saying he is -- it seems that she would have known that a long time ago -- not  just 2 weeks ago."  </P></p>

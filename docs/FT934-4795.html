			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Accountancy Column: Last call for smaller company annual audits - The opportunities and potential hazards of the government's proposed abolition Britain's first unified budget this week may not have had much effect on beer drinkers or newspaper readers, but it will certainly make its impact on small companies and professional accountancy practices around the country. Almost as an aside in the middle of his lengthy speech on Tuesday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, spared a thought for the drawbacks of the current statutory audit requirements. After two previous failed attempts by government in the past few years to relax the rules for annual audits of limited liability companies, draft legislation could now be ready by as soon as next year. This will lift the requirement for a full audit each year for an estimated 500,000 of the 1.1m limited liability companies across the country. All those with a turnover below Pounds 90,000 a year - some 300,000 - will be exempt; most with a turnover below Pounds 350,000 a year - a further 200,000 businesses - will be verified by a report by an independent accountant less exacting than an audit in future. Interestingly, while most of the work on the small company audit has been conducted by officials at the Department of Trade and Industry, all the glory has been claimed by Treasury ministers. It was Mr Norman Lamont, the previous chancellor, who first hinted at government sympathy for reform in his budget speech in March. It was his successor, Mr Clarke, who was given the task of announcing the decision - and who claimed he had been fully in support of the idea while at the DTI. Mr Neil Hamilton, minister of corporate affairs at the DTI, was left with the more technical task of unveiling a consultative document this April - although the first indications that the DTI was again considering the issue came through his predecessor, Mr John Redwood, in February last year. That stoked the fires at a wide range of lobbying groups, which began months of campaigning and preparation of briefs long before any official documents left the DTI headquarters to ask for their views. It rapidly became clear that the mood had changed since previous attempts at reform. The usual candidates arguing for abolition at a higher level came forward, not least the small businesses organisations and much of the accountancy profession, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. They said, as they had in the past, that the audit was costly, irrelevant and not best suited to the needs of smaller companies. What was the point of a supposedly independent audit conducted very often by the sole practitioner who had prepared the books and provided advice to the company? Equally, why have the auditor reporting to the shareholders on the conduct of the directors when the two groups were very often the same? By the time the DTI consultative document was issued, it was becoming difficult to find objectors to the principle of reform. It received an all but unprecedented number of 500 responses, nearly all in favour of reform. For example, the British Bankers' Association had been swayed, in spite of concerns that its members wanted to be able to rely on audited accounts before approving loans. Even the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants - which includes some 4,000 members auditing the smallest companies - began to backtrack. Mr David Bishop, last year's president, had sometimes had to speak through gritted teeth against his own personal views, to argue that the privilege of limited liability must be accompanied by the obligation of the audit. That attitude had softened by the spring, although the association maintained its position that any deregulation should be accompanied by measures to make it easier for many thousands of companies trapped with limited liability for tax reasons to be able to disincorporate. No such measures were announced in the budget. More significant were the silences. Officials at the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise were suddenly no longer murmuring about the reliability of unaudited accounts. They were under pressure from the deregulators that they did not place that much reliance in published accounts, and have powers of far wider access to financial information during tax inquiries. That said, the details announced in the budget go considerably further than those recommended by the DTI in the spring. Its consultative document called for abolition of the audit for companies below the annual turnover threshold above which registration for value added tax: which was just raised in the budget to Pounds 45,000. The new limit for complete exemption is twice that level, and for the lesser requirement of a 'compilation report' by an independent accountant is nearly eight times as high. It is likely that these figures will remain fixed, while the tax limits tend to rise year by year. These higher levels caught many people by surprise, not least the Certified Association. It issued a statement warning: 'Removal of the audit requirement will also remove accountability . . . (and) may give rise to concerns with regard to the public interest.' Even so, the association seems resigned to the changes. Mr John Moore, deputy president and a small practitioner based in Belfast, says: 'If the Chancellor has made our bed we will lie on it and arrange the duvet to be as warm and comfortable as possible.' 'I am certainly not concerned in terms of our own practice,' he says. 'We are happy to be released from the time to do the statutory audit. It was a bit of a bind. This will leave clients with more funds to seek other accountancy services.' A lone campaign will continue against reform by the Institute of Credit Management. 'We view these proposals with serious concern,' says Kate Beddington-Brown, assistant to the director general. 'They will probably prove counter-productive to smaller companies. She says the institute's members are sceptical of the assurance that will be provided by the independent accountant's report, and are less likely to provide strong credit-ratings to unaudited accounts. A number of details have still to be finalised. There has been considerable agonising in Whitehall over the nature of the independent accountant's report. If it is to remain reasonably rigorous, how far will it differ from the existing audit requirement? The DTI must consider how to prevent fraud and to retain assurance that the figures are reliable, although - as it recommended - abolition of the audit will still require unanimous shareholder approval. Equally, there are concerns also among practitioners about exactly what obligations they would be taking on by assuming this new role. Standards-setters may yet have to lay down precise guidelines. But the DTI is committed to reform. It will introduce the reforms as secondary legislation, without the need for an act of parliament, which it says will be in place by the middle of next year.</p>

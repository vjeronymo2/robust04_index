			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Insolvencies total 5% of closures in small businesses ONLY 5 per cent of small-business closures in the past 12 months were as a result of formal insolvency applications, according to an analysis by Barclays Bank. The bank said the remaining 95 per cent closed for other reasons including sale, takeover and merger. Many closed because they were unable to make the business succeed, but only a small proportion left creditors unpaid. Of the 5 per cent that closed because of formal insolvency applications, only one in five were because of receiverships. According to the bank analysis, the rest were because of liquidations or bankruptcies. Receiverships were down by nearly 7 per cent in the first half of this year compared with the same period last year. Barclays warned against using the level of receiverships 'as a barometer of the health of the economy', given the small proportion of closures that could be attributed to receiverships. The second quarter saw the number of small business closures fall for the third quarter in succession. Barclays said this trend 'may indicate tentative signs of improvement in the economy'. A total of 126,000 closures in Britain were reported between April and June, the lowest quarterly total since the end of 1990. The total number of small businesses has fallen steadily since late 1990, when closures started to outstrip openings. In the second quarter of this year there were 110,000 start-ups, a decrease of 15 per cent from the same period last year. Greater London and the north-west of England were the only regions to show increases in start-ups in the first half. New businesses in Greater London increased by nearly 9 per cent, and in the north-west by nearly 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Valmet deficit deepens to FM692m VALMET, the Finnish state-owned paper machinery and engineering group, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of FM692m (Dollars 152m) against a deficit of FM290m in 1990, on sales 24 per cent lower at FM7.6bn. No dividend will be distributed this year. However, Valmet predicts that profitability will improve both in 1992 and 1993 due to restructuring measures. Last year's operating loss was FM471m. This included a deficit for the tractor division of FM221m due to economic problems in Brazil. Logging had a loss of FM165m, reflecting the recession in the forestry industry while the paper machinery division, which accounts for 52 per cent of group sales at FM4.1bn, made an operating profit of FM68m. Effjohn, the shipping line, yesterday reported a profit after financial items of FM4m against earnings of FM30m in 1990 following heavy investments in several passenger vessels. The dividend is being cut to FM1.20 a share from FM1.50. The construction of two ferries for its Silja Line service in the Baltic and the building of two cruise ships for the US market increased net financial costs to FM172m from FM60m in 1990. Turnover rose by 17 per cent to FM3.4bn due to increased passenger traffic. The company predicts that the 1992 operating result will be better than the 1991 result of FM363m as the new ships enter service. However, it gave no forecast for earnings after financial items due to the recession in Finland and the introduction of a new travel tax there.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Letter: Recruiting and keeping union membership Sir, David Goodhart's article on trade union membership and recruitment (Management: 'Stewards shop for new members', August 6), missed three important points: many of the term trends seen as working against unionisation were also operating during earlier periods of union growth; some unions have gained members in the 1980s; it is not simply a question of union recruitment of members that is critical, but their retention once they have joined.

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Choice of Tees port purchaser defended THE TEES &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority yesterday released the text of a letter to employees defending its decision to sell the port to a consortium called Teesside Holdings for Pounds 180m. Mr John Peart, the authority's chairman, said the time had come for him to make the board's position 'perfectly clear to those people who matter most, its management and employees'. The authority's decision to sell the port to Teesside Holdings has brought bitter protests from the management-employee buy-out team which had submitted a rival bid of Pounds 150m during the privatisation process. Also objecting to the port's decision is Maritime Transport Services, operator of the Thamesport container terminal on the Isle of Grain in Kent, which outbid Teesside Holdings with an offer of Pounds 210m. Mr Peart said in his letter to employees that some of the critics of the sale procedure had opposed privatisation from the outset and others were motivated by the need for publicity. He said: 'Teesside Holdings was selected by the board of the authority as the preferred bidder because its bid met most closely the privatisation objectives set by the board and agreed with the secretary of state for transport. 'These objectives have remained constant and uppermost in the board's consideration throughout the privatisation process. 'Teesside Holdings' bid was particularly impressive in respect of the most important of these objectives, maintaining the port as a separate, Teesside-based company, protecting the the authority's assets and ensuring that cash generated continues to be wholly devoted to the further development of the local port facilities and projects benefiting the local economy and community.' Mr Peart's letter comes as Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, prepares to announce whether he is prepared to approve the port authority's decision. Earlier he had said he was 'minded' to do so. The issue will come up in the Commons today when MPs are asked to approve an order providing for the government to claw back a proportion of any property profits made by any of the trust ports after privatisation. Government business managers are expected to ensure a favourable vote. Teesside Holdings is a three-way venture between Powell Duffryn, the quoted engineering and shipping group, Humberside Holdings, a company jointly owned by Powell Duffryn and private interests in the Humberside area, and Investors in Industry, the venture capital group. Mr Peart said Teesside Holdings had 'positive and immediate' proposals for the development of the port and port-related facilities. They comprised substantial capital investment in excess of that proposed by the other bidders for the development of the port business and new storage and distribution ventures.

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / International Company News: QVC accepts Dollars 1.4bn Comcast/Liberty bid Speculation about the immediate future of Mr Barry Diller, the US entertainment industry executive, intensified yesterday after the board of QVC Network, the cable television home-shopping group Mr Diller has run for the past two years, accepted a Dollars 1.4bn takeover offer from its two largest shareholders. The two shareholders, the cable television groups Comcast Communications and Liberty Media, offered Dollars 46 a share for the 65 per cent of QVC they did not already own. That was Dollars 2 more than originally put on the table when they first bid for QVC three weeks ago. After a long meeting, the QVC board accepted the all-cash offer late on Thursday night. Although Mr Diller eventually supported the decision to accept the takeover, he is expected to step down as chairman of QVC. When he joined the company in 1992, he planned to use the fledgling cable company as a launch-pad for expanding into the entertainment and multi-media business. But his first two attempts at expansion - an offer to buy the entertainment group Paramount Communications, and a bid to merge with the CBS television network - both ended in failure. Now that QVC is being taken over by Comcast and Liberty Media, Mr Diller is likely to move elsewhere to pursue his ambition of building an entertainment powerhouse. Recent speculation on Wall Street has suggested that he might make another attempt to gain control of CBS, but this time with the financial backing of Tele-Communications, the largest US cable TV operator whose chairman, Mr Jack Malone, is keen to break into the broadcast television business.</p>

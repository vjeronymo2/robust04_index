			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Starting gun is fired in the race to raise equity capital NEWS OF last night's vote sounded like a shot from the starter's gun for corporate financiers racing to raise equity capital for Lloyd's. Sir Laurie Magnus, head of corporate finance at Samuel Montagu, breathed a sigh of relief before settling down to apply the final touches to a pathfinder prospectus for the Pounds 280m-Pounds 300m London Insurance Market Investment Trust, whose release was planned for 7.30am today. 'If the vote had gone the wrong way I'd have been heading off for the Antarctic,' said Sir Laurie. But the Lloyd's team at Samuel Montagu, and James Capel, the other Hongkong and Shanghai Bank subsidiary involved in the scheme, are keeping their champagne on ice until the trust is fully underwritten early next month. Sir Laurie is competing with other investment companies and trust schemes for equity funds from both corporate and retail investors. Already 16 merchant banks and securities houses have announced plans to raise more than Pounds 1.1bn in capital and a number of other sizeable initiatives are in the pipeline. Four groups had issued pathfinder prospectuses, the documents used to market shares, before yesterday's vote. BZW is linking with CLM Advisers, a subsidiary of the Sedgwick group, to back a Pounds 200m investment trust, CLM Insurance Fund. UBS has joined forces with Grimston Investments and Conning &amp; Company to launch a Pounds 100m scheme, while Roberts &amp; Hiscox, one of the most successful Lloyd's agents, has backing from Charterhouse Tilney for a smaller Pounds 28.9m trust. Allied Provincial Securities is backing Johnson Fry, the financial services group, which aims to launch a scheme to specialise in the shares of other Lloyd's investment trusts, an initiative underlining confidence in the eventual birth of a new stock-market sector. The biggest difficulty facing the new investors may be obtaining sufficient space on the most successful Lloyd's syndicates, many of whom now have more capital than they can use. Sir Laurie, who has been working on the trust scheme for most of this year, says he has legally binding commitments for Pounds 480m of capacity from 98 syndicates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By Song Yong-chol and Kim Chang-hyok] </F>   [Text] "Senior Paek, I'm waiting to see how you get  Minister Choe Hyong-u under your control."    These are the words, said half in jest, of Rep. Kang  Sam-chae, who moved from the position of Policy Coordination  Office II Director to Director of Planning Coordination with the  reorganization of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] which  followed the cabinet reshuffle in December of last year.    The person he called "Senior Paek" is Rep. Paek Nam-chi, who  switched places with Rep. Kang to be appointed director of  Policy Coordination Office II. This is the position with overall  control of DLP-government deliberations on noneconomic sectors.    Rep. Kang and Rep. Paek have worked closely together in the  Democratic-Party faction, which could also be called the  chinjong [the home of a married woman's parents. This refers to  the remnants within the DLP of the Democratic Party of which Kim  Yong-sam was head until his "marriage" with the Democratic  Justice Party and Republican Party to form the DLP] of President  Kim Yong-sam. Rep. Choe Hyong-u, appointed home affairs minister  in the cabinet reshuffle (former secretary general), is their  senior in the Democratic-Party faction.    Was Kang showing that he thought that if Minister Choe were  "under control," there would be no problems in their  relationships with other ministers? Was he encouraging Paek not  to be daunted just because added to the stern Prime Minister Yi  Hoe-chang there was now an influential home affairs minister? Or  was it a joke coming from his composure, the result of a  stabilized relationship between the party and the  administration? Maybe it was all three.    Actually, not that long ago, soon after President Kim took  office, the relationship between the DLP and the administration  was more than a little shaky. There were many occasions when  senior government officials would go to the DLP headquarters on  Youido for party-government deliberations only to leave  embarrassed at the resentful scolding given them by the party  side. This was particularly severe for officials of the health  and education ministries, which experienced many scandals such  as the herbalist-pharmacist dispute and college-entrance  examination irregularities.    With the passage of time, however, the once up-in-the-air  relationship between the DLP and the administration is  experiencing a soft landing. Government ministries and offices  are faithfully going through the process of party-government  deliberations and some "powerless departments" have actually  come to use party-government cooperation to depend on the party  for policy momentum.    President Kim's intentional care played a big part in bring  about this change. Before approving important cabinet policies,  President Kim would ask, "Has this gone through party-government  deliberations?" The administration's posture changed markedly as  this became more frequent, according to a DLP source.    President Kim may have his own reasons for thus setting out  to ensure "party-government cooperation." This is said to be  because Kim is from a minority faction of the ruling party.  Thus, the situation cannot be the same as one in which a  majority-faction president would inherit power from a past  administration.    As the influence of the DLP grew owing to the care of  President Kim, the relationship between the party and the  government grew stable. Only last year, measures supplementing  the financial real-name system were taken under the leadership  of the DLP, to include a revision of the Enforcement Ordinance,  built around a relaxation of excess-profit taxes on real estate,  and the issue of long-term, low-interest, unregistered bonds.    The early party-government relationship was much dependent  on  the "comradely solidarity" of Democratic-Party-faction members  in the party and the cabinet. Although it was not carried  through, First Minister of State for Political Affairs Kim  Tok-ryong, Director of Planning Coordination Paek Nam-chi, and  Policy Coordination Office II Director Kang Sam-chae's putting  their weight behind the progressive labor-management policy of  Labor Minister Yi In-che is one example of this. This year too,  Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u and Political Affairs First  Minister So Chong-won are leading party-government cooperation  together with Directors Kang and Paek.    Recently, however, even some not belonging to the  Democratic-Party faction have started to participate in  party-government cooperation. Party President [PP] Kim  Chong-pil, in a formal meeting with the Yi Hoe-chang Cabinet  after the party and government reorganization late last year,  called the attention of the government side to the DLP's  position, stressing, "After President Kim's five-year term is  over, it will be the ruling party, the DLP, which is judged for  the results of his management of the government.    Once every week, PP Kim meets with President Kim to report  on  operations and to see to President Kim's requests. The mood of  this weekly meeting is completely different from that of the  weekly meetings between PP Kim Yong-sam and President No Tae-u  during the Sixth Republic. There was tension in the meetings  between President No and PP Kim, but the present President  Kim-PP Kim meetings have changed, showing a completely vertical  relationship.    In the relationship between the Blue House and the DLP, at  first, the Blue House had control of everything. Now, for most  important policies, the Blue House determines direction, the DLP  supports this, and the administration follows behind.    Political-reform bills, such as the Integrated Election Law,  the Political Party Law, and the Political Funding Law,  presently undergoing negotiations between government and  opposition parties, were created based on President Kim's ideas  on an "election that does not take money." Late last year when  the regular session of the National Assembly was adrift due to  the budget and the autumn-harvest-grain problem, the DLP laid  out a compromise bill on the Agency for National Security  Planning Law, bringing the National Assembly back to normal. It  is said that this was done following the ideas and at the  request of the Blue House.    Contrarily, there were many cases in which the DLP intended  to do something, but had the brakes put on by the Blue House.  The DLP Special Committee for Social Reform and party officials  presented proposals, such as the abolition of the up-myon-tong  system, a prohibition of government-service employees from using  private vehicles to commute to work, a reform of the reserve  armed forces system, and a proposal to make use of the Yongsan  War Memorial, only to be reprimanded by the Blue House for "not  even giving thought to the plausibility of realizing" them.    In this process, voices began to be heard pointing to the  runaway leadership of the Blue House and to the powerlessness of  the DLP. "In the past, there were many bureaucrats in the Blue  House, and members of the administration-transition team were in  the minority. Therefore, its leadership of the party was weak.  Now, however, a considerable number of the  administration-transition team and many from the DLP are in the  Blue House. Thus the inner mind of the president is silently  conveyed to the DLP," explained one Blue House source concerning  this.    As examples of this, the source brought up the fact that  since President Kim took office, the number of events to which  party officials are called has grown considerably and that a  large number of Blue House figures participated in this year's  DLP New Year's celebration.    DLP channels within the Blue House are Chief Secretary Pak  Kwan-yong, Chief of Political Affairs Yi Won-chong, and  Party-Government Affairs Secretary Yun Won-chung, all from the  DLP. Chief Secretary Pak and Secretary Yi deal with the three  main leaders, Secretary General Mun Chong-su, Policy Committee  Chairman Yi Se-ki, and Assembly Floor Leader Yi Han-tong.  Secretary Yun generally deals with mid-level party officials.</p>

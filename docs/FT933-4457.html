			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Nippon Steel forecasts loss NIPPON Steel, the world's largest steel company, yesterday announced that it will post at least Y15bn (Dollars 144m) in pre-tax losses for the year because of the prolonged economic slump and the sharp appreciation of the yen, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company had earlier hoped for a pre-tax profit of Y20bn. Other leading steelmakers, Kobe Steel, Kawasaki Steel, NKK and Sumitomo Metal Industries, are scheduled to make similar announcements this Friday. Japanese steelmakers have been hit by the sharp fall in steel sales to leading customers, especially in the car, electronics and construction industries. Nippon Steel said it had set up a task force to work out a restructuring programme to reduce administrative staff in its steel divisions. Nippon Steel plans to cut some of its losses by selling securities. It will skip its interim dividend. For the first six months to September 1992, the company paid an interim dividend of Y3 per share. Sales for the first half are expected to fall 8 per cent to Y1,090bn. The company revised its forecast for the half year down from a Y5bn loss to a Y15bn loss. Mr Shigeru Omori, vice-president, said: 'It seems difficult for the business environment to improve in the latter half. The best our company can hope for is to post no profits but no losses either in the second half of 1993-94.' At the beginning of the year in April, steelmakers forecast losses for the first half but had hoped that a forecast recovery in the economy would support corporate earnings for the year. For the year to last March, Nippon Steel saw its annual pre-tax profit plunge by 71.2 per cent to Y28.9bn. The company is working on a three-year cost-cutting plan reviewing its 1980s diversification programmes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Necessary Measures"] </F>   [Text] In perfect accord with Resolution 816 of the United  Nations Security Council, NATO aircraft yesterday shot down four  Serb warplanes in the airspace over Central Bosnia. The  warplanes had been responsible for an attack on a munitions  factory, controlled by the Bosnian government, on the periphery  of Novi Travnik, northwest of Sarajevo. NATO's response,  uncharacteristically decisive, was entirely apt: Security  Council resolutions ban flights by all "fixed-wing aircraft" in  all Bosnian airspace. The prohibition, in force since March  31,1993, is unequivocal: the Serbs cannot seek refuge in  Jesuitical interpretations of text and word.    Also prohibited in clear terms are flights by "rotary-wing  aircraft." Serb and Croat helicopters, however, have violated  the ban with brazen frequency. The Croats, in particular, are  known to have used these aerial means to ferry troops to combat  zones. But what has been bitter sauce in Iraq for the goose has  -- until now -- not been sauce for the gander in Bosnia.  Helicopters have waltzed through Bosnian airspace, encountering  nothing more than the occasional bolt of rhetorical NATO ire.  Force has never been used against them, although it should have  been on more than one occasion.    Yesterday's response to the first instance of breach of the  "no-fly zone" by fixed-wing aircraft was reassuringly swift. It  will have been the intention of the Serbs to test the waters --  or the air -- as regards such aircraft. They can be in no  doubt, now, about NATO's new-found resolve: it has shown, albeit  thoroughly tardily, that it will carry out the mandate handed to  it by the Security Council, which authorised states, "acting  nationally or through regional organisations" to take "all  necessary measures" in Bosnian airspace to ensure compliance  with the ban on overflight. As the Prime Minister, John Major,  put it: "Frankly, they couldn't expect anything else." And the  Russian reaction, while measured, has not been negative: it has  accepted the legitimacy of NATO's action in shooting down the  four warplanes, but has avoided a condemnation of the Serbs for  their aggression.    NATO has used its teeth for the first time, qua NATO, since  its formation in 1949. The significance of this will not be  lost on the Bosnian Serbs. But apart from the particular issue  of the enforcement of a Security Council resolution, its actions  will serve as a more general warning to the Serbs: they cannot  hope to switch with facility from Sarajevo to a different  theatre of war. It is of the utmost importance that the Serbs,  and the Croats, comprehend that NATO is intent on expanding  zones of peace beyond Sarajevo. Mostar and Tuzla are next.    But a few hours after the NATO enforcement action, Bosnian  Serb forces commenced heavy bombardment of the Muslim-controlled  town of Tuzla, which they have besieged remorselessly for more  than two years. But the Security Council has given them until  March 7 to lift their siege of Tuzla airport. Yesterday's  action by NATO must serve as a model for a response to any Serb  failure to "unlock" that airport. NATO, at last, is no longer  playing at war.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Danube row hits plan to widen EC SLOVAKIA'S plan to block and divert the Danube river into the Gabcikovo power plant is causing strains within the joint campaign by Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics to join the European Community. Although all sides are trying to play down the impact of the Hungarian-Slovak row, Mr Gyorgy Granastzoi, Hungary's ambassador to the EC, warned yesterday that any move to divert the Danube would be a 'violation' of Hungary's borders. Mr Granastzoi was speaking at a joint news conference by the three east European countries which made public an 11-page memorandum to the EC aimed at strengthening the integration of the former communist countries into the Community. The EC has described as 'catastrophic' the dispute between Slovakia and Hungary. Tripartite talks under the auspices of the EC took place in Brussels yesterday in an effort to defuse the row and allow technical experts to consider the effects of the planned dam project on the environment. The EC has agreed to mediate on condition that the talks are technical rather than political; and that Slovakia does not carry out any work on the project which is irreversible. The prime ministers of the three east European countries are due to meet Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, in London next week to press their case for starting negotiations on EC accession no later than in 1996. So far the EC has reacted coolly because the huge economic disparities. A full response to the joint memorandum is not expected until the EC summit in Edinburgh in December.</p>

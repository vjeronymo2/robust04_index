			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major General Viktor Filatov: "A Leap on </F> Beijing--It Appears That This Is What the Creators of the `New  World Order' Have in Mind. And Not Without Russia's Help"]    [Text] The Americans are planning field training exercises  at the Totskiy training site in Orenburg Oblast. At the approach  of such events, requests are submitted for ammunition, fuel,  foodstuffs, the number of films to be shown to field training  exercise participants during hours of "rest," the number of  copies of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA to read during the halt... There is  also a request for caskets: There are always corpses at field  training exercises--after all, people fire submachine guns,  throw grenades, fire guns, move around in tanks and armored  personnel carriers, launch rockets... Besides, Orenburg Oblast  is in Asia, the very heart of the Eurasian continent. The  "stars-and-stripes" have never set foot here. On the moon  perhaps, but here--definitely never. It looks like a fool's  dream is coming true: Their stars-and-stripes will be flying  over Eurasia without firing a single shot...    Our side will definitely submit a request for caskets; I am  curious--will the Americans? And if they do, for how many? Ours  will ask for approximately 15 to 20--this is our norm at all  field training exercises without exception. Commanders later  inform mothers tersely: "Died while carrying out his duty..." A  platoon commander and two soldiers--or more often someone going  on leave to the parts where the deceased family lives--bring the  parents the body of their son in a zinc "jacket." After  that--who cares? I am curious how the Americans do it.    Why did I start with caskets? The point is that "by the  number of sides undergoing training, field training exercises  are divided into without and with an opposing force [OPFOR]. At  field training exercises with an OPFOR, the troops (forces) of  each side operate according to their army's tactics. At field  training exercises without OPFOR, the actions of the opposing  side are indicated by specially allocated units, sets of  targets, and other means of imitation in keeping with the  tactics of a foreign army..."    The field training exercises being planned at Totskiy  training site cannot be with an OPFOR since each of the  participating divisions represents in every sense of the word a  completely different "ideology." Does this mean they will be  field training exercises without an OPFOR? It does not figure  otherwise. Who will imitate the enemy? I have seen numerous  field training exercises, and almost always "ours" and "theirs"  in the heat of the battle clash in all seriousness almost in  hand-to-hand combat: Russian against Russian, but from a  neighboring division. And this is, as they say, not the most  deadly thing that happens at training exercises.    Generally speaking, these questions should be addressed to  the field training exercises commander. Field training exercises  have been announced, but there is no commanding officer--or at  least no one has heard of one. Two divisions will participate in  the field training exercises--one of ours and one American.  According to regulations, the field training exercises commander  must be someone one step above a unit commander--in this case, a  division commander. According to regulations, this is an army  commander or higher. There is only one field training exercises  commander. Will the Americans entrust this job to our general?  This is absurd. For the Americans today our general is a  defeated general. They will not place themselves under his  command.    There is a solution--to invite a German. If not as an field  training exercises commander, then as an intermediary--as is  known, there are no field training exercises without an  intermediary. The winners are determined by the intermediary's  reports. Better still, the British: It looks as if they have  some problems in the making with the Chinese regarding Xiangang  and Hong Kong... Most likely, however, a solution will be found  through a "co-" prefix: co-chief, co-commander, co-drinker.    Still, I think that despite everything these will be field  training exercises with an OPFOR--that is, when "troops (forces)  of each side operate by the tactics of their army." The point is  that the Russian army--at least since Yeltsin's time--is a  full-fledged member of NATO, and NATO is a common grave of all  national armies and national military doctrines. It does not  matter that no papers have been signed publicly. Those that need  to be signed have been signed, as they say, behind closed doors.  And there was only one meaning to all the exercises NATO ever  held--to demonstrate "military might," "unity and monolithic  character," "readiness to act against the enemy..." But more  often NATO exercises are used as a "means of political pressure  on the opponent, inciting military hysteria."    Who is NATO's enemy today, when Russia is practically a NATO  member? In this respect it is amusing to watch these Estonias  and Moldovas, who are rushing to get into NATO's trenches  against the Russians in the hope that this "anti-Russian" front  line will be well rewarded. All these Tallinns and Chisinaus  think that they are NATO's road to Moscow. But this is a  mistake: Today they are only milestones by the road, but not to  Moscow. NATO is already in Moscow--without their help. NATO took  Moscow in as a battering ram against Beijing. The Balts, the  Moldovans, or anybody else will not get any profit from this.  Too late.    It is said that the upcoming field training exercises are  aimed against Kazakhstan... You mean against Nazarbayev, who is  completely buddy-buddy with Washington and Billy? Without any  military pressure, Nazarbayev does whatever he is told by  Washington or Brussels. Kazakhstan is as much an occupied  country as Russia.    Clinton, Yeltsin, Nazarbayev... They are people of the same  "campfire," hired for the job by the same personnel  director--the "world government." For each of them, just in  case, there is an almost standard compromising dossier: Clinton  got slapped with real estate machinations; Nazarbayev--with  rigging elections; as to Yeltsin, he got himself in a mess over  so many things on his own that should the "world government"  decide to remove him tomorrow, there will be no Yeltsin the  president. This is what it means to be on hook with the "world  government"--on the brink of impeachment.    For the "world government," Tallinn, Chisinau, Kiev,  Alma-Ata  [Almaty]--all of them are a road to nowhere. While Moscow for  the "world government" is a road to Beijing. What do Estonia et  al have to do with it? It was back under Gorbachev that in  accordance with allegedly mutual agreement with the USSR, within  the framework of the completely mythical for us European  security, all our troops began to be pulled beyond the Urals.  Under Yeltsin the only troops left in the European part of  Russia are essentially two punitive divisions near Moscow. The  entire army is in the east. Facing what enemy?    Today only great China is free; it is the only country where  a new occupation regime under the name of the "new world order"  has not been established. True, in Russia there has been a  show-inspection of some mythical troops in Kaliningrad (when the  entire army is in the east), pretending that a new impregnable  Koenigsberg is being created in the west. Against whom? Against  Lithuania, which in the best times, pardon me, of its  independence under the Germans had an army of 80,000, counting  the rear services? Against Poland? This is absurd--it will have  quite a task now to hold the German lands in the west without  the USSR's aid. It is facing score-settling with "that" side,  not "this" one. Stalin knew what he was doing when he palmed off  to the Poles the traditionally German lands. They will be lucky  if they avoid a fourth partition today...    All this being done for diversion, in order not to alarm  Beijing before the time comes. The "world government" is taking  it into hard tongs: in the East--the American-South Korean  group, and in the West--the American-Russian one. China is  condemned by the "world government" to at least quartering: into  Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and the South--the Yunan  territory... But the No. 1 point is Xinjiang--the Xinjiang  Autonomous District. Nazarbayev knows some details of this big  game; that is why he is now hustling to move the capital from  Alma-Ata further away from the potential military operations  theater: under any outcome, Alma-Ata will have it. It was  founded by Russians as the Vernyy military post. There is a  possibility that Alma-Ata once again will be reduced to its  original status...    Sowing discord between the Russians and the Chinese is an  old  and painstaking job for the "world government." They succeeded  once--and we had Damanskiy and Zhalanoshkol. By the way,  Zhalanoshkol is awfully close to Alma-Ata, almost next door.  Nazarbayev probably also remembers the bodies of Soviet border  troops who defended Soviet Zhalanoshkol. Both we and the Chinese  had dead bodies at Damanskiy and in Zhalanoshkol. And also...    Hungarian analysts, for instance, believe that in 1973 we  amassed a million-strong army against China. An action against  China, a confrontation with it, eventually cost us $200-250  billion. We spent $60 billion on the war in Afghanistan, and as  much on the war between China and Vietnam: both these conflicts  were a "continuation of the Russo-Chinese discord." An expense  of a minimum of $320 billion--this is greater than the combined  material damage to European countries inflicted by World War II  ($260 billion, of which $128 billion was sustained by the USSR).  And how much did China spent on preparations for war against the  USSR? And how much did Comecon countries spend--after all, the  action was held on two fronts?...    Direct military expenditures represent only a small part of  expenses of a different nature in the Russo-Chinese conflict. We  should not forget that China used to tie down a considerable  part of the American military potential. This is true today as  well.    There has existed since the Vietnam war time the so-called  "Nixon doctrine"--"Asians should kill Asians." It is a very  well-developed doctrine, tested in many Asian wars. Nobody has  repealed it to this day--on the contrary, it had been constantly  perfected.    As soon as the joint exercises were announced, PRAVDA ran an  article under the eloquent heading "We Do Not Mention Damanskiy,  But..." And this subheading: "Russia-China: Are There Border  Problems?" It is amazing how synchronously the boys are working  for the "world government," even though perhaps quite  unwittingly! The article hypes up hysteria against the Chinese:  They harass Russians, it says, everywhere--at farmers markets,  in the taiga, in hotels... But what does China have to do with  it if Russia is such a mess? I would write it off as stupidity  had the article been signed by some "reader" or correspondent.  But the signature under it is that of a doctor of historical  science.    I agree that one article, even written by a PhD, does not a  spring make, but now the entire occupation press is turning out  in a broad-front attack against China. In the near future we  should expect a massive artillery attack on the part of all  occupation mass media against China. They already dusted off  Damanskiy... Somebody is already making China into the No. 1  Enemy of Russia. Why? Who needs it?    By the way, it was China that saved us after 1946 from an  atomic bomb striking simultaneously 100 cities in the USSR, the  union and friendship with China. The Chinese said: Our atomic  bomb is our 1 billion population. It was only later that we  developed our own atomic bomb. The discord that was sown between  USSR and China turned out to be a catastrophe not only for the  USSR but for all countries of East Europe, the entire so-called  socialist camp. The enmity that is now being planted in  relations between China and Russia will cost Russians their  complete annihilation.    There is rumor that Beria was an old English spy. Allegedly  since the time they were masters of the Transcaucasus--in  1918-1921. Maybe he did indeed serve British intelligence--I  have not had the opportunity to look in the safes of British  special services. But... "I know them from their deeds:" Beria  very seriously "developed" Xinjiang--this is a fact. To have  Xinjiang is absolutely not a Russian national dream and goal.    Some time in the past in Alma-Ata I met some people. They  were mostly Uygurs. There are a lot of them living in and around  Alma-Ata. There are many more of them living on the other side  of the border, in Xinjiang-Uygur Autonomous Okrug. After 1945  Beria planted in Xinjiang under the guise of various specialists  a tremendous number of Uygurs from Kazakhstan, from the entire  territory of the USSR. They gradually took all the key positions  in the autonomous okrug. Events were moving in the direction of  the creation of an independent state of Uygurstan and its  secession from China. Is this a Russian dream?    Events took a different turn, though. Stalin died. We  executed Beria. Failures began in Xinjiang--in short, the  Chinese massacred all of ours there. Very few escaped with their  life by jumping the border. In Alma-Ata, in the USSR in general,  nobody needed the surviving Uygurs. They lived almost illegally,  without residence permits--with relatives and friends. The new  rulers pretended that they did not know such people--Uygurs.  This probably was true. The dreadful authority, although Beria  was no longer there, set up its own people--who did not even  suspect where they were being led--for a massacre and  annihilation, and those who escaped could not even get a  residence permit in their home town. They did not have the term  "new world order" then, but that does not change the substance  of the matter.    As to the Chinese, in connection with these so-called joint  exercises the Americans and Pasha Grachev are about to run, they  should start viewing attentively in today's Xinjiang--as well as  in Beijing--their own, Chinese, Gorbachevs, Yeltsins, Kravchuks,  and Shushkeviches. Judging by the game, everything is moving in  the direction of a Chinese Novo-Ogarevo, a Xinjiang Belovezha  Preserve, And look less at the United States. Plus move more  troops into Xinjiang, as they did in the memorable incidence of  the failure of the attempt to create a Soviet Uygurstan.</p>

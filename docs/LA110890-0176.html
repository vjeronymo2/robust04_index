			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Investor Buys Caesars World Stake: San Diego real estate investor M. Larry  Lawrence has purchased about 400,000 shares of Los Angeles-based Caesars World  Inc., the casino operator.  </P> <P> The stake, less than 2%, is an investment accumulated over four months, said  Alan Aiello, investment manager for Lawrence, who owns the Hotel del Coronado  in San Diego. "We bought it not as a shot at a buyout, but as a core holding,"  Aiello said. There has been speculation that Caesars is a takeover candidate.  Caesars stock fell 12.5 cents to $15.125 Wednesday.  </P></p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Higher than expected UK average earnings, together with initial weakness on Wall Street, reversed early strength in the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 3,145 on the back of the firm overnight performance on Wall Street that followed the increase in US interest rates. Within minutes of the start of business, June was trading at 3,160, with sentiment boosted by a steady performance in other European markets. However, a further advance was cut short with the release of average earnings data, interpreted as a further blow to chances of a reduction in UK interest rates. The contract drifted lower on concerted selling, with the poor start to trading in New York only serving to increase the downward pressure on June. Having fallen to a low of 3,106, the contract closed at 3,110, down 14 from its previous close and at a 10-point discount to the fair value premium of about minus 3. Volume at 18,009 lots was good. Healthy turnover was also recorded in traded options, where 44,895 lots were dealt, In the index options, 16,224 were traded in the FT-SE 100 option and 3,682 in the Euro FT-SE option. BT was the busiest stock option with a total of 4,802 contracts.</p>

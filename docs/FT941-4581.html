			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Surge at SBC prompts upbeat profits forecast Swiss Bank Corporation, Switzerland's third-largest banking group, held out the prospect of still higher profits this year after a 36 per cent jump in 1993 net income to SFr1.37bn (Dollars 951.4m). 'We expect an increase that will make us very happy,' Mr Georges Blum, who became chief executive a year ago, said at SBC's annual press conference. He forecast that a reduction in bad-loan provisions, plus higher income from fund management and foreign banking business, would overcome the anticipated decline in trading income from last year's exceptional level. There was still considerable room for cost-cutting, he said. The 9.6 per cent growth in non-personnel expenses in 1993 was too high. 'Effective cost containment is one of our top priorities for the current year,' Mr Blum said. Moreover, the bank took advantage of last year's high profits to make generous provisions for the group's troublesome loan portfolio. Mr Blum recalled that, in the late 1980s 'mistakes were made' because of the bank's expansive lending policy. SBC had significant exposures to several of the biggest corporate collapses of the past few years, including, most recently, Metallgesellschaft in Germany. 'The major share of value adjustments should be over,' he said. Mr Blum defended the directors' decision to propose only a 14.3 per cent rise in dividends this year, pointing out that last year's 36 per cent rise in net income was due in large measure to the extraordinary 82 per cent jump in profits, to SFr2.91bn, from trading and derivatives business. Net interest income was up only 1 per cent to SFr3.1bn, reflecting depressed business conditions in Switzerland and elsewhere. However, he said the subscription price for new shares SBC would offer shareholders under an optional dividend substitution scheme would be lower than the SFr318.5 per bearer share offered last year. Mr Marcel Ospel, head of international capital markets and treasury, said SBC's highly-regarded financial operations and derivatives business made a pre-tax profit of between SFr1.5bn and SFr2bn last year, and achieved a 38 per cent return on equity. Derivatives alone had an 80 per cent return.</p>

			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MOVIE PAINS REFORMED HIT MAN  </P> <P> The black comedy "I Love You to Death" about Frances Toto's efforts to kill her  husband, Tony, is no laughing matter for a hit man portrayed in the film by  River Phoenix.  </P> <P> Toto spent four years in prison for the attempts on her husband's life.  </P> <P> The Totos then reunited and sold the rights to their story to a production  company for an undisclosed sum.  </P> <P> Tracey Ullman and Kevin Kline star as the Totos. Phoenix plays a character  based on the hit man, Anthony Bruno.  </P> <P> "The problem I have with it is I have to live every day of my life knowing I  tried to hurt someone. To me, that is no joke," Bruno said.  </P> <P> Bruno, 28, was released on parole Jan. 1 after serving 5 1/2 years in prison  for trying to murder Toto, a former pizza shop owner from Allentown.  </P> <P> He said he is angry that the Totos seem to be capitalizing on the crimes.  </P> <P> "Frances is going on talk shows now. She sits there and laughs. This has ruined  my life," said Bruno.  </P> <P> "I'm definitely a different person," Bruno said. "I've matured a lot."  </P> <P> "After spending 5 1/2 years in prison, you realize things aren't a joke," he  said.  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Damp strike YESTERDAY'S DAMP squib of a general strike in Spain marked a victory for the efforts of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, to steer his country down the road of EC convergence. However, the toughest part of Spain's bid to prepare for economic and monetary union is still to come. The drive to bring Spain's economy more into line with the performance of its European partners represents a threefold challenge. It will test Mr Gonzalez's ability to govern up to and beyond the next general election, due to take place no later than October 1993. It will test Spain's ability to compete successfully with the rest of the industrialised world. And it will test the Community's ability to sustain a political consensus in favour of the strict Emu disciplines imposed under the Maastricht treaty. On the first point, Mr Gonzalez's achievement in standing up to union opposition must improve his chances of going to the polls as Spain's unscathed Don Convergencia. The latter two tasks will be more difficult. The challenges have been increased by slower growth in western Europe, now weathering a period of economic doldrums comparable only with the 1981-82 recession. Spain, in common with other EC countries, has tailored its medium-term economic strategy to the goal of meeting - if not bettering - the Maastricht economic convergence objectives. Yet the strictness of the targets seems likely to limit the opportunities for a resumption of higher EC growth by the mid-1990s. Without this faster expansion, Community members will face great problems in generating the extra fiscal revenues needed to satisfy the Emu requirement of bringing their budgets into better balance. The EC must be alive to the risk that the Maastricht route could turn into a vicious circle. Spain's general government budget deficit is still stuck at more than 4 per cent of gross domestic product, against the Maastricht target of 3 per cent. Lowering this fiscal imbalance by cutting public subsidies and reducing unemployment benefits forms the centrepiece of Mr Gonzalez's convergence plan. Spain arguably has a better chance of meeting the Maastricht targets than Italy, warned by the EC last week in the stiffest terms to bring its budget policies on track for Emu. To soften the impact of planned fiscal austerity, Madrid is placing great store on the Maastricht pledge for the northern states to provide southern EC members with 'cohesion' funds to ease the strictures of Emu. Germany, whose generosity as the EC's principal paymaster has been necessarily reduced by reunification, is however making clear that cutting its own budget deficit must take priority over channelling largesse southwards. Mr Gonzalez may have parried yesterday's thrust from the union leaders. He still has to grapple with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</p>

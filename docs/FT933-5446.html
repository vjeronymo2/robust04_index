			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Order on Elstree Studios weighed HERTSMERE Borough Council has decided to consider placing a compulsory purchase order on the historic Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. This would reduce the value of the 15.5-acre site to make it more tempting for film-makers. Its owner Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, wants to sell it to developers.</p>

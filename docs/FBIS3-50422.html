			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Untitled commentary by Bozena Wawrzewska under the </F> "Commentaries" rubric]    [Text] Yesterday, the government displayed some peculiar  behavior which was watched by all of society.    The prime minister dismissed Deputy Finance Minister  Kawalec,  about which Mr. Kawalec learned from the radio. The superior of  the dismissed minister--Marek Borowski, finance minister and  deputy prime minister--whose motion would be needed to bring  about a dismissal like this, addressed a question to the prime  minister on the reasons behind the dismissal. In reply, PAP  received a communique issued by the Government's Press Office to  the effect that Deputy Finance Minister Kawalec's dismissal is  not linked to the privatization of Bank Slaski, whereas the real  reasons were not given either to the press or to Deputy Prime  Minister Borowski. All the prime minister's press secretary had  to say is that there he has no comment on the issue.    Politics require the courage to tell the truth directly,  even  when it is about decisions which were hard to make. The prime  minister has asked the press to report honestly, but what he is  doing now is condemning journalists for speculating and  expressing views on what could be described as a weird style of  governing, to put it mildly.    So, faced with deficiencies in the government's information  policies and with a lack of explanations which the public  expects, one is entitled to draw different kinds of conclusions  on, for instance, possible frictions within the coalition, a  battle between the Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left  Alliance, mutual disloyalties among different cabinet members  who talk to one another through journalists, who--as they often  stress--they distrust, or about facing coalition partners with  accomplished facts, which is not the first time this has  happened.</p>

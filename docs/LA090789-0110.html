			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAZDA REALIGNS MANAGEMENT AT OFFICE IN IRVINE  </P> <P> Mazda Motor of America said Wednesday that it has realigned management at the  company's corporate headquarters in Irvine.  </P> <P> The restructuring is intended to make the company more responsive to Mazda  dealers and customers by streamlining operations, said spokesman Al Goldberg.  "It's management fine-tuning," he said.  </P> <P> The realignment follows a major reorganization at Mazda 14 months ago, when the  company centralized its U.S. sales operations in Irvine. At the time, Irvine  was the regional office for 31 Central and Western states, with other regional  importing and sales offices in Jacksonville, Fla., and Honolulu.  </P> <P> In last year's restructuring, the three offices were consolidated into one in  Irvine, called Mazda Motor of America Inc., which is responsible for importing,  marketing and selling Mazdas in the United States through its 844 dealers.  After that consolidation, Mazda Motor of America still had separate groups for  operations and for sales and marketing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easier to Communicate  </P> <P> The changes announced this week are "the next step," basically eliminating  those two groups, Goldberg said. In their place is a new Operations Group,  which includes most of the functions of the former two groups.  </P> <P> The new structure "will make it easier to communicate with dealers primarily,"  Goldberg said. "Now everything is under one responsibility -- rather than two  separate groups with different management."  </P> <P> George McCabe, formerly group vice president-sales and marketing, has been  named group vice president-operations. His duties include the firm's five  regional offices, sales operations, dealer development and advertising. That  gives McCabe responsibility for more than half of Mazda's 1,152 employees in  the Irvine headquarters.  </P> <P> McCabe joined Mazda in 1974 as a district sales manager in the New York area.  He progressed steadily through the company's ranks. Before joining Mazda, he  was with the Chrysler Corp.  </P></p>

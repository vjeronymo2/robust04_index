			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> GIRL, 16, DIES 4 1/2 DAYS AFTER WORLD'S 1ST LUNG DEVICE IMPLANT  </P> <P> A teen-age girl died this morning 4 1/2 days after becoming the world's first  recipient of an implanted device that works like a lung.  </P> <P> LDS Hospital spokesman Tim Madden said Melicia Harvey, 16, of Arthur City,  Tex., died of pulmonary failure at 5:30 a.m. The experimental IntraVascular  Oxygenator -- a 20-inch bundle of hollow synthetic fibers that delivers oxygen  to the blood -- functioned as intended until the girl's death, Madden said.  </P> <P> Harvey had been in critical condition throughout the experiment with severe  respiratory distress syndrome, which results from a variety of causes and is  characterized by inability of the lungs to transfer oxygen to the blood.  </P> <P> The IVOX, approved for use for up to a week to allow damaged lungs to rest and  recover, was implanted during two hours of surgery Friday.  </P> <P> Harvey, whose father, Atrell Harvey II, is employed by Campbell Soup Co., had  been a member of the student council at North Lamar High School in Paris, Tex.  The girl's mother, Edith, died Jan. 31 of undisclosed causes.  </P></p>

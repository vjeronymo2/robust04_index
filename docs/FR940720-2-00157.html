Instead, Security Life will deduct from the sub-accounts each valuation period a distribution fee equal to .15% of sub-account assets on an annualized basis, and prior to the maturity date, a 3% withdrawal charge (contingent deferred sales charge) will be assessed in circumstances where complete or partial withdrawals are attributed to purchase payments made within three years prior to the date of the withdrawal. Applicants represent that the distribution fee and the withdrawal charge are intended to reimburse Security Life for compensation paid to cover selling concessions to broker-dealers, preparation of sales literature and other expenses relating to sales activity. Applicants rely on Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the Act to impose the withdrawal charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. To compensate it for assuming mortality and expense risks under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contracts, Security Life deducts from each sub-account a charge each valuation period at an effective annual rate of 1.25%, consisting of .80% for the mortality risks and .45% for the expense risks. The rate of the mortality and expense risk charge cannot be increased.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Mortality risk assumed by Security Life under the Contracts is the risk that annuitants may live for a longer period of time than estimated. Security Life assumes this mortality risk by virtue of annuity rates incorporated into the Contract which cannot be changed. This assures each annuitant that his longevity will not have an adverse effect on the amount of annuity payments. Also, Security Life guarantees that if the owner dies before the maturity date, it will pay a death benefit. The expense risk assumed by Security Life is the risk that the administration fees, which cannot be increased, may be insufficient to cover actual expenses. If the mortality and expense risk charge is insufficient to cover the actual cost of the mortality and expense risk undertakings, Security Life will bear the loss. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to Security Life and will be available for any proper corporate purpose including, among other things, payment of distribution expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any persons, securities, or transactions from any provision of the 1940 Act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the issuer of a periodic payment plan certificate, and any depositor or underwriter for such issuer, from selling such periodic payment plan certificate unless proceeds of payments on such certificates (other than sales loads) are held under an indenture or agreement containing specified provisions. Section 26(a)(2) and the Rules thereunder do not permit a deduction from the assets of a separate account for mortality and expense risk charges or distribution expense charges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

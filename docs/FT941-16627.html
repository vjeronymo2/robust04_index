			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: East gives west a boost - Hong Kong's growth has stimulated fund performance Do not be disappointed if your unit or investment trust is not included in the four tables (below) of the top collective funds over three and 10 years. Figures released this week by Micropal show that those heading the list are most likely to be highly specialist funds. Take the unit trust tables; eight of the 10 funds listed over the two periods are in the Far East (excluding Japan) sector. Much of the growth has come from a sharp increase in Hong Kong; last year alone, the Hang Seng index rose by 115 per cent. Hong Kong is seen by many fund managers as the most exciting growth 'opportunity' of the future because of the capitalist transformation of the Chinese economy. It is, therefore, no surprise that the fund which has dominated the Far East (excluding Japan) sector is one invested mainly there. Gartmore Hong Kong heads both unit trust tables and was also the top-performing unit trust over five years (all figures to the beginning of January; offer to bid with net income re-invested). There are, however, unlikely to be many private investors brave enough to have chosen Hong Kong as their main investment home. While being open to pent-up demand and economic reform in China, the colony's stock market is also vulnerable to internal Chinese politics and to Beijing's volatile relations with the west. Still, anyone who had the foresight 10 years ago to invest, say, Pounds 5,000 in Gartmore's Hong Kong fund would have turned this into almost Pounds 59,000 today. The two other top-performing unit trusts listed in the tables are both in the European sector. Baring European Growth has a strong long-term performance record and was managed for many years by the widely-respected Crispin Odey, who left in 1991. The fund has increased since then from about Pounds 260m to Pounds 480m, and is managed now by Omid Kamshad. St James's Place is a three-man investment team which, apart from managing a range of unit trusts, also runs pension and life funds for J. Rothschild Assurance, the company established by Sir Mark Weinberg and Lord Rothschild. The strongest performers among the investment trusts are from a wider variety of sectors but, once again, the specialists are not confined to the short-term performance tables. The investment trust figures are calculated on a mid-market to mid-market basis, with net income re-invested. The top fund over 10 years - Capital Gearing - invests in the shares of other investment trusts and is a small fund with only Pounds 10m of assets. The second-best performer over the same period was the capital shares of the split-capital M&amp;G Second Dual trust, which is due to be wound up in 1995. Capital shares are highly-geared and are regarded traditionally as risky investments, since they have no claim to the income of the trust but rely on performance to reap the remaining assets on wind-up. The table does, however, include the more mainstream TR City of London and Law Debenture, both managed by Henderson Touche Remnant. Law Debenture is invested in a broad international spread of investments and is managed by Michael Moule, who was also TR City of London's fund manager until 1991. TR City invests mainly in blue chip UK stocks with the aim of producing a higher than average yield. The three-year investment trust performance figures are, once again, led by an oddity. The ordinary shares of the split-level TR Technology fund are highly-geared. John Korwin-Szymanowski, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg, says this gearing has been created by the presence of zero dividend and stepped preference shares. The trust invests in high technology companies, mostly in the UK and US. Murray Enterprise is a split-capital trust with an investment strategy of capital growth through investment mainly in unlisted securities. The other funds in the three-year investment trust table are in the Far East (excluding Japan) sector. Scottish Asian was launched in 1990 by Murray Johnstone. Korwin-Szymanowski says it is differentiated from most Far East funds by the investment policies of Peter Montgomery, its manager. He has a reputation for preferring large weightings in markets he believes will perform well rather than a diluted portfolio. Although most of the top-performing collective funds are specialists, it is reassuring to see the presence of well-established names. Murray Johnstone and Henderson Touche take the lion's share as managers of the top investment trusts, while the glory is spread more broadly among the unit trusts. Capel-Cure Asset Management, which featured prominently in the same exercise in the previous two years, is conspicuous by its absence this time round. Funds which topped the tables this year will not necessarily do so in future. As recent articles by John Cuthbert in the Weekend FT have shown, investors need to examine the trade-off between the risks taken by managers and the returns they achieve.  --------------------------------------------       BEST UNIT TRUSTS OVER 10 YEARS  -------------------------------------------- Trust                          % growth  -------------------------------------------- Gartmore HK                    1,179.56 S&amp;P SE Asia Grwth                878.04 Baring Euro Grwth                742.29 Invesco HK &amp; China               682.16 St James Pl Gtr Euro             612.27  --------------------------------------------     BEST INVESTMENT TRUSTS OVER 10 YEARS  -------------------------------------------- Trust                          % growth  -------------------------------------------- Capital Gearing                1,310.00 M&amp;G 2nd Dual-Cap                 803.23 Murray Smllr Mrkts               795.45 Law Debenture                    759.09 TR City of London                741.07  --------------------------------------------       BEST UNIT TRUSTS OVER THREE YEARS  -------------------------------------------- Trust                          % growth  -------------------------------------------- Gartmore Hong Kong               453.00 Prov Capitol HK                  393.83 Fidelity Asean                   372.85 J Capel HK Grwth                 360.95 Invesco HK &amp; China               355.47  --------------------------------------------    BEST INVESTMENT TRUSTS OVER THREE YEARS  -------------------------------------------- Trust                          % growth  -------------------------------------------- TR Technology-Ord                607.95 Murray Enterprise                428.66 Scottish Asian                   423.23 Gartmore Emrg Pacif              379.89 TR Pacific                       367.03  --------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- The Republic of China  [ROC] will again protest the Asian Development Bank's (ADB)  unilateral decision to change the ROC's title at the  international banking institute to "Taipei, China."    Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying, who will lead an ROC  delegation to the 27th ADB board of directors meeting scheduled  to open May 3 in Nice, France, said the name change was  unacceptable and unjust.    The unilateral decision to change the name deprived the ROC,  an ADB founder, of its rights at the international banking  institution, Li said.    Li said he may issue the protest during the meeting either  directly to the ADB board chairman, or in a statement when he  makes an oral report.    The ADB changed Taiwan's representative name from Chinese,  Taipei into "Taipei, China" after Beijing joined the group in  1986. Taipei refused to take part in any ADB activities in  protest of the insensitive and unfair treatment in 1986 and 1987.    Taipei resumed its involvement with the ADB and returned to  the annual board meeting in 1988 after President Li Teng-hui  advocated more pragmatic diplomatic measures.    The ROC mission protested the name change during a board  meeting last year by placing a sign reading "under protest"  above the "Taipei, China" designation.</p>

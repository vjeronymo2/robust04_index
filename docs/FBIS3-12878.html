The Meretz Knesset  faction threatens to walk out of the coalition the moment Labor  starts negotiating with Tzomet on joining the government. This  was decided tonight in a meeting attended by Meretz ministers  and its caucus. Meretz notes that the coalition agreement gives  it veto powers over other parties joining the coalition, and it  is certain that Prime Minister Rabin will abide by the  agreement. Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that Meretz  says that coopting Tzomet into the coalition will constitute a  negative message to the PLO leadership, Israel's Arab community,  and the entire peace process.    Minister Shulamit Aloni informed Prime Minister Rabin of the  Meretz decision. She said his response was indignation and that  he said he would continue contacts with Tzomet. Minister Aloni  said the prime minister thinks Meretz has to do his bidding and  that he demands more from it than from his own party. She said  they are two separate parties and the Meretz position also has  to be taken into account.    Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent that  following the Meretz decision his information permits  negotiations into Tzomet joining the government.    Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said the Meretz decision  is strange. It is unclear why they rule out Tzomet, which is  ready to join on the basis of the government's basic guidelines,  he said.</p>

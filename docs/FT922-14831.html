			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Carlton lacks news supply for teletext bid CARLTON Communications' bid for a 10-year public teletext licence has been made without a contract for a news supplier. Unlike the other four bidders for the licence at present held by Oracle, the commercial teletext company, Carlton was unable to reach agreement with the Press Association, the UK news agency that supplies most newspapers and broadcasters. Carlton, the television facilities and production company that won the London weekday licence from Thames Television, is bidding in a joint venture with Intelfax. The company has accompanied its bid with a confidential letter suggesting how it would obtain its news supply if it won the bid battle. One suggestion is that Independent Television News could be the news supplier. ITN, however, is trying to win the franchise itself in a joint venture with MAI Broadcasting, Scottish Television and Anglia Television. Carlton argues that it will easily negotiate a news contract if it wins the licence. Rivals argue that the lack of a contract might lead to Carlton's failing the initial quality threshold.</p>

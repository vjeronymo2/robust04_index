			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandr Grebenkov, head of the laboratory </F> of the Institute of Energy Problems at the Belarusian Academy of  Sciences, by Yevgeniy Rostikov; place and date not given: ``Will  Waste Dumping Be on the Sun, Too?'' -- first paragraph is  RESPUBLIKA introduction]    [Text] Today, when those in our Republic who suffered so  much from the ``peaceful atom'' are more and more loudly voicing  demands for more Belarusian nuclear power stations, the position  of Vitaliy Trubnikov seems very representative. I am not going  to discount the contention that the ``risk levels of operating  nuclear stations is very low.'' This calls for a separate and  serious discussion. This time, I brought up the issue of  radioactive waste. Everyone knows where it comes from.  However, the question is how and where to bury it. I asked  Aleksandr Grebenkov, head of the laboratory of the Institute of  Energy Problems at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, to share  his opinion on this issue.    Grebenkov: Indeed, the problem of radioactive  waste remains one of the most difficult and expensive issues.  It first arose during the development and creation of the first  atomic bomb. In the United States, all wastes, chemicals, and  even clothes were mixed with concrete in a special laboratory,  loaded in containers and dumped in the Massachusetts Bay near  Boston.    In the Soviet Union, the attitude was just as neglectful.  Radioactive wastes were often discarded at unequipped and  unguarded dump sites. However, as far as I know, there were no  such sites in our Republic before the Chernobyl catastrophe.    Rostikov: And what about the burial ground in  Minsk?    Grebenkov: That's a different matter. The burial  place in Sosny, established specifically for this purpose, is a  sophisticated engineering facility equipped with several  protective barriers. It has been operating for several decades  now without any problems. The problem is, however, that it is no  longer large enough. The situation became especially difficult  after the Chernobyl accident. At first, we shipped all  Chernobyl-related waste to the scientific and industrial  amalgamation ``Prypyat'' in Ukraine. Now that our republics  have become independent states, Ukraine refuses to accept  ``foreign'' radioactive waste. This is why we found ourselves  confronted with a need to set up our own dump sites -- because  you cannot consider as dump sites the dustheaps scattered all  over Homel and Mohylev Oblasts, where bulldozers dig radioactive  litter into holes covered at best with polyethylene. After some  time, those holes sag and accumulate water, which can easily  penetrate into the ground waters. Over the past two years, the  State Chernobyl Committee has conducted inventories of those  sites to determine how dangerous they are.    Rostikov: But it was the Committee that once  sanctioned those burial sites.    Grebenkov: This was all we could do at that time.  Some villages needed to be buried. The fires last year showed  how dangerous the secondary transfer of radiation is. Add to  this marauding... Also the problem of burying ashes from burning  radioactive wood and peat, where the concentration of  radioactive substances is 50 times of that in wood, is acute.  Silt is another source of radioactivity. No one knows so far  what to do with it. Water is evaporating, increasing the risk of  secondary transfer of radiation.    Rostikov: Where do you plan to locate stationary  burial sites?    Grebenkov: In several places. One of them is in  Homel Oblast, near Khatki. They would comply with all  international standards.    Rostikov: What do you know about the construction  of the burial site at the ``Marlinskiye Hamlets'' military  firing ground near Stolin? Local residents claim that this will  be where not only local waste will be buried but also waste from  atomic stations and CIS and Western nuclear submarines.    Grebenkov: This area was heavily contaminated in  the Chernobyl accident. Since intensive clean-up measures are  being conducted there at this time, one has to do something with  the collected radioactive dirt. This burial site will  efficiently block the spread of radiation throughout the  Republic. However, this site will, so to say, serve local needs  -- there could be no talk about any waste from other regions,  let alone from other countries.</p>

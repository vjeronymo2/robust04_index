			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: RAPPING THE GIFTS;  </P> <P> AFTER YEARS ON THE RECEIVING END, A MAN MAKES HIS PRESENTS KNOWN  </P> <P> AS A MAN who has almost everything, I have decided that I don't want anything  more.  </P> <P> I may not have quite everything, but I certainly have everything that I want.  </P> <P> I am making this position public because I want to impress its seriousness upon  all of my loved ones -- especially my wife.  </P> <P> She likes to buy things for me that she thinks I need. She is convinced that  (1) I don't know what I need, (2) I'm too shiftless to buy it for myself, or  (3) I'm too cheap.  </P> <P> Consequently, I own a stationary bicycle that remains exactly that: stationary.  </P> <P> By design, it not only does not move from place to place, but its pedals never  turn. I tried working them once or twice, but I found the exercise too boring.  </P> <P> Then my wife bought me a small color television set that I could watch while  exercising.  </P> <P> I found nothing to watch during my exercise hour but cartoons and boring  variety shows.  </P> <P> The television set now sits at the end of the kitchen counter. If I happen to  be watching a sex-and-violence movie in the living room while my wife is  preparing dinner, she watches the same show on the kitchen TV set. That way she  keeps apace with my cultural enlightenment.  </P> <P> When I complained of being bored while working out on the rowing machine on my  three mornings a week at the gym, she bought me a compact disc player and a  clutch of discs. It worked fine for a while. I listened to Beethoven and Mozart  while I imagined I was rowing across the Hellespont.  </P> <P> Then my instructor took me off the rowing machine and put me on the treadmill.  It is not practical to listen to a CD player while walking on the treadmill. So  my wife bought me one of those little radios that is concealed in a set of  headphones.  </P> <P> I found the tuning knob too tiny to turn with accuracy, but by chance I got it  fixed on KFAC and enjoyed classical music for a while. But I left it on between  visits and the battery is dead. I haven't had enough desire to buy a new one.  </P> <P> Some years ago, she bought me a telescope, which I suspect was expensive. One  night, from our house in Baja, I saw Saturn, with its rings, through it. I was  thrilled. However, I have never found Saturn again, and the telescope sits  unused.  </P> <P> Once or twice I tried focusing it on the windows of our neighbors' houses  across the canyon, but I felt guilty about that and gave it up.  </P> <P> My wife's most recent gift to me was a fax machine.  </P> <P> As I foresaw, it has been of little use, though I was thrilled one morning to  see that David Hockney was sending me copies of some of his work.  </P> <P> A few times I have received material from The Times' library, but I would say  the fax is not paying for itself. The only communication I've received in weeks  is an ad from some fax repair and supply company.  </P> <P> Just the other day, the United Parcel Service man brought a large package that  turned out to be a machine that I can pedal to exercise my legs while I'm  working at my computer or watching television. Unfortunately, it came  unassembled.  </P> <P> Long ago, after a frustrating three hours trying to put a microwave stand  together, I swore never to assemble anything ever again. Selling things  unassembled ought to be against the law. The next thing you know they'll be  selling us cars in a carton with a screwdriver and a wrench and a set of  directions written in "Japanenglish."  </P> <P> I live in constant anxiety that my wife is going to buy me something else.  What's left? All I can think of is a telephone for my car.  </P> <P> Of all the things I don't want, a telephone for my car would come first. I  think the idea of making telephone calls while you're driving on the freeway is  insane. And the idea of receiving telephone calls while you're driving on the  freeway is worse. Driving on the freeway is stressful enough without holding a  conversation with someone who isn't there.  </P> <P> But who knows? Maybe when I retire, I can watch the neighbors through my  telescope while I'm using the pedaling machine to exercise my legs -- if I can  get my wife to assemble it.  </P></p>

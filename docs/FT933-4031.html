			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: BTR There are real reasons for disappointment with BTR's first half results. The operating margin has fallen; profit before interest would also be down without the effect of exchange rate changes. But BTR's failure to deliver strong organic growth only adds to the impression that it looks in need of an acquisition again. Unlike Williams, whose results also disappointed earlier this week, BTR's balance sheet is increasingly able to support such a move. Gearing has fallen by 8 percentage points since December. The disposal of Newey &amp; Eyre and the enhanced scrip dividend will reduce it by about 12 points more. A year from now the cash outlay on restructuring acquisitions could have dwindled to a trickle. Yet, if an acquisition looks both desirable and affordable, a suitable target may be hard to find. At current market levels a contested bid for a listed company could be prohibitively expensive. Shopping for an agreed trade purchase might not yield anything large enough. The most interesting opportunities could lie overseas. BTR's enhanced scrip dividend would make greater sense if it reflected a realisation that an even larger proportion of future earnings would be generated abroad.</p>

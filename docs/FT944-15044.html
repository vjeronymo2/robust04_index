			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: SIB may be given expanded function The Treasury has proposed devolving more of its regulatory powers under the Financial Services Act to the Securities and Investments Board, while taking on additional duties for itself regulating occupational pensions and insurance. The Treasury's proposal to devolve more of its duties to SIB is seen as a vote of confidence in SIB's activities. In its review document released yesterday the Treasury proposed three key areas where it felt SIB could expand its role. The Treasury said its director of finance regulation and industry should review whether additional work could be passed to SIB without primary legislation. In particular, the Treasury would pass on the day-to-day responsibility for overseeing the listing department of the London Stock Exchange, a move which would make SIB more like the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a development is unlikely to be welcomed by the exchange, which is under pressure from SIB to alter some of its rules on the transparency of transactions. Moreover, the move would create additional expense for the exchange because, unlike the Treasury, where costs are paid for out of tax revenues, SIB must recover the costs of its activities from the regulated bodies themselves. The Treasury said it would like to pass on the responsibility for determining whether the rules and operation of overseas exchanges that wish to conduct investment business in the UK are as rigorous as those of domestic exchanges. While SIB already has a consulting role in making these decisions, the Treasury is the final arbiter. The Treasury has also proposed that SIB take on responsibility for determining which territories offer equivalent investor protection to that in the UK. Investment businesses from equivalently-regulated territories may be allowed to operate in Britain. Senior Treasury officials had been hinting for months that they believed responsibility for regulation of occupational pensions and prudential supervision of life assurance companies should be concentrated in its department. Yesterday's document said: 'In particular we see considerable logic and attractions in the suggestion that the Treasury might eventually take on more responsibility, for example, for the regulation of pensions and insurance. Such a move would bring responsibility for regulating all the key financial institutions and markets into one department, the Treasury.' Sources familiar with the Treasury plans said the department expects to provide oversight for the proposed new occupational pensions regulator to be created through legislation in this parliamentary session. Responsibility for occupational pensions currently rests with the Department of Social Services, while the Department of Trade and Industry is responsible for the prudential supervision of life insurance companies. The DSS said yesterday: 'This is a Treasury internal document. The proposal in question would be for discussion and concerns a possible change for the future. The organisation of government is not for a single department to decide.'</p>

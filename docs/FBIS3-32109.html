Sources close to Defense Minister Oscar Camilion and the top  military commands told CLARIN there is "some surprise" over the  official invitation made by the British Government to a minister  who has not been installed yet.    When Eduardo Frei is inaugurated in Chile in March, Perez  Yoma, who is one of the future president's right-hand men, will  replace current Defense Minister Patricio Rojas. The sources  said it is unusual for a minister-designate to be officially  invited by London.    The sources also said that the extension of Perez Yoma's  visit to London, which is a seven-day visit that ends on 2  February, "is somehow improper."    In contrast to such an extensive visit, it should be  recalled  that the future Chilean minister was in Argentina for only a  brief time, a protocol visit.    Perez Yoma also held high-level meetings in London,  including  a meeting with British Secretary of State for Defense Malcolm  Rifkind and top military officials.    The sources added that Perez Yoma was also in Parliament,  visited military units, and gave a lecture in Canning House that  was attended by the main economic groups linked to arms  production.    The Defense Ministry sources took note of Perez Yoma's  comments in public during his tour. Analysts close to Camilion  detected that, in general, Perez Yoma gave "known points of  view" on Chilean foreign policy and put emphasis on some  economic aspects such as the Chilean desire to join NAFTA, the  free trade agreement sponsored by the United States.    Such concern by the Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces  over the Chilean minister-designate's visit reveals that the  consequences of Chilean behavior during the 1982 Malvinas war  and the differences over the border conflicts with Chile still  prevail.    The sources indicated, however, that the latest meetings  with  Chilean Foreign Minister Patricio Rojas within the framework of  the joint declaration signed by Presidents Carlos Menem and  Patricio Aylwin in 1990 contributed to strengthening relations  between the two countries in the military field.    The sources also linked Perez Yoma's long visit to England  with the recent visit to the Malvinas by five Chilean  congressmen.    On their way to the Malvinas, the Chilean congressmen  stopped  in the Lago del Desierto region, which is under international  arbitration as a result of a border conflict between Argentina  and Chile.</p>

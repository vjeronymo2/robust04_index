			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F> Silajdzic in Washington on 2 March -- recorded]    [Text] We have made the biggest step toward peace. I think  that the signing of the agreement last night should mark the  beginning of a process to (?eliminate) the conflict and to  (?regulate) an overall peace in the new, territorially  reorganized part of our homeland. In other words, this is an  indispensable prerequisiste for creating specific conditions:  first, to facilitate the return of all refugees and displaced  persons. This we see as being the most important issue. In  other words, everyone to return to his or her home. This is our  main goal. We know it will be difficult to attain it but we are  working on it.    Second, to begin the process of reconstruction, development,  and consolidation in our country both by relying on our own  resources and with the help from the international community --  this was the topic of discussion with Mr. Preston, the president  of the World Bank, in particular, and with Vice President Gore  and Mr. Christopher on several occasions.    I must say -- and we stressed this point last night during  the signing ceremony -- that this agreement would not have been  possible without the direct involvement on the part of the  United States and of top U.S. officials.    We have been trying for two years to give the U.S. public a  true picture of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to spur the U.S. public and  leadership. The seeds we have been sowing for two years are now  sprouting. It seems to us that Washington, the capital of the  democratic United States, is the right place for both the talks  and the signing of this preliminary agreement and the final  agreement which, we hope, will be signed by Presidents  Izetbegovic and Tudjman on 15 March. That is the date we  arranged. We hope that all work will be completed by then.    However, this diplomatic activity was made possible by the  heroic efforts of our soldiers who liberated parts of the  territory. This was a basis for the diplomatic and political  activity. We have proved that we were not only a political but  also a military factor without which diplomatic activity could  never be sufficiently successful.    A great deal of work still needs to be done. Above all we  must maintain this level of involvement and interest on the part  of the United States, the allies, Russia, and UN member  countries to achieve peace. For this reason we will be going to  Moscow to meet Minister Kozyrev and other officials. Russia is  without a doubt an important international factor and we will  try to examine possibilities of an agreement with the Serb side.    I expect a lot of work on the preparation and the drawing up  of the federation's constitution and the confederal agreement  with Croatia. This work will be accomplished at the U.S.  Embassy in Vienna. A team of experts has already been sent  there. Once the text of the constitution and the confederal  agreement between the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  Republic of Croatia has been coordinated, Presidents Izetbegovic  and Tudjman are expected to sign these agreements in Washington.  Very little time remains and a great deal of work needs to be  done.    To conclude, I still have another meeting today in the State  Department in connection with further activities and talks.</p>

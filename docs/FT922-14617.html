			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Hyundai founder in new feud ANOTHER political feud has broken out between the South Korean government and Mr Chung Ju Yung, the founder of the Hyundai conglomerate, with authorities alleging that a Hyundai subsidiary illegally funded Mr Chung's Unification National party (UNP) in last month's National Assembly elections. The charges, which Hyundai denies, coincided with an announcement by Mr Chung that he would probably run as the UNP's candidate in December's presidential elections. The Office of Bank Supervision (OBS) claims that Hyundai Electronic Industries borrowed 4.8bn won (Pounds 3.6m) from the Korea Exchange Bank to help finance the creation of the UNP in January. Korean law stipulates that such loans should only be used for business purposes. Hyundai contends, however, that the money came from the proceeds of Hyundai shares sold to the group's employees. The UNP said the OBS allegations were part of a campaign by the authorities to harm Mr Chung's reputation and divert attention from charges of government vote-rigging in the recent parliamentary elections.</p>

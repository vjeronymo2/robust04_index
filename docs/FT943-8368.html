			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Fed raises discount rate The US Federal Reserve yest-erday announced a 50 basis- point increase in the discount rate to 4 per cent from 3.5 per cent, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar's initial response was favourable, jumping from DM1.5515 before the announcement to DM1.5660 against the D-Mark. Traders reported a surge of interest in US Treasury bonds, which should help the dollar. New York trading finished with the US currency at DM1.5615. The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, was favourably received by analysts, who described it as a 'healthy, decisive move'. The rate increase was the fifth this year by the Fed. It said in a statement that it expected its actions 'to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained non-inflationary growth'. The Federal Funds rate - the benchmark for US short-term rates - will rise to 4.75 per cent from 4.25 per cent. Ahead of the FOMC's announcement, which came at 17.17 GMT, currency trading across the board was fairly listless, with volumes low and currencies moving in fairly narrow ranges. The D-Mark was slightly easier as some investors took profits, anticipating a rise in US rates. Sterling had an uneventful day, with the trade weighted index unchanged all day at 78.8. Analysts welcomed both the extent of the Fed's move and the rhetoric accompanying it. Mr Tim Stewart, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley, commented: 'This goes a long way to instilling credibility in the Fed both in terms of its actions and by its rhetoric.' He said the dollar had been given a good deal of support at the DM1.55 level. Mr Stewart said the dollar would probably take its cue from the Treasury bond market, where the early outlook was encouraging with signs of foreign investors buying. Mr Stewart added that the Fed would be unlikely to move rates again before its November meeting. He is not predicting a further rise this year. But Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, predicted that the Fed Funds rate would probably rise to 5 per cent this year, still a long way short of the 5.85 per cent being discounted by the December Eurodollar contract. Ahead of the FOMC, activity in the interest rate futures markets was subdued. The December short sterling contract traded only 13,400 lots, but closed four basis points firmer at 93.23, helped by a lower than expected July public sector borrowing figure, and the CBI distributive trades survey showing that consumer spending remains patchy. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury economist at CIBC in London, said the market was still 'far too gloomy' about the outlook for rates. He noted that at the beginning of the year, December short sterling reflected three-month interest rates at 4.4 per cent by the end of 1994. This figure is now close to 6.8 per cent - 'a massive turnaround by any standards'. Mr Parsons noted that, going back to 1989, three-month LIBOR, as implied from the futures market, had never closed more than 82 basis points above the base rate. But even if UK rates jump by  3/4 percentage point to 6 per cent, the December contract is still nearly 80 basis points above this level. 'It is hard to see what will drive three-month rates to 6.8 per cent by December,' said Mr Parsons. Ms Liz Ward, economist at Bank Julius Baer in London, makes a similar point, noting that on the March 1995 futures contract for sterling and D-Mark rates, the expected differential has widened from a low of 52 basis points in March to around 200 basis points now. Ms Ward said that while expectations of higher UK short-term rates should have boosted the pound, the reverse has occurred. 'The widening gap seems to have reflected market perceptions of a weaker pound ahead. The causation is flowing from the currency to interest rates, rather than vice versa.' She cited two other factors which explain the 6 per cent fall in the pound against the D-Mark this year. One is that sterling has traded like a 'transatlantic' currency, following roughly half of the 6.7 per cent move down in the dollar. The other is that 'exchange markets have ignored strong UK fundamentals for even stronger ones in Germany'. There also appears to be a belief that the German recovery is less likely than the UK one to foster inflation. Although purchasing power parity estimates suggest the pound is nearly 10 per cent undervalued against the D-Mark, Ms Ward said it is difficult to make a case for buying pounds 'without a convincing move on base rates first'. Sterling finished at DM2.3951 from DM2.4061 and at Dollars 1.5401 from Dollars 1.5467. The Bank of England did not operate in the morning or afternoon rounds yesterday, providing UK money markets with only Pounds 90m late assistance after earlier forecasting a Pounds 350m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 1/4 and 6 1/2 per cent.</p>

			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Non-EC trade gap narrows to Pounds 613m A STRONG rise in the value of exports to countries outside the European Community helped narrow the UK's non-EC trade gap last month. The visible trade deficit - just under half the total of UK trade - narrowed for the fourth successive month to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 613m in June, compared with Pounds 770m in May. The June deficit was the lowest for three years. A 4.5 per cent month-on-month increase in export values was behind the encouraging news. The sharp rise took exports to their highest ever levels and encouraged hopes that buoyant manufacturing exports are leading the UK out of recession. Against the sharp rise in export values, import values rose by only 1 per cent month-on-month. The underlying deficit, which excludes oil and erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones, dropped to Pounds 538m in June from Pounds 854m in May, the smallest deficit since July last year. The good performance by exports was spread fairly evenly across industry. The Central Statistical Office said that measured by volume, and excluding oil and erratic items, exports and imports were rising by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent per month. In the past three months export volumes excluding oil and erratic items rose by 15 per cent compared with the previous quarter and were 5.5 per cent higher than figures for the corresponding period a year ago. Underlying import volumes rose by 14 per cent on the previous quarter and 3 per cent compared with a year ago. The trends since August last year - just before sterling left the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system in September - show how UK exporters have bene-fited from the pound's devaluation. Export volumes excluding oil have risen by 21.5 per cent since August, while import volumes have risen by 13.5 per cent. The figures also indicate that exporters are using the competitive edge won through devaluation to raise their prices. The CSO said that since August last year, prices of non-oil exports to countries outside the European Community have risen by 7.5 per cent. Import prices measured on the same basis have risen by 10.5 per cent. The UK imported more oil than it exported last month. The deficit in oil trade was Pounds 196m compared with a small surplus of Pounds 13m in the previous month. For the third consecutive month, the UK exported more to the US than it imported, sustaining a small surplus of Pounds 88m compared with a surplus of Pounds 3m in the previous month. Elsewhere, apart from the oil exporting countries, UK trade was in deficit. A positive picture of the economy is presented in two surveys of business confidence and business activity published yesterday. The enterprise barometer, calculated by 3i, Britain's largest venture capital group, measures business confidence among the owners of the private businesses backed by 3i. It was at its highest level for nearly five years in June. A survey by the Association of British Factors and Discounters found a 25 per cent increase in the turnover of its members' clients to Pounds 4.7bn in the second quarter of the year. This was the largest year-on-year increase for more than six years, said the associ-ation. 3i Enterprise Barometer. 3i, 91 Waterloo Road, London SE1 8XP.

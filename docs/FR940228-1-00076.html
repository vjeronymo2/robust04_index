			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary intends to use provisional certification as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanism for monitoring an institution that has not previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participated or one that has changed ownership, until it has time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish a track record. In keeping with current practice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary does not intend to certify any initial applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until it has successfully completed a period of provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification. Because many of the requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification cannot be met until an institution has participated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Title IV, HEA programs for a period of time, an initially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating institution would still have the opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate while establishing a record that demonstrates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with all of the proposed current standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation. The Secretary notes that certain factors of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial responsibility and administrative capability, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements governing the appropriate handling of Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program funds and timely submission of required audits and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports, cannot be judged until an institution has Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program funds to administer. In these cases, instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifying that an institution meets all the standards of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart B, the Secretary certifies that an institution has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated that it meets all the standards it can currently and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it will be able to meet all the standards in subpart B to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify it for full certification within a period of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified by the Secretary. Such an institution will receive a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified program participation agreement. For the same reasons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary also intends to use provisional certification for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all institutions that undergo a change of ownership. Provisional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification would permit them to participate in Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs while demonstrating over time that they can meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for participation under the new ownership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the HEA provides that the Secretary may use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisional certification for institutions that are currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating who will have their financial responsibility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability determined for the first time. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions have been participating in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs since before the establishment of the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility and administrative capability standards, and have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> never undergone a certification review. These institutions may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be allowed the time necessary to establish that they can remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any deficiencies found and meet the standards for participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, under the provisions of the Technical Amendments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, the Secretary may provisionally certify a participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that is undergoing a certification review if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that the institution is in a financial or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative position that could jeopardize the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to perform its financial responsibilities under its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participation agreement. The Secretary may provisionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify an institution under this provision if the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation has been limited or suspended under subpart G of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this part, or voluntarily enters into provisional certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the Secretary proposes to use provisional certification as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a probationary period for some participating institutions, if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary determines that the institutions are capable of meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standards for full certification by the end of that period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, the Secretary might find that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying for recertification on its own fails to meet one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards in proposed &sect;668.15. If the Secretary determines that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the failure could jeopardize the institution's ability to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its financial responsibilities, such as the payment of refunds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary would provisionally certify the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "YSKL 94 Electoral News Coverage" program] </F>   [Text] Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, chief of the UN Observers  for El Salvador [Onusal], has affirmed Sunday's general  elections are being held normally. He only noted some minor  logistics problems. What I have said confirms these elections  have been rightfully termed the elections of the century and  will play a key role in consolidating peace, Ramirez Ocampo has  said during an interview.    Upon noting the civility and democratic culture the  Salvadoran people have demonstrated in these general elections,  Ramirez Ocampo has said the peace agreements are yielding their  fruits, adding the elections are being held with a large voter  turnout and amid peace.    In addition, President Alfredo Cristiani has said everything  is reported normal in several schools where polling sites are  located in the capital, while international observers are  confirming the Salvadoran people's demonstration of patriotism.    President Alfredo Cristiani has said the elections, the  first  elections held after the signing of peace with guerrillas in  1992, have become a true civic party.    The left has reported the presence of soldiers in polling  stations in the interior and problems regarding the opening of  electoral sites, but, as the right has done, it has highlighted  the positive balance of the elections.</p>

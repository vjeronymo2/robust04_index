			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Arms groups' Dollars 1.9bn merger helps lift Dow Wall Street Rallying European stocks, firmer bond prices and news of a billion-dollar defence industry merger lifted US share prices across the board yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 23.92 ahead at 3,856.22, slightly below the high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 2.17 at 466.91, while the American SE composite was 2.59 higher at 469.06 and the Nasdaq composite up 4.50 at 795.05. New York SE volume was 285.6m shares. After recent wild fluctuations, equity prices opened the new week in impressive fashion, moving into positive territory right from the opening. Traders said several factors were behind the advance: a recovery in European stocks, hit last week by turmoil in local bond markets; gains in US bond prices; and news of a big merger between defence companies. The latter was particularly welcome, given that the market had been rattled by the collapse two weeks ago of the billion-dollar union between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications. Yesterday's news involved Grumman, the Long Island defence contractor, which has agreed to be taken over by Martin Marietta, another defence group, in a deal valued at Dollars 1.9bn. The announcement of the agreement sent Grumman's shares soaring in heavy dealings. By the close they were trading at Dollars 54 1/8 , up Dollars 14 1/4 , or 36 per cent. Martin Marietta has offered to pay Dollars 55 each for every Grumman share. Wall Street clearly liked the deal, because Martin Marietta's shares also rose on the news, climbing Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 46. Salomon advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 as investors reacted warmly to Friday's late announcement that Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and former interim chairman of the securities house, had increased his stake in the company from 14.7 per cent to 19 per cent. The move was seen as a vote of confidence in Salomon's long term ability to generate profits. USAir dropped Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 9, a 52-week low, in busy trading after warning that it would make a pre-tax loss of Dollars 200m in the first quarter of the year, against a deficit of Dollars 61m a year earlier. The airline blamed bad weather and price competition for its poor earnings. Philip Morris, which has been hit recently by concern that the government might impose strict regulations on cigarettes, rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 56 3/4 amid speculation that the planned increase in excise taxes may be smaller than originally feared. Brazil Heavy trading took Brazil 7.1 per cent higher by the close on expectations that the government would not raise taxes on foreign investment and amid optimism on constitutional reform. The Bovespa index was finally 799 points ahead at 11,939. Turnover came to Cr216.1bn (Dollars 314.1m). Trading picked up amid reports of proposals to end all state monopolies. Canada Toronto closed solidly higher after fairly active trading, with most sectors posting gains as fears of an imminent rise in US interest rates appeared to ease. The TSE 300 index rose 38.1 to 4,436.6 and advances led declines by 472 to 313 after volume of 69.6m shares.</p>

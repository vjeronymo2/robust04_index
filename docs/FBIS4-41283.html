			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 24 TASS--The discussion, started on  Thursday, of the presidential decree "On Urgent Measures To  Protect the Population From Banditry and Other Manifestations of  Organised Crime", did not end with the adoption of any decision  on Friday. None of four draft resolutions polled the necessary  number of votes. Neither did the deputies support a proposal to  form an editorial commission to work out a new document.    The Federation Council, according to the Constitution, may  not turn down or endorse a presidential decree, Issa Kostoyev,  chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Constitutional  Legislation and Judicial Matters, told ITAR-TASS. But since  Boris Yeltsin referred the document to the Federation Council,  expressing hope that the upper house of parliament "will ensure  the exercise of necessary measures to enact the decree in the  regions and constitutent republics of the Federation", the  deputies began to examine it, Kostoyev said.    The legislation committee, upon studying the decree, came  forward with a draft resolution emphasising that "any measures  to combat crime should be based on strict observance of Russia's  Constitution and federal laws."    The draft resolution shares the president's concern and  supports on the whole the resolute measures being taken by him  to step up anti-crime fight.    At the same time the deputies "have to state that the decree  contains a number of provisions that run counter to the  Constitution and legislation," Kostoyev said. He believes that  the contraditions are quite resolvable. "Therefore, in the draft  resolution we suggested that the acting prosecutor-general  "ensure strict observance of the rights and freedoms of  citizens, the norms of the constitution and criminal procecude  legislation".    In view of the fact that the deputies did not accept either  this draft resolution or three other ones, Kostoyev recalled  that, according to the Constitution, the presidential decree  signed on June 14 is already in effect throughout the territory  of the Russian Federation.</p>

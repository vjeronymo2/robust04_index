			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Thames TV lower at Pounds 8.2m but beats market expectations THAMES TV, whose London weekday broadcasting franchise expires at the end of this year, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.2m for the year ended December 31 1991, slightly down from 1990's Pounds 8.9m but rather better than analysts' forecasts of about Pounds 5m. However, extraordinary provisions of Pounds 25.5m - made against the group's need to rapidly scale down its operations this year - meant that it recorded an overall loss of Pounds 23.5m for the year. Operating profit declined to Pounds 35.8m (Pounds 40.1m). The board recommended a final dividend of 5p, making a total of 7.5p (16p) for the year. Earnings per share fell to 4.1p (10.9p). Thames reduced its net debt over the year by Pounds 11.5m, leaving it at Pounds 38.2m at the year-end. Included in the extraordinary items were costs of more than Pounds 2.75m incurred in preparing the failed application to renew its broadcasting licence. Besides forthcoming redundancy costs, an Pounds 18.8m provision was made for property which will soon be surplus to requirements. Against that Thames has benefited by some Pounds 11.5m levy relief and Pounds 9.7m corporation tax relief. Thames has progressively shrunk its workforce from more than 1,800 in 1990. By mid-1993, when restructuring will be completed, it will have less than 250 employees worldwide. Mr Derek Hunt, finance director, said yesterday that Pounds 22m of the provisions will cover redundancies. Revenue over the year grew slightly to Pounds 388m (Pounds 378m). Its share of the independent television network's advertising revenue increased to 15.32 per cent (15.21 per cent), while overall network revenue fell by 1.6 per cent. However, after discounts, advertising revenue shrank slightly to Pounds 243m (Pounds 246m). While revenue from programme sales fell across the world - particularly so in the US - programme sales in the UK showed a marked improvement to Pounds 97.8m (Pounds 79.1m). The Independent Television Commission is to shed 53 of its 242 staff by the end of 1992. The job losses will be achieved by a mix of early retirement, non-renewal of contracts and redundancies.</p>

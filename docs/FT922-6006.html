			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Top Japanese insurers report fall in profits JAPANESE non-life insurance companies were hit by sharp increases in underwriting losses stemming from last September's typhoon damages and declining investment income. Non-consolidated net premium income for the year ended March at the top five Japanese non-life insurers - Tokio Marine &amp; Fire, Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine, Mitsui Marine &amp; Fire, Sumitomo Marine &amp; Fire, and Nippon Fire &amp; Marine - rose 6.8 per cent as a result of brisk sales of car and compulsory auto liability insurances. But all five companies reported falls in pre-tax and after-tax profits. Only Tokio posted an operating profit. Net insurance payments for the five companies jumped 27.7 per cent to Y1,857.3bn (Dollars 14.35bn), due to a rise in car accidents and the surge in claims from typhoon damages. Non-operating profits were squeezed due to lower interest rates and the stock market slump. The companies also faced a sharp rise in redemptions for the savings type insurances.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Smith New Court Smith New Court has every right to be pleased with itself. A return on capital of 28 per cent last year - due to an astonishing annualised rate of return of 50 per cent in the second half - is twice that achieved by SG Warburg across its investment banking interests. But Smith can no more afford to rest on its laurels than others in the industry. ICI, for example, is targeting an annual return on new investment of 20 per cent. Since the securities business is more volatile than most industrial enterprises, the return achieved by Smith last year is little more than the average investors might expect through the economic cycle. On that basis, Smith will have to work hard to justify yesterday's Pounds 41m rights issue. Strides which have been made to improving the quality of earnings will help. More than half of last year's profits were earned outside the UK. The steady increase in commission income has reduced its dependence on market making, which feeds off the unpredictable level of turnover in the UK stock market. Its reluctance to move into new areas such as bonds or merchant banking is equally comforting. If that makes Smith a less risky investment, investors will accept a lower return. The 14 per cent rise in the shares yesterday suggests the market has concluded that the outlook is both brighter and less changeable than it previously forecast. In risk businesses such as market making and underwriting, though, Smith will always be vulnerable to nasty shocks.</p>

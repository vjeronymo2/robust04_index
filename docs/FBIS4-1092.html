			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Renamo President Afonso Dhlakama by </F> unidentified announcer in Lisbon--live]    [Text] [Announcer] The Renamo [Mozambique National  Resistance] president is here with me. Good evening, Afonso  Dhlakama. Will you give us an assurance, here at Telejornal,  that what happened in Angola will not be reenacted in Mozambique?    [Dhlakama] No, it will not be reenacted, because we believe  that the important thing in Mozambique is to attain peace, not  to attain power.    [Announcer] Even if the elections are unfavorable to Renamo  and it finds itself prevented from attaining power?    [Dhlakama] Certainly. My fight has been for democracy in my  country, not for power. And I am well acquainted with the  implications of democracy.    [Announcer] Be that as it may, you have said on several  occasions that Renamo has a proposal for the setting up of a  national unity government, and that you would like to be Joaquim  Chissano's vice president in the event of Frelimo winning the  elections, which means that Renamo has designs on power.    [Dhlakama] Well. I have a clear idea to put to the  Mozambican people, recognizing that in Africa the course of  democracy has been a hard one. I would like there to be neither  victors nor vanquished. Hence, this idea of mine. As I have  said before, should it win the elections, Renamo does not wish  to govern alone, it wishes to govern jointly with the other  parties. And the other parties, should they win, ought to do  likewise.    [Announcer] In other words, you have just confirmed what I  said earlier on, that one of your goals is to hold office in the  future Mozambican Government, regardless of the election results.    [Dhlakama] Well, that is in order to avoid problems; in  order  to avoid problems.    [Announcer] The kind of problems that arose in Angola?    [Dhlakama] Not just in Angola, all over Africa, because in  Africa so far we have been learning about democracy itself. I  am of the view that democracy must be allowed to develop its own  history in Africa. In Mozambique, for example, we have the  history of our independence. That history of our independence  went wrong, hence the civil war. So, in order to  avoid...[pauses] So that democracy may develop its own history  in Mozambique, it is necessary that, regardless of who wins the  October elections, the victors should invite those also  represented in parliament to govern together.    [Announcer] Yes. What is President Joaquim Chissano's  reaction to the ideas you advocate, to that kind of proposal?    [Dhlakama] Well, so far we have not yet entered into  negotiations officially. However, I have already been able to  chat to him about it and I have not yet had a positive response.  In the newspapers I have read that several government ministers  seem not to agree to the idea. Nevertheless, I am optimistic,  because now I am already living in Maputo, and all the  intellectuals -- professors, economists and engineers -- support  my position.    [Announcer] Afonso Dhlakama. You have come to Portugal, you  arrived in Lisbon today, to ask the Portuguese Government and  businessmen for greater support. Portugal had already made  available some $300,000 for a support fund for Renamo, to be  managed by the United Nations. Is this not enough? What else  have you come to ask the Portuguese Government?    [Dhlakama] Well, the purpose of my visit is not to ask  Portugal for cash. I have also come to confirm to the  Portuguese people that the war is over in Mozambique, and also  to reassure the Portuguese -- because up to now the people have  been growing disillusioned with the situation in Angola -- to  reassure the Portuguese that what has happened in Angola will  not happen in Mozambique. Secondly, indeed, I have come to ask  for general support for the Mozambican peace process.    [Announcer] But what kind of support? More troops, more  money? What kind of support? Logistical support?    [Dhlakama] As you know, even Britain is already withdrawing  from Mozambique, and I believe that there could indeed be an  increase in the military presence of the Portuguese in  Mozambique, even though they are already there training the  Mozambican Army. Moreover, direct support for Renamo could be  increased, because Renamo needs infrastructure. The Mozambican  Government has planes, motorcars, money, and Renamo does not  even have premises.    [Announcer] Afonso Dhlakama, thank you very much for coming  to Telejornal.    [Dhlakama] Thank you.</p>

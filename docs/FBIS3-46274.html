The annual interest rate for the six-month-maturity  nonphysical treasury bill will be 9.8 percent, and its interest  will be calculated starting from 25 January 1994. The principal  and interest will be paid on a lump-sum basis on 25 July 1994.  The annual interest rate for the one-year-maturity nonphysical  treasury bill will be 11.98 percent, and its interest will be  calculated starting from 7 February 1994. The principal and  interest will be paid on a lump-sum basis on 7 February 1995.  After the issuance of the six-month-maturity and  one-year-maturity nonphysical treasury bills ends, these  nonphysical treasury bills may be transferred through the  Shanghai Securities Exchange Market.    The issuance of nonphysical treasury bills means that the  state will not adopt the method of printing treasury bills, and  that the selling and buying will be done through record keeping  carried out over computers. In other words, paper will not be  used in the issuance of nonphysical treasury bills.    The nonphysical treasury bills will be sold on consignment  by  nonpolicy banks, securities companies, trust and investment  companies, and other nonbanking financial organizations. The  registration and clearing of transactions will be done through  the computer network of the Shanghai Securities Exchange Market.    Various securities and financial organizations which have  established business links with the Shanghai Securities Exchange  Market may, starting today, file applications for the  consignment of the six-month-maturity and one-year-maturity  nonphysical treasury bills to the State Debts Administration of  the Ministry of Finance and the Central Treasury Department of  the People's Bank of China. Financial organizations which are  not in a position to handle nationwide consignment but which  possess the conditions to utilize the Shanghai Securities  Exchange Market's network for transactions may act as sales  agents and take part in the marketing of nonphysical treasury  bills or buy nonphysical treasury bills from securities  companies on behalf of investors.    The nonphysical treasury bills will be mainly consigned to  and purchased by banks and other financial organizations.  Enterprises and business undertakings and individual investors  who purchase more than 10,000 yuan of nonphysical treasury bills  may open transaction accounts with distributors (mainly  securities organizations which have transaction space at the  Shanghai Securities Exchange Market). Various investors who  already have stock exchange accounts with the Shanghai  Securities Exchange Market through securities organizations may  use their original accounts to purchase nonphysical treasury  bills.    It was also learned from the Shanghai Securities Exchange  Market that to promote the issuance of nonphysical treasury  bills, further simplify procedures, increase efficiency, expand  sales, and provide convenience for investors, the Shanghai  Securities Exchange Market has formulated plans for nominal  quotations and the distribution of nonphysical treasury bills by  agents. The distributors, after purchasing nonphysical treasury  bills from the Ministry of Finance, may post nominal quotations  within a prescribed period and act as sales agents.  Stockbrokers who have space in the securities exchange market  may use their own funds or act as agents for their customers to  submit purchasing slips and buy nonphysical treasury bills  through a selected underwriter [cheng xiao shang 2110 6906  0794]. The declared value [shen bao jia ge 3947 1032 0116 2706]  should be the unified issue price of the treasury bills.    The nonimal quotations for the six-month-maturity  nonphysical  treasury bills will be posted for seven days at the Shanghai  Securities Exchange Market starting on 24 January. Various  brokers may start to do business with investors from the date  that the nominal quotations are posted until the formal  announcement of listings for transactions by the Ministry of  Finance.    A responsible person at the Ministry of Finance pointed out  that the reform of the method of issuing treasury bills seeks to  meet the needs of the market economy and to promote the  marketability of treasury bills. He expressed his hope that  various securities organizations would strengthen the training  of staff members, do a good job of publicizing the method, help  various units and individual investors understand the investment  procedures for nonphysical treasury bills, and facilitate their  purchase.    According to this responsible person, to satisfy the demand  of individual small investors who want to buy treasury bills,  the state will issue some physical treasury bills (namely in a  printed form) within this year. The sales and purchasing  methods are same as in previous years. The interest rate for  physical treasury bills will be to a certain extent higher than  that for bank savings accounts during the same period.</p>

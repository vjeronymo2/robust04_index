			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Ambroveneto lifts uncertainty over its future BANCO AMBROSIANO Veneto (Ambroveneto), Italy's biggest private-sector bank, has lifted some of the uncertainty over its future following agreement between controlling shareholders on reshuffling their stakes, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Gemina, one of the five companies which together form the shareholders' pact dominating the bank, has accepted the L6,000-a-share offer from its other partners for its 13.06 per cent stake. Gemina, which is indirectly controlled by the Fiat group, indicated in September it wanted to sell out. The L387bn disposal will produce a capital gain of L225bn. Gemina, which controls the RCS publishing group and the Fila sportswear company, among other investments, has not indicated how it will invest the proceeds, which will be paid in mid-January. Details of how Gemina's stake will be distributed among the other members of the Ambroveneto pact, which include Credit Agricole of France and Crediop, the Rome-based long-term lending bank controlled by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, have not been revealed. Both Credit Agricole and Crediop have said they are ready to increase their holdings.</p>

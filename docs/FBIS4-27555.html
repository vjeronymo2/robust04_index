			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren) asked the government Wednesday [1  June] to hear industry views on its plans to control exports of  goods convertible for weapons production, Keidanren officials  said.    The powerful business organization made the request as the  government began to study measures to regulate exports of such  products in line with its policy of preventing proliferation of  nuclear and conventional weapons.    The government plans to enforce regulations on the basis of  a  recommendation to be made by the Industrial Structure Council,  an advisory body to the minister of international trade and  industry.    Keidanren said the proposed regulation will have a serious  impact on domestic manufacturers, particularly on those who are  not familiar with export controls.    The federation called on the government to hear views from  industries concerned in working out new regulations and give  them enough time for familiarization, the officials said.</p>

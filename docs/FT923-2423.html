			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Japan's economic downturn gathers pace JAPAN'S Electronics Industry Association said yesterday it was preparing to apply to the government for subsidies to help the industry through the 'employment adjustment' needed to cope with the recession, which has hit hard at consumer electronics manufacturers. The Labour Ministry's central employment security council, an advisory panel, yesterday disclosed that five other industries had approached the government over employment subsidies and that a further eight were considering doing so. Last week, steel producers said they were likely to apply for subsidies to help cover the cost of transferring and retraining idle workers. A company becomes eligible for the subsidy if its sales, production and employment fall by more than 5 per cent in three months. Employment subsidies cost the government Y40bn (Pounds 164.6m) in 1987, which was the last time they were extensively used as the Japanese economy was hit by a sharp appreciation of the yen. While unemployment remains low, 'employment adjustment' refers to the transfer of surplus workers to subsidiaries or other companies. The electronics industry's troubles present one of the clearest signals yet of how the recession is starting to eat in to Japan's industrial heartlands. The association's call for employment subsidies followed a warning that electronics output, one of the mainstays of Japanese manufacturing, could suffer its sharpest fall since 1975. The association said it had scrapped its original forecast of growth of about 5.6 per cent to a fall in the value of production of between 5 per cent and 8 per cent. The fall has been led by a sharp drop in the production of consumer electronics, video cassette recorders, camcorders and audio products, which are expected to be about 17 per cent below last year's output. Electronics output in the first half of the year was 10.4 per cent down on the same period in 1991. Further grim economic statistics yesterday confirmed the parlous health of the Japanese economy. Corporate bankruptcies were up 28.9 per cent in August from a year earlier, according to report by Teikoku Data Bank, the credit research company, published yesterday. Small manufacturing companies are being particularly badly hit, according to the report, which shows the main impact of the slowdown in the Japanese economy is shifting from real estate and finance into industry. Although the number of bankruptcies rose sharply, the debts owed by companies which went bankrupt fell by 60 per cent from last year, reflecting the fall in large bankruptcies and the growing number of small companies that are falling prey to the recession. Bankruptcies in manufacturing were up by 68 per cent on last year, while real estate bankruptcies rose by 16 per cent. A growing number of bankruptcies are due to the downturn in the Japanese economy rather than the fall in the stock market which had been the main force behind the rise in corporate failures over the past two years. Further evidence of the weak state of the manufacturing sector was disclosed by official figures for orders of new machinery. Private sector demand for new machinery rose 12.9 per cent in July compared with the month before, according to official figures from the Economic Planning Agency. However, most of the rise was accounted for by non-manufacturing companies. Investment in new equipment by manufacturers continues to fall sharply in many sectors, with machinery orders 26.8 per cent down in the car industry, 13.8 per cent lower in textiles and 5 per cent down in the steel industry .</p>

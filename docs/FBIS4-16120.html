			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevinc Abdullayeva and Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku, 13 Apr -- Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Hasan  Hasanov branded as fiction media reports to the effect that  Azerbaijan will be declaring at the Moscow meeting that it is  leaving the CIS. Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS  correspondent about the likelihood of such a step, the minister  said at a news conference today that "Azerbaijan attaches great  importance to the development of all-round contacts with the CIS  states, regarding it as a priority in the republic's  foreign-policy activities."    Hasan Hasanov told journalists that, at the Moscow summit,  "Azerbaijani President Gaydar Aliyev may make a special  statement." According to the minister, in the statement  "relevant assessments of the current situation in the  Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict area will be given." A sharp  deterioration in it ensued, according to Hasanov, four days ago,  "following the latest offensive undertaken by the Armenian armed  formations outside Nagorno-Karabakh in the western and  southwestern regions of Azerbaijan."    The head of the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry commended  Russia's new efforts to resolve the Karabakh problem. Without  going into details, the minister merely declared that  "Azerbaijan has, in principle, approved the draft agreement on a  cessation of hostilities submitted by the Russian side, but has  borne in mind its comments and proposals." It was also stressed  yet again that the leadership of Azerbaijan holds firm to the  view that the conflict can only be resolved by political means.</p>

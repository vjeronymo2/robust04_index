			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A former probation officer who worked at Juvenile Hall and is charged with  molesting 13 girls there had his bail substantially increased Wednesday and was  jailed.  </P> <P> Robert Denny, 48, of San Diego, had been free on his own recognizance on  condition that he not contact any of the alleged victims -- terms set by  another judge.  </P> <P> But, when Denny appeared before San Diego Municipal Judge John Thompson for  arraignment Wednesday, the judge set bail at $100,000, an increase 10 times  that requested by the prosecutor.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryn Rosen had recommended a $10,000 bail, and Denny's  temporary attorney, Elliot Kanter, urged the judge to leave it as set  previously by Municipal Judge Lillian Quon.  </P> <P> Thompson said he was surprised that no bail had been set earlier. He said he  was concerned about the seriousness of the charges and for the community's  safety.  </P> <P> Kanter said there was no way Denny could post $100,000.  </P> <P> He said Denny needed to be free to seek an attorney to represent him, but the  judge said he could not be concerned with that. Quon had given Denny two weeks  to find a permanent attorney before Wednesday's arraignment.  </P> <P> Most of the charges are misdemeanor offenses involving unlawful touching of  girls, but some are felonies. The girls involved are from 15 to 17 years old.  </P> <P> A bail review was set for June 12 and a preliminary hearing for June 21.  </P></p>

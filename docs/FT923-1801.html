			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Survey of Northern Ireland (5): New links forged - North/South Trade SUNBATHERS on Howth Strand in Dublin can look north on a sunny day and clearly see the mountains of South Down 50 miles away. There begins Northern Ireland. If traffic conditions are favourable, it is a mere one-hour drive to the border. If they are not, which is more likely, it can take over three hours to cover the 100 miles to Belfast - the same as the ferry trip to Holyhead across the Irish Sea, and the British market lying beyond. The train journey takes two-and-a-half hours, while an airline service simply does not exist. The underdeveloped transport links between Northern Ireland and the Republic are always a surprise to the newcomer arriving from another European city. No two cities of comparable size and separation elsewhere in northern Europe now lack the high speed road, rail and air links that are vital to successful trade and commerce in the competitive environment of the 1990s. It should be of no surprise therefore, as the EC moves towards the completion of the Single Market, that this geographic anachronism - a result of the 70 years of political distrust and antagonism between the two parts of the island - is finally coming under scrutiny, as is the entire subject of north-south trade. The Confederation of Irish Industry (CII) calculates that manufacturers in the south sell only one-third as much per capita in Northern Ireland as they do in their home territory in spite of the proximity of the market. Manufacturers in the north, meanwhile, sell only one-sixth as much per capita in the south as they do in Northern Ireland. Only 5 per cent of the south's total exports go to the north, while the north supplies only 4 per cent of the south's imports. The possibilities for enhanced trade would seem to be considerable. According to the CII, a total of 75,000 additional jobs on both sides of the border could be achieved by exploiting more fully the market potential within the island of Ireland. It is a theme to which politicians north and south are increasingly warming. In May, amid much fanfare, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, launched a 200-page government study on cross-border economic co-operation. The central message of the study is this: 'In an increasingly integrated Europe, the costs of the current one-island/two-economy basis of operation will have an inhibiting effect on economic progress.' In a keynote speech in July, Mr Robert Atkins, Northern Ireland's minister for the economy and environment, echoed Mr Reynolds' views. He pointed to growing links between business federations on both sides of the border and the challenge of the European Single Market. Such developments, he said, 'add up to a fundamental change in circumstances and open up the real prospect of a quantum change in the economic relationships between Northern Ireland and the Republic'. Both governments have made commitments to upgrade the road and rail links between Belfast and Dublin. Infrastructure will not be sufficient in itself, however. The fact that around 20 per cent of the Republic's foreign trade is already transported across the border for onward consignment by road to Britain and Europe, suggests that infrastructure is not necessarily a limiting factor to improved north-south trade. Some are also highly sceptical of the CII's estimate of 75,000 additional jobs coming from improved trade. Dr Graham Gudgin, the director of the Northern Ireland Economic and Social Research Centre (NIESRC), says that a recent survey based on 870 Northern Ireland manufacturing companies, accounting for 80 per cent of manufacturing employment in Northern Ireland, found that two-thirds of these firms are already involved in some trade with the Republic, and that Northern Ireland firms already export three times more on a per capita basis to the Republic than they do to mainland UK. 'I am sceptical of large short-term gains but I support the efforts to improve trade,' said Dr Gudgin. 'We certainly should increase trade to increase long-term competitiveness but we should not create over-optimistic expectations. Greater trade and access to each other's market means job losses as well as gains.' Of immediate benefit, however, will be the plan by the two governments to establish a joint tender information system, whereby firms on either side of the border will be invited to tender for contracts of both governments. The creation of a new database detailing all the manufacturing firms in the island of Ireland, their products and capabilities, will be made available to the public, possibly next year. Joint trade fairs and roadshows are also planned. Such initiatives will never, independently of the EC process of integration, result in Northern Ireland's economy becoming as integrated with the Republic as it is with the rest of the UK. Wage bargaining systems are different, and the fiscal structures and public expenditure programmes remain independent of each other. But that is not the primary goal. In the words of Mr Atkins, 'the benefits of increased cross-border trade will go beyond the purely economic. The more contact people in both parts of Ireland have with each other, and the more they see their interests bound up together, the more likely it is that understanding and tolerance will grow'.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                   CROSS-BORDER TRADE COMPARISONS  ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1989                                             Pounds m  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Imports to the Republic of Ireland from Great Britain                                  4,538 from Northern Ireland                                 489  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Exports by the Republic of Ireland To Great Britain                                    4,120 To Northern Ireland                                   776  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Central Statistics Office, Dublin  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

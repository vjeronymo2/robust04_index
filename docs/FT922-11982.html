			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Demutualisation plan attacked by USX pension fund The US Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund, a sizeable US institutional investor representing the interests of pensioners at the USX steel and energy group, yesterday hit out at the share allocation suggested by Equitable, America's fourth largest insurer, in its 'demutualisation' plan. Mr James Carney, administrator of the pension fund, told a public hearing on Equitable's scheme that the proposed allocation of shares among its policyholders was unfairly biased toward the ownership of policies, rather than the contribution made by policyholders to the insurer's profits. The US Steel Pension Fund is a leading policyholder with Equitable. Equitable is by far the largest US insurer to 'demutualise' - a practice that many believe will become more common as US insurers seek to bolster their capital resources. It is also converting under the supervision of the New York State insurance department, viewed as one of most professional state regulatory organisations. Accordingly, the Equitable scheme - which is designed to turn the company from one controlled by its policyholders into one owned by shareholders - is being seen as a model for future US demutualisations. 'It will set a precedent for the conversion of other mutuals,' Mr Carney told the hearing. However, he warned, 'if policyholders resort to litigation', the precedent would not be good one. His complaint centred on the suggestion that each policyholder be allocated three shares apiece regardless of the type or size of the policy. They then would receive further shares based on more sophisticated actuarial calculations of their contributions to the mutual's surplus. Mr Carney claimed, however, that one share would be sufficient to reflect the policy ownership. He calculated - using one of Equitable's theoretical scenarios - that 23 per cent of all shares going to policyholders could be allocated under the fixed share basis if the three-shares-per-policy system were used. Since some policy categories have been heavily loss-making in the past, he claimed that this would be unfair. Equitable responded by saying that the fixed element was in line with previous demutualisations. Mr Carney stressed the fund was supportive of the demutualisation in principle. At the meeting, there were no representations from Axa, the large French insurance group which invested Dollars 1bn in Equitable last year. Assuming the demutualisation scheme goes ahead, Axa will convert this into an equity stake of up to 49 per cent of Equitable, with the ability to take this over the 50 per cent mark in 1994.</p>

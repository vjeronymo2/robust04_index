			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / French finance ministry officials welcome interest rate cut Relieved French finance ministry officials yesterday welcomed the interest rate cut as 'a new gesture in the right direction,' though the move was not enough to prevent fresh selling of the French currency, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The Banque de France left its intervention rate unchanged at 9.1 per cent. It is believed not to have intervened to try to restrain the franc from falling at one point to FFr3.4080 against the D-Mark, its lowest for 10 weeks, though still well above the ERM floor of FFr3.4305 per D-Mark. By afternoon, the French currency had recovered to FFr3.4065. Economists said it was unlikely the French central bank would follow suit with a rate cut, given the market's lingering uncertainties over the monetary policy of the conservative government, expected to win the general election this month. Dealers attributed the franc's initial weakness to the fact that the foreign exchange markets had already discounted an easing in German rates and were disappointed that it was only a half percentage point cut. Nevertheless, the Bundesbank move gives French monetary authorities a little extra breathing space in the final days before an election which some senior politicians, such as former prime minister Mr Raymond Barre, expect to be accompanied by a heavy speculative attack on the franc.</p>

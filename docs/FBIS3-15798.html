Nixon"]    [Text] Gennadiy Zyuganov, chairman of the Communist Party  of the Russian Federation [CPRF] Central Executive Committee and  leader of the communist faction in the Federal Assembly State  Duma, received former U.S. President Richard Nixon 8 March. An  engaged discussion took place between them about Russia's  internal political and economic situation and the prospects for  Russia's development and for the development of Russian-U.S.  relations. Having congratulated G. Zyuganov on the CPRF's  success in the Russian Federation Federal Assembly elections, R.  Nixon asked the leader of Russia's most popular party about his  views on ways of extricating the country from the crisis, his  assessment of the ruling regime's domestic and foreign policies,  the CPRF's international ties, and its attitude to religion.    The CPRF chairman unequivocally stated that the policy of  so-called shock therapy is destructive for Russia and fraught  with the possibility of social outbursts with unpredictable  consequences for the whole world. At the same time, he noted  that the Russian Communist Party will accept neither right-wing  nor left-wing radicalism and is ready to cooperate with all  political forces which stand for the revival of a strong Russia  as a guarantor of peace and security throughout the world. "The  reconstitution of a renewed Union, in which none of its peoples  would have their sovereignty infringed, is only a matter of  time," G. Zyuganov emphasized. The first stage in achieving  this goal, he said, is to renew all ties between Russia and  Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. The whole world will benefit  from stability and calm being restored to this area, occupying  one-sixth of the globe and packed with nuclear warheads.    G. Zyuganov told R. Nixon about the permanent contacts  between the CPRF and former union republics' communist parties  and its international ties with more than 100 communist,  socialist, social democratic, and other left-wing parties of the  Old and New World.    G. Zyuganov also noted that the CPRF and the whole of the  Russian patriotic movement are uneasy about the one-dimensional  nature of the U.S. approach to the political forces in Russia  and the growth of anti-American sentiment in Russian society in  connection with Washington's reckless support for the current  executive, which is unpopular among the people; but they greet  with enthusiasm the recently observed trend whereby the U.S.  leadership is trying to gain a deeper understanding of the real  situation in Russia. We have an interest, he said, in mutually  advantageous cooperation on an equal basis between Russia and  the United States, but on the condition that there is respect  for the culture and spiritual values of the Russian people and  the other peoples of Russia.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Clinton calls for open trade to lift world growth PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday asserted US leadership in the task of speeding up world economic growth and taking down trade barriers, but called on Japan and Germany to do their share as 'engines of global prosperity'. He also sought to dispel fears that the US was becoming more inward-looking and protectionist under his administration, insisting America 'must compete, not retreat'. As finance ministers and central bank governors flew to London for today's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, Mr Clinton complained that international economic co-operation was not working well. 'We simply cannot afford to work at cross-purposes with the other major industrial democracies,' he said. 'Our major partners must work harder and more closely with us to reduce interest rates, stimulate investment, reduce structural barriers to trade and restore robust global growth.' Speaking to cheering university students in Washington, Mr Clinton said the world stood at a rare 'great moment of decision' about the need for co-operation. Germany and Japan especially should do more for the global economy and open their markets to foreign goods, he said. Cautioning against trade protectionism in the US, he said: 'The truth of our age is this, and must be this: open and competitive commerce will enrich us as a nation. . . It spurs us to innovate. 'And so I say to you in the face of all the pressures to do the reverse, we must compete, not retreat.' He acknowledged that many of the US's competitiveness problems had primary roots in US policies. 'There is much about our competitive posture that cannot be straightened out by trade retaliation,' he said. 'Too many of the chains that have hobbled us in competitive trade have been made in America.' But Mr Clinton said the US would also enforce its trade laws, insist on reciprocal opportunities overseas for US investors, and take measures to help US communities hurt by the adaptation to a global economy. 'In short, putting the American people first, without withdrawing from the world and people beyond our borders,' he said. The speech was applauded by Ms Carla Hills, Mr Bush's trade negotiator, but may not dispel the questions of the US's trading partners in the EC and Japan, who in the five weeks since Mr Clinton took office have had to weigh every declaration of free trade principles against announcements of new dumping duties on steel imports or new inquiries into Airbus subsidies. Just minutes after Mr Clinton spoke, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, repeated that the US wished to review all aspects of its deal with Airbus shareholders over subsidies. Mr Clinton sought to outline a middle way between the extremes of absolute free trade and protectionism, and to situate his trade policy in the broader context of his domestic economic programme and of his foreign policy goals. He also argued that bilateral, regional and multilateral approaches all had their place in trade policy. Linking the spread of democracy in China, the developing world and the former Soviet Union to economic growth and the development of free trade, the president said a 'fair distribution of the fruits of growth among an increasingly restive world population' would bring 'dividends of trade, of friendship and peace'. 'Trade, of course, cannot ensure the survival of democracy. . . but if we believe in the bonds of democracy, we must resolve to strengthen the bonds of commerce,' he said. The president used his speech partly to explain to his trades union and business community backers why he would not adopt a firmly protectionist stance and to bid for more support for his package of taxes and spending measures.

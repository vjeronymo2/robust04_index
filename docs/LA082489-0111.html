			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> FAIL-SAFE MACHINERY URGED FOR JET DOORS  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board recommended the use of redundant  fail-safe mechanisms on airliner cargo door latches to prevent the doors from  popping open in flight and to assure that they are properly closed before  takeoffs. The safety board said its investigation of an apparent cargo door  failure last February in which nine people aboard a United Airlines flight were  killed shows the original design of the doors on Boeing 747 models "does not  provide for the fail-safe features intended." It recommended redundant  indicators to directly pinpoint the position of latch cams on the cargo doors.  The board also said torque-limiting devices should be installed to prevent  damage to the lock mechanisms during cargo door operation. No final  determination has been made of the cause of the United accident.  </P></p>

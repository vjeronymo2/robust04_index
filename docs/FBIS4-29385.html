			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yoshikazu Imari, member of TOKYO SHIMBUN's </F> General Affairs Bureau in the United States; first in a series  entitled: "Structure of North Korea's Suspected Development of  Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the International Community":  "U.S. Expectations; Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons is a  Proposition; Deep-Rooted Apprehension About Japan Still Exists"]    [Text] The Clinton administration has been patient and  making utmost diplomatic efforts in dealing with the DPRK (North  Korea) over its suspected nuclear arms development. As former  President Carter was about to leave for Pyongyang, North Korea  announced on 13 June its secession from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    The United States is struggling to prevent North Korea's  nuclear arms development project because it thinks that, if  North Korea is allowed "to have its way," nuclear states will  emerge one after another, nuclear weapons will proliferate in  the world, the system of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  (NPT) and IAEA will collapse, and North Korea's nuclear project  will become a serious threat to world peace.    In addition to the United States, Russia, Britain, and  France, which own nuclear weapons, South Africa disclosed its  temporary ownership of nuclear weapons. Also, there is a strong  suspicion that such countries as India, Pakistan, Israel, Iran,  and Libya either own already or are currently developing nuclear  arms. We still remember the news report on the IAEA's nuclear  inspections of Iraq. We cannot completely rule out the  possibility that North Korea's "nuclear" issue may become an  incentive to the ROK and other Southeast Asian nations to move  toward becoming nuclear nations.    There is a deep-rooted concern in the United States in  particular, that Japan, which is well capable of developing  nuclear weapons, will acquire nuclear weapons in the future.  Japan has been stressing its peace Constitution and three  nonnuclear principles. However, U.S. Congressman John Kasich  said: "Sometimes, politicians change their fundamental demands.  It is impossible to predict how politicians will act when they  feel that their countrymen are exposed to a danger."    North Korea's nuclear arms development plan is directly  linked to a denial of the diplomacy of the Clinton  administration, which calls for "post-Cold War changes." The  U.S. Government analyzes that North Korea already has one or two  "nuclear weapons," which are either completed or still under  construction. The United States also predicts that North Korea  will be able to extract enough plutonium to make four or five  bombs from spent fuel rods, which were recently removed from a  reactor, and that a new reactor, which will be constructed as  early as next year, will produce enough plutonium to produce  from 10 to 12 bombs annually. The United States just cannot  leave the North Korean plan to take its own course.    The U.S. Government has been patient and trying to settle  the  issue through dialogue with North Korea because tension will  build up on the Korean peninsula and even a military collision  cannot be avoided should hard-line measures be taken. If that  happens, the U.S. forces in the ROK will be the first to suffer  major casualties. Also, there is a fear of radiation pollution  if North Korean nuclear facilities are destroyed.    The Congress and the public are keeping a strict watch on  the  Clinton administration. At a meeting of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee's subcommittee on Asia-Pacific affairs,  Chairman Gary Ackerman addressed severe questions to the State  Department.    He said: "It was (the diplomatic policy of the past) that if  somebody told you at gun point to "give me your wallet," you  would say "no unless you show me if the gun is loaded." Even if  you demand North Korea, before sitting at a negotiation table,  to give up all cards it has, I do not think it will listen."    The Cable News Network's recent survey over the telephone  shows that 80 percent of the American people, or an overwhelming  majority, said yes to the question of whether "the United States  should impose economic sanctions against North Korea." Only 13  percent of the respondents were against it and 7 percent said  they did not know.    Moreover, in response to a question on whether if "military  action should be taken to destroy North Korea's nuclear  facilities," 46 percent of the respondents said yes and 40  percent said no.    However, China, which is supplying oil and food to North  Korea, still has not said that it will cooperate with the United  Nations in imposing sanctions against North Korea. Although  Japan stresses officially that it will act in harmony with the  United Nations, it is not actively supporting the idea of  banning remittances to North Korea. The Clinton  administration's irritation and confusion continue.</p>

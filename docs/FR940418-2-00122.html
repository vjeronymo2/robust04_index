			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC states in its filing that it has accepted deposits of common stock as clearing margin since 1982 and preferred stock and corporate debt since 1991 and that, accordingly, it has gained substantial experience in operating its valued securities program. OCC claims that the valued securities program has been successful in (1) reducing OCC's reliance on letters of credit by expanding acceptable forms of margin deposits and (2) enhancing the efficient allocation of clearing member capital. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> OCC states that because margin securities are the major source of collateral for letters of credit, its valued securities program was designed to eliminate the intermediate step of clearing members' depositing margin securities at banks as collateral for the issuance of letters of credit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC further states in its filing that from the program's commencement clearing members have requested that deposits of securities be valued at greater than 50% of current market value. OCC has been unable to accommodate these requests because of its agreement with the staffs of the FRB and the Commission that the OCC clearing margin would be capped at the maximum loan rate provided by Regulation U for margin securities. In response to OCC's filing, the FRB's staff has stated that the FRB will not object to an increase in the valuation rate applied to OCC's deposits of debt and equity issues. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  OCC proposes to value stocks and bonds deposited as clearing margin at a maximum of 60% of current market value or at such lesser value as OCC's Membership/Margin Committee may prescribe from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Telephone conversation between Scott Holz, Senior Attorney, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, FRB, and Thomas C. Etter, Jr., Esq., Division, Commission (March 3, 1993) and letter from Scott Holz to Thomas C. Etter, Jr. (March 11, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCC states that in addition to the 60% valuation rate providing a safe level of protection for OCC, there are additional safeguards in place for its protection. These safeguards include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Commission's Uniform Net Capital Rule, which applies to OCC clearing members; <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Act Rule 15c3&hyph;1 [17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1 (1993)]. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) The authority of OCC's Membership/Margin Committee to prescribe a lower valuation rate from time to time; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) OCC Rule 604(d)(1) which, among other things, establishes high eligibility standards for securities in the valued securities program and limits deposits of valued securities program and limits deposits of valued securities issued by any one issuer to 10% of the margin requirement of the account for which the securities are deposited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

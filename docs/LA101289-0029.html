			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW POLITICS FOR HUNGARY  </P> <P> Hungary's Communist Party has declared political bankruptcy, reorganized under  a new name and with different top managers, and is now back in business  offering what it says is a better line of goods. This remarkable  transformation, unprecedented in the history of world communism, represents a  last-ditch effort to give the party that has held near-totalitarian power for  40 years a gloss of respectability as Hungary prepares for promised multiparty  elections next spring. The more committed among the party's reformers, however,  are already questioning whether the metamorphosis goes far enough.  </P> <P> Much of Hungarian communism's old guard has found a home within the successor  Socialist Party and managed to retain some measure of ideological influence as  well. Thus the new platform states that "the party is a left-wing socialist  party striving for a synthesis between fundamental socialist and communist  values." Most Hungarians are likely to regard this hybrid as representing  something less than a clean break with the discredited and despised past. For  those who last week called themselves communists but who now say they have  turned Lenin's picture to the wall, it represents an uneasy compromise,  dictated by a sense that if the party is to have any hope for future electoral  success it must avoid further internal squabbles.  </P> <P> The reformers nonetheless can claim to have achieved much of what they wanted.  While the platform pledges to prevent the restoration of capitalism "by all  political means," it also promises -- without attempting to explain the paradox  -- to "abandon our stubborn prejudice against private property." It calls for  abolishing the state's monopoly in education, for transforming the  party-controlled Worker's Militia into a non-military emergency-aid  organization, and for opening parliamentary discussions on how to dispose of  the considerable real estates and other assets that were acquired by the  Communist Party during the course of its rule.  </P> <P> Like Poland's Solidarity-led government, the Socialist Party has carefully  committed itself to maintaining good relations with the Soviet Union and  membership in the Warsaw Pact and Comecon trade bloc. As for the 50,000 Soviet  troops still stationed in Hungary, the party says their withdrawal must await a  general agreement on disarmament in Europe.  </P> <P> All this, as the reformers worry, is likely to be interpreted by most  Hungarians as something less than a full separation from the party's past. The  central and historically impressive fact nonetheless remains that the Hungarian  Communist Party has dissolved itself, and its successor has solemnly pledged to  abide by the free political choice of the electorate. That vote, if polls are  right, is likely to leave those who have long ruled Hungary and who are  responsible for its economic and social malaise no more than a small opposition  party.  </P> <P> That moment has not yet arrived. But the point of no return does seem to have  been reached, with Hungary headed for an electoral revolution that -- more than  four decades after a Communist coup d'etat -- will provide it with a true  popular-based government. Step by step, country by country, the system that  Stalin imposed on Eastern Europe is being dismantled and interred.  </P></p>

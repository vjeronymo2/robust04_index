President Yeltsin, with the political statement signed in  Brussels on 9 December 1993, the EU [European Union] and Russia  agreed on the principles and directives on which the partnership  and cooperation agreement should be based. I am particularly  happy because one of the important EU actions under the Greek  Presidency is the signing of the Partnership and Cooperation  Agreement with your country. Today's ceremony clearly shows the  great importance the EU attaches to its relations with Russia.  It confirms the EU's continued support for Russia's democratic  development and reflects the great value for the EU of Russia's  constructive participation in international and regional  affairs, always in accordance with the principles of the United  Nations and CSCE, which we have both signed. We know of  Russia's interest in accession to the international and European  organizations and welcome recent developments. The agreement we  will sign constitutes the base for our cooperation across a  broad spectrum of issues. The agreement provides the legal  framework and reinforces the political dialogue between the EU  and Russia. We sincerely hope that it will lead to mutual  understanding and fruitful political cooperation that will  contribute to the stability and security of all Europe. The  agreement should give a big boost to our economic relations. It  considers the intricacies of the economic, fiscal, and  structural processes in Russia. It provides our economic bodies  with the necessary framework and the guarantees to move forward.  Ultimately, the agreement includes the possibility of expanding  into a free trade zone. This agreement will also contribute to  the success of our common goal, which aims at consolidating a  new and democratic Europe and political and economic progress in  our continent. I am convinced that our new partnership will  contribute to safeguarding the peace and prosperity that our  people desire so much. I thank you.</p>

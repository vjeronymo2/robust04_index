			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Canary Wharf offer considered MR LEWIS RANIERI, the Wall Street investor, has emerged as a partner of Mr Larry Tisch, the media billionaire, in a possible bid for Canary Wharf, the east London property development. The two investors, who expect to receive backing from investment funds, have offered to provide the Pounds 300m needed to complete the initial phases of Canary Wharf and find tenants for offices. Their offer will be discussed tomorrow by 11 commercial bank lenders to the project, which have provided Pounds 576m in commercial bank loans. Mr Tisch and Mr Ranieri are putting pressure on the banks to decide. Though Canary Wharf is being managed by administrators from Ernst &amp; Young under insolvency legislation, the final decision on the future ownership of Europe's biggest office development will be made by the banks, which include Barclays and Lloyds. Mr Paul Reichmann, who created Canary Wharf as founder of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property developer, persuaded Mr Ranieri and Mr Tisch to become potential investors. If their bid is successful, they would expect O&amp;Y to continue managing the project. Under the terms of the Tisch/Ranieri offer, the banks would be repaid nothing until the new investors had earned a return on their Pounds 300m. A banker said yesterday that the banks are split on what to do about the offer: 'A third believe we should examine it slowly, a third think we should accept it and a third think we should reject it'. However, Mr Tisch and Mr Ranieri have hinted that they will withdraw if they do not receive strong encouragement. Some bankers are concerned that if the offer is rejected, there is a risk that Canary Wharf will go into liquidation.</p>

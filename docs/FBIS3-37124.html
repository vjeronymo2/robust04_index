There is no alternative to  relations with Russia and this refers to all spheres: social,  cultural, economic, military and others, he said. The  parliament session discussed measures to stabilize the coupon  (monetary unit) of the Georgian National Bank and the situation  in the Ghali Region of Abkhazia.    Commenting on the signing of the Russian-Georgian agreements  during the recent visit to Tbilisi by Russian President Yeltsin,  Shevardnadze said that this had created the legal basis for  equal relations between the two countries. Of special  importance for Georgia, he said, is the package of economic  agreements. Shevardnadze has said that it is necessary now to do  everything so that the two countries' parliaments to ratify the  signed agreements.    Speaking about the situation in the Ghali Region of  Abkhazia,  the Georgian leader described the actions by the Abkhazian armed  units as another fascist sortie. There is only one way out, he  said. It is to settle the conflict politically. This could be  achieved, he said, if UN peacekeeping forces or Russian troops  are deployed in the zone of conflict.</p>

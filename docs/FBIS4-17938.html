			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 28, BNS -- The final version of the  plan for Estonia's participation in the NATO Partnership for  Peace program is expected to be ready in the middle of May,  officials at the Estonian Foreign Ministry said.    Estonia by now has prepared in most part the text of the  document it is going to propose from its side. Still to be  agreed upon are the issues pertaining to the military resources  to be given to NATO's disposal by Estonia. Work is going on  over these issues at the defense forces Central Staff in Tallinn.    After all necessary amendments have been made in the  Estonian  text of the plan, the government will get a draft budget of the  expenses connected with Estonia's participation in the program.  If the government approves the budget, Estonia will submit its  program to the NATO leadership for approval.    The Foreign Ministry says Estonia will be ready to take part  in the program in the second half of this year. Cooperation  under the Partnership for Peace program will follow the 16+1  formula, i.e. 16 NATO members plus that particular non-member  partner. But the program also provides for extensive bilateral  cooperation between NATO members and the partner countries.    The cooperation project is being prepared in Estonia by a  work group, led by the head of the Foreign Ministry's political  department, Toivo Klaar.    Officials at the Foreign Ministry said Estonia has been  working closely particularly with Denmark, but also with Germany  and the United States while drawing up the program. Exchanging  of information goes on steadily with Latvia and Lithuania, the  ministry officials said.    Enn Tupp, the head of the defense policy department at the  Estonian Defense Ministry, told reporters on Wednesday [27  April] that the country above all is interested in the  possibilities that the partnership program offers in the field  of military training. "This is one of our main aims while  participating in the program," Tupp said.    Estonia in the documents pays much attention to the  strengthening of its coast defense. The country expects from  the NATO members not only assistance in the form of consulting,  but also "certain material support," Tupp said.</p>

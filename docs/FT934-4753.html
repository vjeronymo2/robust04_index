			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Argyll Argyll's decision to depreciate its freehold assets and scale back its store opening programme helps clarify some of the uncertainties bedevilling the food retailing sector. Some other grocers are likely to follow Argyll's lead, ensuring their stated earnings will stall - or even fall - over the following few years. The market had implicitly assumed as much and confirmation could even come as a relief. Attention may now switch to other valuation criteria, which suggest food retailers possess more value than reflected in their stock market worth. It certainly appears anomalous that Argyll yields 5.5 per cent while it boasts such generous dividend cover. Argyll has not yet accepted the logical conclusion that it should cut its opening programme still further and return more cash to shareholders. Such a volte face would perhaps be too great coming just a year after it committed itself to accelerating capital spending. Were it any smaller, that might make Argyll vulnerable to a bid. A predator would certainly have the financial leeway to make brutal asset write-downs and halt capital spending, releasing a torrent of cash flow. Retailing rivals would find it hard to justify opening more superstores in such circumstances, restoring price equilibrium to the market.</p>

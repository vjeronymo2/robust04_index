			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Cost cuts lift Provident Financial to Pounds 12.8m PROVIDENT FINANCIAL, the personal loan and consumer finance group, reported a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 10.6m to Pounds 12.8m, for the half year to June 30. Turnover was up by 12 per cent to Pounds 184m, with the main activity - weekly credit collected from customers' homes - earning pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 10.1m). The improved performance reflected reduced costs, as the group cut its branches from 404 to 368, and closed 14 Lawson Fisher credit retailing stores. The group now has 1.3m credit customers. Staff numbers at the headquarters were reduced from 90 to 50, and head office no longer provided central services to subsidiaries. The insurance division made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m (Pounds 2.1m) but benefited from the market increase in motor premiums, while the banking side turned round to a profit of Pounds 100,000 (loss Pounds 1.1m). Earnings per share rose to 16.7p (14.37p) and the interim dividend is lifted to 9.25p (8.5p). In August, Car Care Plan, a loss-making subsidiary with net assets of Pounds 600,000, was sold for Pounds 4.6m cash to Motors Insurance Corporation, plus up to Pounds 500,000 in further conditional payments.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Contaminated land registers postponed THE GOVERNMENT has postponed plans to compel local authorities to introduce registers of contaminated land by April 1 after complaints by developers and landowners that such registers could blight their property. It is estimated that 100,000 sites in the UK are contaminated by pollution and that the total cost of reclamation would be between Pounds 10bn and Pounds 30bn. The postponement angered environmentalists. Mr Sean Humber, of Friends of the Earth, said: 'The government's backtracking will leave the public unaware of the risks posed by many sites.' Mr David Trippier, environment minister, said the government was concerned that land values would be unfairly blighted because of the registers. He said that further consultations would take place but gave no target date for eventual introduction of the register.</p>

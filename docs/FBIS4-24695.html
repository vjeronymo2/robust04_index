			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Qin Youshun (4440 0645 7311): "The 10 Million </F> Yuan Worth State Shares Change Owners for the First Time"]    [Text] On the morning of 9 May, based on the legal  supervision and intermediate service by the Anshan City Property  Right Trading Market, the ownership of 10 million yuan worth  state shares was transferred openly for the first time, and the  transaction formalities were completed on the spot by the buying  and selling sides. This means a major breakthrough made by  Anshan city in reforming the system concerning the ownership of  state-owned assets.    By the end of last year, Anshan set up a total of 18 limited  liability stock companies whose shares were partly held by the  state. Three of the companies raising capital stocks from the  public and selling shares to the public were listed; and 15  companies were raising capital stocks from fixed directions,  with capital stocks totaling over 1 billion yuan, of which, 45  percent was held by the state. Judging from the experiments,  however, some problems remain in the fields of further changing  the operating mechanism of enterprises on the basis of the  shareholding system, enabling enterprises to assume  responsibility for their own profits or losses, and enabling  holders of the same amount of shares to enjoy the same rights  and same profits. Conspicuous manifestation is that state  shares cannot participate in market operation and cannot be  circulated, thus being unfavorable to the activation of state  capital and to the optimization of industrial structure. For  this reason, Anshan city has mapped out programs on operation  and management of state shares, has established property right  exchange organs, and is preparing for the form of exchanging  stocks behind the counter. The Anshan Automatic Control  Instrument Group Limited Company and the Wuhuan Industrial  Limited Company, side A of this stock transaction in Anshan,  respectively transferred out 4 million and 6 million state  shares (ordinary shares) valued at 4 million and 6 million yuan.  Each share was sold at the ratio of 1 to 1.1 to side B, the  Anshan City Trust and Investment Limited Company. The Anshan  Automatic Control Instrument Group Limited Company and the  Wuhuan Industrial Limited Company are share-holding enterprises  with good management results and high social reputation in  Anshan city. The former generated more than 10 million yuan in  profits last year, with an increase margin of 105 percent, and  the latter developed rapidly and drew more dividends in the past  two years. The Anshan City Trust and Investment Limited Company  is an enterprise gaining handsome profits through the stock  market. Both buying and selling sides of this dealing are  strong players in the stock market.</p>

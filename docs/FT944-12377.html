			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / World Trade News: MPs expose 70-year trail of export credit errors Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department has said administrative mistakes which caused it to make overpayments of Pounds 83m (Dollars 131m) to British exporters since 1975 may have been going on for more than 70 years. The admission is contained in a report yesterday from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee. It severely criticises the ECGD for sloppy administration, poor internal controls and slowness in deciding whether to discipline staff responsible for the mistakes. The Department of Trade and Industry has already decided not to try to recover the overpayments, most of which arose from insurance of export orders from Nigeria. The committee said the overpayments, first disclosed by a National Audit Office report in February, had occurred because ECGD officials had misinterpreted policies governing recoveries on supplier credit insurance to exporters. After the department took legal advice, its London office had applied the correct approach since 1990, However, its older Cardiff office - which now belongs to NCM, the Dutch export credit insurer - continued to misinterpret the rules until 1992. The ECGD told the committee that though overpayments had been traced back to 1975, it was unsure when the misinterpretations began and 'believed it possible' that they had taken place since 1919. The committee also said the ECGD had given 'conflicting evidence at different times' about how far its inability to provide a more accurate figure for overpayments was due to its destruction of case files. The committee expressed concern that internal audit procedures had not discovered the two offices' different methods, which had been detected only in 1992 by independent consultants brought in to computerise the department. The committee expressed surprise that the ECGD had not sought proper legal advice on how to interpret a new form of credit guarantee introduced in 1975. It said this had produced a 'sloppy system', made worse by lack of co-ordination between the London and Cardiff offices. The report said the overpayments had prompted the ECGD to review its operations and strengthen links between its administrative staff and lawyers. However, the committee expressed concern that almost two years after the differences in the ECGD's methods had been discovered, the department had still not decided whether to take disciplinary action against its staff.

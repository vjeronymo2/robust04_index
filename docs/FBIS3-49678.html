			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor Krejci </F> in Prague; date not given: "`The Foreign Policy Card Must Not  Be a Substitute for the Domestic Card'"]    [Text] Polish President Lech Walesa said in an interview  in yesterday's LIDOVE NOVINY that he is disappointed and  disturbed by the course of action adopted by Prague, which,  according to him, insisted that each country meet separately  with President Clinton and that no joint communique be issued.  Apparently, if -- as Lech Walesa said -- the talks end in  failure, it will be necessary to say that this was the fault of  the organizers. The Polish president also said that he had  proposed to Prime Minister Klaus that he deliver a joint  statement on behalf of all four countries, but, apparently, this  suggestion was not "taken up." In this connection, we asked  Prime Minister Klaus for an interview.    [Krejci] Prime Minister, would you care to comment on the  statements made by President Walesa?    [Klaus] First, I would like to state quite unequivocally  that the Czech side is not the organizer of this meeting. I  think that certain of our neighbors and partners have either  simply forgotten this or they do not want to hear it. We did  not come up with the idea that President Clinton should come  from Brussels and brief the Central European countries on the  outcome of the U.S. initiative in NATO. We have -- of course --  absolutely no power to do this and we have even less power to  persuade the U.S. Administration that this meeting should be  held in Prague. This was solely the initiative of the U.S.  side, and we can only say that we were glad to accept it. This  means there can be no suggestion at all of any organizing on our  part.    As far as the Visegrad countries drafting a joint communique  is concerned, I do not know if there is a sufficient consensus  of interests and views for this. I do not think it is possible  to place the cart before the horse; this means that, first of  all, it is necessary to have concurring views and only then can  a communique be drafted by simple means. Unfortunately,  however, this is not the situation. The term joint interests  cannot be used to describe the maximal interests of one country.  Only the highest common denominator of the interests of the  four Visegrad countries can be a joint interest. The Czech side  certainly does not act like a bottleneck or is the one to lower  the common denominator.    [Krejci] Could you somehow specify the diversity of  interests that you mentioned?    [Klaus] We do not measure the closeness of cooperation by  the number of summits involving heads of state or foreign  ministers, but by real tangible deeds and, in this case, it  seems obvious to me that the most significant deed so far has  been the creation of CEFTA, or the Central European Free Trade  Zone, while the bottleneck blocking the intensification of this  free zone, the speeding up of its completion, and the inclusion  of a larger number of commodities in this free trade zone is not  the Czech Republic. It is, on the other hand, the side that  constantly asks its partners for more effective cooperation.    [Krejci] How do these diverse interests manifest themselves  with regard to entry into NATO?    [Klaus] It is not my place to analyze the interests of  Poland, Hungary, or Slovakia. I simply do not want -- and the  Czech side is not doing this -- the foreign policy card to be  played as a substitute for the domestic policy card. I am a  little concerned, however, that this is what we are beginning to  see in some of the Visegrad countries.    [Krejci] After the Slovak Republic paid its debt in the  clearing account with the Czech Republic, this debt was incurred  again as you predicted last month. How will the government  proceed in this regard?    [Klaus] The government will proceed precisely in accordance  with the agreement concluded on clearing relations between the  Czech Republic and Slovakia, this means, that if a debt is  incurred, it is a condition that it be repaid in hard currency  by the middle of the following month. Nothing more and nothing  less. I am pleased that when this situation arose for the first  time there was no hitch. Of course, we will refine the clearing  agreement; however, we will not increase the margin.    On the other hand, I think that the various devaluation  shifts have more of a long-term than a short-term effect, so it  is not out of the question that balanced relations between the  Czech and Slovak economies in foreign trade will be achieved  earlier than it may seem.</p>

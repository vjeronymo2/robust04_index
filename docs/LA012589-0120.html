Atty. Paul Rugnetta  said.  </P> <P> Molina was not the actual killer of Hahn's niece, Ramona Gayton, who was in her  40s.  </P> <P> Rugnetta said Molina's accomplice, Jose E. Ulivarri, was the person who stabbed  Gayton to death during the robbery of the home she shared with her psychiatrist  husband. Ulivarri faces a pretrial conference today.  </P> <P> The prosecutor said Ulivarri, who was armed with a gun, and Molina also tried  to strangle Juliette Pecorano, 19, a neighbor who was at Gayton's home during  the robbery. Pecorano survived.  </P> <P> Pecorano told officials she remembers hearing Gayton screaming, "Run Juliette,  run for your life," before the two suspects tried to strangle her.  </P></p>

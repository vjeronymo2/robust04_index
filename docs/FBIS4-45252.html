Orlando Gomez; from the "Midday Television </F> Newscast"]    [Text] Despite Colombia's poor image in the realm of human  rights violations, it is very possible that the EC countries  will increase its tariff benefits. Because of the huge  sacrifices Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru have made in  blood and money in the struggle against drug trafficking, the EC  four years ago established a system that allows these Latin  American countries' products to enter the 12 EC countries  without paying tariffs or taxes. Thanks to this measure, a  considerable amount of Colombian exports are entering the old  continent without any problem. EC Ambassador Jose Luis Benito  Prior discussed the issue.    [Begin Benito Prior recording] This measure covers over 90  percent of Colombia's exports, all industrial products, and a  long list of farm products. Colombia, therefore, can  congratulate itself for this positive atmosphere. [end  recording]    Thanks to the good work these countries have done in the  struggle against drug trafficking, these preferential tariffs  may be extended for another 10 years.    [Begin Benito Prior recording] In Europe we appreciate all  the efforts that Colombia and other Latin American countries are  making in this struggle. Much must still be done, and together  we must try to foster a spirit of cooperation. [end recording]    These favorable conditions and terms will allow Colombia's  most competitive products to establish roots on the old  continent within a few years.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibeth Vega G.] </F>   [Text] In a message to the public exactly one week prior to  the elections, President Guillermo Endara asked the Panamanian  people to remember the past and establish the difference between  this democratic electoral campaign and past campaigns. "The  Panamanian people must remember this campaign has been totally  different from past campaigns; it is up to the people to ensure  the example of this election will be repeated in every future  election," Endara told LA PRENSA.    The president suggested that under no circumstances should  the Panamanian people allow anyone to deprive them of the right  to vote freely as citizens of a democratic government. Endara  said he is pleased to preside over the first popular election in  freedom and democracy.    Endara took office on 20 December 1989, when U.S. troops  invaded the country and toppled the military regime of Manuel  Antonio Noriega, who is serving a 40-year prison sentence in the  United States on drug-trafficking charges.    "I cannot decide Panama's future. That is exclusively up to  the Panamanian people, and I am therefore asking them to go to  the polls and vote for the best candidate," the president said.    Endara reiterated he is pleased with his accomplishments as  president and will surrender power to whomever wins the 8 May  elections. "It will be my duty to surrender power on 1  September to whomever wins the elections. Moreover, for the  first time, immediately after the winner is named, I will offer  him my support and an orderly transition period so that when he  takes office he will be aware of all public affairs," the  president added.    Approximately 1.5 million Panamanians will elect the new  government that will replace Endara's on 8 May.</p>

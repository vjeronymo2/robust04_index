			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Christian Democratic Assembly [RDC] leader Eddy  Volel opposes the demonstration scheduled for 4 February.  According to Volel, some sectors have the right to demonstrate  in the streets whereas others do not.    [Begin Volel recording, in Creole] There is a sector that is  struggling for democracy, but that does not have the right to  speak, even less does it have the right to stage demonstrations  or to hold meetings. We in the RDC are always against this  stance that favors a person or a group of persons to the  detriment of another person or group of persons. We could never  offer our support, we never offered our support, and we will  never offer our support to anything done against the interests  of the people. So, we do not offer our support: We oppose this  demonstration. We are against this disorder because those  people, who are staging the demonstration, have never done  anything for the Haitian people. On the contrary, they have  always tried to destroy the people, to destroy the country. [end  rcording]</p>

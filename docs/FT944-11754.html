			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Observer: Spoilt for choice The distinction between the editorial and news departments of the Wall Street Journal newspaper is no secret. The former is a billboard for conservative thinking, while the latter plays it pretty straight. Each seems to accept - if not always happily - the existence of the other. But that inherent contradiction has surfaced this week with the publication of extracts - by the news section, naturally - of a book by two WSJ reporters who are highly critical of Justice Clarence Thomas of the US Supreme Court. In 1991, when confronted with allegations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill during his confirmation hearings, Judge Thomas had no stouter defenders than WSJ leader writers. Much space was devoted to David Brock, whose book charged that Hill was part of a liberal conspiracy to undermine the judge, by foul means rather than fair. Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, two WSJ reporters, now come to a distinctly different conclusion. In the extracts, they paint a picture of a man almost obsessed by the female sex, parading as witnesses four women who worked with Thomas and whose evidence was never presented to the Senate judiciary committee. The extracts appeared yesterday - as did spin-off prime time TV programmes. So far the magisterial leader writers have been quiet. But surely not for long?</p>

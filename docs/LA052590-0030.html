			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOL BOARD REJECTS STIFFER PENALTY ON WEAPONS  </P> <P> Insanity seems to prevail in the school board decision not to automatically  expel students armed with lethal weapons on campus.  </P> <P> Your editorial "When Students Tote Guns, Not Books" (May 9) was equally  outrageous.  </P> <P> I quote ". . . without kicking out frightened youngsters who carry a Scout  knife for protection against gangs and bullies."  </P> <P> Thus the writer sees nothing wrong with a student carrying a Scout knife to use  against those who threaten him at school. Who is to decide who the gang members  and bullies are, each student? A Scout knife is a deadly weapon and is  dangerous if used for self-protection. But it is really no match for a gun. I  humbly suggest that the school board enact a new rule that all students can  carry guns for protection. Of course, the teachers would be issued assault  rifles to ensure fair play. Maybe the NRA could be talked into training the  students in quick draw and accuracy.  </P> <P> LEE L. BANDLE  </P> <P> Palm Desert  </P></p>

The party style of a ruling party exerts a decisive  and yet subtle influence on social practices.    Since its inception in 1921, our party has faithfully  carried  out its objective of serving the people wholeheartedly. It has  believed in and relied on the people. In their interests, and  advancing wave upon wave, it has vanquished imperialism,  feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, and spared no pains to do  a good job in economic construction; thus winning the warm  support, love, and esteem of the people, and establishing  flesh-and-blood ties with them. Over a long period of  revolutionary struggle and economic construction, the broad  masses of party members have, with their staunch party spirit,  strict discipline, selfless dedication, and edifying influence,  given an impetus to hundreds of millions of people. The correct  party style has thus given rise to sound practices among the  people to lead simple and honest lives amid an harmonious  atmosphere, and among people who are ever vigorous in spirit and  intent to make progress.    In recent years, some party members and cadres, in  particular  a handful of party members and leading cadres who were unable to  stand the trials of governing, reform, and opening up, gradually  yielded to mammonism, hedonism, and extreme individualism. They  made use of their power to gain selfish ends, lived in luxury,  became corrupt and degenerate, hankered after fame and fortune,  and to a certain extent, undermined party style and tarnished  its image. The presence of decadent phenomenon within the party  has exerted an undesirable influence and encouraged unhealthy  practices, giving rise to the tendency of regarding money as  all-important and caring for nothing but profit, or even  bringing back to life some of the vicious phenomena that  disappeared long ago. These kinds of phenomena not only run  counter to socialist spiritual civilization, but also hamper  economic development.    The people are realistic. First they come to know the party  and evaluate it in light of the practices and actions of party  members in their midst. When a Communist Party member raises  his arm at a critical and trying moment when one's fate is  hanging in the balance, he shouts: "I am a Communist Party  member, follow me!" As soon as party members go forward, the  people will follow suit. If a party member sees a woman being  humiliated by a villain armed with a knife and turns a blind  eye, staying away for fear that he may be unable to get away in  time; if some party members and leading cadres come across a  seriously ill patient who needs to be rushed to a hospital, but  just ignore him and whiz by in a plush sedan; if, while the  people are still toiling to find sufficient food and clothing,  party members and cadres indulge themselves in feasting, what  will they people think? How will they view it? How can we  expect the people to gallantly rise for a just cause? How can  we ask the people to unite and help one another?    Presently, some party members and cadres complain that the  people are disobedient and hard to lead, that human hearts are  not what they used to be in the old days, and social practices  are no longer pure. Those complaining comrades should first  examine the actual role being played by party organizations as  fighting bastions under their leadership, and examine how their  own party members are playing their exemplary vanguard role.  Why is it that party members in places like Huaxi village under  Jiangyin county, Qianzhou township under Wuxi city, and Jianhuai  village under Huaian city do not have such complaints; and why  can these people work with one heart and one mind with party  members and cadres to carry out economic construction and  spiritual civilization construction? The crux of the matter  lies in that party organizations and members in these localities  have been faithful to their objectives, have done practical work  for the people, and worked for their benefit; such correct party  style has naturally led to healthy social practices.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: The key to China's  problems lies in doing a good job within the Communist Party.  To establish simple and honest social practices, create a  political environment marked by stability and unity, and  organize hundreds of millions of people to work with concerted  efforts to achieve the goal of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, first and foremost, we must eradicate all  corrupt practices inside the party. Party organizations at all  levels and every party member should further study the  guidelines set out in the whole series of anticorruption  documents issued by the party Central Committee; clearly  understand the overall concept of the anticorruption drive  launched by the party Central Committee and the party's  short-term goals and current tasks, principles, and priorities;  and try to unify our thinking and understanding, and actively  plunge ourselves into the anticorruption struggle. We must, on  this basis, resort to mobilizing and relying on the people to  expose, lodge reports, and take measures against major cases in  cooperation with specific organs according to the law, and  firmly stamp out several unhealthy practices which the people  are resentful of. At the same time, we must strengthen the  management of education among party members, and constantly  raise consciousness toward self-discipline, honest living, as  well as the ability to fight corruption and handle any  unfavorable turn of events among party members and cadres,  particularly among leading cadres. The leadership and rank and  file must work hand in hand to set party style right, and create  a new situation with correct party style and healthy social  practices.</p>

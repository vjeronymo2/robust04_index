			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: Plea bargaining dangerously tempting Sir, John Mason, in his article 'Haggling a discount on criminal justice' (June 8), is correct in highlighting the danger of defendants being pressured into pleading guilty should a formal system of plea bargaining be introduced into the English criminal justice system. The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice should resist making such a recommendation at least until the Serious Fraud Office wins greater, widespread confidence in its handling of cases and its identification of what constitutes criminal action. I write as one of seven defendants in the Blue Arrow trial. Each of us believed that we were innocent of any criminal action and were eventually vindicated by the courts. Nonetheless, at the beginning of the trial in November 1990, certain vague plea-bargaining proposals were discussed between defendants, their counsel and prosecuting counsel. Fortunately they came to nothing. Consider our position though: we had been arrested in November 1989, the scope of the prosecution allegations was such that the trial was likely to run into the autumn of 1991 (in fact, it ran until February 1992), and the complexity of the case (at times seemingly beyond the grasp of the prosecution) ran the risk that the final verdict would be a lottery. The effect of the trial on ourselves and our families made the short-cut tempting. Had we also been responsible for our own costs, the choice would have been all the harder. I would not have wished that temptation to have been set in the context of a formal plea-bargaining system. Until the SFO demonstrates both a better judgment in bringing cases to court and a determination to keep trials down to a sensible length, the dangers of a formal plea-bargaining system should outweigh its largely economic attraction.

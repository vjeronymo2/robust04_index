			<p>BFN     [Text] The renowned Jirki, Gevdan, Mamguran, Giravi, and  Goran tribes in Sirnak and Hakkari Provinces have joined their  forces against the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK]. The tribes,  which have thousands of armed men, assembled in Beytussebap  District to demonstrate against the PKK at 1030 yesterday. Some  5,000 demonstrators marched and chanted: "The banner will not  be lowered; the cause cannot be abandoned; the Turkish, Kurdish,  Laz [Black Sea people], and Circassian peoples are brothers;  this country will be the PKK's grave; the PKK will drown in the  blood it sheds."</p>

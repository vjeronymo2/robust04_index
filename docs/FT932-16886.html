			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / US approach on trade issues under fire MR Martin Bangemann, European Commission vice president, yesterday criticised the US for taking a bilateral approach in trying to solve trade issues, and said the EC should adopt a multilateral and more moderate approach to its growing trade imbalance with Japan. Mr Bangemann, responsible for EC industrial affairs and information and telecommunications technology, had tough words for the US, which was trying to impose its views on the rest of the world. He was particularly critical of the bilateral approach adopted by the US, which, he said, generally benefited only one party. 'If all of us start having bilateral agreements then we are lost,' he said. Referring to the US-Japan semiconductor arrangement through which the US has sought 20 per cent of the market in Japan for foreign semiconductor manufacturers, Mr Bangemann said such an approach 'is not a free market method.' The way to resolve trade disputes was not through bilateral agreements but through a multilateral arrangement, like the Gatt, and through greater co-operation between the industries of the two regions. The widening trade imbalance with Japan was alarming, both in economic and political terms. The EC's trade deficit with Japan grew to Dollars 31.2bn in 1992, up almost 70 per cent from Dollars 18.5bn in 1990. What the EC and Japan needed, in order to improve the trade balance, was 'a comprehensive new method of dealing with our economic relationship,' which was not guaranteed market shares or any other bilateral agreement for managed trade.</p>

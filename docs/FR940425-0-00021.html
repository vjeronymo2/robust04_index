			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 19. The Commission's primary goals in this proceeding are to provide usable spectrum for emerging technologies in a timely manner and to provide for recommodation of incumbent operations when necessary with a minimum of disruption to those operations. The Commission believes that it is possible for some degree of sharing to exist between emerging technologies and fixed microwave operations in these bands, particularly as emerging technologies are developing. However, the Commission believe that in the long term these bands will be required primarily for emerging technologies, particularly in urban areas. Therefore, it is inconsistent with the Commission's goals, as a general policy, to encourage new or relocated fixed microwave use of these bands. Specifically, the Commission believes that returning in general will be detrimental to its goals, because most retuned fixed microwave facilities ultimately would be required to move to another band. Further, in cases where the current equipment is incapable of being retuned, it would be necessary to purchase new equipment, which would result in little saving of time or money in the relocation process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20. The Commission now believes, however, that some retuning may be practical, particularly in rural areas where all of the spectrum allocated for emerging technologies may not be needed. It believes that allowing such retuning would facilitate the clearing of spectrum in these cases and that such clearing may lead to quicker implementation of PCS services in these bands. Therefore, the Commission will allow relocation within the 2 GHz band where all interested parties agree to the retuning of the incumbent's facilities. ``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent licensee, the emerging technology provider or representative requesting and paying for the relocation, and any emerging technology licensee of the spectrum to which the incumbent's facilities are to be retuned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 21. The Commission is prohibiting any retuning to emerging technology spectrum that is not yet allocated to a specific new service, specifically, the 1970&hyph;1990, 2110&hyph;2130, and 2160&hyph;2180 MHz bands. It is also not adopting a specific date for the relocation of all incumbent facilities from the band designated for unlicensed PCS devices, as requested by Apple Computer. The Commission believes that the relocation framework adopted in this proceeding is sufficient to allow for a timely relocation of the incumbent facilities from the unlicensed band. However, if it becomes apparent that additional measures are required by the Commission to facilitate the implementation of unlicensed PCS, this decision may be reconsidered at that time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. In the Third R&amp;O, the Commission stated that a fixed two-year period for voluntary negotiations will commence with its acceptance of applications for emerging technology services, and a one-year mandatory negotiation period for unlicensed spectrum will commence when an unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates a written request for negotiation with a specific licensee. The transition framework adopted in this proceeding attempts to balance the need to provide usable spectrum for emerging technologies as quickly as possible against causing disruption to the incumbent operations. We believe the two-tier negotiation process provides incumbents with adequate protection in the relocation process, even in rural areas where spectrum may not be required immediately for emerging technologies. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe that in order to facilitate the implementation of PCS in a timely manner, the two-year voluntary negotiation period should begin in all areas upon the receipt of applications for the emerging technology service. However, to avoid ambiguity as to the exact date on which the voluntary negotiation period will begin, the Commission will issue a public notice specifying this date. The Commission also notes that this period is for voluntary negotiations; and, therefore, that incumbents are not required to negotiate until licensees have been designated, if they so choose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 23. With regard to Apple's request to clarify which negotiation period is applicable when it is necessary for a PCS licensee or representative of the unlicensed devices to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee whose operations are in spectrum adjacent to that of the PCS provider, the Commission concludes that the transition schedule of the entity requesting the move will apply. For example, if a representative for unlicensed devices needs to relocate a fixed facility that is operating in spectrum allocated for licensed PCS, the transition schedule for spectrum allocated for unlicensed devices (one-year mandatory) will apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. In the Third R&amp;O, the Commission stated that its staff is working with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to establish procedures to accommodate in the adjacent government fixed service band at 1710&hyph;1850 MHz those non-government 2 GHz fixed microwave facilities that technically cannot be accommodated in higher bands. The Commission noted that NTIA has agreed to provided limited, condition access to government spectrum on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

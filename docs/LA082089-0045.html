			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: CORNY BUT TRUE  </P> <P> Universal Studios, eat your heart out. Dyersville, Iowa -- site of the  cornfield that "starred" as the magical baseball diamond in "Field of Dreams"  -- has become a hot tourist attraction too.  </P> <P> "We direct hundreds of people to the field each week," said Mary Lee Harmon,  manager of the Visitors Bureau in nearby Dubuque.  </P> <P> For the film's purposes the baseball diamond was built on land owned by two  farmers. The farmer who owns the land that comprised left and center fields has  since replanted it with corn.  </P> <P> But Don Lansing, owner of infield and right field, has kept his portion  unfarmed -- and is personally maintaining it. He's mowing, watering and  smoothing down the red dirt base paths. And he's put out signs directing people  to "the movie set." Adjacent to the field is Lansing's lemonade concession --  and a T-shirt stand.  </P> <P> Emblazoned on the T-shirts: the line from the film, "Is this Heaven? No, it's  Iowa."

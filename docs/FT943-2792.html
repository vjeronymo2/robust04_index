			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Privatisation tops Major's agenda for foreign tour: Saudis and S Africans seek help Saudi Arabia and South Africa have asked the UK government for advice on privatisation programmes that could generate massive consultancy and flotation fees for British companies. British officials say privatisation will be near the top of Mr John Major's agenda on his five-day visit to the two countries and Abu Dhabi which starts tomorrow. More than a dozen top businessmen will accompany Mr Major. The group includes senior executives of privatised companies, merchant banks and stockbrokers. Mr Anthony Nelson, the Treasury minister responsible for privatisation, is also going. The trip is the first visit to South Africa by a British prime minister since Harold Macmillan's 'wind of change' speech in 1960, which signalled the start of the white-run government's international isolation. Mr Major will hold talks with President Nelson Mandela, and his vice-presidents Mr Thabo Mbeki and Mr FW De Klerk. He will also meet Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Zulu leader. The prime minister will announce more aid for South Africa. However, the focus of the trip will be on developing business opportunities identified during an exploratory visit in July by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. The African National Congress ruled out privatisation before winning the elections - but the multi-party government is considering asset sales as a means of raising money to finance its reconstruction and development plans. The state-owned railways, ports and airline are thought to be possible candidates for privatisation, with the water industry and Telkom, the telecommunications agency. The government also owns a number of businesses such a phosphorus mine and a gas field which could be sold. Political demands for land reform would probably prevent the disposal of the state's vast land holdings. Many of the British companies represented in the party have long-standing links with South Africa, and some are believed to have held preliminary talks with government officials since the election. Mr Michael Marks, chief executive of stockbroker Smith New Court, said: 'We think there might be quite a lot of opportunities as the government looks for ways to finance its reconstruction programme, and we want to be part of that.' South Africa is also thought to be interested in buying British naval patrol craft and military aircraft. But British officials said no deals were likely to be finalised during the trip. Saudi Arabia is said to be considering the privatisation of part of its extensive public sector to replenish its reserves which were severely depleted by the cost of the Gulf war. The government has run a budget deficit for the last 12 years as a result of declining real prices for oil exports and rising spending, particularly on arms. The state-owned telecommunications, petrochemicals, and airline businesses are thought to be potential candidates for privatisation. British Aerospace is thought to be close to finalising the sale of about 40 aircraft to Saudi Arabia under the Al Yamamah II arms deal, under which payment is made in oil. The business party with the prime minister includes Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general; Mr Tim Barker, vice-chairman of Kleinwort Benson; Earl Cairns, chief executive of SG Warburg; Mr Michael Dobson, chief executive of Morgan Grenfell; Sir Christopher Benson, chairman of construction group Costain and Sir Ralph Robins, chairman of Rolls-Royce.</p>

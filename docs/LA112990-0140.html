			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUE HONIG FOR FUNDING PARITY  </P> <P> Charging that the state has failed to comply with a state Supreme Court  decision requiring equal funding to schools, the Capistrano Unified School  District and eight other districts on Wednesday sued state schools chief Bill  Honig in an effort to balance funding statewide.  </P> <P> The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, charges that the state has  failed to live up to the 1974 Serrano vs. Priest decision, which held that wide  funding gaps between school districts was unconstitutional. The decision was  upheld by the state Supreme Court in 1976.  </P> <P> The suit, which charges that the state's formula treats children "in an  invidious and irrational manner," will be handled by John McDermott, a Los  Angeles attorney who also handled the first Serrano-Priest case through its  state Supreme Court hearing.  </P> <P> At a press conference at the Capistrano district's headquarters, McDermott said  some school districts around the state receive up to $1,000 more per student  than other districts in the same county.  </P> <P> The lawsuit seeks a ruling that the state's school finance system is  unconstitutional and a directive to the Legislature "to devise a constitutional  system of finance" within one year, with periodic progress reports from Honig.  </P> <P> Jacqueline Cerra, a spokeswoman for the Capistrano district, said the state  superintendent of public instruction is named defendant in the suit because "he  is responsible for distribution of (education) funds" in the state. Honig could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Joseph Symkowick, general counsel for the state Department of Education, said  that a similar challenge was struck down in Los Angeles Superior Court in 1983.  The state Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in September, 1987.  </P> <P> "We're under the same school financing system as we've been under essentially  for more than 10 years now," Symkowick said. "That system has undergone an  extensive review . . . . (in the Los Angeles case) the appellate court upheld  the lower the court finding that the financing system met the test of the equal  protection clause of the (state) Constitution."  </P> <P> McDermott said that while the Legislature has made "significant strides" in  bringing the state into compliance with Serrano-Priest, it has failed to fully  comply with the 1974 ruling of Judge Bernard S. Jefferson, who ordered funding  disparities between school districts to be reduced to less than $100 per pupil  by 1980.  </P> <P> Jefferson's ruling "was supposed to get the job done, and here we are in 1990  and the job still isn't done," McDermott said. "There is no mechanism currently  in place in state law to get rid of those inequalities."  </P> <P> The inequalities can be traced to Proposition 13, McDermott said. According to  the lawsuit, "before Proposition 13, high-spending districts received a much  greater portion of their revenue from local property taxes than did  low-spending districts. Thus, rich districts would have had their budgets  reduced substantially, far more so than poor districts" after Proposition 13  passed.  </P> <P> To offset those lost property tax revenues, the Legislature authorized bailout  funds, or systematic increases based on student attendance. The problem, the  suit charges, was that instead of equalizing funding, the Legislature simply  provided school districts with up to 91% of what they had been getting from  taxes before Proposition 13, thus leaving the disparities between so-called  "low-wealth" districts and wealthy districts intact.  </P> <P> "By substituting funds for lost property-tax revenue, the Legislature  re-enacted and re-created the same spending disparities that existed before  Proposition 13," the lawsuit says. The result, McDermott said, is that a  district with high property values can get hundreds -- or perhaps thousands --  of dollars per student more than a district right next door.  </P> <P> For example, Capistrano Unified received $2,832 per student in fiscal 1990,  compared with $3,113 per pupil in the neighboring Newport-Mesa Unified School  District. But McDermott said that because the upscale Newport Beach/Costa Mesa  area receives so much money from property taxes, it has more money to spend on  schools -- in fact spending $966 more per student than in Capistrano Unified.  </P> <P> "There's just no reason why the state gives out $3,000 to one school district  and $2,000 to another," McDermott said.  </P> <P> He added that the Legislature had been moving toward closing the gap by giving  larger cost-of-living adjustments to poorer districts than to richer ones, but  slowed its efforts after the 1983 Los Angeles case. The Superior Court ruled  then that the state was largely in compliance with Serrano-Priest if gaps  between districts were not more than $260 per pupil, or the $100 per pupil  mandated in the original Serrano-Priest decision adjusted for inflation.  </P> <P> But McDermott argued that the $100 per pupil was meant to apply in current  dollars in any year, and even if the $260-per-pupil level is upheld, the  disparities often are even greater.  </P> <P> Besides Capistrano, the districts named as plaintiffs are the Magnolia  Elementary District in Orange County; New Haven Unified, Alameda County; Delano  Union Elementary, Kern County; Lucia Mar Unified, San Luis Obispo County;  Laguna Salada Union Elementary, San Mateo County; Oak Grove Elementary, Santa  Clara County, and Barstow Unified and Redlands Unified, both of San Bernardino  County.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICTS' REVENUE PER STUDENT  </P> <P> State revenue per student, from lowest to highest, for Orange County unified  districts with average daily attendance over 1,500.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.87IN:2.22IN:2.33IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Avg.

"Too much NATO-centrism," he replied.    Coming from the man most closely identified with the  prowestern thrust of the first two years of Russia's post-Soviet  foreign policy, the remark was revealing. If Russia's most  ardent "westernisers" are becoming more critical of the West, it  is a significant shift. It may be tempting to see the new  Moscow line as a reaction to the upsurge of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, the far-right leader. But it has been evolving  over a period of months, as Russia's military and political  decisionmakers begin to recover from the shock of the Soviet  Union's collapse and work out a new conception of their  country's place in the world. If it is a reaction to anything,  it is to what is seen as the West's disappointing attitude to  Russia.    Gorbachev's perestroika was founded on the notion that if  Russia changed its behaviour in eastern Europe and towards the  West, the rest of the continent would adjust its negative image  of Russia. As the successors to Gorbachev, the leaders of the  new post-Soviet Russia went further. They hoped they would be  welcomed into the western club with open arms, while also being  recognised as a country with legitimate interests.    It did not happen. Even before Zhirinovskiy, Russia's  efforts to withdraw from the Baltics in an orderly fashion were  attacked in the West as foot-dragging, or even as a  barely-disguised effort to hold on to imperial positions. Its  exclusively diplomatic moves to defend the civil rights and  linguistic interests of Russian settlers in the Baltics were  criticised as interference. Its military moves in Tajikistan,  even though they had the support of the Commonwealth of  Independent States, were depicted as interventionism.    A strange dichotomy emerged in the West. Almost anything  President Yeltsin did at home was applauded blindly. Almost  anything he did outside Russia in areas of previous Soviet  influence was condemned as the stirrings of imperialism.    It is not surprising that eastern Europeans should harbour  ill-will towards Russia. They suffered under Stalinist  occupation for more than 40 years. Polish suspicions go back  for two centuries before that. Partly genuinely, but with a  good deal of calculation, they have seized on the Zhirinovskiy  card to try to drum their way into NATO.    Clinton has done well to resist their pressure, sensing that  to move NATO's frontier eastward will incite Russian anxieties.  As Kozyrev put it as long ago as last March: "We don't  understand the discussions to the effect that NATO must give  security guarantees to the countries of central Europe and in  the long term accept them as members. How are these countries  threatened and by whom?"    But Clinton is only partly guided by good reasons. As  Kozyrev's "NATO-centric" comment implied, the West is still  mesmerised by NATO's alleged achievements. The tag-line "the  most successful alliance in history" does not survive close  scrutiny, nor does its subtheme that nuclear deterrence was the  key ingredient.    The West's monopoly of nuclear weapons, which Truman proudly  announced to Stalin at Potsdam in 1945, did not stop the Soviet  take-over of central Europe or roll back its annexation of the  Baltic states. The formation of NATO four years later did  nothing to prevent new assertions of Russian-inspired control in  East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia.    If Moscow did not move further westwards, it was not because  of NATO but because the Kremlin by 1949 had no interest in  further European conquest. By then the possessor of its own  nuclear weapons, it was like all other nuclear powers since  Nagasaki "self-deterred."    The very awesomeness of their destructive force has always  restrained responsible leaders, as Eisenhower admitted in his  memoirs over Korea and Nixon did over Vietnam. Brezhnev and  Andropov were the same.    What makes Zhirinovskiy terrifying is that he breaks the  mould for the first time. He sounds irresponsible enough to  press the button. By the same token, however, traditional  defences do not work. No amount of security guarantees by NATO  can defend Poland, Hungary, or Lithuania from such a man.    The only defence is to prevent him coming to power. He must  be deprived of any chance of turning his fragile 23 per cent  vote into a majority. Not moving NATO's borders just west of  St. Petersburg is one way to do that. Russians also have their  paranoia, and the notion of the world's most powerful military  machine, with the modernised bases and airfields which would  inevitably go with it, planting itself in Poland and Slovakia,  let alone inside the former Soviet Union, is not wanted by  anyone in Russia.    The subtext of Kozyrev's crack at "NATO-centrism" is that  western countries, as well as the states of central and eastern  Europe, must abandon the "block [as published] mentality." For  a few months after he came to power, Yeltsin toyed with joining  NATO. It was partly meant as a dramatic sign that this was a  new and democratic Russia. But it was also a device for  expanding NATO so enormously that it ceased to be NATO.    More recently, Russia has gone back to an old Gorbachev  idea, the notion of merging NATO with the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). As Kozyrev put it in his  brief TV interview this week: "Maybe Russia will join NATO.  Maybe there will be another scenario. NATO will change into  some kind of all-European system." Vyacheslav Kostikov,  Yeltsin's spokesman, has made the same point. "The Russian  President is concerned by the tendency to expand the block [as  published] system. Encouraging it would contradict the declared  intentions of building relations on principles of trust,  partnership and equilibrium," he said.    The speed with which the Zhirinovskiy factor has been used  in  the West, and not just in central and eastern Europe, to whip up  old nightmares about the Russian bear has upset many people in  Moscow. Eastern Europe's emotions are understandable, though  their recourse to old-fashioned remedies will not help. What  matters more to Russians is what the major western leaders feel.    This is the umpteenth U.S.-Russian summit since the cold war  wound down, but it is the first time that Moscow's  decision-makers have not seen their American visitor as a man  who could help them. In a funny way, the new attitude restores  some of the status Russia lost when it ceased to be a  superpower. The Russian elite will be happy if they can give  this new and apparently more receptive American president  something themselves. If Clinton leaves here having learnt  something about Russian complexities and with the conviction  that NATO should not expand geographically but re-think its  entire rationale, Russians will treat his visit as a success.</p>

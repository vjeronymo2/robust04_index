			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 23 (AFP) -- UN General Sir Michael  Rose said Wednesday that close air support of UN soldiers under  attack remained an option in Bosnia despite NATO's failure to  use warplanes to defend Swedish troops.    Five Swedish soldiers of the United Nations Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) were wounded when their convoy of armored personal  carriers was attacked Tuesday near Ribnica in northern Bosnia.    NATO jets were dispatched to defend them but could not  determine exactly whom to fire on since the mortar attack had  come from a front line between Moslems and Serbs, UN officials  said.    Rose, the UN commander for Bosnia, said in a statement read  by his spokesman Wednesday: "Although the aircraft were not used  in the final event it should be made clear to avoid any future  misunderstanding or incident that when UNPROFOR convoys or  personnel are engaged by any armed element they will be given  the authority to engage targets. This may include the use of  air."    The statement said Rose had written to both Serb and Moslem  commanders "to emphasize that his troops continue to exercise  freedom of movement throughout Bosnia. He has also reminded  both sides that UNPROFOR is here to help the people of this  country and that his troops are not here as combatants."    UNPROFOR spokesman Bill Aikman said it was not the first  time  NATO planes had moved in for close air support.    An officer on the staff of the overall UN commander for the  former Yugoslavia, French General Jean Cot, said NATO jets were  near Ribnica and quickly at the confrontation site. But he said  that in the 100-metre (yard) zone in which they isolated the  source of fire, there were both Moslem and Serb positions.    Cot told AFP that since this would have been the first  actual  close air support firing by NATO planes: "We have no right to  make a mistake. Imagine the catastrophe if we had bombed the  wrong side."    Aikman denied reports that Rose had in fact called for air  strikes and was overruled by Cot. He said this was "totally not  the case." He said none of the injuries to the Swedes was  "life-threatening."</p>

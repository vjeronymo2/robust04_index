			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / International Company News: Korean groups set to list on NYSE Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco) and Korea Electric Power (Kepco) are expected next month to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the ministry of finance said yesterday. It is the first move by South Korean companies to seek listings on international markets. The two state-controlled companies, which have tentative approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the NYSE for the listings, will each issue Dollars 300m in depositary receipts. Posco is the world's second largest steelmaker, with net profits of Won295bn (Dollars 368.7m) in 1993. Kepco, meanwhile, is Korea's electricity monopoly and the largest capitalised company on the Seoul bourse, with net profits of Won419bn last year. The Korean government recently announced it would allow Korean companies to list their shares on the New York, London and Tokyo bourses. It is also considering allowing foreign companies to be listed on the Seoul exchange from next year, as part of its financial liberalisation programme. At least nine other Korean companies are considering listing their shares on foreign exchanges from next year. They include Samsung Electronics and its electronics rival Goldstar, Hyundai Motor, Daewoo Corporation, Samsung Heavy Industry, the Lucky and Yukong petrochemical companies, Ssangyong Oil Refining and Ssangyong Cement. The ministry of finance had initially wanted to delay the listing of Posco and Kepco on the New York exchange at least until the end of this year, for fear that a record amount of overseas issues of equity-linked bonds by Korean companies would increase inflationary pressure, as they brought the funds into the country. The ministry recently banned overseas bond issues for the fourth quarter after this year's ceiling of Dollars 1.25bn was reached. However, it has now raised the ceiling to Dollars 1.28bn to accommodate the Posco listing. It has also allowed Kepco to replace a planned Dollars 300m bond issue with the depository receipts, so it could acquire the New York listing.</p>

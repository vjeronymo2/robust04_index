Gubkin and Gas Processing Scientific  Research Institute; UDC 66.097.3]    [Abstract] Catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides to  elemental nitrogen by various gases used as reducing agents is a  much more promising way of recovering nitrogen oxides than  conventional absorption and adsorption methods. Noble metals  (i.e., platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, etc.) may serve  as catalysts in selective reduction processes; however, their  high cost and scarcity have spawned the search for cheaper  alternatives. Noble metal oxides on different carriers and  variable-valence metal oxides may be used as catalysts in  nonselective reduction processes. In view of these facts, a  study was undertaken to find effective non-noble  metal-containing catalysts that could be used to reduce nitrogen  oxides with natural gas. The experiments were performed in a  continuous reactor unit with a stationary catalyst layer at  temperatures of 250-590C with a space velocity of 3,000/h  and CH[.sup]4[/]:NO[.sub]x[/] ratio of 10:1. The content  of nitrogen oxides in the gas mixture at the reactor entrance  and exit was determined by the calorimetric method and by  gas-liquid chromatography. Eight catalysts were tested: STK,  GIAP-8, NTK-10-1, NTK-10, nickel-chromium, palladized carbon,  GIAP-16, and carbon-modified STK. With the exception of GIAP-8,  all of the catalysts tested manifested a high catalytic activity  during the nitrogen oxide recovery process. The main products of  the reduction reaction were nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide.  A side reaction of methane and oxygen also occurred. The study  established that most metal oxide-based commercial catalysts  (i.e., with the exception of GIAP-8) may be used to virtually  totally remove nitrogen oxides from gas mixtures at  290-590C provided that the said gas mixture does not  contain more than 3 weight percent oxygen. When greater amounts  of oxygen are present, it is necessary to first remove the  oxygen from the gas mixture by, for example, using a two-stage  reactor. Tables 3; references 4 (Russian).</p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian group still in PNG mine talks Mr Paias Wingti, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, said yesterday that Mr John Kaputin, the country's mining minister, had been told to 'pursue discussions with the Malaysian Mining Corporation', over the large Lihir mining project. Last night, Mr Wingti's office declined to comment further on the implications of this statement. It followed a presentation on the status of the Lihir project by Mr Kaputin to PNG's National Executive Council. This covered 'the present status of the project, the Lihir joint venture partners' plans for developing a mine on Lihir, as well as unresolved issues, including landowners' demands'. The joint venture partners in the project, which envisages development of a large gold mine on one of the islands within the New Ireland group, are Britain's RTZ and Niugini Mining, a PNG-registered company quoted in Australia and in which Battle Mountain Gold has a majority interest. Their original plan was to divide shares in Lihir Gold, the holding company for the project, three ways - giving RTZ a 40 per cent stake, Niugini Mining, 30 per cent and the PNG government the remaining 30 per cent. Those stakes would then have been diluted by a flotation of Lihir shares, which could have raised upwards of Dollars 300m. However, at the end of 1993, ministerial positions were shuffled in PNG and the necessary special mining lease for Lihir has yet to be granted. There is thought to be debate within the PNG government over whether the state-owned MMC should be allowed into the project at an early stage. The original plan envisaged that MMC might acquire a significant interest, but only through the flotation process.</p>

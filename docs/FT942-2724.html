			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian government plans rice export 'thrust' - Efforts to increase the country's 5 per cent share of the world market The Indian federal government, assured of comfortable food stocks, has decided to work hand in hand with the trade to promote the export of rice. Although India has the largest area under rice and it is the second biggest producer of the cereal after China, its share in the current year's projected world trade of 14.5m tonnes of rice will be less than 5 per cent. According to the All India Rice Exporters Association, however, the country's export earnings from rice should be up to Rs25bn (Pounds 524m) by the turn of the century from about Rs12bn in the year to March 1994. The designation of rice as a 'thrust export commodity' and the series of measures taken by the government to facilitate export has made the turn of the century target achievable, say trade sources. The more important export enabling steps that the government has recently taken include the removal of the minimum export price (MEP) for basmati rice (a superfine, extra long aromatic variety), reduction in phases of the MEP for the non-basmati rice to improve its competitiveness in the world market and the abolition of the export quota for the non-basmati varieties. Meanwhile, the commerce ministry has accepted the suggestion of the exporters' association that an export promotion council for rice should be set up. Its constitution, according to traders, will give a 'direction to the growth in Indian rice export. We must know the changing consumer preferences in the traditional and new markets. One of the main tasks of the council will be to disseminate market information among the exporters'. India's rice exports grew to Rs12bn in 1993-94 from Rs3.52bn in 1987-88 without a proper marketing strategy. But until then India had largely relied upon the export of basmati rice, for which its only significant competitor is Pakistan. Basmati constitutes less than 10 per cent of the total amount of rice traded in the world market. Of the total, about 42m hectares under rice in India (less than 800,000 tonnes) - in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - are committed to the basmati variety. Indian production of basmati ranges from 600,000 tonnes to 650,000 tonnes a year. Last year's exports are estimated at 400,000 tonnes, of which 75 per cent went to the Middle East. Mr EA Siddiq, project director of the Indian Directorate of Rice Research, has sounded a note of caution that in spite of its special attributes, basmati rice is 'becoming less acceptable in the traditional markets and it is often rejected in the western market due to the failure to conform to the quality norms.' He said that complaints regarding the quality of basmati can be tackled, provided that this special rice was put into two broad categories based on the grain length - grade one comprising grains 7mm long and above and grade two between 6.5mm and 6.9mm. Traders have said it should be possible to sell larger quantities of basmati in Europe, the US and Canada, which are now small markets. According to the exporters' association, there is scope for promoting long grain basmati in Japan as a 'gourmet food'. The special Indian rice attracted some good enquiries at the recently held Foodex Japan. There is a growing consensus, however, that increases in Indian rice exports will have to come mainly from the non-basmati varieties, which last year accounted for only about 160,000 tonnes. According to the exporters' association, the gradual reduction in farm and export subsidies and the minimum access opportunities for agricultural products that are envisaged under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will improve India's rice export prospects. Besides basmati rice, India produces high quality long grain, medium quality long grain, short grain and glutinous rice. It is in a position, therefore, to exploit a number of markets. As for non-basmati rice, the market that India is targeting specifically, it is in Africa where the demand for broken rice is growing and the exporters' association considers that continent to be the 'best bet' for Indian rice exporters. As part of their effort to achieve a bigger share of the world trade in rice, Indian exporters have started making 'substantial investment' in rice mills with state-of-the-art graders, sorters and polishers. Another encouraging development is the entry of big houses like Hindustan Lever and ITC, the Indian associate of BAT Industries, in India's rice export sector.</p>

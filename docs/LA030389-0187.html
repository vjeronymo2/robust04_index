			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COLUMBUS 500 RACE CANCELED  </P> <P> The Columbus 500 sports car race scheduled for Oct. 1 was canceled today by  International Motor Sports Assn. officials after promoters were unable to save  the financially troubled event.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, all of the people behind the scenes came close, but could not  manage to put all of the pieces together to have a race this year," IMSA  Executive Vice President Mark Raffauf said. The race was to be run on a  2.3-mile course in the streets of downtown Columbus.  </P> <P> IMSA officials are reviewing options to fill the open date.  </P> <P> The Columbus street race began in 1985. However, the race was reportedly deeply  in debt, and the Columbus City Council Thursday voted down a request by the  promoters for a $350,000 debt reduction bond 7 to 0.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The popular organizations and trade unions in Syria  have condemned the Israeli massacre perpetrated at the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque. They emphasized this massacre was the result  of an organized, premeditated, and planned act. This is proven  by the mass killings and acts of violence which continued after  this terrible massacre at the hands of the Israeli occupation  troops in several areas of the occupied territories.    In a statement issued today, the popular organizations and  trade unions said this abominable crime is not new to the  aggressive nature of the Israeli settlers and soldiers. This  crime was intended to terrorize Arab residents as a prelude to  evacuating and annexing Arab land as part of the Israeli policy  of expansion and hegemony.    The statement noted Israel's racist rancor and terrorist  record, which is replete with mass massacres, including the  massacres of Dayr Yasin, Qibyah, Kafr Qasim, Bahr al-Baqar,  Da'il, and southern Lebanon. The statement added that the  Hebron massacre confirms the dangers posed by continued Israeli  occupation of Arab territories and the presence of settlements  in them. Both the occupation and settlements violate all  international laws, norms, and resolutions.    The statement emphasized that this heinous massacre shows  that Israel's intransigence and procrastination in the peace  talks instigate acts of violence. This makes Israel responsible  for extremism and terrorism in the region.    The statement reiterated that the Syrian people,  organizations, and trade unions support the Palestinian Arab  people and our kinsfolk in the Golan and southern Lebanon in  their struggle to liberate every inch of Arab territory and to  regain the Palestinian people's legitimate rights.    The statement added that the popular organizations and trade  unions -- which were established under the sponsorship and care  of leader struggler Hafiz al-Asad and which are experienced in  adherence to rights as their policy and in sticking to  consistent positions as their principle -- stress that the path  of capitulation, sellout of rights, and chasing the mirage of  partial and deceptive solutions cannot produce peace.    The statement urged the international community, the  Security  Council, and the United Nations to end the policy of double  standards and assume their humanitarian responsibility to  confront the logic of Israeli hegemony. It urged these bodies  to pressure Israel into complying with international legitimacy,  which specifies the principles of a just and comprehensive peace  and guarantees security in the region.</p>

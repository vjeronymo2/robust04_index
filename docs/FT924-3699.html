			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Property: Going it alone in Portugal's villa market - A look at a scheme for buyers with design ideas of their own rather than buying a resale or a property on a large development - is a popular option in many parts of Portugal. One firm which caters for this market is Portogoa, which is based in Lagos, in the centre of the western Algarve. It offers a large portfolio of plots and a comprehensive design and building service. Maintenance and letting can be arranged through an agent, if required. The company's three directors are Graham Fone, an English civil engineer with a consulting background; Paul Loughlin, an Irish civil engineer with a contracting background (they met while working in Saudi Arabia), and Francisco da Silva, formerly involved in the property market in the US. After seven years working in the Middle East, Fone returned to his native Devon. But 'one wet summer, and that was enough,' he says. Spending a year touring warmer places, he met da Silva in the Algarve, where they saw an opening for a company which built villas. Loughlin was brought in and the company was formed in 1988. 'As a construction company, we offer a complete package,' says Fone. 'We carry a large portfolio of building plots, a range of villa designs that we can adjust to suit personal requirements and a professional construction team that can handle all the building work.' The plots are mostly in the western Algarve and all have planning permission. The price of inland sites start at about Pounds 20,000, prices for plots with sea views start from Pounds 50,000. Depending on size, plot prices can go up to Pounds 250,000. The lowest total price for a two-bedroom property with land, which might be as much as an acre in an inland area such as Silves, could be below Pounds 100,000. But Portogoa tends to cater more for the upper market and top prices depend on how much house and land the buyer wants and in what location. Portogoa has its own architect who works from a series of basic villa designs on which clients can begin to build their own requirements. A starting point might be the Casa Monchique design for a large, four-bedroom villa with multi-level roof. Ground floor rooms open off an atrium and the dining and living rooms have covered terraces. Three of the bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms are at this level. The master bedroom, with its bathroom, study and square open terrace, is on the first floor. The cost of construction of a design on these lines, excluding land, would be about Pounds 166,000. A swimming pool would be an additional Pounds 16,000. Building takes eight to 12 months, depending on the size of the property. But what advantages are there in buying from companies such as Portogoa, rather than big developers? Fone says smaller companies have fewer overheads, a saving they are able to pass on to customers. Buyers also have a choice of plot, design and materials and do not face annual management charges that are usually levied on an estate. Portogoa (Lagos tel: 082-341035) has agents in nine countries, including Surrey-based Grainger Properties (0276-855292), which can handle management and letting for owners. Fone says that, at present, about 60 per cent of Portogoa's clients are German, 25 per cent British. Others are Dutch, Swiss and Austrian.</p>

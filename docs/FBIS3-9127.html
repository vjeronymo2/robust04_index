The parliament of Yugoslavia's Republic of Serbia on  Thursday  endorsed a new cabinet, headed by Marjanovic. The cabinet  includes five vice-premiers, 20 departmental ministers and four  ministers without portfolio.    Marjanovic said in Serbian television's prime-time news  programme that the new government would act immediately and felt  confident that they would manage to maintain the national  currency, the dinar, stable and boost production.    This is only the beginning, and any substantial economic  recovery should be left for later, he added.    Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) has lost 25 million dollars  through U.N. sanctions clamped two years ago for the country's  alleged involvement in Bosnia's civil war.    The figure would be much higher if the total cost had been  calculated of manitaining the 600,000 refugees from the  war-zones registered in Yugoslavia, 95 percent of whom have been  accommodated with private families.</p>

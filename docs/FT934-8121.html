			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Business and the Environment: Spotlight on UK plants Biodiversity is one of the great rallying cries of the green movement. Everyone feels intuitively that it is important to preserve as many types of plant and animal as possible - but there has been little direct evidence so far to show how the loss of species would harm the environment. Now, however, ecologists at Imperial College's Centre for Population Biology at Silwood Park, Berkshire, are beginning to fill the experimental gap. John Lawton, director of the centre, says it is already clear that the variety of species in a biological community has a big impact on the way it functions. 'We can no longer ignore serious threats to key ecological processes, posed by the loss of biodiversity.' The work is taking place in the Ecotron, a Pounds 1m research laboratory containing 16 separate climate-controlled chambers. Each is a two-metre cube with its own community, set up to model British grassland. There are wild plants (varying from two to 16 species per chamber), insects and soil organisms. 'What we did was mimic the loss of species currently being caused by human impacts on ecosystems, but under controlled conditions,' Lawton says. Preliminary results show that biodiversity has a big impact on plant growth, absorption of carbon dioxide, soil chemistry, water cycle and microclimate. The Ecotron - funded by the Natural Environment Research Council with a Pounds 250,000 annual grant - provides climate control over light, temperature, humidity and rainfall. It enables scientists to mimic ecosystems while carrying out controlled experiments that would be impractical in field studies. Although it is far smaller than the Biosphere II in Arizona, the Ecotron is a more powerful research tool because its separate chambers allow experiments to be replicated and the results verified by statistical analysis.</p>

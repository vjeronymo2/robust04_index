			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses recover after four days of decline THE broadly-based gain in bourses yesterday followed four days of decline, and coincided with hopes of interest rate cuts in a number of capitals, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS ended just short of its best after late arbitrage buying reinforced the positive effect of firmer bonds and the franc's rise to a one-month high against the D-Mark. The CAC-40 index rose 20.65, or 1.05 per cent to 1,995.33 in turnover of about FFr2.2bn. It was not all one-way traffic. Carrefour, the hypermarket retailer, rose FFr63 to FFr2698 up after its March sales figures showed a rise of 12.9 per cent. However, Pechiney International, in packaging and aeronautical parts, fell FFr10.50 to FFr220.50 on an 11 per cent drop in 1992 operating profits. Looking ahead, Alcatel rose FFr9 to FFr671 on expectations of a 12 per cent rise in net profits today. A drop in Thomson-CSF profits came after the market closed, and the shares ended only 70 centimes down at FFr166.50. FRANKFURT balanced a firmer bond market, and buying of BMW and Volkswagen against poor results and prospects from Daimler. The DAX index closed 6.71 higher at 1,665.40 as turnover rose from DM4.7bn to DM5.9bn. Daimler dropped 2.4 per cent as its DVFA earnings fell from DM55.40 a share to DM29.60 for 1992. The shares closed DM14.50 lower at DM580.50 with Mercedes, still closing the gap which will disappear when the two companies are merged, DM10.50 down at DM564. BMW and VW rose by DM4.90 to DM315.90, and DM14 to DM488 respectively. There was a theory that with the amalgamation of Mercedes stock, investors will want to reduce potentially overweight Daimler holdings and plump for the other two majors instead. In steels, Thyssen rose DM4.50 to DM179, following recent strength in Krupp Hoesch, on a blue skies view of recovery prospects if the German steel industry is restructered, perhaps into only three major suppliers. AMSTERDAM, looking to Germany to give an interest rate lead, moved ahead although trading was thin and small deals were enough to lift prices. The CBS Tendency index added 1.3 to 108.0. Chemical stocks were bought partly on options-related interest, with DSM rising Fl 2.60 to Fl 87.20 and Akzo up Fl 1.90 to Fl 150.50. Unilever was the only blue-chip to end lower, losing Fl 1.10 to Fl 209.10 amid rumours that some UK brokerages have downgraded the stock. Pakhoed, the tank storage company, fell Fl 2.10 to Fl 38.60 after a drop in 1992 earnings and a forecast of lower profits for 1993. MILAN saw renewed buying by foreign investors and short-covering by domestic traders ahead of the Easter weekend. The Comit index rose 6.98 to 485.55. Mutual funds data for March, which showed a net inflow of L358bn into equities after February's L15bn outflow, also boosted sentiment. Blue chips were among the main beneficiaries. Fiat fixed L30 lower at L5,670 but firmed to L5,790 on the kerb while Generali fixed L410 higher at L33,700 and rose to L34,475 after-hours. Pirelli added L32 to L1,371 in response to Monday's sale of its stake in Continental. Telecommunications stocks continued to be bolstered by plans to restructure the sector and privatisation candidates were also firm. ZURICH moved back into record territory with investors encouraged by lower money market rates and the firmer tone of the dollar. The SMI index rose 12.1 to an all-time high of 2,196.0. The general mood improved by an inflation rate of 3.6 per cent while lower interest rates helped the banks. MADRID extended its gentle downward correction to a fifth day, the general index closing 0.60 lower at 236.68 against a year's high of 241.50 a week earlier. One Madrid trader said that political concerns about the ruling Socialist party are beginning to weigh on Spain's equity and bond markets. BRUSSELS closed off its mid-afternoon highs as the oil major, Petrofina, which rose 2.5 per cent in mid-afternoon on takeover speculation, saw a late sell-off which limited the gain to BFr180, or 1.7 per cent at BFr8,980. The Bel-20 index closed 10.79 higher at 1,266.83. Petrofina was boosted by plans to narrow its stake declaration threshhold from 5 to 3 per cent, soon after news that the French oil group, Elf Aquitaine, had bought a stake of less than 5 per cent. VIENNA went back on the upgrade, the ATX index rising 9.28, or 1.2 per cent to 778.31 although traders said that the rise was mainly technical, and in thin volume. OSLO rose 1.5 per cent, helped by lower interest rates and strength in the dollar against the Norwegian crown, the all-share index closing 6.73 higher at 447.79 in turnover of NKr254.4m. HELSINKI saw continued strong gains in Nokia, the technology group, FM6 higher at FM148 following Monday's news of a large order from Germany. The Hex index rose 17.8, or 1.7 per cent to 1,048.7, up 25 per cent in local currency terms this year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 6                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1143.38    1143.01    1143.84    1145.10 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1209.81    1209.11    1210.33    1210.36  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1145.35    1146.40    1148.41    1147.43 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1210.45    1210.68    1211.32    1210.05  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Apr 5     Apr 2     Apr 1     Mar 31    Mar 30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1136.15   1140.36   1144.81   1149.13   1152.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1202.24   1215.52   1219.86   1220.16   1219.87  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1148.73 ; 200 -  1212.74 Low/day: 100 -  1142.88  200 -  1208.59 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: De La Rue steps in Market speculation turned to fact as De La Rue confirmed that it was the mystery predator which had approached paper manufacturer Portals, the announcement speeding the two companies' shares in opposite directions. Portals continued its upward momentum, first seen a week ago, with the shares ending another busy session 40 ahead at 805p, making a net gain of 28 per cent over the past week. In contrast, De La Rue dropped 21 to 857p on fears that the bank note printer may have to pay too high a premium to secure Portals, and worries over how it would be financed. A mixture of cash - the company has around Pounds 250m - and paper was thought the most likely avenue. With Portals having a solid reputation in the City as a well run profitable company, many analysts felt that the premium that an agreed merger would require would be too high a price to pay, while a hostile bid was deemed a non-starter. A bid price of Pounds 9 a share was being mooted late yesterday, a figure which would put Portals on a price/earnings ratio of 21 on 1995 earnings forecasts, a hefty 70 per cent premium to the market. Others also questioned De La Rue's timing, with the paper and printing market well off the bottom of a year ago. Full-year figures from brewing and retailing group Whitbread met market forecasts, although the shares ran into profit-takers and slid 9 to 563p. Drinks specialists blamed the fall, as well as weakness in some of the other stocks yesterday, on the good run in the sector recently, as well as on the lack of scintillating news needed to maintain the momentum. Bass, which reports tomorrow, was one such casualty, retreating 17 to 550p. Greenalls suffered a similar fate, losing 9 at 440p. Speculation continued to surround the Guinness share price, with suggestions that LVMH, its French partner, may use the options market to offload some of its Guinness shares ahead of the agm on Thursday. The French group has agreed to reduce its holding in Guinness from 24 to 20 per cent by June next year. Guinness receded 6 to 490p. The overall weakness in the market took its toll of the banks sector, where most of the business involved heavy switching from National Westminster into Barclays. The latter ended a net 3 off at 537p on hefty turnover of 4.5m, while the former fell 14 to 449p on 3.9m traded. The switching operation was said to have triggered additional straight selling of NatWest. Abbey National was recommended by one of the big integrated houses and initially edged up to 407p before slipping back to close marginally easier at 402p. General Accident was the outstanding performer in composite insurances, the shares adding 9 at 568p. A switching operation out of Prudential, 2 off at 305p, and into Legal &amp; General left the latter 5 stronger at 455p. National Power was the star performer in the utilities sector, responding to recommendations both new and in the recent past from various broking firms. SG Warburg Securities issued a strong buy note on NatPower and PowerGen late last week, while Lehman Brothers, the US brokerage house, and James Capel, the leading UK agency broker, were said to have given the stock a big push yesterday. At the close NatPower shares were 15 higher at 443p after good turnover of 2.6m. PowerGen appreciated 10 to 475p. The Scottish generators, on the other hand, were hit by profit-taking, Scottish Power retreating 10 to 368p. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel remained under a cloud in spite of a company denial that it faced a deadline at midnight yesterday to secure further bank loans from Japanese bank creditors. The shares relinquished 12 to 420p on these financial concerns, and with sentiment further weakened by reports that the well-flagged rights issue would be announced today. But several analysts discounted such a likelihood today. The company yesterday announced that the first fare-paying freight service through the tunnel will begin on Thursday, and forecast it will have 50 per cent of cross-channel car and coach service by 1996. News of the start of operations at Eurotunnel and optimism on traffic levels damaged sentiment in P&amp;O, the ferry operator. The shares gave up 10 to 690p in trade of 1.9m. Rolls-Royce rose 6 to 188p in hefty trading of 7.7m, with US investment bank Lehman Brothers said to have been among the day's big buyers. Profit-taking left British Aerospace 10 lighter at 493p. The company said the total of overseas owners of its shares had exceeded 29.5 per cent, the permitted limit under its articles of association. Foreign owners that last acquired the stock will now be forced to sell the shares to reduce the total to the permitted figure. Buoyant metal prices continued to boost international mining group RTZ and the shares gained a further 7 at 865p. Press speculation on the National Lottery helped Rank Organisation, which is in a consortium believed to be one of the front runners. The shares added 5 at 408p. NatWest Securities reiterated its positive stance on Boots, up 5 at 549p, and Storehouse, ahead 2 at 219p.</p>

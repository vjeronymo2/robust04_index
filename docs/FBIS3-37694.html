"This decision was made in answer to Slovakia's request," a  senior member of Russia's Foreign Ministry told Interfax.    The coalition government of Vladimir Meciar "is going  through  a crisis", he explained. "Evidently this is not the best time  for a visit," he added.    According to the diplomat, initially the capital of Slovakia  was to be the first point of Kozyrev's European tour. However,  because of the aggravation of tensions in and around  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Russia's foreign minister began his tour  with Athens, to confer with the European Union's "group of  three": the foreign ministers of Greece, Belgium and Germany --  the European Union's current, previous and subsequent chairmen.    As Interfax's interviewee noted, from Athens Kozyrev went to  Prague, and, on Monday morning, to Budapest. The head of  Russian diplomacy is expected to spend two days (Monday and  Tuesday) in the Hungarian capital. The next point of his tour  will be Krakow, where Kozyrev and his Polish counterpart,  Andrzej Olchowski, will attend a conference on the  Russian-Polish relationship on the road to a new partnership.    Kozyrev is expected to return to Moscow on Wednesday.    "However Kozyrev may make some changes in the program of his  tour. It's quite possible that he will suspend it in order to  visit Bonn, where consultations on the ways to reach a  settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be held on Tuesday," the  diplomat said.    The foreign minister's secretariat confirmed that Kozyrev  had  postponed his trip to Bratislava. "As for Bonn, his deputy,  Vitaly Churkin, who was in Sarajevo, went there on Monday. So  far Kozyrev is not expected to pay a blitzvisit to Bonn," a  member of his secretariat said.</p>

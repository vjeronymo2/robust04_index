			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Peru rebel leader gets life Peru's highest military court has upheld the life sentence imposed on Shining Path leader Mr Abimael Guzman, AP reports from Lima. The decision late on Wednesday by the Supreme Military Tribunal turned down the second and last appeal allowed to Mr Guzman's defence, ending any minimal hope he might have held for finding a legal loophole to freedom. In a communique, the military said Guzman will serve his sentence, without possibility for parole, on the island of San Lorenzo.</p>

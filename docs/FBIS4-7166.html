			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday said he was  sure last Saturday's bomb explosion at Nakhon Si Thammarat  railway station was an act of subversion to destroy the  Government but admitted he had no hard evidence pointing to any  particular group.    "Personally, I believe this might be the work of a  subversive  group out to sabotage the Government by terrorising the public,  even though we do not have enough evidence to specify which  group was responslble," he sald.    Mr Chuan said he was waiting for a detailed report from the  Police Department and needed a concise investigation result  before he would comment on the incident.    The Premier said there were several differing opinions among  senior police involved in the case so it was important not to  confuse and frighten the public with speculation or rumour.    He said he had given strict orders to officials to be  extremely careful in their investigations and preventive  measures, especially now when there are rumours of bomb threats  in the South as well as- in Bangkok.    Meanwhile yesterday the Interior Ministry decided to improve  its operation centre to counter subversive activities in the  country.    The decision was made at a closeddoor meeting of the  National  Civil Defence Committee chaired by Interior Minister Chavalit  Yongchaiyudh.    The meeting agreed to provide the centre with more manpower  and a bigger budget to boost its capacity in  intelligence-gathering to prevent acts of sabotage, said centre  chief Ari Wong-araya, who is also Permanent Secretary for  Interior.    Mr Ari said the meeting yesterday also decided to recruit  the  support of members of various organisations including village  scouts to help serve as the "eyes and ears" of the Government to  prevent acts of sabotage.    He said the Government was understaffed and without the help  of these volunteers to help report on possible sabotage attempts  the effort could fail.    Police Department chief Prathin Santipraphop insisted  yesterday the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station bombing was an  act of personal vengeance and not a politically-motivated act.    He emphasised his theory was based on information obtained  by  investigators handling the case and was not a baseless  assumption.    "Other persons who are speaking from their own assumption  should not offer comments as this will only add more to public  confusion," Pol Gen Pratin said.    Police Department deputy chief Vinit Charoensiri said  yesterday, however, investigators probing the attack have three  separate theories: a love conflict, a political conflict and  terrorism by separatists.</p>

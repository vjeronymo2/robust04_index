			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The week started very quietly with few transactions being reported. Where there has been dealing, the bias remains towards buying, with two companies having open offers. Directors at both Computer People and EFT Group took the opportunity afforded by the new stock to increase their existing holdings. Largest sale of the week was at Camellia Group, the agriculture and financial service provision company. David Bacon, managing director, sold 5,000 shares at Pounds 25.50p. The sale accounted for over 5 per cent of his holding, leaving him with 89,000 shares. Shortly before the closed period at the end of March another director, Donald Green, a non-executive, also sold stock. Asprey, the jewellers, featured recently when John Asprey, the chairman, sold 375,000 shares at 306p. His total stake accounts for 50 per cent of the company so relatively the sale was not significant. This time Timothy Cooper, who manages the Bond Street branch of operations, exercised 35,740 options and then sold them all. The company is anticipated to show pre-tax profits growth of 18 per cent over the next year. Relatively, the share price is underperforming the market. Filofax, the personal organiser people, has also featured on this list before. Richard Koch, the non-executive holder of over 2m shares - 8 per cent - of the company, continues buying with two separate purchases of 10,000 shares at 186p and 30,000 shares at 203p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 No of Company                     Sector      Shares    Value     directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Asprey                       RetG       35,740   112,938        1* Betterware                   RetG       32,500    23,400        1 Camellia                     OthF        5,000   127,500        1 Dalepak Foods                FdMa       26,342    23,708        1 Forte                        L&amp;Hl       25,000    58,000        1* McKay Securities             Prop       10,000    19,000        1 Morland &amp; Co                 Brew        4,000    19,200        1 PEX Group                    Text    2,000,000    10,000        1 Town Centre Secs             Prop       10,000    11,800        1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 3i Group                     InvT       22,000    59,840        4 Carlton Cmtns                Mdia        3,500    31,295        2 Charter (incl. loan stock)    DivI        2,851    17,282        4 Community Hsptl              Hlth        5,000    11,650        1 Comptr People (open offer)   SSer      382,400   604,192        2 Dalepak Foods                FdMa       61,342    59,502        3 EFT Group (open offer)       OthF      262,330   128,542        4 Filofax Group                OS&amp;B       40,000    79,500        1 McKay Securities             Prop       10,000    19,000        1 Microgen Holdings            SSer       24,705    32,117        1 Mosaic Investment            PP&amp;P       70,000    18,900        2 West Trust                   FdMa       75,000    27,750        1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

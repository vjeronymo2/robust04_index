			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Revenue consults on Finance Bill THE INLAND Revenue yesterday invited comments on two draft clauses for the next Finance Bill. The clauses deal with the tax treatment of insolvent groups of companies and are designed to close loopholes on rights to profits for shareholders when a company is being wound up, and on charges to companies which leave a group during insolvency proceedings. The new legislation follows the defeat of the Revenue last year in a Court of Appeal case against J. Sainsbury, the retailer. It would be effective from November 15 last year.</p>

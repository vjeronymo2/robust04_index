			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be amended to clarify that designation and adjustment of allotment boundaries include the authority for, and the practice of, combining or dividing allotments when determined by the authorized officer to be necessary to achieve resource condition objectives or to enhance administrative efficiency. This section includes changes in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking to clarify that modification of allotments must be done through agreement or decision of the authorized officer, and to make clear that the interested public would be involved in the designation or adjustment of allotment boundaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.3&blank;Changes in Permitted Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be amended by replacing the term ``grazing preference'' with ``permitted use,'' and by clarifying that changes in permitted use shall be supported by monitoring data, field observations, land use planning decisions, or data collected through other studies. This section includes changes made in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.3&hyph;1&blank;Increasing Permitted Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be revised by including the requirement that a permittee or lessee, or other applicant has been determined to be qualified under subpart 4110, by substituting the term ``permitted use'' in place of ``grazing preference,'' and by clarifying the requirements for consultation. Also, reference to a permittee's or lessee's demonstrated stewardship would be added to factors to be considered in allocating available forage. This section includes changes made in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.3&hyph;2&blank;Decreasing permitted grazing use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be amended by revising the heading, revising paragraph (b) to expand the list of methods for determining when a reduction in grazing use is necessary, and by deleting paragraph (c). The amendment would add to monitoring ecological site inventory and other recognized methods for determining forage production as methods of identifying when use exceeds the livestock carrying capacity of the area considered. The amendment would also add a reference to national requirements and standards and guidelines. Under this section the authorized officer would be required to take or approve corrective action when grazing use or patterns of use result in less than properly functioning conditions of the ecosystem, as established by the proposed national requirements and standards and guidelines and identified through monitoring or field observations, or when use exceeds the livestock carrying capacity. The BLM Technical Reference 4400&hyph;5 (Rangeland Inventory and Monitoring Supplemental Studies) describes acceptable methodologies for estimating forage production. The revised section would allow the use of other acceptable methods to estimate rangeland carrying capacity to be used as the basis for making initial adjustments in grazing use. Subsequent adjustments could be made as monitoring data are collected and analyzed. The amendment would therefore allow more responsive action when use or patterns of use result in a failure to meet resource condition objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section includes changes made in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4110.3&hyph;3&blank;Implementing reductions in Permitted Use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would rename the section, would remove existing paragraph (a) and other requirements for phased-in reductions in grazing use, and would amend existing paragraph (b) to remove the terms ``consultation, coordination and cooperation,'' and ``suspension of preference'' and add in their place the terms ``consultation'' and ``reductions in grazing use,'' respectively, and provide, by way of reference to &sect;4110.3&hyph;2, for the application of national requirements and standards and guidelines and the use of other methods, in addition to monitoring, for determining the need for an initial reduction. The change in the heading is intended to describe the section more accurately. The removal of existing paragraph (a) and other requirements for phased reductions in use would allow more responsive correction of situations where grazing use exceeds carrying capacity. Removing the phased implementation requirement would not prohibit agreements or decisions that would allow phased reductions in use. The cross reference to other methods of estimating forage production and identifying and the use of monitoring or field observations to identify when grazing use or patterns of use are not consistent with the national requirements or standards and guidelines, or grazing use is otherwise causing an unacceptable level or pattern of utilization, would also allow more responsive action to improve the rangeland condition. The Department does not intend that extended monitoring would be necessary to begin needed adjustment of use. The removal of the term ``coordination and cooperation'' would result in a more precise statement of the requirements placed on the authorized officer. The statutory requirement of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1752), as amended by section 8 of the Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978, for consultation, coordination, and cooperation applies to the development, revision, and termination of allotment management plans. Existing paragraph (c) would be redesignated as paragraph (b) and would be amended to remove the word ``temporary'' because it implies only one season while the influences of natural events such as drought could significantly affect vegetation health and productivity for several months or years after a drought has passed. Other minor amendments clarify the action of the field manager and retain the special provisions for making ``emergency'' decisions effective. This section includes changes made in addition to those presented in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (2): To those that have - The leading managers LINDSAY Tomlinson, UK investment chief at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, is waiting for the giants of the balanced pension funds investment business to crack. His company, an offshoot of Barclays Bank, is the UK leader in index fund management, with portfolios worth nearly Pounds 10bn linked via computer programmes to the All-Share and various other UK and international stock and bond market indices. 'Over the past three or four years the industry has polarised on four or five top managers,' he says. 'It only needs one or two of them to fall over, and you will find that a group of trustees will move towards indexation.' It is a fact that a handful of managers is winning almost all the new business. According to the newsletter Global Money Management, the top mandate winner in 1991 was Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management, with about Pounds 1.4bn net. Mercury Asset Management, easily the biggest in terms of existing funds under management, pulled in another Pounds 1.2bn. Schroder received Pounds 0.7bn and Gartmore over Pounds 0.5bn, confirming its position as the industry's current rising star. In the past four years, Gartmore has leapt from nowhere to eighth in the FT's annual league table of UK pension funds under management. Mr David Watts, head of pension funds at Gartmore, reports that the new mandate scene is quite busy, despite the greater concentration in the market-place. 'We have not seen the volume of new enquiries going down recently,' he says. This year Gartmore has picked up a new balanced mandate worth Pounds 125m from Northamptonshire County Council. Few managers are fortunate enough to be able to report much activity, however. Most managers in the list are losing clients, and the overall scene is likely to be quiet this year as trustees focus on the security and governance questions arising from the Maxwell pension funds scandal. Still, there is currently a so-called externalisation under way, as the previously internally managed Universities Superannuation Scheme seeks two to four external managers. Several local authorities besides Northants are also revising their arrangements, a round of restructuring that reflects the breakdown of the old relationships between local authorities and stockbrokers that were characteristic of the pre-Big Bang era. How far can the polarisation of pension fund investment around a handful of managers go? Five years ago, the then top four accounted for 41 per cent of the funds managed by the top 20. Now the proportion is 51 per cent. The trend has yet to change. And, while BZWIM may hope that the pacesetters will falter, the beneficiaries might not just be the index fund managers. There is a whole group of management companies which hope to improve their performance and get back into a position where they can start winning significant numbers of mandates again. An example is Prudential Portfolio Managers, which had a poor couple of years for performance in 1989 and 1990 but picked up speed again in 1991 when it claimed a 21.8 per cent return, against the Caps median of 18.6 per cent (excluding property). Others with good performance numbers for 1991 included Baring, Henderson and Lazard, but it takes more than one good year to get back on to the short lists, let alone to start winning new mandates. Another top City name which would like to claw its way back up the table is Robert Fleming. It achieved an above-median performance in 1991 through an emphasis on UK blue chips. Like Henderson, Fleming suffered a few years ago from becoming too big too quickly; but, according to its investment boss, Mr Iain Saunders, a new structure in the investment department is working smoothly. In 1991, he says, 'the emphasis was on increasing the level of discipline in investment management.' Across the industry, fund managers wait eagerly to see if the industry leader, Mercury Asset Management, will falter. It appears to have had an indifferent year for performance in 1991, although only hearsay evidence is available because MAM refuses to disclose its performance - a policy it has stuck to in the past, even when the numbers have generally been good. The number two house, PDFM, also dipped slightly below median performance last year, although it is not unusual for PDFM to underperform in conditions of high average returns and more than make it up in more difficult years. As an industry giant, MAM is under pressure to move ahead of the herd. Moreover MAM cannot hope to deliver the same consistency of performance to all its client funds as can a smaller manager. Still, it has always managed to please most of its clients and disappoint its competitors in the past. Yet little is predictable in the fickle business of pension fund investment management. Look at the varying performances of two Scottish independents, Murray Johnstone in Glasgow losing significant numbers of clients, but Baillie Gifford in Edinburgh powering ahead with a 40 per cent jump in assets under management. As the industry giants get even bigger, there is certainly scope for well-managed and well-marketed smaller houses to find their niches. 'We are seen as an interesting alternative,' says Mr Jimmy West, chief executive of Lazard Investors, part of the City merchant bank. He can offer features such as 'tight dispersion' - that is, all the funds perform closely in line - which the big managers find harder. 'I think a lot of people are now looking for a house with a more individual style,' he says. A lot of other bosses of smaller pension fund management firms hope so, too. But not Mr Tomlinson at BZWIM.</p>

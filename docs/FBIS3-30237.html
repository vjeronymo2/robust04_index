			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrzej Drzycimski, press spokesman for </F> Polish President Lech Walesa, by Piotr Swiac on the "Directly  From the Belvedere" program; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Swiac] Shortly after a summit of the Visegrad  Group leaders in Prague, President Walesa was host last week to  Slovak President Michal Kovac. Despite some very friendly  gestures at the meeting, some preannounced agreements were not  signed, among them a transborder agreement.    [Drzycimski] It is a fact that there was a readiness on our  part to sign the two agreements, but the Slovaks were not  technically prepared to do so. From what President Kovac told  us during the bilateral talks, they have 14 more agreements  ready in their initial form, so it could be expected that during  both the ministers' and the prime ministers' mutual  visits--which, as announced, will take place in the immediate  future--these agreements shall be signed.    But you know, you really must take a different kind of  approach to this. Presidential visits do not necessarily always  result in the signing of treaties, agreements, pacts, and so  forth. The nature of such visits is completely different.  These visits, I would say [hesitating], they open  up....[Drzycimski changes thought] They raise the standards,  they create opportunities, both for prime ministers and for  ministers, but one should perhaps emphasize even more strongly  that these visits also create opportunities for people who  manage institutions, workplaces, for local governors on both  sides of the border--these are the opportunities for them to  kind of follow the [high-ranking officials'] lead. It is that  aspect which will determine whether or not these meetings made  sense.    The presidents of both countries--that is to say, Lech  Walesa  and Michal Kovac--discussed very significant political issues,  which are important not only for the countries of the Visegrad  Group but also for the countries of Central and East Europe as  well. To us, Partnership for Peace, which has been accepted by  all the countries of the Visegrad Group, is a path of some kind,  that is to say, it may be such a path, but it may also be kind  of a concealed attempt to rebuild a sphere of influence--the  sphere from which we fled. In that regard, President Kovac, for  instance, also focused our attention on the fact that our  military cooperation is just excellent--both immediately across  the border, and globally, between our two countries.    [Swiac] The issue of Partnership for Peace has a direct  impact on issues linked with the Polish Army. We will see some  changes in the Army. Those who are critical of these planned  changes--the Sejm National Defense Commission among others--are  charging [hesitating] that the changes will lead to a kind of  elimination of the civilian part from the Army.    [Drzycimski] That is not possible for a very simple reason:  If we intend to join NATO, then one of the preconditions....    [Swiac, interrupting] Exactly.    [Drzycimski] One of the preconditions is civilian  supervision over the Army. But there is a general trend to  retain civilian supervision in a determinant manner. In that  area, there is no willingness to eliminate civilian supervision  over the Army, neither on the president's part, nor, I think, on  the part of the [Defense] Ministry. The reason is that if we  were to do that, we would kind of contradict everything we have  done so far. This entire change is not just for its own sake;  it must at the same time have some safety valves which will  guarantee that the Army is efficient and able to conduct a full  mobilization if there is such a need. It is not the case that  we live in an isolated world. There are different situations  occurring around our country, in particular on the Eastern side.  It is not the case that we are afraid of war. We do not expect  a war to come from the outside, but what we want is that our  country's territory is such that we have guarantees of its  security and sovereignty.</p>

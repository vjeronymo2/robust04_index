			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Trump card: Developer Donald Trump will serve as master of ceremonies when the  American Friends of Hebrew University honors Merv Griffin at its awards gala  Jan. 14 at the Beverly Hilton. The event raises money for scholarships for  needy students.  </P> <P> A nose knows: Does Mt. Rushmore need a face lift? To find out, a helicopter  will hover beside the memorial next week as engineers photograph cracks and  other rocky wrinkles. The study is part of a project to spruce up the memorial  for its 50th anniversary in 1991, Mt. Rushmore Supt. Dan Wenk said.  </P> <P> Lighting up: Detroit Tigers owner and pizza baron Thomas Monaghan will get to  put up his $800,000 Christmas light display at Domino's headquarters after all.  Ann Arbor Township in Michigan had refused to issue a permit for the lights,  but a judge this week ruled that officials failed to prove the lights would  cause irreparable harm. Monaghan's display attracted thousands of visitors in  1987 but was not put up last year due to concerns over potential traffic and  safety problems. Monaghan aides say they have a new traffic plan.  </P> <P> Eyes don't have it: A man who claims his family was given most of the northern  United States by the king of England during Colonial times has sued to get it  back. Robert Brewster, of Longmont, Colo., said he wants the land for a country  just for blue- and green-eyed people. In a lawsuit filed in U. S. District  Court in Cheyenne, Wyo., he claimed his family was given the land between the  40th and 48th north latitudes from ocean to ocean. The 48th parallel is about  at the Canadian border; the 40th parallel stretches roughly from Eureka,  Calif., to New York City.  </P></p>

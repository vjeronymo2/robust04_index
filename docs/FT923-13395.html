			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Study highlights lack of knowledge GLOBAL fund managers lack knowledge of risk management instruments and are hesitant to use them, according to a survey by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx). The study found that US fund managers have a poor understanding of sophisticated currency products, while their European colleagues are not confident about their knowledge. European money managers are more likely to hedge currency risks than their US counterparts. Nearly two-thirds of European money managers questioned said they hedged, while less than one-third of US managers did so. This is partly explained by the fact that almost half of the European managers have 50 per cent or more of their holdings in foreign assets. Only 16 per cent of US equity fund managers and 31 per cent of US fixed-income fund managers have portfolios with more than 50 per cent in foreign assets.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / French inflation down to 2.1% Weak domestic demand and seasonal factors prompted a fall in French consumer price inflation in December, according to figures released yesterday by Insee, the national statistics office. Consumer prices fell by 0.1 per cent compared with November, giving an annual rate of inflation of 2.1 per cent. Insee said that a slight fall in the consumer price index was not unusual at the end of the year and reflected a fall in prices in fruit and vegetables and in clothing. Additional factors included a reduction in the price of oil products. Economists in Paris said that the weakness of inflation also reflected fragile consumer demand in the face of uncertain economic growth and the rise in unemployment. Several economists estimate that consumer spending fell in the final quarter of 1993, after rising strongly, by 0.7 per cent, in the third quarter.</p>

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of the Philippines (12): Popularity and pragmatism - Profile of Ramon 'Monching' Mitra RAMON MITRA, the 63-year old Speaker of the House of Representatives, used to run barefoot to school, earned pennies herding cattle on horse-back and was apprenticed to a crocodile hunter at the age of 11. Unlike many of the presidential candidates who rediscover humble origins as elections approach, his claim to 'know the pain of hunger and what it means to sleep without having your dinner' carries a ring of truth. As Speaker he has cut political deals and came closest to uniting a fractious set of congressmen behind President Corazon Aquino's party, even if a number of his bills have been shot down in the Senate. Such a mixture of populist politician and pragmatic party man should make Mr Mitra the 'candidate to beat' in presidential elections on May 11. But he lacks one important ingredient: President Corazon Aquino's support. Last month, Mrs Aquino threw her support behind his opponent in the ruling LDP party, retired General Fidel Ramos, even though the party had chosen Mr Mitra at a party convention as the candidate. Mrs Aquino's reservations appear to be based on the commonly aired view that Mr Mitra, who has built the strongest party machinery throughout the country, is a 'traditional politician'. This less-than-flattering epithet in the Philippines contains the suggestion of unacceptable amounts of patronage. Having lived for 20 years with President Marcos's brand of patronage politics, many Filipinos view almost any form of political horse-trading with deep suspicion. Mr Mitra has also been linked with illegal logging in Palawan through a local concessionaire and old friend. He denies the charges but some of the mud has stuck, at least in Manila. Whether his image is tainted in the countryside remains to be seen. His early life certainly could not have been better scripted for a politician. A rich businessman by the time he became House Speaker in 1987, he was born the illegitimate son of a half-American mother and the superintendent of a penal colony on Palawan Island. His mother died when he was 11 months old after his father left for Manila and he was raised in poverty by her family. After escaping from the Japanese army during the Second World War, he was reunited with his father - by that time a Philippines congressman - and began an expensive education that led him to journalism, foreign service at the United Nations, commercial farming and politics. On the economic policy front, Mr Mitra espouses much of the market liberalisation on which many businessmen are pinning hopes of recovery. He is in favour of opening up the economy to foreign investment and competition and letting the peso find a more realistic international exchange rate. And his solution for the burgeoning domestic debt problem is textbook economics: not new taxes, but better collection of existing ones. This suggestion has been less than enthusiastically received in Manila. It explains, he believes, why his candidacy has yet to gain popular support.</p>

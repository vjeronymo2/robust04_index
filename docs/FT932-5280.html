			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: MEPC Things have reached a pretty pass when the City expresses disappointment after a company eschews a dilutive rights issue. Such is the intoxicated haze surrounding the property sector, that MEPC's abstinence comes as something of an anti-climax. MEPC may be sticking to the commendable view that diluting net asset values is a heinous offence. But it has not ruled out the possibility. The suspicion remains that the summer will not pass without it tapping the market. The danger is that, without fresh funds, MEPC will be left behind in a recovering property market. With gearing in excess of 80 per cent and thin cash flow, MEPC has only limited scope to upgrade its assets and diversify its portfolio. Its interim results suggest it may yet have to rely on property disposals to justify a maintained annual dividend. So far, the stock market has wafted most companies in the property sector higher on a surge of sentiment. But the point must soon be reached where differences in asset quality and growth prospects produce a marked divergence in share performance. Those companies using cheap money to buy properties yielding 9 per cent will usefully bolster income and increase their exposure to any growth in asset values. Land Securities, British Land and Brixton Estate, have already positioned themselves to benefit. MEPC must decide whether it dares follow suit.</p>

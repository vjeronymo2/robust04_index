			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate cut prompts sell-off at long end The Bundesbank's latest rate cut fuelled easing hopes among Germany's European neighbours, prompting investors to shift funds into shorter maturities and causing yield curves to steepen. While the Bundesbank left its discount and Lombard rates unchanged, it cut its rate for securities repurchase agreements by  1/4 point and set 6 per cent fixed-rate repos for the next five weeks. The German yield curve steepened after the Bundesbank's announcement, with 10-year yields rising by two basis points and the rate for three-month Eurodeposits falling by 13 basis points. With the repo rate fixed for the next five weeks, a widespread feeling that there will be no more key rate cuts until January caused the sell-off at the long end, said Torsten Bohler, bond analyst with UBS. The longer-dated sector was also damped by the announcement of new ultra-long supply after the Bundesbank cancelled the 10-year bund issue scheduled for December and announced the auction of a new tranche of 6 per cent bonds due 2016. The December bund future fell 0.22 point to 99.68, while the three-month Euromark future climbed 0.06 point to 93.92. The Bundesbank's rate cut fuelled speculation that France may soon deliver its long-awaited rate cut, with some traders betting on a  1/4 -point rate cut as soon as today, or a cut in the 6.45 per cent intervention rate at Monday's Bank of France repo. But others said the French authorities may prefer to wait until Germany lowers its official rates before following suit. According to Mr Michael O'Hanlon, chief international economist with Kidder, Peabody Securities, the French authorities do not want to risk pressuring the franc by a unilateral cut in official rates. Moreover, he said France still has to repay some of the intervention funds it borrowed during last summer's currency crisis, and needs to fully replenish its foreign currency reserves before being in a comfortable position to cut rates. The December notional bond future on Matif ended 0.10 point lower at 124.10 while the three-month Pibor future rose 0.08 point to 93.60. UK gilt traders also reported heavy demand for short-dated debt as investors took profits at the long end. The March long gilt futures contract slipped by  5/16 to 116 3/4 . Italian bonds weakened further on political worries ahead of the second round of municipal elections on Sunday. The March BTP contract on Liffe fell 0.42 point to 111.43. However, some said this represents a buying opportunity for medium-term investors. 'Italian bonds are getting to very attractive levels,' said Marc Hendricks, head of international bond research at Swiss Bank Corporation. US Treasury bond prices softened yesterday as the market digested a batch of second-tier economic statistics and awaited the government's report on November employment due out today. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/16 at 99, with the yield edging higher to 6.268 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.20 per cent. The market weathered the day's generally upbeat readings on the economy with little fanfare. Prices inched ahead soon after the release of the data, mainly because the figures were in line with expectations. The Commerce Department said personal income in October had risen 0.6 per cent from September to October, and personal consumption climbed 0.8 per cent. The Labor Department, meanwhile, said initial claims for state unemployment benefit last week showed a modest decline. More favourably for bonds, October sales of new homes dipped 6.5 per cent against September's figure, which was revised downward. However, prices slipped into negative territory as the morning progressed amid speculation that the Clinton administration may support an increase in short-term interest rates early next year.</p>

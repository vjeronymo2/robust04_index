			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Penetration Does Not Make  Peace," AL-THAWRAH comments on Israel's pressures which aim to  weaken the Lebanese national will. AL-THAWRAH stresses that  attempts to effect a Syrian-Lebanese disengagement are doomed to  failure. Having undergone numerous tests, the strategic  relations between Syria and Lebanon have emerged sound and safe,  because they reflect vital national aspirations and interests.    AL-THAWRAH notes that Lebanon adheres to a just,  comprehensive peace based on UN resolutions. It will accept no  peace without the full implementation of Resolution 425, as well  as Resolutions 242 and 338. Lebanon is confident that its  alliance and continued coordination and cooperation with Syria  will thwart all Israeli attempts to weaken it. Syria and  Lebanon have a common destiny. In its peace efforts and moves,  Syria makes no distinction between the Golan Heights and  southern Lebanon. It insists on the implementation of  Resolution 242 as much as it insists on the implementation of  Resolution 425 on Lebanon. The paper says Lebanon knows well  that in all of Syria's peace discussions, Resolution 425 has  been an essential part of Syrian strategy.    Speaking about Israel's attempts and distorted concept of  peace, AL-THAWRAH says that what Israel frequently attempts to  convey through its officials is not the desired peace nor the  one provided for in the UN Security Council resolutions. For  peace to be viable, it must comprehensive. Withdrawal from  every inch of the Golan and withdrawal from every inch of  southern Lebanon is the basis and prerequisite of peace; without  it, there can be none. Israel should understand that Syria and  Lebanon are not after just any peace.    If Israel believes that its penetrations on other tracks  will  support it against the Arabs and that it can impose its terms,  it is undoubtedly deluded. This is because Israel deeply knows  that there is no peace without Syria, as everyone knows.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Volvo plans for merger hit by wave of dissent Volvo's ambitious plans to merge with France's Renault were under renewed threat last night after the Swedish group's third-largest shareholder joined a growing chorus of opposition to the deal. The call by Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken Funds, which controls 5.7 per cent of Volvo's voting capital, for the merger to be postponed brought to seven the number of Swedish institutional shareholders that have said they will not support the deal at a special shareholders meeting next Tuesday. With only two Swedish institutions independent of Volvo pledged in favour, opponents called on Volvo not to proceed. Volvo declined official comment, but a senior executive said: 'We are, of course, taking the situation very seriously'. Volvo's share price rose steeply on speculation that the merger would fail. The most-traded B share closed at SKr444 (Dollars 51), up SKr30 from Tuesday's close. Votes committed against the merger still trail those in favour by a margin of between 10 and 6 per cent of the votes. But the Yes camp includes Renault's 10 per cent holding and the opposition now holds a clear lead among the independent institutions. Volvo admits it is reluctant to push through the deal on a narrow majority. Renault said that while yesterday's developments were obviously unwelcome it had no new plans ahead of the shareholder vote and would await next week's decision. A French government official adopted a similar stance, adding that the French side had done all it could to reassure Swedish investors and clarify points of concern about the deal. Doubt was also cast yesterday over the decision of one of the supporting institutions. The board of the Fourth Fund state pension fund, the biggest Volvo shareholder after Renault, is set to reconsider its narrow 8-6 vote in favour of the merger at a meeting tomorrow. This follows the revelation that the fund's chief executive also sits on the board of a Volvo subsidiary. Today, attention will focus on a decision expected from the SPP insurance company which holds 4.5 per cent of the Volvo votes. S-E Banken Funds, which has a close relationship with the Volvo board, did not reject the merger outright, but said a final decision should be postponed until next April. The funds sharply criticised the information provided by Volvo on the merger, saying it was not sufficiently detailed to allow a proper evaluation of the values placed on Volvo assets. Under the merger plan, Volvo would put all its core car, truck and bus making operations into the new Renault-Volvo company in exchange for a 35 per cent shareholding. 'The information was not up to the standard we like to have in such an important case as this,' said Mr Peter Thelin, S-E Banken Funds chief executive. He also said time was needed to 'repair the damage' caused by what had become an emotional tussle between Volvo and its shareholders. Background, Page 18</p>

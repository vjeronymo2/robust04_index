(SNARK) -- "Recent events in  Abkhazia which resulted in new victims among the civilian  Georgian population represent an intended action aiming to  prevent the peace settlement process of conflict", said in his  exclusive interview to SNARK Shalva Pitchkhadze, the state  adviser of Georgian President. Characterizing the military  actions in Feb. 7 and 8 as "bacchanalia", developed by Gudauta  separatists against the Georgian population, the result of which  were hundreds of innocent civilians, Eduard Shevardnadze's  adviser observed: "Abkhazians deliberately torpedoed the Geneva  negotiations process. Naturally, the refugee's return to Gali  region since Feb. 10, as agreed in Geneva, is out of question".    On these days, said Pitchkhaladze, Eduard Shevardnadze will  appear with a statement on recent events in Abkhazia.</p>

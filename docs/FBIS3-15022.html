			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Mar 01, BNS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's February 24 report at the Russian parliament was well  thought over in contrast to the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozirev's frequent and inconsiderate statements, Aleksandrs  Kirsteins, chairman of Latvian parliament foreign committee,  said Monday [28 February] at the press conference in Saeima  [parliament] house. Kirsteins noted that Yeltsin's report shows  that it is impossible to forecast trends in Russian foreign and  interior policy.    Kirsteins said that Latvia could agree to the Yeltsin's  statement about the necessity to sign an agreement with Russia  on minorities rights' protection so that it was possible to  regulate the Russian minority's social status in Latvia.    Kirsteins thinks that placing matters related to Skrunda  radar in the center of the interstate talks was just a political  maneuver because, at the same time, Russia does not want to sign  the agreement with Latvia and Russia's demands concerning  Russian retired military personnel and its further stay in  Latvia are unacceptable for Latvia.    In return, Faction Latvian Way leader Andrejs Pantelejevs  noted that Russian presidents' report is an encouragement for  Latvia to integrate sooner into Europe by passing a law on  citizenship. Pantelejevs informed that the representatives of  European Council will visit Latvia next week to discuss the  possible Latvia's joining this organization.</p>

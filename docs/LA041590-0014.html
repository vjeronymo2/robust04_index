			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HANDLE WITH CARE  </P> <P> "Longtime Companion," a frank look at a group of gay friends in New York City  coping with the impact of AIDS on their lives in the 1980s, is the kind of  feature film some distributors would give the soft sell. But the Goldwyn Co.  plans to pull no punches in marketing the movie, which opens in New York May 11  and here a week later.  </P> <P> "Obviously, it's very difficult subject matter, and not the easiest marketing  job, but we think it's going to surprise people," says Tom Rothman, Goldwyn  senior veep and worldwide production chief. "It has to be handled with great  care, and nurtured.  </P> <P> "We're addressing the (gay and AIDS) issue head-on. From a marketing point of  view, that's the real question. We're not in any way afraid of what the movie  is about. That's why we picked it up."  </P> <P> Trailers for "Longtime Companion" are already appearing in theaters along with  mainstream releases. They "mention both AIDS and homosexuality in the first 20  seconds," Rothman says -- and have been drawing applause. "We feel it's a movie  that both gay and non-gay audiences will respond to."  </P> <P> Produced for American Playhouse Theatrical Films, the picture was written by  Craig Lucas and directed by Norman Rene. The sizable ensemble cast includes  Bruce Davison, Patrick Cassidy, Dermot Mulroney and Campbell Scott. Some are  already doing advance publicity for the film.  </P> <P> "I think all the actors are very proud of it," Rothman said. "I think only one  or two are gay, and I wouldn't know which ones -- it's none of my business."  </P> <P> Does it take special courage for mainstream actors to appear in such a film?  </P> <P> "I think so. I think the whole movie is courageous." John M. Wilson  </P></p>

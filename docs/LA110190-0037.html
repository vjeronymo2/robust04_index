			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: TWO ADVENTUROUS THEATERS GET MORE NEA FUNDING;  </P> <P> GRANTS TO LATC AND SAN DIEGO REPERTORY THEATRE ALLAY FEARS THAT ONLY 'SAFE'  ARTS ORGANIZATIONS WOULD SEE ENDOWMENT MONEYS.  </P> <P> The controversy surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts since last year  led some observers to fear that only the safest arts organizations would be in  the endowment's good graces.  </P> <P> But so far that's not the case, judging from the latest endowment grants to  professional theaters in Southern California.  </P> <P> Two Southland theaters with reputations for adventurous work won major  increases in endowment funding, according to an endowment list of 214  professional theaters, receiving $7.8 million for the 1990-91 season.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Theatre Center's endowment grant rose from last year's $40,000 to  $65,000, while San Diego Repertory Theatre's grant increased from $35,000 to  $60,000.  </P> <P> These grants were issued with the NEA's anti-obscenity certification  requirement intact, though it was recently struck from legislation that applies  to next year's grants. However, many of the recipients -- including LATC and  San Diego Rep -- filed friend-of-the-court briefs in lawsuits challenging the  clause.  </P> <P> Among other local theaters, South Coast Repertory did best this year -- its NEA  grant will rise from $95,000 to $112,500. David Chambers, an SCR artistic  associate, was chairman of the NEA theater panel, but he followed endowment  conflict-of-interest rules and left the room during discussion and vote on the  SCR application, an endowment spokeswoman said. Under new NEA enabling  legislation passed by Congress over the weekend, he would not be able to serve  on next year's panel -- conflicts of interest will be illegal in future NEA  grant-review proceedings.  </P> <P> All of the other Southern California theaters that are NEA recipients will  receive the same amount as last year, or less.  </P> <P> The Mark Taper Forum won $260,000, down $20,000 from last year. Its amount was  nevertheless the third largest on the list, surpassed only by grants to the  Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and Arena Stage in Washington.  </P> <P> The Old Globe's grant stayed at $180,000. La Jolla Playhouse received $76,500,  down $8,500. The Odyssey Theatre got $31,500 -- $3,500 less.  </P> <P> East West Players, L.A. Theatre Works and Stages each garnered $7,500 -- the  same amount as last year.  </P> <P> The endowment theater program began its apportionment of money this year by  cutting the allotments to last year's recipients -- at least those that  received more than the minimum $7,500 -- by 10%. The pool of money derived from  these cuts was then used to reward groups that were considered to have been  underfunded in past years, an NEA spokeswoman said. Some of the money was also  restored on a discretionary basis to some of the other theaters.  </P> <P> LATC artistic director Bill Bushnell pointed out that both his theater and San  Diego Repertory came of age in the '80s, when the Reagan Administration reined  in endowment funding: "We suffered certain inequities because the endowment  itself wasn't growing."  </P> <P> Bushnell said he believes the endowment boost also reflects "a sense that (LATC  is) going to survive. . . . We're a year older, and our overall (budgetary)  numbers have improved considerably." Recent tough talk by some City Council  members, who advocate ending or reducing city support for LATC, occurred after  the endowment theater panel deliberations.  </P> <P> San Diego Rep managing director Adrian Stewart agreed that "we've historically  been underfunded." But he sounded grimmer about the future than Bushnell,  noting that the theater must still raise $350,000 in private contributions by  the end of the year "to keep our doors open." He said he was heartened by the  endowment endorsement of the "high-risk" programming taken by San Diego Rep  last year -- risks that he acknowledged helped plunge the theater into its  current fiscal crisis.  </P> <P> La Jolla is another theater that emerged in the '80s, and the Odyssey attained  much of its reputation during the '80s, yet funding for these theaters was not  supplemented after the initial 10% cut.  </P> <P> Alan Levey, La Jolla's managing director, acknowledged that "given our relative  youth, we were being funded more (in previous years) than other organizations"  such as LATC -- which has a budget almost twice as large as La Jolla's.  </P> <P> The Odyssey's Ron Sossi said his theater's NEA funding probably won't rise  above its current level "until we're under an Equity contract" -- which won't  happen unless the Odyssey expands into quarters larger than its current 99-seat  theaters.  </P> <P> The New York Shakespeare Festival, which rejected another endowment grant  earlier this year because of the endowment's anti-obscenity clause, was listed  as a recipient of $243,000 in this latest round of grants.  </P> <P> The Shakespeare Festival's producer Joseph Papp said he would announce today  whether the $243,000 will be accepted. The Oregon Shakespeare Festival, which  rejected a $49,500 grant earlier this year for similar reasons, was not  mentioned on the endowment list.  </P> <P> Separately, the NEA confirmed Wednesday that Jessica Andrews, who took over as  director of the endowment's theater program 10 months ago, has resigned to  become managing director at Washington's Shakespeare Theatre at the Folger.  Andrews was one of two acting program directors named a permanent director by  NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer in his first personnel moves after taking over  the agency in October, 1989.  </P> <P> The NEA said Andrews would leave the endowment next month. She joined the NEA  in 1987.  </P> <P> LATC SINGS: "The Joni Mitchell Project," opening tonight at LATC, was born from  an idea by Barry Krost, the business partner of Mitchell's manager Peter Asher.  Krost is also a board member at LATC.  </P> <P> Could the project have been approved because Krost is on the theater board?  </P> <P> "Absolutely not," said LATC artistic director Bushnell. "I've turned down other  projects Barry has presented. I've turned down dozens of projects presented to  me by the trustees." The project was approved strictly on its artistic merits,  he said.  </P> <P> Bushnell declined to discuss the show's details. Krost, while acknowledging  that Mitchell "will be well and appropriately remunerated" for her material  (she is not performing in the show), added that if the show is commercially  successful in a later life after its LATC run, LATC could earn "a considerable  income" from it, as could Mitchell. "I'm assuming LATC would be a substantial  participant."  </P> <P> Starting next week, "The Joni Mitchell Project" will be joined by another  musical revue, "Blues in the Night," at LATC. Bushnell said no subscribers have  complained about two revues in a row; instead, "my guess is they'll be  overjoyed."  </P> <P> The overlap wasn't intentional, said Bushnell: "The timing just happened to  work out that way because of the schedules" of the two directors.  </P> <P> From the two shows, he added, "The astute observer will see that you can start  from the same position" -- songs, singers and instrumentalists -- "and end up  with something completely different."  </P> <P> COMING ATTRACTIONS: Tony Franciosa and the original cast's Liliane Montevecchi  will star in the national tour of "Grand Hotel," scheduled to arrive in Costa  Mesa April 2, in Hollywood May 28 and in San Diego Aug. 20. . . . Sheri  Glaser's "Family Secrets" will re-open at the Heliotrope Nov. 24 after a  successful run at the Hahn Theatre in San Diego. Earlier this year the show ran  six months at the Heliotrope. An additional character has been added during the  San Diego run: a trance channeler who is married to the older daughter of the  family.  </P> <P> The local premiere of a new film version of "Cyrano de Bergerac," starring  Gerard Depardieu, will benefit Pasadena Playhouse, Tuesday at the Royal Theatre  in West Los Angeles. Information: (818) 792-8672, Ext. 208.  </P></p>

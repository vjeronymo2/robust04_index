			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Number of fires at 14 year high THE number of fires in 1990 was the highest for 14 years and deliberate arson attacks on cars have almost doubled, according to figures released yesterday. Fire brigades attended 467,000 fires in 1990, up 11,000 on the previous year and the largest number since 1976, the Home Office said. Numerous grassland fires in the summer are believed to have increased the figure. Fires started deliberately in cars went up by 45 per cent in a year, amounting to almost half of all fires in cars. Overall, the number of people dying in fires remained steady at about 900. Smoke alarms detected more fires than ever, but that still amounted to fewer than 5 per cent of house fires. They seem to have cut deaths in household blazes, although those still account for 70 per cent of fire fatalities. Deaths in homes fell to 627, the lowest since 1971.</p>

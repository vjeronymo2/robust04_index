			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Microvitec returns to black with Pounds 62,000 MICROVITEC, the USM-quoted computer peripherals manufacturer and software group, returned to profit in the first half of 1992 after two years of consecutive losses. The turnround came despite continuing losses in its distribution division and higher net interest costs. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 62,000 compared to losses of Pounds 2.21m, including Pounds 267,000 of rationalisation costs, last time. Earnings per share came to 0.1p against losses of 4.8p. No dividend has been paid since 1990. In the latest period the group reported operating profits of Pounds 439,000 (Pounds 1.67m losses) on turnover which more than doubled to Pounds 25.5m, mainly reflecting the acquisition in May last year of Logitek, the computer services company. Mr James Bailey, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We have continued to reduce costs and improve efficiency and these, together with our changing product mix, have improved gross profit margin to 26.3 per cent.' 'This has been achieved despite the effects of the continuing recession, price reductions by computer manufacturers and fierce discounting by competitors.' Net interest charges more than doubled to Pounds 377,000 (Pounds 183,000) mainly as a result of debt acquired with Logitek. However, Mr Bailey said the company was committed to reducing the level of gearing, which had improved to 72 per cent at the end of June. All divisions of the company, except the Logitek distribution business which is operating in a 'hostile environment', operated profitably in the first half. A new management team has been appointed in the distribution division and costs are being reduced. The monitor and display division returned to profit following the successful implementation of a joint venture with Electrohome of Canada, and the launch of the new AlphaWindows terminal.</p>

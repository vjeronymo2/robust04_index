			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: ADRs gain popularity in the Netherlands  -How Dutch companies are latching on to US markets Amev, Ahold and Fokker - announced plans for new American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programmes this month, bolstering the direct presence of Dutch companies on US stockmarkets. Ahold, the big Dutch food retailer, already had an ADR programme, but it deepened its commitment by listing the ADRs on Nasdaq on April 8. Fokker, the airplane builder, and Amev, the insurance company, are newcomers to ADRs. Trading in Fokker's ADRs began on the over-the-counter market this month, with Amev scheduled to follow in June. The moves, while unveiled almost simultaneously, are part of a wider, more gradual rise in the use of ADRs among Dutch companies since the early 1980s. The nearly identical timing of Amev, Ahold and Fokker is due more to the release of pent-up demand following the end of the Gulf War than to any special factors which make ADR programmes more attractive, bankers say. There are now 23 Dutch companies with ADR programmes, putting the Netherlands in second place in Europe after the UK and just ahead of Sweden. Because of their small home market Dutch companies have traditionally used ADRs to widen their shareholder base. ADRs enable US investors to invest in foreign companies and at the same time to receive dividend cheques in dollars. Apart from the usual reasons, Ahold, which recently acquired its fourth major US supermarket chain, said it decided to launch a full ADR programme to make it easier for its 55,000 US employees to invest in the company. Fokker and Amev wanted to meet growing US demand for their shares. None of the three has immediate plans to raise fresh capital through ADRs. 'Many US institutional investors are obliged to invest only in dollar-denominated shares. The ADRs allow us to tap a potentially large number of shareholders,' says Mr Peter Glasbeek, Fokker's assistant treasurer. Most well-known Dutch companies, ranging from Philips to Heineken, already have ADR programmes of different sorts, varying from unsponsored programmes to full listings on one of the US stock exchanges. Mr Robert Murray, head of the ADR department at JP Morgan in New York, which is the depositary institution for the three latest programmes and for well over half of all Dutch ADRs, says at least six other Dutch companies are considering ADR transactions. DSM, the chemicals group, has already said that it may launch a programme later this year. One possible consequence of launching ADRs is that trading in the US can affect the level of a company's share price on the home market. For example, nearly half of shares in Reuters, the UK-based financial information group, are held in the form of ADRs, which sometimes means that the share price is determined in New York rather than London. This is not yet true of any Dutch company, though the potential exists. 'If a programme is very successful, you're going to see trading in the US which could have an impact on the market value in Holland,' Mr Murray says. But he adds that foreign stock markets exert influences over share prices in other countries in any case, and an ADR programme merely makes that link more visible. Ahold's move to the Nasdaq market helped boost its share price in Amsterdam, at least temporarily, for two reasons. Strong initial demand in the US led to buying of Ahold's Dutch shares for repackaging as ADRs. The company's US roadshows also kindled interest in the Dutch-listed shares from institutional investors who are able to invest in Ahold in guilders. On April 8, the first day of Nasdaq trading, Ahold's shares rose by Fl 2.70 (Dollars 1.42) to Fl 86, extending increases sparked by its recent acquisition of Tops Markets, a New York-based supermarket chain, and by the rise of the dollar. Its shares later fell back, partly due to the resignation of a top executive in the Netherlands. They closed yesterday at Fl 83.90, up 30 cents on the day.</p>

IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that at the meeting, the IAEA  produced to North Korea technical requirements related to  nuclear inspections.    Meyer said the contact was going on between the two sides,  and he could not discuss any details.    He added, however, he expects additional talks could take  place this week on the inspection of the seven declared North  Korean nuclear facilities.    Another IAEA spokesman, David Kyd, said he doesn't believe  there would be any immediate progress over the question of  inspecting two undeclared facilities.    North Korea was represented at the second contact held at  the  IAEA headquarters here in Vienna by Yun Ho-chin, a councilor at  the North Korean embassy in Vienna, and a couple of other  diplomats.</p>

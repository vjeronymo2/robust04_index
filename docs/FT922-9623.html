			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Queen's Speech: Freeing the market for milk - Agricultural marketing THE drawn-out process of bringing to a close the Milk Marketing Board's 60-year-old monopoly right to buy milk appears to be gathering pace. The announcement in the Queen's Speech that legislation would 'be introduced to promote improvements in agricultural marketing' is mainly aimed at the reform of the MMB - a long-term aim of the government. Shortly after the election last month, and only a few days before the government's Easter deadline, the MMB submitted to the Agriculture Ministry its plans to turn itself into a single voluntary co-operative with pooled prices. The ministry said the legislation would be intended to help the MMB's move 'to a new structure better able to protect the interests of producers and consumers in the European single market.' The ministry has not yet made a formal response to the plans, which will also have to be approved by the European Commission. The MMB, which has put up stiff resistance to reforming itself, was debating the reforms for two years. The plans include the spinning off of Dairy Crest, its wholly owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent share of the UK's manufactured dairy products market. Yesterday Mr Bob Steven, MMB chairman, said: 'In changing a structure that has existed for nearly 60 years, future legislation must seek to preserve as many benefits of the current system as possible.' It must give farmers and dairy companies 'a fair opportunity to adapt their businesses to changed circumstances,' he added. Legislation is also being introduced to end government guarantees for the Potato Marketing Board and British Wool Marketing Board intervention schemes. The government has not spent any money on the potato scheme since 1984, but the ministry said yesterday that the wool scheme had cost Pounds 40m last year. However, the wool board said yesterday it was well prepared for the end of the wool scheme, as the government first announced its intention to reform it at the opening of the previous Parliament.</p>

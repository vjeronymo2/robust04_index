			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nisim Qeynan] </F>   [Text] It has just been released for publication that  shots were fired at an IDF [Israel Defense Sources] patrol in  the southeastern corner of the Qatif Bloc settlement of Ganey  Tal at about 0620 this morning. Four soldiers were wounded in  the incident. As a result of the gunfire, the patrol driver  lost control of the vehicle, which overturned and plummeted  about 10 meters down a sand dune. An Army helicopter evacuated  the wounded to the hospital. Two of the men, who suffered  moderate injuries, apparently caused by the gunfire, were  evacuated to Soroka Hospital in Beersheba, while the other two,  who sustained slight injuries, evidently as a result of the  car's overturning, were moved to Barzilay Hospital in Ashqelon.    It has been further learned that the gunshots came from a  two-story house on the outskirts of Khan Yunus, whose Amal  neighborhood borders on Ganey Tal. The house has been known to  serve as a terrorist hideout and observation post in the past.    The IDF and the security forces have mounted a manhunt for  the terrorists, who fled the house. No arrests have been made.  The number of assailants is unknown, although an initial  debriefing indicates that the shots came from at least two  firearms.</p>

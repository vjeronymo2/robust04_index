			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The members of the [Sarajevo]  City Council have assessed the latest round of humanitarian aid  as one of the worst so far. That is why a meeting was organized  yesterday with Tony Land, chief of the UNHCR office in Sarajevo.  Mayor Muhamed Kresevljakovic asked Mr. Land whether the obvious  reduction in the humanitarian aid represented yet another form  of pressure on the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities, and whether  the UNHCR had merged with the European underworld, which  normally resorted to such tactics.    Tony Land vehemently rejected this, justifying the  increasingly poor deliveries to the Saralians by the wintry  conditions, which limit the number of flights, by the frequent  firing at UNHCR aircraft, and the lack of land corridors. The  representatives of the city authorities proposed to Land that on  one day no flour should be brought into the city, but instead  all the flights should be used to bring proteins and sugar into  Sarajevo. Land said that he had no say in the kind of goods  that were delivered by air.    All in all, the meeting with the chief of the Sarajevo UNHCR  office was assessed as unsatisfactory. That is why the members  of the Sarajevo City Council have sent another letter from  today's session to UNHCR's Sadako Ogata, in which they inform  her about the very difficult humanitarian situation in Sarajevo,  asking her to do something improve it.

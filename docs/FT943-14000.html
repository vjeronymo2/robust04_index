			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Banks advance The banking sector was in the vanguard of the market's advance with fund managers across Europe said to have moved quickly to fill in underweight positions. 'There was a feeling that many institutions have missed the bottom of the market and have started to panic,' said one marketmaker who pointed out that the banks have been left behind by the market for many months. News that the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society intends to announce revised terms for its merger with Lloyds Bank by the middle of next month was seen as the trigger for the upsurge in the sector. Lloyds shares raced closed 21 higher at 557p after turnover of 5.7m. NatWest, viewed by some as the cheapest stock in the sector because of its expansion in the US, leapt 16 to 470p on 8.9m traded, while Barclays rose 15 to 554p. HSBC raced up 31 to 727p with dealers pointing to the strong rally in the dollar, linked to the HK dollar, and stories that HSBC is about to embark on a big expansion policy outside of Europe. SG Warburg slipped 4 to 693p amid suggestions that the shares had been downgraded by one of the market's leading brokers. Personal credit group Provident Financial jumped 16 to 499p after Hoare Govett published a buy note on the company, focusing on the attractions of collected credit and the group's cost cutting. Great Universal Stores recouped losses sustained following the disappointment over the non-appearance of a share buy back as the stock responded to some cautiously positive comment on the company's fundamentals. The shares lifted 8 to 574p. United Biscuits fell 5 to 309p as BZW cut its 1995 forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 190m implying flat profits because of dull trading conditions in the US and Europe and advised clients to sell the shares. Advertising and marketing services group WPP jumped 5 to 107p as SG Warburg published an in-depth recommendation. The house argued that the shares deserved to trade at a 25 per cent premium to the market which translated to a medium term target of 127p at current levels. A slight setback in oil prices and a sluggish opening on Wall Street restrained the oil majors where BP, much more highly geared than Shell to a rising oil price, settled a penny off at 400p after turnover of 7.5m shares. Shell, helped by the upsurge in markets, edged up 3 1/2 to 709p. Enterprise Oil, a strong performer since its failed bid for Lasmo and boosted by the recent strength in crude oil prices, suffered from a bout of profits-taking to close 4 off at 427p but remained sharply higher over the week. British Gas was the pick of the energy sector, the shares advancing 6 1/2 to 284p as dealers responded to a growing view that legislation to introduce competition in the domestic gas market will be delayed for at least a year. Retailer Marks &amp; Spencer improved 9 to 415 1/2 p on the anticipated boost to profits prompted by its decision to open on Sundays. Suppliers also benefited - Claremont Garments rose 16 pence to 315p, Dewhirst 4 to 130p and Courtaulds Textiles 15 to 505p. Hartstone, the leather goods and hosiery manufacturer, fell 10 to 22p as it announced a Pounds 70.7m loss after exceptionals against Pounds 9.86m previously and a deeply discounted two-for-one rights issue at 15p a share to raise Pounds 30.3m. The cash call had been well flagged but the size of it was a surprise. Negative press comment for Rank Organisation, after better than expected interim figures on Thursday, left the shares trailing 3 to 402p. Whitbread rose 14 to 538p ahead of next week's annual meeting. Some analysts said the group was trading ahead of budget and brewing margins were stabilising. Turnover in Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, the thinly-traded brewer, hit 3.6m as one marketmaker took on a line of 1.5m shares at 263 1/2 p and placed them at 264 1/2 p. The share price rose 3 to 266p. Industrial conglomerate BTR gave up 5 1/2 to 377p, in heavy trade of 9.7m with UBS reported to be cautious. Components manufacturer Automotive Precision Holdings, which hosted a group of analysts last week, closed 5 ahead at 111p. Wagon Industrial jumped 21 to 499p, after a presentation to institutions.

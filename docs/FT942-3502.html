			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium and coffee lead renewed advance Base metals and soft commodities made a bright start to the week with leading contracts at both the London Metal Exchange and the London Commodity Exchange registering big gains. At the LME the pace was set by the aluminium market, which saw the three months position confirming last week's break above the Dollars 1,400-a-tonne resistance area. The price closed at Dollars 1,427.25, up Dollars 21, after reaching a 33-month high of Dollars 1,433 at one time. Dealers told the Reuters news agency that there was a growing consensus in the market that aluminium's fundamentals were turning round at last after a long period during which oversupply had lifted stocks of the metal in LME registered warehouses to unprecedented levels. They said the next target on the upside was Dollars 1,460 a tonne, which could signal the start of a major bull market. 'The tide is turning for aluminium,' said Mr William Adams, research analyst at London broker Rudolf Wolff. 'As long as smelters do not renege on their cutback announcements, the fundamentals should continue to improve.' Aluminium's strength helped the copper market to repeat last week's assault on resistance at Dollars 2,400 a tonne - and this time it appeared to have succeeded. Good buying was attracted by an early dip to Dollars 2,380 for the three months price and, after peaking at Dollars 1,423, it closed Dollars 27.50 to the good at Dollars 2,411.50. It moved up again in after hours trading to Dollars 2,420. But Mr Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, told an analysts' meeting in Paris that copper's current price level was temporary and would 'see a retreat before 1995'. Copper supply was now falling short of demand, he said, but in the next few months cheap Russian exports might resume now that cold weather would no longer slow output. At the LCE, meanwhile, the September delivery robusta coffee price surged to Dollars 2,330 a tonne in an active morning session, adding Dollars 182 to last week's Dollars 57 advance. It was trimmed back to Dollars 2,290 at the close. Traders attributed the fresh surge to Friday's US Department of Agriculture report predicting lower world green coffee output in 1994-95. The department said it expected production to total 90.6m bags (60kg each), down 4 per cent from last season's harvest. Reuters reported that buying was well spread between traders, commission houses and speculators, with some investment funds also returning to the fray. With coffee's bullish mood firmly re-established some of the enthusiasm spilled over into the cocoa market, where September delivery futures rose Pounds 21 to Pounds 1,016 a tonne. 'The funds are looking for value,' said one trader. 'They seem happy to sit and let the price go up, rather than liquidate long positions.' Coffee stocks held by Brazilian co-operatives fell in May to 1.79m bags from 2.16m bags in April, said the National Coffee Council, a growers organisation, reports Reuters from Rio de Janeiro.</p>

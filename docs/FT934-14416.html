			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: Elderly face costs blow for home care - Your lifetime's savings could be in danger PEOPLE ARE living longer these days, but increasing numbers need to spend their last few years in nursing or residential homes. Such accommodation is expensive, and, at Pounds 400 or more a week for nursing home care, can quickly eat up a lifetime's savings, including the capital tied up in a house. A letter in our Q &amp; A Briefcase column two weeks ago touched on this subject, since when we have received many letters. The Care in the Community Act, which came into force in the UK in April this year, requires that anyone needing residential or nursing home care must contribute to its cost if they are able to. If the person has more than Pounds 8,000 in savings or capital, they are obliged to meet the full cost until the savings have been reduced to Pounds 8,000, and then a proportion of the costs until they have only Pounds 3,000 left. Anyone with less than Pounds 3,000 does not have to contribute. There has been much confusion since the act came into force over the treatment of the value of a person's home. If the person going into care owns his or her own home, its value will be assessed as capital. Local authorities cannot force the sale of the house, but they can have a legal charge put on the property, so that when it is eventually sold they can claim some or all of the proceeds. However, the regulations lay down that if the spouse or another relative aged over 60 or incapacitated lives in the property, its value has to be disregarded. Age Concern is worried that some local authorities appear to be applying this wrongly and are including the home in the assessment whether or not the spouse still lives there. If this happens, you should first make a formal complaint to the council, then contact the local government ombudsman. Many elderly people wonder about transferring ownership of the property to the children so that its value cannot be eroded by care fees. However, if a local authority suspects that assets have been disposed with the intention of avoiding charges, they can pursue both the person who disposed of the assets and the person or people who received them, with no time limit. A court would decide what the intention was. Some local authorities are also automatically including the spouse's separately owned assets and savings in the assessment for the partner needing to go into a home. This is not allowed under the act. A 'liable relative' provision allows for a spouse to be asked to agree to contribute. If they do not agree, they could be taken to court for it to assess what a reasonable contribution would be. The partner who is not in care does not have to fill in a form when his or her partner is assessed. Partners should also be wary of signing declarations of liability for their spouse. Unmarried couples have no liability for each other, but again some councils have been using forms which refer simply to a 'partner's' savings or income. Age Concern says that the misapplication of the rules may be partly because some council employees carrying out assessments have not received adequate training, and have not had access to the Department of Health's guidance. Another area of difficulty is that for many couples, their main income is the husband's occupational pension. If he needs to go into a nursing home, the entire pension is assessed as his, with no allowance for the fact that his wife also depends on it. Unfortunately, this is correct according to the law. However, local authorities do have discretion to increase the amount of personal allowance deducted from a person's income before the rest is used to pay fees. This discretion could be used to allow the husband to support his wife at home while he is in care. Some of our readers have expressed concern that other relatives, such as sons and daughters, could find their own income, savings and property being taken into account to support elderly relatives in residential care. Under the act, relatives are not obliged to contribute towards nursing home fees, even if they were sharing their homes with the person going into care. They cannot be means-tested. However, before a person can be admitted to a home under the Care in the Community Act, the local authority has to assess their needs. If it feels that someone is being adequately looked after where he is, it can refuse to assess him as needing nursing home care, even if the carers feel they can no longer cope. This may give carers no alternative but to pay nursing home fees. Also, the local authority is not obliged to pay in full for a person in a home which charges more than its 'usual fee' - the amount it would normally expect to pay for a place in a home with a standard of care appropriate for a person with those needs. If you choose a home which charges more than the usual fee, when a cheaper place was available, you are obliged to find some way of making up the shortfall. This often involves asking relatives to pay the difference. The local authority's 'usual fee' has to be set in relation to actual fees in its area; if you think it is unreasonably low, you can complain. A survey of pensioners published by Eagle Star this week found that 70 per cent had made no financial provision for care they might need in future. Fewer than a third had any idea how much it would cost to be cared for in their own home or in a private nursing home. Many insurance companies now offer long term care insurance, which will cover the cost of nursing home care once you become incapacitated, but this is not available to the people in most imminent need. The market for such insurance is likely to grow as more people see their parents or other relatives experience the financial consequences of needing nursing home or residential home care.</p>

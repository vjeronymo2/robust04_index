			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo rules out private pay curb THE government has no intention of imposing an incomes policy on the private sector, Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday. However, in evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, he said the government had a right to point out the danger of high pay settlements in the environment caused by sterling's devaluation since the pound left the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16. Answering questions from Mr Nicholas Budgen, (Cons, Wolverhampton South West), Mr Portillo said past British devaluations had not produced the economic benefits people thought they might produce. He said British industry had granted its employees high real wage increases instead of winning increased orders. Speaking on the day after Mr John Major's Guildhall speech in which the prime minister urged business leaders to control executive pay, Mr Portillo said the government would not restrain private industry in its pay policies and had no intention of imposing its will on the private sector. Nevertheless, it could make statements of a 'broader sort' about pay, he said. Mr Portillo made clear that the government's position on public sector pay was quite different. One reason for its plan to limit pay settlements in the public sector to a maximum of 1.5 per cent was to resist cost pressures and so offer better services to business and the general public. In wide-ranging testimony, Mr Portillo provided an explanation for the sharp Pounds 1.16bn fall in payments to the European Community envisaged in the government's spending plans for 1993-94. The cut from earlier planned levels reflected: A reduced forecast for EC spending on agriculture. Expectations of substantially higher receipts from the farm guarantee fund following reform of the EC's common agricultural policy. A lower UK share of gross contributions to the Community reflecting a lower UK share of EC gross domestic product.</p>

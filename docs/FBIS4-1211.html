			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the IEC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 20 April]    [Text]  <H5>  Candidates' Lists </H5>   The list of candidates for the National Assembly and  provincial legislatures, published during the course of  Wednesday April 20 and Thursday 21, contains certain errors for  which the commission assumes responsibility.    Among these errors is that which the commission drew to the  attention of editors yesterday concerning the listing of the  African Christian Democratic Party [ACDP] under the provincial  list.    In column one of page 7, due to a typographical error, the  name of the ACDP was rendered as the Democratic Party, and its  leading candidate in the Eastern Cape, Mr Brian Court, was  listed above the party name, not below as it should have been.  We reiterate our apology for this error.    Additional anxiety was created for some voters because the  list appeared to leave the National Party out of the national  component of the list for the national assembly. This is not an  error. The National Party chose to place all its candidates on  regional lists, as it was permitted to do in terms of Schedule 2  to the Electoral Act, and this decision has no outcome on the  apportionment of seats to that party.    The National Party announced this decision at its federal  congress earlier this year. It is therefore asked to convey the  motivation for this decision to its supporters and others who  might enquire.    The commission points out that several parties asked for  postponements for the submission of their lists, and that in  many instances, parties were late in providing accurate  information to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]  regarding the identification and eligibility of candidates.  This required necessitated extensive re-checking by officials  of the election administration directorate, further delaying the  process of publication.    The list that was presented for publication was thus  compiled  under extreme pressure of time, and within hours of the  production deadlines that would enable the commission to provide  the list to the electorate via publication in newspapers  throughout the country. Had we delayed any longer, we might have  risked not being able to provide lists before the election.    The commission apologises for errors, asks both political  parties and votes to consider the difficult circumstances under  which errors happen, and wishes to make clear that these are not  the responsibility of the newspapers. The newspapers themselves  have performed an admirable task in printing the information  provided to them under great pressure of time, and serving as  carriers of the information to the electorate.

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLISH, HUNGARIAN ECONOMIC REFORMS OUTLINED FOR NATIONS AIDING EAST BLOC  </P> <P> Poland and Hungary today outlined their economic reforms at a meeting with 24  Western nations that are coordinating aid to prevent Eastern Europe's reforms  from being derailed by economic troubles.  </P> <P> In separate presentations, Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski and  Gyula Horn, his Hungarian counterpart, said their countries were creating  market-oriented economies.  </P> <P> Also, they said, they will soon conclude talks with the International Monetary  Fund for financial rescue packages that would free extra Western loans and help  in easing their huge foreign debts.  </P> <P> In return, the IMF insists that both countries adopt sound economic policies.  </P> <P> "One of our most important aims is to shape a healthy . . . enterprise  structure," Horn told the foreign ministers of the donor nations, including the  United States, the 12 European Community countries, Japan, Canada and  Australia.  </P> <P> Skubiszewski detailed efforts to "demonopolize" the Polish economy "by opening  wider the doors to free enterprise."  </P> <P> Hungary and Poland have been at the forefront of the democratic changes  reshaping Eastern Europe. Poland has the East Bloc's first non-Communist  premier, and Hungary has opened its borders, promised multiparty elections and  formally disbanded the Communist Party.  </P> <P> Sources said both East European officials were questioned by several  delegations about details of their economic reform programs and the measure of  support they have in Warsaw and Budapest.  </P> <P> The meeting was the first between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his  23 counterparts since President Bush and other world leaders suggested an aid  program for Eastern Europe at a summit meeting in Paris in July.  </P> <P> Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said today that the talks were "of  great significance."  </P> <P> "It is extremely important to remove . . . the economic hardships which  confront Poland and Hungary and to enhance the smooth implementation of the  economic reconstruction and development so that budding reform in the two  countries will develop unimpaired and finally bear fruit."  </P> <P> Nakayama said his government was prepared to offer $150 million to an economic  stabilization fund for Poland as soon as the Warsaw government reaches an  agreement with the IMF.  </P> <P> In Washington today, the White House announced that the United States will put  up $200 million toward a $500-million temporary loan for Poland as it awaits  economic help from the IMF.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lorenz Wolf-Doettinchem: "Bad Luck for </F> Populists"]    [Text] "When we come, the mark will stay" is the proud  message on Federation of Free Citizens posters. The party of  Eurocritic Manfred Brunner, former cabinet chief for EU  [European Union] Commissioner Martin Bangemann, wants to make  the 12 June European Parliament election a "plebiscite on  Maastricht." The Republikaner are following suit with their  appeal to the voters to "help us save the German mark." Because  the Maastricht opponents have the majority of citizens behind  them, the Bonn politicians, out of fear of an election defeat,  are offering almost nothing to counter the protest parties'  polemics. According to opinion surveys, between 50 and 80  percent of Germans--depending on the formulation of the  question--reject monetary union. East Germans in particular do  not want to give up the mark they acquired just three years ago.    For all that, the established parties could effortlessly  ally  the concerns of mark fans because the plan for a common currency  is turning out to be more and more a distant illusion:     -  The  timetable for monetary union, which according to the Maastricht  Treaty is to begin in 1997 at the earliest and by 1999 at the  latest, is much too ambitious.    -  Not a single EU country met the  stringent accession criteria last year; proliferating government  deficits in particular are becoming stumbling blocks to  Euromoney.    -  The Federal Constitutional Court's ruling on  Maastricht prohibits Germany from participating in a watering  down of the convergence criteria--yet monetary union without  German participation is hardly conceivable    -  In the coming years,  the political will for European integration will be tested in an  unprecedented election marathon in which nationalistic elements  could gain the upper hand--as has already happened in Italy.     Moreover, the practical problems involved in introducing a  common currency are proving to be treacherous as well. According  to Bundesbank Foreign Minister Helmut Schieber, the "technical  issues" involved with Euromoney are "more complicated than  expected." And, to be sure, while the European Monetary  Institute (EMI), which is supposed to prepare the introduction  of a common currency, started on time at the beginning of the  year, EMI President Alexandre Lamfalussy had to start almost at  ground zero because the Maastricht Treaty took effect nearly one  year late as a result of the ratification marathon. According to  central banker Schieber, the organizational work that really  should have been taken care of in 1993 can only now be caught up  on--"at the expense of substantive work."    Lamfalussy's little staff initially found shelter at the  Bank  for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel where the Committee  of EC Central Bank Presidents had already taken up residence.  The move to Frankfurt, the EMI's proper headquarters, continues  to be delayed. After a summer date was initially envisioned, the  first board meeting in the new domicile has now slipped to 15  November.    At the present time, the top 10 floors of the 36-story  former  BfG [Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft] high-rise--today the  "Eurotower"--are being refurbished to include an elegant  conference floor at the top of the tower. To be sure, the EMI  will certainly have to forego excessive luxury after the Eastern  Europe Bank in London wound up in the headlines as a result of  its excessive ostentatiousness and luxurious appointments. For  the startup, therefore, old office furniture was even borrowed  from the Bundesbank. Such unpretentiousness is entirely in  keeping with EMI chief Lamfalussy's style and this is not the  least of the reasons why the former BIS general manager was  chosen in the autumn of last year. By foregoing interviews  entirely, for example, the Belgian has accommodated Bundesbank  President Hans Tietmeyer who jealously guards his prerogatives  ("The EMI is not a central bank"). To date, the EMI has  published just a single report, and it deals with the rather  peripheral topic of "prepaid credit cards."    It is thus understandable that doubts are now arising as to  whether the EMI can become the "driving force" for the  implementation of monetary union as French Minister of Economy  Edmond Alphandery has called for. Thus far, EMI members have  tackled their Herculean task in the manner of good bureaucrats.  Experts of the 12 EU central banks are working on plans in three  committees and five subcommittees and the deeper they delve into  the problems, the more difficult the solutions seem. Example  bank notes: The Bundesbank needed nearly six years to design and  bring into circulation new paper money. Experience shows that a  European process of coordinating safety features, the design,  and the representation of national symbols, would certainly take  even longer. Example coinage: With the striking of Eurotalers,  all European coinage would be fully utilized for years. The  vending machine industry needs exact specifications for the  conversion to be provided expeditiously. Experts calculate a  conversion period of six to eight years. Example statistics:  Terms and definitions for banking and balance of payment systems  have to be harmonized. A Bundesbank statistician complains that  "entirely different concepts are still being used" in EU  countries. The conversion of foreign trade statistics in the  context of the European internal market has demonstrated how  great the chaos can become.    Closely related to statistics issues is the EMI's greatest  challenge: to devise a common monetary policy and to develop the  appropriate instruments for it. To date it has been taken for  granted that, after all the discussions have been concluded, the  German money supply concept--in more or less modified  form--would be adopted. Since the Bundesbank has apparently lost  control of the M3 money supply, however, doubts are increasing  as to whether Europe should pursue a money supply target at  all--particularly in view of the fact that this indicator has  failed in past years in the United States, Canada, and Great  Britain. Wuerzburg Professor Peter Bofinger believes that "the  Bundesbank's problem is becoming a European problem."    To introduce a new currency when monetary policy is flying  blind could quickly result in a crash. Before there can be any  progress in Europe, therefore, the Bundesbank must do its  homework: Why has the growth in the money supply--apart from all  special factors--been so immense in the last three years? Why  have the monetary regulators nonetheless been able to reduce  interest rates so sharply? Trier Professor Wolfgang Flic is  calling upon the monetary regulators to "reveal their  indicators," and monetary expert Bofinger--successor in the  professorship occupied by Bundesbank chief economist Otmar  Issing--complains: "The discussion regarding the proper monetary  policy is not being conducted in Germany."    For all that, the success of the guardians of the mark is  uncontested. Economics expert Wolfgang Franz, commenting on the  most recent 2.9-percent inflation figure for western Germany,  says "The Bundesbank has won the battle against inflation."  Monetary expert Bofinger sees a real opportunity for EMI in an  impartial investigation of the reasons for the currency  guardians' success, but Tietmeyer, Issing, and Co. are not yet  showing their cards. And EMI President Lamfalussy realistically  assesses the work that lies ahead of him: "It will not be an  easy task." Bad luck for populists--the mark does not yet have  to be saved.</p>

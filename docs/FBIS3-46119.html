At 0900 that day the leading comrades, including Gu Jinchi  and Yue Qifeng, came to the Dadong shopping center of nonstaple  foodstuffs. Gu Jinchi said: The state-owned nonstaple  foodstuffs stores should upgrade as much as possible their  commodity grade and service level as the Dadong shopping center  has done so as to saturate the people's demands. Yue Qifeng  said to (Wang Guofu), manager of the shopping center: Market  commodities for the Spring Festival this year are abundant and  commodity prices are stable. Staff members and workers on the  commercial front have done a great deal of work in this regard.  In this connection, we would like to extend thanks to them.    At 1000 that day, the leading comrades of the provincial and  Shenyang city organs came to the Commercial Building in the  center of Shenyang. At the central shopping center, they deeply  felt that the shopping center has more products turned out by  outside provinces than those turned out by our province. Yue  Qifeng said while picking up a sweater: Our province is totally  able to process such products and the leadership of our  enterprises should learn from their concept on markets, which  should produce what the markets need.    In the afternoon that day the provincial leaders also  visited  and saluted a number of enterprises and households of staff  members and workers in Tiexi district of Shenyang, which are  encountering special difficulties.</p>

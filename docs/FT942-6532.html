			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Gateway to Palestinian contracts The shaded, walled courtyard of the American Colony Hotel, in Arab East Jerusalem, is the starting point for foreigners who want to do business with Palestinians in the West Bank. It provides a good base, because Palestinians do not like to cross into the Jewish side of the city. However, if you also plan meetings on the Jewish side, be warned that many Israelis see the Colony as a hotbed of Palestinian 'terrorism'. By far the best hotel on the Arab side of the holy city, it serves traditional Arab and international cuisine throughout the day. From the Colony you can easily travel to the commercial centres of the West Bank - Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin and now Jericho - all of which are within an hour's drive of East Jerusalem. Jericho, which is in the process of becoming the administrative capital of Palestinian self-government, will soon be an essential place for any foreign businessman to visit. Travelling in the West Bank can be dangerous. Cars with yellow Israeli licence plates are often targets of stone-throwing youths, who assume the drivers are Jewish settlers. The best way to travel is in an Arabic taxi, which has different coloured licence plates and signs in Arabic. If you want to rent a car, go to Petra Rent a Car, in Shufat, which will deliver it to your doorstep and give you a mobile telephone if needed. Although most of its cars have yellow plates, they have big stickers on their sides in Arabic to deter potential stone-throwers. Another sensible precaution is to buy a Palestinian kefiyah - head scarf - and drape if over your dashboard. Having an Arabic fixer/translator is essential, although most Palestinian businessmen speak good English. A fixer can set up meetings, negotiate around a roadblock, and give a flavour of the political and religious sensitivities that infuse discussions in the Holy Land. He can also accompany you on a tour of the Old City, where otherwise you are almost certain to be fleeced by merchants in the bazaar. Most places in the West Bank accept dollars, Israeli shekels and Jordanian dinars. You can get a slightly better rate for foreign currency at money changers in East Jerusalem. Many foreigners use Nabil Freidy on Sallah'adin street, East Jerusalem's high street. Doing business in the Gaza Strip is more difficult. After years of repression, Gaza has become a deeply conservative and islamicised society. Travelling with yellow licence plates almost guarantees that you will be stoned. To get into Gaza, leave your car at the Erez checkpoint and transfer to a car with white plates. There are several taxis just past the checkpoint, but most of the drivers do not speak English. It is better to arrange a car with a translator beforehand. Many new hotels are being developed in Gaza, especially on the sea front where a cool breeze blows off the Mediterranean most nights. Many foreigners, however, prefer to stay at Marna House in central Gaza. Many important politicians and businessmen show up here in the evenings, and it is one of the rare places where guests can be served beer.</p>

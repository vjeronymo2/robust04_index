			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin on Tuesday [17 May] urged Japan and China to put the  remarks of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano behind them  and move forward with the development of friendly bilateral  relations for the future, Japanese officials said.    "Let's put the Nagano remarks in the past and move ahead  thinking of the future," Jiang told Wataru Kubo, secretary  general of Japan's No. 2 opposition party, the Social Democratic  Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ].    Kubo on Monday delivered a letter to Jiang from Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata expressing regret over Nagano's claim that  the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication.    Jiang told Kubo that he appreciated the apology from Japan.    Regarding concerns that North Korea may be trying to build a  nuclear arsenal, Kubo said he hopes the issue could be resolved  through dialogue and he had expectations for China's role in  unlocking the stalemate.    Jiang also hoped to see the issue resolved through  negotiations but cautioned the international community should  not overestimate China's influence on North Korea.    "Looking forward to a resolution through dialogue, China  hopes to play a positive role," Jiang said but added, "it is  unrealistic to overestimate China's role."    Jiang told Kubo that China, North Korea's only major ally in  the world, wants to see a stable Korean peninsula free of  nuclear arms.    Kubo is currently in China on an eight-day visit through  Sunday as head of an SDPJ delegation marking the 10th  anniversary of the party's exchanges with China's Communist  Party.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 2 February, in a report from the daily  "Details" program presented by Nikolay Svanidze, today outlined  the reasons why most of the State Duma is against Yeltsin's  visit to Georgia and claimed to have information that seven, not  three, Russian military bases could soon be set up on Georgian  territory.    "In fact, Yeltsin is returning to the position of Catherine  II, who regarded Georgia as the gateway to the Caucasus,"  Svanidze said, "and he has timed things perfectly -- Georgia is  ready to make concessions. Georgia simply has no choice but to  make concessions to Russia: Having suffered what amounts to  military defeat, threatened with economic disintegration and  hunger, with gangs on the rampage, and most of its' territory  out of control; Georgia could simply cease to exist.  Shevardnadze understands this and is ready to say `yes' to many  demands from Yeltsin."    The package of agreements on military cooperation to be  signed tomorrow has already "incurred wrath" in the northern  Caucasus, part of Russia, Svanidze said as the video cut to  President of Chechnya Dzhokhar Dudayev. Yeltsin, the  government, Russia's Foreign Ministry, and military leaders are  for union with Georgia. Most of the State Duma is against it,  he said. He then interviewed Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of  the State Duma committee for CIS affairs, who said a treaty  signed by Russia would mean that "Russia, having taken measures  to arm the Georgian Army, must at the same time prevent  Abkhazia's Armed Forces from arming itself, which creates a  one-sided situation that would engender a desire for revenge."    Armenia and Azerbaijan are waiting eagerly for the results  of  the Yeltsin visit to Georgia to see if Russia may also become "a  local UN" for them, Svanidze warned.    Opponents of the treaty on friendship and cooperation with  Georgia in the State Duma fear most "the very serious" level of  military assistance it implies, Svanidze said, pointing to  article three, in which Russia undertakes to help in the setting  up, strengthening, and equipping of the Georgian Army.    "The text of the treaty says nothing about military bases,"  Svanidze continued, "but we have information that a memorandum  will be signed during Yeltsin's meeting with Shevardnadze that  will start a negotiation process for the setting up of seven  Russian military bases on Georgian territory, I repeat seven;  initially, the issue was of three bases being set up. It is  precisely for this reason that the military, who were previously  against union with Georgia, now insist on it." Two of the bases  will be in Abkhazia -- one in Sukhumi, the other in Gudauta,  Svanidze added.    Zatulin concluded: "I would like to say, on the eve of the  visit by Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, that peace in the northern  Caucasus could be damaged."    The council of State Duma factions today approved a letter  to  Yeltsin asking him not to go to Tbilisi, or at least not to sign  the treaty, Svanidze said.</p>

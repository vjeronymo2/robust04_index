			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEW LAWYER HIRED FOR BRANDO;  </P> <P> KILLING: ATTORNEY DOES NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SEEKING A PLEA BARGAIN.  </P> <P> Christian Brando, the son of actor Marlon Brando, may seek to strike a plea  bargain with prosecutors to settle charges that he shot and killed the  boyfriend of his pregnant half-sister, his lawyer said Monday.  </P> <P> While no plea bargain negotiations have begun, a defendant entering such a deal  typically would either plead no contest to the charges or admit guilt to lesser  charges.  </P> <P> Word of the potential for a plea bargain came on the same day that criminal  defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro announced that he has been hired by the  defendant's father to replace civil rights lawyer William Kunstler as defense  counsel.  </P> <P> After a brief court appearance by Christian Brando, 32, Shapiro said it was "a  little premature" to hold plea bargain talks with prosecutors, but added,  "We're leaving everything open. We're not eliminating any possibilities."  </P> <P> He said the defense was conducting its own investigation of the case, in part  so that "we will have all the facts," if plea bargain discussions begin.  </P> <P> Shapiro said the defense investigation already has included a partial  reconstruction of the crime scene by "the country's most respected  criminalist." He declined to identify the specialist.  </P> <P> A second autopsy commissioned by the defense supports Christian Brando's  contention that the shooting was an accident, Shapiro said.  </P> <P> The New York-based Kunstler, a longtime friend of Marlon Brando, is not  experienced in murder cases and lost a bid on May 22 to have bail set for  Christian Brando.  </P> <P> Shapiro said Marlon Brando decided to hire him because he wanted a seasoned  criminal defense lawyer whose practice is based in Southern California.  </P> <P> "I really think (Kunstler) was called in just for the initial stages of the  case because of his relationship with Marlon," Shapiro said. He said Kunstler,  who was not available for comment, will continue to act as an adviser in the  case.  </P> <P> Christian Brando appeared in court Monday to schedule a preliminary hearing,  but the judge postponed the scheduling until June 25 to give Shapiro more time  to investigate the case.  </P> <P> The younger Brando is charged with shooting to death Dag Drollet, 26, the  boyfriend of Cheyenne Brando, in her father's 12-room estate in the Santa  Monica Mountains on May 16.  </P> <P> Police said the shooting occurred after Christian Brando accused Drollet of  beating his half-sister. Prosecutors said Drollet was shot in the back of the  head while watching television.  </P> <P> Christian Brando has admitted shooting Drollet, but said it was an accident  that occurred while he and Drollet were wrestling for the weapon, a .45-caliber  handgun, according to police.  </P> <P> Along with murder, Christian Brando, who remains in custody without bail, is  charged with illegally possessing a machine gun and a silencer. He has pleaded  innocent to all charges.  </P> <P> If convicted of first-degree murder, he could be sentenced to 25 years to life  in state prison. Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty.  </P></p>

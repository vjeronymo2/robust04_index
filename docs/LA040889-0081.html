			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERFAITH TV NETWORK EXPANDS ITS PROGRAMMING, INCLUDES SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> An interfaith television network, which started offering cable companies an  alternative to evangelical-fundamentalist programming last September, expanded  to a fuller schedule this week amid other signs of growth.  </P> <P> VISN, an acronym for Vision Interfaith Satellite Network, became available for  the first time this week in the Greater Los Angeles area -- through cable  franchises in the eastern San Fernando Valley and southern Orange County. It  also is seen in Oxnard.  </P> <P> And signaling strong Roman Catholic interest in the nationwide venture, Ed  Warren, a former syndication programming executive with Viacom and Columbia  Pictures Television, was hired as a key decision-maker on which Catholic shows  will be selected and developed for VISN. Warren started work in Los Angeles  this week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Widely Representative  </P> <P> The coalition of 21 faith groups is counting on its broadly representative  support and resources -- from Protestant, Catholic, Mormon and Jewish TV  production units -- to be an inviting choice for cable operators fed up with  heavy-handed TV preachers.  </P> <P> It doesn't hurt that VISN also has guidelines against proselytizing,  criticizing other religions and soliciting donations.  </P> <P> "I think people are at a point where they won't sit still for a half hour of  appeals for money," said Jeff Weber, programming vice president for the  nonprofit organization based in New York.  </P> <P> Weber described the current 15 1/2 hours of weekday programming (up from 5  hours) and 18 hours of weekend shows (up from 12 hours) as "a rich mix of  entertainment, music, drama, worship and public affairs" for people "interested  in mainstream religious and values-oriented telecasting."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Setbacks Expected  </P> <P> "All signs are very positive that we are going to be here for the long haul,"  Weber said.  </P> <P> He doubted that VISN would face the kind of setbacks suffered by a 5-year-old  satellite television network run by the Southern Baptists, the nation's largest  Protestant denomination.  </P> <P> The Southern Baptist Radio and Television Commission, which at one point spent  $600,000 more on fund-raising efforts than it received, recently has been  trying to sell ACTS (American Christian Television System), which is $8 million  in debt. But a group of San Antonio investors failed last month to meet  financial requirements, prompting ACTS to cut its Fort Worth-based staff by  20%.  </P> <P> Although it has some programs produced by other denominations, ACTS has a  largely Southern Baptist-oriented fare, including two hours of live call-in  counseling five days a week. It currently has a 24-hour schedule and its  programs can be seen in 9 million households, said Dick McCartney, ACTS  executive director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costly Operation  </P> <P> VISN may yet encounter difficulties, McCartney said. "Given the cost of  providing 24 hours service and the necessary people and promotion, it will be  an awfully uphill battle to make it and keep cable companies interested," he  said in a telephone interview.  </P> <P> However, VISN's Weber said, "We are gaining support within the cable industry  because the companies understand that we are broadly representative."  </P> <P> Another important difference is that VISN is selling its service to companies  for 3 cents per subscriber.  </P> <P> "For religious programming that is absolutely novel," said Bill Airy of  Albuquerque, N.M., VISN director of affiliate relations. ACTS offers its  programs free and some networks, such as Trinity Broadcasting Network, based in  Tustin, pay cable companies to carry the programs, Airy said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 9 Million by December  </P> <P> According to an internal projection, VISN officials expect to be available in  3.5 million households this month and in 9 million by December -- equal to  ACTS' present total.  </P> <P> Dimension Cable, a southern Orange County cable operator and a subsidiary of  Times Mirror Co., added VISN this week to the same channel that had been used  exclusively by TBN. Dimension, which has 100,000 customers, made the move  despite its survey of 450 subscribers indicating that if programming were  added, they were the least interested in religious programs of any kind,  according to a company official.  </P> <P> VISN likewise began Monday for 50,000 customers of United Cable in eastern San  Fernando Valley, but it will share a channel with Prime Ticket, according to  Bill Cullen, president. VISN, which begins at 7:30 a.m. (PDT) on weekdays and 5  a.m. (PDT) on Saturday and Sunday, yields to Prime Ticket in the evening hours.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Subjects  </P> <P> The programming includes "All in Good Faith," a British comedy series about an  Anglican vicar who moves his family to a demanding urban parish; "The Long  Search," a Time/Life documentary that explores various faiths; "Hard  Decisions," an ecumenically produced series examining business, medical and  legal ethical questions; "Faces on Faith," interviews with religious figures  such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Daniel Berrigan and Harvey Cox;  "magazine"-format shows produced by the United Methodist Church, the  Seventh-day Adventists and the Council of Jewish Federations, and old movies  accompanied by discussions of issues they raise.  </P> <P> Two syndicated religious dramas already seen on broadcast channels -- the  Paulist Productions' "Insight" and the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod's "This  Is the Life" -- also show up on the schedule.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Catholic Links  </P> <P> VISN appeared to be spurned last June by the U.S. Catholic Bishops, who voted  to channel their officially sponsored programs exclusively to Mother Angelica's  independent Eternal Word Television Network based in Birmingham, Ala. In doing  so, the bishops voted down a proposal to negotiate for participation in VISN.  </P> <P> However, the leading producers of Catholic TV programs formed an independent  group to offer their services to VISN.  </P> <P> "Officials of the U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington have privately assured  us they are in favor of our effort," said Father Anthony Scannell, president of  the Franciscan Communications Center in Los Angeles and a board member of  Catholic VISN Producers. Scannell said the newly formed group may produce  investigative and daring "frontier" programs that they would not otherwise be  able to do if they were under the direction of the bishops.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broadcasting Veteran  </P> <P> To select the best of existing Catholic productions and develop new shows, the  producers group enlisted broadcasting veteran Warren, 63, a member of St.  Jude's parish in Westlake Village who studied in Catholic colleges and once  headed the communications department at St. Mary's College at South Bend, Ind.  </P> <P> "I took the job because (VISN's) need coincides with my own personal philosophy  and my desire to use my experience," Warren said in his freshly painted, but  decidedly unpretentious office at the Franciscan center in Los Angeles' garment  district.  </P> <P> Warren said he was interested in more than religious programs. "I'd like to see  human interest programs and ways to show how Catholics have contributed to  history and culture as well," he said.  </P> <P> After heading programming departments at major stations and network offices in  New York, including six years with ABC, Warren directed TV syndication for  Viacom and Columbia until the mid-1980s when he went into consulting work.  </P> <P> Scannell, in praising Warren, said: "I'm not aware of anyone else in VISN who  has someone of this caliber in charge of programming."  </P> <P> Of VISN, Scannell said: "It's the most hopeful thing on the horizon because of  the diminishing free time for religious programs on broadcast stations and the  rising costs of buying time."  </P></p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: German labour costs almost double UK level  -BMW/Rover Deal Germany has the highest total motor industry labour costs in the developed world while the UK has the lowest according to a study by the German auto industry, writes Kevin Done. German costs at DM49.6 (Pounds 19) per hour in 1993 were almost double the UK's level of DM25.6 according to figures from the German automobile federation (VDA), which exclude South Korea. The gulf in labour costs between Germany and theUK underlines a key part of the strategy behind BMW's Pounds 800m takeover of Rover,the leading UK volume carmaker, announced on Monday. The acquisition gives the German executive and luxury carmaker access, for the first time, to a low-cost production base in Europe. As a result of the takeover BMW has abandoned its earlier plan to develop a small car for sale under the BMW badge. It has decided to make Rover the European centre for the production of small and medium-sized front wheel drive cars. They will be under the Rover, rather than the BMW, badge. The UK position at the bottom of the labour costs league is the result of the very low level of social costs, such as payroll tax or nationalinsurance. UK social costs accounted for only 27 per cent of total wage costs, compared with 43 per cent in Germany. The appreciation of the D-Mark and the yen against many other European currencies and the dollar have had a substantial impact on the competitiveness of leading vehicle producing countries. Japanese carmakers now have the highest gross wage levels in the world's auto industry at DM34.3 per hour, compared with DM28.5 in Germany, DM18.7 in the UK and only DM12.9 in Italy. Total Japanese wage costs are still 16 per cent lower than the German level, however, thanks to a much lower social costs. Japanese carmakers have rapidly built up a large production presence in North America and Europe. Three of the leading Japanese producers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda, have chosen the UK as the location for their first European car plants. UK car production rose by 6.5 per cent last year in contrast to sharp falls in most continental European countries and is forecast to show the strongest increase during the whole of the 1990s chiefly as a result of rising Japanese output. The biggest improvement in competitiveness in total labour costs last year came in the UK, Spain, Italy and Sweden largely as a result of the devaluation of these countries' currencies against the D-Mark and the yen. Italy now has the second lowest total labour costs after the UK, but it is still 6 per cent above the UK level, because of much higher social costs, which are more than double the UK level.</p>

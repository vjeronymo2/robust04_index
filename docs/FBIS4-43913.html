			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Rwanda/Italy: Defense Minister </F> Asked To Appear Before Senate"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 23 -- The chairman of the Senate  foreign affairs committee, Raffaelle Bertoni of the opposition  Progressive group, has requested that Defense Minister Cesare  Previti respond first to parliament before any decisions are  made concerning the eventual deployment of Italian troops in any  mission in Rwanda.    "The government must inform Parliament before any decision  is  made on a military intervention in Rwanda" he said, adding "this  is the only seat where the (mission) objectives can be fully  examined as well as the risks for our troops which could derive  from decisions made in haste or without due reflection."    "Thus Minister Previti, who for some time has promised to  illustrate to the Senate defense committee the guidelines of his  policy" Senator Bertoni added, "should now quickly fulfill this  commitment, to communicate the government's intentions regarding  the conflict in Rwanda."    "It is inadmissible" he concluded, "that Parliament must be  limited to only information relayed through the media and not  put in the position to express its views on such an important  question through a meeting with the minister."    Defense Minister Cesare Previti confirmed later that Italy  could participate in an eventual humanitarian mission on the  condition that it be multi-national and for peaceful purposes.    Speaking to the press before entering a cabinet meeting, the  minister told the press how such a multi-national peace mission  would have to be commanded by an authority which was above any  national level or interest.    Italy, Previti added, "is taking part in diplomatic  negotiations" for such a solution and that his defense minister  was raising no objection to such a project.    The United Nations Security Council last night gave its  green  light to a French-led humanitarian mission.    Opposition Progressive groups in both the Senate and the  House have asked that Previti appear in their competent  committees to illustrate the new defense model. In a joint  statement issued today, Senate Progressive whip Cesare Salvi and  House whip Luigi Berlinguer and the respective committee  chairmen Loreto and Ruffino, also asked that the matter also be  subject to a floor debate.    The Progressives went on to point out how the new government  has been in power for some six weeks and has yet to illustrate  its policies to parliament for discussion. "This becomes even  more subject to criticism" they stated, "given that during the  confidence debate the government dealt with security and defense  policies in a generic and brief way."    In reference to statements made by Previti on Rwanda, the  Progressives underscored how "Even on such topics the minister  did not feel it was opportune to inform the parliament committee  of his intentions. Such behavior is not adapted to our  parliamentary democracy."</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Slow ahead for privatisation of Greek groups GREEK privatisation, beset with legal obstacles, political opposition and union resistance, is making painfully slow progress. The diversity of state-controlled assets for sale in 1990 created problems for the government in setting priorities for disposal. The 200 or so companies on offer amounted to a cross-section of the economy, ranging from small textile and white goods producers to major concerns like shipyards, banks and cement makers. To underline the official commitment to transparency, the government selected prestigious international banks to advise on disposals, but often with considerable delay. Credit Suisse First Boston has done best, advising on the sale of a 35 per cent strategic stake in OTE, the state telecommunications company, and also acting as joint global co-ordinator, with J. Henry Schroder Wagg, for the flotation of another 14 per cent of the company on the Athens stock exchange. CSFB is also advising the government on the sale of two state-owned oil refineries and the National Bank of Greece on disposing of several luxury resort hotels. NM Rothschild, the government's overall adviser on privatisation, was given the job of co-lead manager for the international tranche of the telecommunications group IPO. However, the foreign advisers failed to persuade the government to set clear regulations for the privatisation process. As a result, disposals were at first carried out piecemeal. It was not until Mr Stefanos Manos, a keen advocate of unbundling the state, took over both the economy ministry and the privatisation portfolio that the pace of disposals picked up. To date, about 70 companies have been unloaded, raising Dr200bn (Dollars 850m), of which Dr124bn came from the sale of Heracles General Cement to Calcestruzzi, a subsidiary of Italy's Ferruzzi group. This year's budget target for privatisation revenues is Dr330bn, to be covered by the sale of OTE and the two refineries. While most sales so far have been direct, the Athens stock exchange is becoming a vehicle for disposals. The government recently sold a 37 per cent stake in Hellenic Sugar, the state sugar producer, for Dr7.1bn. Two more state banks will be privatised through the bourse this year, following the sale by public tender of Bank of Athens to Korea's Hanwha group for Dr6.2bn. However, plans to sell a 49 per cent stake in Olympic Airways, the state carrier, are on hold while the airline is being restructured. Moreover, both major sales in 1992 have run into problems that will affect future disposals. Heracles will probably be put up for sale again later this year because of Ferruzzi's political and financial difficulties. At Eleusis Shipyards, sold by Commercial Bank for Dollars 12m to NJ Peratikos, a London-based Greek shipping group, labour problems, left unresolved in the interests of bringing off the sale, have intensified since the new owners took over. This has proved a deterrent to other leading Greek shipowners being courted by the government to take over Hellenic Shipyards, the state-owned yard. Even the OTE sale is developing into a cliffhanger, with the government being forced to delay the passage of enabling legislation, which would transfer management to the strategic investor, because of opposition from a faction in the ruling conservative party. However, if either the sale or flotation, where the international tranche amounts to 5 per cent, fall victim to additional delay, bidders may turn to other international telecommunications offerings, dealing a heavy blow to Greek credibility in financial markets.</p>

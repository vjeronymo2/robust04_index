			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fletcher Challenge sees return to full-year profit FLETCHER Challenge, the New Zealand forest products and energy group, expects to return to profit this year following strong first-half gains. The company forecasts profits of NZDollars 200m (USDollars 103m) for the year ending June, 1993 on the back of positive factors in most of its operations. For 1991-1992 the group made a loss of NZDollars 158m after writing down its Australian property portfolio. As reported in late editions yesterday, the six months ended December achieved earnings of NZDollars 153.5m excluding abnormal items, up from NZDollars 121m a year ago. Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said the result reflected good performance in energy, both in New Zealand and Canada, a strong recovery in its New Zealand operations, an improving trend in Canada, and continued growth in sales to Asia, which reached NZDollars 1bn for the first time. The group had also achieved a significant reduction in its interest expenses and improved the cash flows from existing businesses. Mr Fletcher pledged that the company, which was widely criticised in 1991 and 1992 for continuing to expand rather than repay debt, would not make any further acquisitions until it had improved its international investment grade ratings. He said a number of further assets were to be sold, including nearly all its investment properties in New Zealand. Discussing the future, Mr Fletcher said the company saw 'reasonable ' growth prospects in New Zealand, North America and Asia, excluding Japan. 'We expect conditions in Britain and Australia to be difficult, but to show continuing improvement,' he said. Mr Fletcher said an aggressive restructuring programme was under way with the company concentrating on expanding output, reducing employees and developing new products to increase profitability. He said that despite these improvements a recovery in prices is necessary to restore profitability. He said the immediate outlook was that with the exception of methanol and wood pulp, most of the company's products and services appeared to have reached the bottom of their cyclical trough, and had begun an upward movement.</p>

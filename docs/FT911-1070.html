			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Cry, the unloved continent: Why devastation and famine are continuing to afflict Africa Last week a Belgian air force C130 transport aircraft, the only one making daily relief flights from Nairobi of life-saving food and medicines into war-torn Somalia, was transferred to the Kurdish relief effort. It was a cruel illustration of the marginalisation of sub-Saharan Africa in a world starting to tire of Africa's plight, even before competing demands for attention and resources came from eastern Europe, Kuwait and Iraq, and now Bangladesh. For every Kurdish refugee facing cold and starvation in Iraq, Iran and Turkey there are at least 15 Africans fighting famine in the drought-devastated lands of Africa. From Liberia to Mozambique, nearly 30m Africans are estimated to be at risk from starvation. Thousands are dying. The final toll threatens to overtake Ethiopia's losses of up to 1m people in the 1984-85 famine, which prompted Bob Geldof's unprecedented fund-raising drive, Band Aid. It is, say aid workers, the biggest disaster to threaten sub-Saharan Africa, already debilitated by decades of conflict and mismanagement, and burdened with a Dollars 161bn external debt it cannot repay. Could the suffering have been avoided? Or is Africa doomed to unending crises requiring the world's intervention? The answer to the first question is a qualified yes, particularly if the United Nations and the west had been prepared to play as assertive a role in Africa as they are now in Iraq. While if current peace efforts succeed, an end could be in sight to at least some of the civil wars which are at the heart of Africa's agony. For the first time governments and rebel movements are starting seriously to look for solutions at the negotiating table and not on the battlefield. A combination of war weariness, the superpower rapprochement that is bringing an end to fighting by proxy, and a surge of support across the continent for multi-party systems, has helped create a climate for talks. Last week rival parties initialled a settlement of Angola's 16-year-old conflict; this week the Mozambique government and the rebel Renamo movement resume peace talks; US and Soviet officials, once bitter rivals in the Horn of Africa, are currently playing a leading role in efforts to end civil wars in Ethiopia. But success will come too late for hundreds of thousands caught up in a long-predicted catastrophe. Since last September it has been well known that a serious drought and crop failure was looming across Africa. African regimes bear much of the responsibility for the suffering of their people. Dictatorships and uncaring rebel groups, blinded by pride and a lust for power, have prepared the ground for the crisis, while war then made a successful relief effort impossible. Inappropriate agricultural and economic policies, corruption, diversion of resources and personnel to the war effort, have all exacerbated the natural disaster of drought. But outsiders also share the blame for the human catastrophe. Inadequate aid, frustration at a continent where disaster seems never-ending, and putting political considerations above humanitarian obligations have all compounded the crisis. US patronage of corrupt and authoritarian regimes such as Liberia and Somalia has been matched by Soviet support for Ethiopia, while Angola suffered under the attention of both superpowers. But wherever the responsibility lies, the world's humanitarian response has been inadequate. Aid workers lay part of the blame on competing demands both on media attention as well as donors' pockets. But 'aid fatigue' is only part of the problem. If any lesson is to be learned from this crisis, say aid workers, it involves a fundamental reassessment of how the international community deals with African regimes which put a president's power ahead of his people's welfare. Two crucial questions arise, aid workers and diplomats maintain. Does the world place political considerations ahead of the delivery of humanitarian assistance - judging, for example, that aid would simply extend the life of a repugnant regime? And how far should the international community go in overriding a nation's sovereignty when its government has demonstrated it is incapable of feeding its own people. The cases of two famine-hit African states leaves opinion divided. In Sudan aid workers are battling to deliver food to 7m people facing starvation. Even with help from the government, reaching most of the people would have been a Herculean task. Roads are poor, the railways and ports inefficient, and the transport fleet is dilapidated. But help has not been forthcoming. Since last September, donors have had to deal with an extremist Islamic government, with a notorious human rights record, and which belatedly appealed for help too late to avert loss of life. Khartoum consistently underplayed the disaster as a 'mere food gap', harassed aid agencies and denied them travel permits, and labelled talk of famine an attempt to undermine the government. Complex negotiations about the mechanics of the relief operation - particularly who would distribute the food and how much would go to the rebel-held south - seriously delayed the delivery of food, now beginning to trickle in. Many aid workers are now asking a painful question: 'Should we save 500,000 Sudanese people this year, and give the government another five years of power, where every year there will be another disaster?' said one senior UN official. 'Or should we let them die and hope to get rid of the government? Which is the better in the long term?' Mr Kosti Manibe, deputy general secretary of the Sudan Council of Churches, strongly disagrees with this hard-headed stance: 'That is immoral and it may not achieve its purposes. 'The whole question of sovereignty needs to be addressed for Sudan as in Iraq,' he said. 'If a regime has proved absolutely intransigent, has used food as a political weapon, and is incapable of feeding its own people, the option of the international community should not be abdication and indifference, but intervention. The precedent set in Iraq should be applied to Africa, where the situation is more grave.' The world community, however, shows no sign of treating the action to save the Kurds as a precedent. In Somalia, scene of continued warfare between the country's main clans, relief efforts are almost non-existent despite a growing shortage of food and medicine. When the civil war engulfed the capital in late December, the UN, western governments and all but one of the aid agencies evacuated their personnel. The absence of a relief effort to date is a sign that the international community's patience has been exhausted by the continued bloody fighting and the lack of a political settlement between the warring parties. 'Frankly the security situation precludes any on-the-ground American official presence,' said Mr Jack Davison, director of the US State Department's Office for East African Affairs. Dr Husein Mursal, the Mogadishu director of the Save the Children fund, disagrees. 'Something could have been done in Somalia in the last four months,' he says. 'If they were worried about the security of UN personnel they could have employed Somalis. At least they could have organised an airdrop of bandaging material and essential drugs to combat measles, malaria and tetanus.' Dr Mursal claims that Unicef, the United Nations children's fund, has been 'sitting on millions of dollars, waiting to act. By the time they come in everybody will be dead.' Yet the issue of sovereignty versus what many see as a moral obligation to mount a humanitarian effort is complex. 'The problem since the overthrow of (former President) Barre is that the country has divided into three factions,' says Mr Fred Eckhart, a UN spokesman: 'For the UN to deal with any one of these factions would imply political support from the UN, or international recognition.' 'You can't do business like that in Africa,' replies Mr Abdul Mohammed, an expert of relief in the Horn of Africa, arguing that the realities on the ground make contact essential. Further, he argues that the Kurdish relief operation has undermined the whole concept that aid operations must respect sovereignty and require the consent of the recipient country's government. 'But in Africa, where there is a greater disaster, the UN still behaves as the last hide-out of sovereignty . . . manipulated and paralysed by regimes which have no legitimacy or respect from their own people. 'The UN's instinctive reaction to crisis is to evacuate. People are dying and the niceties of international politics should be meaningless to an organisation which is supposed to respond quickly to humanitarian needs.' While no end is in sight to the war in Somalia, Angola's example demonstrates that seemingly intractable conflicts offer hope for peace in Africa and an important prospective role for the international community. Last week the MPLA government, led by President Eduardo dos Santos, and Dr Jonas Savimbi's Unita rebel movement initialled an agreement paving the way for a ceasefire and multi-party elections in 18 months. Essential to the agreements are provision for international monitoring of the process. Yet questions about the level of support the outside world will provide have elicited a cautious response from western diplomats. Even without massive assistance, however, in the form of thousands of monitoring personnel, the transition process will be under acute strain. Without outside help, it may well fail. If the west and the UN are really serious, say an increasing number of Africa's diplomats and politicians, they should play a prominent mediating role in other African conflicts. Outsiders cannot impose solutions, officials say, but they can play a part ranging from honest brokers to neutral monitors of ceasefires and elections. A negotiated settlement to Africa's wars, they argue, goes to the heart of an anti-famine strategy. At the same time, the recovery efforts for the rest of the continent, where most governments are implementing economic reform programmes, must be backed by a combination of debt relief and new resources. These resources should be tied - as many African governments now accept - to what the World Bank calls 'better governance' - the introduction of democracy and accountability. Proposals designed to head off disaster generally meet a sceptical response. Strategic food stockpiles in Africa are difficult to maintain and prone to abuse. African diplomats acknowledge that all this may be expecting too much from the west - though pointing out that the UN-endorsed mobilisation for the Gulf war and the Kurdish relief effort have shown what can be done if the political will exists. But the alternative, they warn, is grim. The cost of inaction in Africa will not simply be more famines and more African governments imploding, ceasing to exist as nation states, as in the case of Somalia and Liberia. It will be an unhealthy Africa, they argue, which ultimately means an unhealthy world. Environmental damage on the continent, further migration into southern Europe from north Africa, the spread of Aids, all have potentially disastrous implications, albeit some years away, for the rest of the world. 'It may well be,' said one participant at a recent gathering of aid officials and politicians, 'that only when the west fears for the welfare of its own next generation will it be sufficiently motivated to address Africa's disaster.'</p>

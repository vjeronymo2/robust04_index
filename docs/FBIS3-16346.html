The amendments mainly apply to the procedure for  voting on confidence in the government, either initiated by the  republic's legislature or the head of state.    According to the document, the head of state or one fifth of  deputies are entitled to initiate a vote of confidence in the  government. The decision on the issue will be taken by a  majority of the total number of deputies.    After nearly a year of discussion, the deputies passed a law  on arms Tuesday. According to the law, all individuals will  have the right to keep properly registered smoothbore arms at  home.    As for legal entities, the Georgian Interior Ministry may  give them permission to posess handguns. All individuals will  be entitled to carry CS gas pistols. The law will come into  force on May 15, 1994.    At a proposal by Eduard Shevardnadze, the consideration of  the composition of the government was put off for a week.  Shevardnadze said he would submit a final list of the members  of a future government.</p>

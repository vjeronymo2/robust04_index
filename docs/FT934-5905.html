			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Advertisers threatened by ITV changes Sir, The potential losers from the government's decision to relax the ownership restrictions between the ITV companies are the very people who pay for the programmes - the advertisers ('Battle begins for future of ITV', November 25). Viewers' interests are safeguarded by the statutory powers of the licensing authority, the Independent Television Commission, but the inevitable concentration of ITV ownership which will ensue could, if unchecked, limit the current choice available to advertisers. The most radical aspect of the government's 1990 Broadcasting Act was not the auction for franchises. It was the abolition of the ITV monopoly of airtime sales, putting Channel 3 in competition with Channel 4 (and, to a tiny extent, satellite). That freeing up of the vital, wealth-creating television advertising market is now under threat. ITV is still the dominant force with a share of more than 70 per cent of all advertising revenue. Against some predictions, Channel 4 has provided real competition; but our ability to compete effectively as the minnow in the pond hangs on the ITC's rules that no individual ITV sales operation can offer for sale more than 25 per cent of ITV's total revenue. The government, the ITC, the advertisers and those charged with ensuring fair trading conditions must not allow concentration of ownership to undermine the 25 per cent rule which is the advertisers' only guarantee of choice in a lopsided market.

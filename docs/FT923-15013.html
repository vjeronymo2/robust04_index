			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: TI and Dowty integration starts TI GROUP, which last month successfully bid for Dowty, has announced the first phase of a corporate reorganisation to integrate the aerospace and information technology group. Mr Bruce Ralph, Dowty's former chief executive who left the Dowty board on Thursday, will remain as a consultant to Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI's chairman and chief executive. Mr Roy Roberts, Dowty chairman, and Mr Reg Moore, finance director, have already resigned from the board. The reorganisation will lead to the closure of Arle Court House, Dowty's headquarters outside Cheltenham where the company's founder George Dowty built the business that supplied landing gear to all makes of RAF aeroplane that flew in the second world war. TI made the announcement, which will mean 70 job losses, to clarify local uncertainty about the future of the company which has long been the area's largest private sector employer. While reorganisation of Dowty's operating businesses is being examined there are as yet few changes in the operating structure. Mr Norman Askew and Mr Jim Lightfoot, respectively TI's and Dowty's managing director of aerospace, remain in charge of separate companies based in Abingdon and Cheltenham. Both will report to Mr Sid Taylor, TI's chief operating officer. 'This is not the final picture,' TI said. 'Sid Taylor will sit down and discuss how best to run the aerospace division in the longer term.' Mr Lewinton said he had been impressed with the quality of Dowty. 'All that we have learned about Dowty so far confirms that our strategy of concentration on its core specialist engineering businesses is well founded.' TI is negotiating with a number of people who had expressed an interest in the information technology business which TI said it would sell if it won the bid. 'We do not drag our feet. We want to concentrate all our efforts on the core business of Dowty.'</p>

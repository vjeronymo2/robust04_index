			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Margreet Bloemers: "Plants Make New Ecological </F> Raw Material"]    [Text] Molecular biologists have succeeded in genetically  modifying plants so that they can produce large quantities of  high- polymer fructans. These fructose polymers offer new  industrial possibilities which were inconceivable using  conventional glucose polymer starch. The Van der Have refining  company is investigating whether the production of fructans is  economically profitable.    Fields of sugar beet stretching as far as the eye can see.  This is how the future looks if we make everything from sugar,  from phosphate substitutes in detergents to plastics components.  Theoretically, sugars are cheap raw materials which are easily  decomposed in the environment. However, one problem is that not  all sugars are equally suitable for use as building blocks for  new products. So far, starch, which is easily recoverable, has  been used with varying degrees of success. Recent results  obtained by Dr. Sjef Smeekens' research team (Molecular Cell  Biology research group at the University of Utrecht) bring  high-polymer fructans within the reach of industry.    Smeekens obtained the high-polymer fructans by transferring  a  gene from the bacteria Bacillus subtilis to plants. Only a  limited number of plants produce fructan with a chain length of  between 10 and a few 100 fructose units. Certain bacteria,  including types in our oral flora, can easily produce fructans  consisting of 100,000 units. The genetically engineered plants  are now equaling this performance.    Delft University carbohydrate chemistry Professor Herman van  Bekkum welcomes this discovery under the motto: "The longer the  chain, the better. The very fact that you can safely cut up the  raw material or make derivatives from it gives you far more  possibilities."  <H5>  Spin-off </H5>   The fructan-producing plants came about more or less as a  spin-off of the fundamental research carried out by Smeekens.  He investigated how the end products of photosynthesis, such as  glucose, fructose, and sucrose, are processed by plants. An  increasing concentration of sugar in the cell may possibly  inhibit photosynthesis and therefore the growth of the plant.  By studying the effect of various types of sucrose  polymerization on photosynthesis, you obtain a clear picture of  this inhibition.    Using genetic engineering, the researchers endow the plant  cell with enzymes which can produce specific types of sugar  chains, for example fructans. If a plant is to produce an alien  sugar chain without problems, it is also important that the  increase in this chain takes place in the right place (in the  cytosol, the vacuoles, or in the extra-cellular environment  itself). To ensure that this happens, the genetic information  about the storage location of the final sugar chain is  controlled, as well as the gene which codes for a specific  polymerization enzyme. By combining these properties, Smeekens'  group was the first to succeed in making plants produce  high-polymer sugars.    In follow-up research funded by the EC and other  institutions, Smeekens will delve further into the possibilities  of the technique. "We want to condition the polymerization  enzyme in such a way that specific polymerization occurs. This  means that we can also produce sugars other than fructans.  Ultimately, we can make any plant produce any sugar."  <H5>  Scaling Up </H5>   The SON and STW [Technical Sciences Foundation], which are  financing the research, have now filed a patent application for  the principle of producing specific sugars using genetically  engineered plants. Furthermore, the Zeeland-based Van der Have  company has bought the operating rights. Research leader Cees  Noome believes it is now time to select a suitable crop (sugar  beet or chicory for example), so that the high-polymer fructans  can be profitably produced.    Noome says we will have to wait and see whether a useful  result will be produced quickly. "Such long-term projects are  risky because of the many stages involved in producing an ideal,  stable strain. It will be a few years before we can say we have  an industrially useful raw material."</p>

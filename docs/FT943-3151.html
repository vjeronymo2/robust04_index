			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Country Casuals chief quits over contract terms Country Casuals, the clothing retailer, yesterday announced the departure of its chairman and chief executive, Mr John Shannon, just a day after the group saw more than a fifth of its market value wiped out following a profits warning. The group said Mr Shannon resigned when the board refused to extend his contract. It is believed that Mr Shannon, who was on a one-year rolling contract, had pressed for a two-year deal. He will be replaced as chief executive by Mr Mark Bunce, finance director. Mr Tom Adam becomes non-executive chairman. Mr Shannon was one of three directors who bought Country Casuals from Coats Viyella as part of a management buy-out in 1989. He was on a salary of Pounds 106,000, with a one-year rolling contract, and is expected to receive a payment of at least Pounds 145,000.</p>

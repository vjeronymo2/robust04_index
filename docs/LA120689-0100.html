			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHEVRON ASKS ITS BANKS NOT TO LOAN TO RAIDERS;  </P> <P> TAKEOVERS: THE ENERGY COMPANY IS QUIETLY TAKING STEPS TO DEAL WITH A POSSIBLE  HOSTILE BID.  </P> <P> Chevron Corp., which has been the subject of takeover rumors for weeks, has  asked its banks not to lend money to potential raiders, the latest move in what  is emerging as a sub rosa anti-takeover strategy.  </P> <P> As part of its attempt to arrange a $5-billion revolving credit line, San  Francisco-based Chevron is seeking assurances that its banks will not lend to  outsiders buying up Chevron shares, according to sources close to the bank  talks.  </P> <P> Chevron spokesman Larry Shushan declined to comment, as did officials of many  of Chevron's banks.  </P> <P> The energy company has steadfastly refused to discuss rumors that it is the  target of a takeover or forced restructuring by Pennzoil Co. or other  companies, but such speculation has driven Chevron's stock to new highs in  weeks of heavy trading.  </P> <P> Despite its unwillingness to discuss possible takeover threats, the company has  taken steps to deal with them. Last week, Chevron announced the creation of a  $1-billion employee stock ownership plan that would raise the percentage of  shares in employee hands to 16% from 11%, which, under Delaware law, would  allow them to block a takeover. Chevron is incorporated in Delaware.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a banker for one of Chevron's foreign-based lenders called  Chevron's request for assurances "highly unusual" but said in an interview that  many of the energy company's lenders would probably agree to it.  </P> <P> "Maybe not some of the American money center banks, but certainly the European  and Asian banks probably will," added the banker, who asked not to be  identified.  </P> <P> The banker said the request is still under negotiation. Chevron is trying to  line up the $5-billion line of credit for "general corporate purposes," which  would include financing a war chest against raiders, the banker said. Chevron  has business relationships with about 30 banks.  </P> <P> The trade journal American Banker reported that banks expected to take part in  the credit line include the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, Bank of Nova Scotia  and Royal Bank of Canada.  </P> <P> Despite Chevron's anti-takeover moves, many analysts and investors continue to  discount the possibility of a serious bid for the massive oil company, a bid  that could cost as much as $35 billion. Despite weeks of rumors, no sizable new  investor has emerged.  </P></p>

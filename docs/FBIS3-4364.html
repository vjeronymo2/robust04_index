On the Polish part, the session was chaired by Minister of  Transport and Maritime Economy Boguslaw Liberadzki and on the  Chinese by Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Wu  Yi.    The commission, that had assembled for the first time in  1991, assessed positively the renewed rise in Polish-Chinese  turnover over the past three years. Last year, its value  amounted to 397 million dollars, according to Poland, and to 472  million dollars, according to China, and was higher by 125 per  cent as compared with 1992.    The protocol signed by the commission on Monday shows that  mining, power, aviation, electronic, light, chemical and food  processing industries and transport offered the greatest  opportunities for the development of Polish-Chinese economic  cooperation. Working groups are to seek concrete possibilities  of cooperation in these areas.    On Monday, Minister Liberadzki met Chinese Deputy Foreign  Minister Tian Zengpei [name as received] and on Tuesday he will  hold talks with Communications Minister Huang Zhendong. On  Tuesday and Wednesday, members of the Polish delegation  representing Polish Ministries of Industry and Trade, Foreign  Economic Relations, Finances, Agriculture and Food Economy, the  Cabinet Office, commercial bank and the Agriculture Market  Agency will hold talks with delegates of similar Chinese  ministries, offices, institutions and enterprises. On Thursday,  the Polish delegation will be received by Chinese Deputy Prime  Minister Li Lanqing.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Fortis lifted by new acquisitions FORTIS, the Dutch-Belgian banking and insurance group, reported a 14 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit, bolstered by the first-time consolidation of a Spanish joint venture and a Dutch savings bank. Net profit rose to Ecu85.1m (Dollars 103.82m) from Ecu74.5m a year earlier, on revenues up 15 per cent at Ecu2.54bn. Among the factors behind the rise were favourable exchange rate movements. If currency factors are excluded, net profit would have risen by 9 per cent. The first-time consolidation of the Caifor joint venture with Spain's La Caixa and of VSB Bank in the Hague lay behind the strong increases in pre-tax operating results from life insurance, up 25 per cent, and banking, up 40 per cent. In other sectors, accident and health insurance posted a more modest rise of 13 per cent, while operating losses widened to Ecu6.1m from Ecu3.9m in other non-life lines such as motor and fire insurance. Capital gains on investments such as shares and property fell to Ecu22.2m from Ecu26.6m a year earlier. Fortis said the results confirmed previous expectations that full-year net and operating profit would at least match their 1992 level. It noted that second-quarter figures would include capital gains from the sale of the company's shares in Belgium's Generale de Banque. Ahold, the Dutch-based supermarket and retail group, reported a 13 per cent increase in net profit to Fl 96.2m (Dollars 53.4m) during the first quarter of 1993. Operating results showed an even stronger rise of 23.3 per cent to Fl 180.8m, but this was partially offset by a substantial rise in financial costs to Fl 49m from Fl 34.4m, reflecting new acquisitions as well as first-time consolidations. Sales rose by 22.3 per cent to Fl 8bn as a result of new acquisitions in the Netherlands and Portugal and the consolidation of Schuitema, a Dutch food wholesaler which is 73 per cent-owned by Ahold and which was previously not consolidated. If these factors are eliminated, sales growth totalled 4.9 per cent. In the US, where Ahold is one of the 10 largest supermarket operators, higher operating results were achieved at three of the group's four supermarket chains - Tops, Bi-Lo and Giant Food Stores. The fourth, First National, posted lower results. Total US operating profit rose by 7.2 per cent to Dollars 48.1m. In the Netherlands, operating results were up 29.7 per cent at Fl 87.6m, partly due to consolidations and acquisitions.</p>

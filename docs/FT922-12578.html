			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Bougainville rebels murder negotiator HOPES of a peace settlement on the copper-rich island of Bougainville evaporated yesterday after the Papua New Guinea (PNG) government said a leading negotiator and seven other men had been executed by the outlawed Bougainville Revolutionary Army (BRA). Bougainville has been in turmoil since the BRA attacked PNG officials and partially destroyed the Australian-run Panguna copper mine two years ago as part of a drive for independence from the former Australian colony. Hundreds of Bougainvilleans are believed to have died in fighting between the BRA and PNG troops. Others are said to have died of disease when the government blockaded the island for several months, cutting off supplies of food and medical supplies. Mr Rabbie Namaliu, the prime minister, said the government was 'shocked and horrified' by the killing of Mr Anthony Anugu, a political leader from South Bougainville who negotiated a partial settlement with the central government.</p>

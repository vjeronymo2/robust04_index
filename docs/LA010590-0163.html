			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EMOTIONAL BUSH PROTESTS TV'S SPLIT IMAGES;  </P> <P> PANAMA: HE IS UPSET OVER NETWORKS JUXTAPOSING SOLDIERS' COFFINS WITH HIS  'FRIVOLOLOUS COMMENTS.'  </P> <P> His voice choking with emotion, President Bush today protested the use of a  split screen by two television networks and CNN showing the caskets of soldiers  killed in Panama returning to the United States while he was making "frivolous  comments" during a news conference last month.  </P> <P> Bush told reporters that it appeared that he "didn't give a damn and I do."  </P> <P> In an emotional appeal, he urged the networks to notify him if such a technique  is going to be used.  </P> <P> White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the juxtaposition of the two  events on the screen simultaneously -- the flag-draped coffins arriving at  Dover, Del., and the news conference in the White House press room -- by ABC,  CBS and CNN "absolutely was deliberate."  </P> <P> Fitzwater said Bush is "very upset about it" and "it's hard to believe the  networks did not understand the significance of it."  </P> <P> Bush told reporters that he had received a lot of mail "and I had some calls"  after his news conference on Dec. 21 "because when I was speaking here in this  room the networks juxtaposed against my frivolous comments at the time the  split screen . . . it showed American lives. The bodies of dead soldiers in  caskets . . . coming home."  </P> <P> "And I would respectfully request if the urgency of the moment is such, if that  technique is going to be used," he said, "if I could be told about it and will  stop the proceedings or if it's something less traumatic. I could understand  why the viewers were concerned about this.  </P> <P> "They thought their President, at a solemn moment like that, didn't give a  damn, and I do, I do," he said. "I feel it so strongly. So please help me with  that, if you would."  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Co-operative Retail expands despite slight fall in sales CO-OPERATIVE Retail Services, one of the UK's biggest retailers, yesterday reported a substantial increase in profits for the year ended January 30, despite the high street recession and a marginal decline in sales. CRS reported a surplus before distribution of Pounds 41.6m, compared with a previous Pounds 33.2m. The pre-tax surplus amounted to Pounds 25.9m, against Pounds 21.6m, and was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 5.15m (Pounds 638,000). Turnover slipped to Pounds 1.45bn against Pounds 1.5bn. Net sales, which take account of VAT, were 3.6 per cent lower at Pounds 1.34bn (Pounds 1.39bn) mainly reflecting the sale of the dairy business in July last year to MD Foods. Despite the lack of sales growth, and the loss of the dairy business contribution, trading profits increased to Pounds 52.5m (Pounds 50m) reflecting margin improvements and tight control over expense levels. Trading margins improved from 3.6 per cent to 3.9 per cent. The food division, which includes the Leo's, Stop &amp; Shop and Pioneer chains, increased sales by 1.6 per cent to Pounds 1.13bn with profits up 17.7 per cent. The non-food division, including the Living department stores and Home World furnishing stores, increased turnover by 0.9 per cent to Pounds 234m despite 'the harsh economic background.' Net interest costs fell to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 16.8m). Gearing tumbled to 27 per cent (58 per cent) mainly reflecting the sale of the dairy division and the net positive cash flow of Pounds 83.6m. Operating surplus - after interest and distributions - increased to Pounds 31.1m (Pounds 22.3m) which Mr Harry Moore, chief executive, said underlined the society's commitment to building a successful platform for future development.</p>

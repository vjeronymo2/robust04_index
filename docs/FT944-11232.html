			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (10): Beyond the corner shop - Ethnic diversity gives business a lift, but also raises problems A recent survey from the Birmingham Economic Information Centre (BEIC) cites 'clear statistical evidence' of discrimination against ethnic minority groups in the labour market. It says unemployment among minority groups is double that among whites. Unemployment among those with higher qualifications was 8.8 per cent for ethnic minorities, 3.2 per cent for whites. The 1991 census figures on the gulf between rich and poor surprised many people by their scale and by the deterioration since the 1981 census. Researchers from the BEIC - set up by the city council and the training and enterprise council - used the census to compile a study of deprivation, comparing the city's electoral wards. Unemployment in inner-city Sparkbrook was 32.6 per cent, while in leafy Sutton Four Oaks it was 4.7 per cent. In Sparkbrook, 13.5 per cent of households were overcrowded (more than one person per room), compared with 0.5 per cent in Four Oaks. In Sparkbrook, 35.2 per cent of non-pensioner-only households had no earned income, against 4.2 per cent in Four Oaks. Sparkbrook had a black and ethnic minority population of 66.6 per cent, Four Oaks of 2.5 per cent. Workers from overseas - particularly the Indian subcontinent and East Africa  -were lured to the West Midlands in the boom times after the war, when factories were short of labour. In Birmingham alone, there are now estimated to be 66,000 people of Pakistani origin, 51,000 Indians and 13,000 Bangladeshis. As workers in the older industries - often unskilled and semi-skilled - many were among the victims of factory closures in the 1970s, though, says Mr Ripan Sachdev, a chartered accountant in Coventry, some put their redundancy money to work in a small business. He says the latest recession has damaged the Asian community significantly, with fewer opportunities for those made redundant. Some of the small shops which had prospered are falling victim to the squeeze in retailing generally, while they and other small businesses do not have the technology and marketing techniques increasingly needed for survival. But as some areas suffer, there is hope in the way that younger Asians are taking over family businesses, with skills newly acquired in colleges and in self-help community initiatives. Many textiles businesses were notorious as sweatshops. But Mr Sachdev says the sector is modernising, as companies bring in information technology and employ designers, aiming to sell to the high street retailer rather than the market stall. Some children of corner-shop owners are exploring other market sectors. Mr Davinder Panesar, of the Indian Community Centre in Coventry, is attempting to build on the Asian tradition of working from home. He wants to replace the women's sewing machines with personal computers, to encourage the growth of teleworking. 'We have the skills base, we have the skills in business, we have the ethic and philosophy of women working from home.' With a large contribution - about Pounds 340,000 - from a local Asian businessman, there are plans for a teleworking centre with a nursery attached, so that childcare can be provided while the women train and work. LIke Mr Sachdev, Mr Panesar sees great difficulties for people seeking work. Some had committed themselves to helping their parents in corner shops, which then went down in the recession. Competition for jobs is intense, though Mr Panesar plays down the role of crude racial discrimination - often, he says, a youngster from college is competing with a redundant executive with a track-record and a network. He also believes the new generation has lost some of the vigour and vision which drove their parents to build their businesses. Working with the University of Coventry, the centre saw a need for an academic platform for Sikh culture - 54 per cent of the city's ethnic minority population is Sikh - and the university has agreed to help accredit a course in Sikh philosophy and theology. In the field of practical skills, a national vocational qualification is being developed in authentic Asian cuisine, gaining accreditation for the ability that thousands of people, especially women, already have. The Asian community has in the past, says Mr Panesar, been 'quite disorganised'. Now, locally-educated British Asians know the country's systems and standards and have the skills, especially with computers, to use their knowledge. Mr Panesar says the community is organising itself and building networks across regions, counties and cities - 'and soon across countries'. Such initiatives will make a difference, but more help from outside is needed to address the intractable problem of the inner cities. The economic review from the BEIC issues a stern warning. A growing proportion of school leavers will be from ethnic minorities, it says. 'Discriminatory and other barriers will need to be addressed urgently by employers and others if a satisfactory supply of labour is to be maintained. In particular, recruitment of Asian women needs to be encouraged,' it says. 'Some employers will only consider recruiting from minority groups when the economy grows quickly. Without intervention, these trends will have major implications for the Birmingham economy.'</p>

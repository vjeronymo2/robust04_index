			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANNEL ONE, CLASSROOM TELEVISION WITH COMMERCIALS, GOES ON THE AIR  </P> <P> Students across the country got the news Monday along with a sales pitch for  candy, razors and cheese snacks when the advertiser-supported classroom program  Channel One went on the air.  </P> <P> "I think it is a good idea," said Powell High School student Jim Addington, 17,  one of the first to see the Channel One news program, beamed nationwide for the  first time to 400 schools.  </P> <P> "I don't see why there is so much controversy over the commercials," he said,  because he has seen the same commercials for M&amp;Ms, Gillette shavers and  Chee-tos on regular television at home.  </P> <P> The brief program is produced by the Knoxville-based media company Whittle  Communications, which loans participating schools expensive video equipment and  satellite dishes to receive the program, and sells advertising to cover the  cost.  </P> <P> Despite criticism from national education groups, bans by public educators in  New York and California and a lawsuit in North Carolina, 2,900 schools in 34  states have signed up for Channel One, company Chairman Christopher Whittle  told reporters at the high school.  </P> <P> As long as they're taking Channel One, schools can use the TV sets, video  recorders and satellite for other projects, as well.  </P> <P> Monday's broadcast by Channel One's five-member team of under-30 anchors and  reporters gave a capsule of breaking news -- voting in three Soviet republics,  last week's escape of a 17-year-old Cuban to the United States on a sail board,  the return of the space shuttle Atlantis and President Bush's trade talks with  the Japanese prime minister.  </P></p>

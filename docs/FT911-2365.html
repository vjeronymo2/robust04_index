			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Etam threatened by SA takeover THE FAMILY that controls one of South Africa's largest women's fashion chains has taken the first public step towards a possible bid for Etam, the UK fashion chain. Oceana Investment Corporation, a vehicle for the Lewis family, which owns the 700-store Foschini chain in South Africa, has made a tender offer of up to Pounds 22.3m for 18.5 per cent of Etam's shares. This would take its stake to 25.1 per cent. The maximum price offered is 185p per share, putting a market value of Pounds 121m on Etam. This compares with Pounds 114.3m at yesterday's closing price of 175p, up 15p. Mr Michael Lewis, a director of Oceana and Foschini, said Oceana was considering making an offer for the whole of Etam. It did not want to make a hostile bid and the tender offer was a way of gauging shareholder response. Etam responded angrily to the move, describing it as 'an attempt to gain back-door control at an unacceptably low price.' The board had already rebuffed a cash and shares takeover proposal, worth about 150p a share, from Oceana early this year. Mr Alan Howard, chairman, said: 'Oceana is aiming to profit at our shareholders' expense from the very significant benefits still to flow through from Etam's substantial investment over the last three years and the upturn to come in the retail cycle.' Over the past four years Etam has invested Pounds 78m to increase floorspace by 60 per cent. It has added the Snob teenage fashion and Peter Brown menswear shops to its portfolio as well as expanding the established Etam and Tammy Girl chains. Turnover has increased by more than 80 per cent to Pounds 206.5m. But the 1990-91 results announced last week showed a 51 per cent fall in profit to Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 17.5m), which compares with the record Pounds 17.9m set back in 1987-88. The figure was the worst since 1983-84. However, after a first-half loss of Pounds 1.1m, Mr Howard said the management had proved its ability by effecting a dramatic second-half recovery in adverse market conditions. Mr Lewis said that if a bid were launched for Etam, it would be at a maximum price of 185p. This was nearly 25 times the earnings per share announced last week and 15 to 20 times this year's earnings forecasts. The offer for up to 12.1m shares is being made by Campbell Lutyens Hudson, the investment bank, on behalf of Oceana Retail Holdings, set up for the purpose. The closing date is May 7 and the striking price will depend on the number of shares subscribed.</p>

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FREE THROWS LEAD WAY FOR FAITH BAPTIST, 67-52  </P> <P> Faith Baptist High basketball Coach Stuart Mason did not need to philosophize  Tuesday night on how his team defeated Calipatria, 67-52, in the opening round  of the Division V Southern California regional tournament.  </P> <P> He knew, as did most observers, that simple arithmetic at the free-throw line  told the whole story.  </P> <P> Faith Baptist converted 23 of 31 free throws, while its opponent was zero of  seven.  </P> <P> "We had some players who were feeling a little sick tonight," Mason said. "We  just tried to capitalize on anything they gave us. Our kids played their hearts  out."  </P> <P> Surprising Faith Baptist (20-10), which defeated Brethren, 65-59, in overtime  Friday night to win the Southern Section 1-A championship, will play at Ribet  Academy at 7:30 p.m. Thursday in the semifinals. Calipatria, the San Diego  Section Division V runner-up, finished the season 21-5.  </P> <P> Calipatria was smaller and slower than Faith Baptist, yet the Hornets stayed  close for much of the game. In fact, they pulled ahead of the Contenders,  40-38, early in the fourth quarter on forward Javier Vega's layup.  </P> <P> Faith Baptist responded with a three-point bomb from sophomore guard Darren  Wyre and never trailed again.  </P> <P> With the Contenders' normal scoring leaders -- sophomores Alex Estrada and  Peter Rasmussen -- slowed by the flu, Wyre increased his average by making four  three-points shots in the second half on his way to a game-high 21 points.  </P> <P> Estrada, a 5-foot-8 guard, finished with 13 points, and Rasmussen, a 6-foot-6  center, added 15. Junior forward Fernando Garcia had 12.  </P></p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin prices touch 2-year highs TIN PRICES rose to the highest levels for two years on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, continuing the rise which has taken the three-month price from Dollars 5,500 a tonne at the beginning of the year to more than Dollars 6,500. The breakthrough resistance at Dollars 6,500 for three-month metal early yesterday triggered further orders to buy, but profit-taking emerged at Dollars 6,550. By the close it had retreated to Dollars 6,502.50 a tonne, up Dollars 47.50 on the day. The move followed a rise in the Kuala Lumpur tin price above the psychologically-important MDollars 16 a kilogram, an 18-month high. Kuala Lumpur traders attributed the rise to a lack of sellers. They expect a move above MDollars 16.20. However, dealers at the LME said the upward move was driven by speculative buying. The market was lacking fundamental developments and physical interest was slack, they said. LME warehouse stocks rose 60 tonnes to 12,775 tonnes. Mr Robin Bhar, analyst with Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken, suggested that LME stock movements had been a bit erratic and were not providing the firm undertone the market should be seeking. While improved fundamentals and a better physical market had given the price its initial impetus, 'it's looking a bit frothy now'. 'Consumer activity was noticeably absent,' said Mr Bhar, who believes that the rise cannot be maintained unless fresh buying emerges.</p>

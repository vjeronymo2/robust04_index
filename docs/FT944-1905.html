			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Late rally lifts Nikkei as region slows A late rally lifted the Nikkei index to a slightly higher finish, but the total market was marginally off in declining volume as arbitrage buying continued to set the tone, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The 225 average, after spending much of the day on the minus side, climbed by nearly 150 points in the final hour of trading to close at the session's high of 19,163.43, up 42.31, its third rise in as many days and a percentage point higher on the week. The day's low was 19,012.10. However, volume shrank to an estimated 230m shares from Thursday's 287m and the broader market was sluggish. Declining issues outnumbered advances by 502 to 466, with 205 stocks flat. The Topix index of all first-section stocks eased 0.19 to 1,508.60 and the capital-weighted Nikkei 300 was off 0.04 at 279.04. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 0.78 at 1,259.39. Arbitrageurs bought stocks underlying the Nikkei 225 average after futures prices were pumped up by dealers. Large-capital issues were mixed. Steelmakers shed some of Thursday's gains. Nippon Steel, the day's most active stock, lost Y8 at Y355, Kawasaki slipped Y5 to Y400 and Kobe dipped Y2 to Y303. Shipbuilders added to Thursday's rises. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries moved up Y5 to Y728 and Kawasaki Heavy Y4 to Y446. Japan Tobacco cut a two-day rally short, declining Y7,000 to Y908,000, and NTT fell Y7,000 to Y841,000. East Japan Railway recovered Y1,000 to Y468,000. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 21.12 to 20,830.34 in volume of 124.8m shares. Roundup Wall Street's overnight gain helped sentiment. HONG KONG encountered profit-taking in a thin market. The Hang Seng index was off 93.17 or 1.1 per cent at 8,166.39, after hitting a low of 8,141.16, leaving a 4.8 per cent rise on the week. Turnover was a provisional HKDollars 2.9bn, against HKDollars 3.7bn for Thursday. HSBC fell HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 82.50. The H-share index of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong rose 3.80 to 1,080.93. SEOUL was lifted by broadly based buying and ended higher for the third consecutive session. The composite index added 8.89 at 1,036.76, but was unchanged on the week. Brokers said that smaller-capitalisation shares, which had fallen sharply in recent days, staged a technical rebound, while blue chips continued to post moderate gains. Korea Mobile Telecom closed limit up for the third day, rising Won10,000 to Won455,000. Samsung Electronics put on Won1,000 at Won114,000. MANILA's gain was influenced by the rise on Wall Street, with the composite index climbing 29.14 to 2,708.99, bringing the week's improvement to 4 per cent. Southeast Asia Cement Holdings, listed on Wednesday, was the week's top performer, rising 28 per cent to 1.92 pesos from its offer price of 1.50. KUALA LUMPUR finished a choppy session lower, with falls in Telekom Malaysia and Tenaga Nasional dragging the composite index down 4.17 to 946.60. The index gained 4 per cent over the week. Telekom fell 40 cents to MDollars 16.60 and Tenaga lost 20 cents at MDollars 10.20. SYDNEY ended slightly higher after late profit-taking eroded initial gains. The All Ordinaries index was up 2.0 at 1,897.0, for a 2.5 per cent rise on the week. BHP advanced 12 cents to ADollars 19.12 after reporting improved six-month results. BANGKOK chalked up a further 2 per cent gain, the SET index closing 26.47 stronger at 1,336.47, higher by 4.5 per cent on the week, in a rally led by finance and banking counters. Turnover expanded from Bt6.2bn to Bt7.9bn. The finance and banking sectors both rose by 2.3 per cent. BOMBAY saw moderate buying interest from domestic mutual funds, and the BSE 30-share index rose 39.76 to 3,943.65. This was still 0.6 per cent lower on the week, although brokers argued that there had been an overreaction to the Congress rout in regional polls earlier in the week, when the index fell by more than 135 points.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Jardine ousted from board of HK chamber of commerce A MILESTONE in Hong Kong's return to China was passed last night when Jardine Matheson, the British trading company, was thrown off the board of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. Election victories by pro-Beijing businessmen left the board evenly split between supporters and opponents of Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor. Mr Martin Barrow, a senior executive of Jardine Pacific, Jardine's core trading, distribution and construction arm, stood for re-election and was defeated in a battle organised in part by the Xinhua news agency, Beijing's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong. This is the first time since the chamber, the colony's leading business association, was founded in 1861 that a representative of Jardine has not sat on the board. Beijing has gained control of Hong Kong's other main business associations. But the chamber has so far refused to come out against Mr Patten and has withdrawn its support from the Business and Professionals Federation which in November made a strong attack on the governor. Six seats on the 24-member board, vacated by rotation, were contested in a secret ballot. Five pro-Beijing businessmen were elected while one incumbent, Mr Simon Lee, was re-elected. Among the successful candidates were Mr Chan Wing Kee, a textile manufacturer who is also a Hong Kong deputy to the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp parliament, and Mr Ye Longfei, a Shanghai government official on long-term secondment to Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm. The campaign Beijing mounted to gain control of the chamber's board reflects the seriousness with which China takes the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's lawmaking body. The chamber elects one of the 60 members of LegCo, a position held by Mr Jimmy McGregor, an outspoken Patten supporter. After last night's vote, Mr McGregor said: 'I interpret this vote as a turning point. The pro-China group within the chamber backed by those of like interest have made a very substantial dent in the chamber's system.' Xinhua officials have recently visited some of the chamber's bigger corporate group members and presented executives with China's preferred ticket.</p>

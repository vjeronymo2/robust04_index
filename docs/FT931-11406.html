			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / PLO rejects Rabin deal on deportees MR Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, came under sharp attack from the opposition Likud party yesterday for giving in to US pressure to compromise over the controversial expulsion of 400 Palestinians to Lebanon, while the deportees themselves and the Palestine Liberation Organisation flatly rejected the offer for 100 to return home. The deportees and the PLO dismissed Mr Rabin's compromise as a manoeuvre to prevent unprecedented UN sanctions against Israel. Mr Rabin's Labour-led government had enjoyed broad support from the right-wing Likud for ordering the expulsions in December after a series of killings of Israeli soldiers by Islamic fundamentalist militants. But this evaporated following Monday night's reversal. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the former prime minister, said the government's credibility had been undercut by its inability to withstand international pressure. Israel's position in Middle East peace negotiations had been weakened, he said. Mr Binyamin Netanyahu, a leading candidate to succeed Mr Shamir as Likud leader next month, said: 'I believe in retrospect it would have been better not to deport at all.' The 396 deportees, most of them alleged members of the Hamas Islamic movement, voted unanimously in their snowbound Lebanese encampment to reject Mr Rabin's proposal, which included reducing the terms of exile of those not allowed to return immediately to no more than one year and the offer of food and medical supplies. Likewise, the PLO said at its headquarters in Tunis that it would continue to press for sanctions against Israel to enforce UN resolution 799 calling for the immediate return home of all those expelled. Mr Rabin dismissed the Palestinian rejection of his offer as 'their problem'. He would be happy for the deportees to stay put, saving him the humiliation of having to organise their return. His chief concern in making the compromise was to cement ties with the Clinton administration in Washington. Government officials expressed satisfaction that Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, quickly applauded the Israeli move. They were confident the US would keep any debate of sanctions out of the UN Security Council. However, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, was reported last night as telling American Jewish leaders he did not believe Israel's offer on the deportees complied with Security Council requirements.</p>

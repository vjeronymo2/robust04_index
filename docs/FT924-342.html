			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System Tension within the exchange rate mechanism eased last week. Pressure on the French franc has abated, but dealers are still poised to test its strength. On Christmas eve, the central bank of Ireland said it would cut its overnight support rate to 14 per cent from 16 per cent. There was a growing perception in the markets that Germany would ease short-term interest rates. Currencies, Page 25 The chart shows the member currencies of the exchange rate mechanism measured against the weakest currency in the EMS's narrow 2.25 per cent fluctuation band. In practice, currencies in the narrow band cannot rise more than 2.25 per cent from the weakest currency in that part of the system. The Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo operate with 6 per cent fluctuation bands.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (5): 'Complicated' recovery forecast - The Economy Economically speaking, what is good for Spain is better for the Basque Country and the reverse is just as true. With the Spanish economy now entering its second year of recession, the Basque economic indicators look worse than they do elsewhere in the country. The third-quarter 1993 report issued by Bilbao's business think tank, the Circulo de Empresarios Vascos, sombrely notes that there is no sign of any brakes to arrest the falling industrial demand and, much less, of recession bottoming out. It concludes that recovery in the Basque Country will be 'more complicated' than in other areas of Spain. The industrial activity index for the Basque Country in May, the latest available statistic, fell by 4.7 per cent which was in line with the negative growth recorded for the past two years and the year-on-year fall in industrial activity stood at the end of that month at 10.1 per cent. A breakdown of the Basque Country's recession data gives worrying statistics. The steel sector, which accounts for 44 per cent of the area's industrial activity, fell by 10.9 per cent in May to give a 12-month drop of 16.3 per cent. Bilbao's estuary, once the pulsating hub of heavy Spanish industry, is now an industrial wasteland, arguably darker and more satanic than anywhere in the developed world. 'Before people used to talk about profits and investments and now when you get two businessmen together they will swap stories about how they are reducing their payroll,' says Mr Jose Miguel de la Rica, chairman of the Circulo think tank. Profits, when they exist at all, are uniformly down and the investment is ploughed into paying off redundancies. The labour shakeout is aimed principally at containing losses and not at improving productivity. Companies are offering early retirement to those aged 55 and they are sacking those under 30 who are mostly employed under temporary contracts and are cheaper to dismiss. Unemployment stood at 23.2 per cent of the Basque Country's active working population in the second term of this year, according to the Madrid-based Statistics Institute's labour survey. This figure, which gave a jobless total for the area of 201,240, was marginally above the national average; it was a shocking set of data for what was once, scarcely 20 years ago, a full employment area. The Basque Country's economy is the victim of deceptive successes in the past when it used to draw cheap labour from the rest of Spain to transform steel and to manufacture ships and capital goods for the protected Spanish market. It caught pneumonia when it was blasted by the cold winds of competition. 'We were stripped naked when we entered the European Community,' says Mr Jose Maria Gorordo, a former mayor of Bilbao and now the chief executive of the city's Chamber of Commerce. 'We would have been better off if we had been left with our old clothes.' The Basque Country's problem was that its old clothes, its obsolete heavy industry built around the Altos Hornos de Vizcaya steel plant, was exactly what Brussels had no use for. Cut-backs imposed by Europe were exacerbated by domestic difficulties, chiefly the over-valued peseta of the 1980s and the high interest rates that kept the currency high. These factors, coupled to industrial disputes and soaring wage rises, turned meaningful restructuring and diversification into an endless obstacle course for the top Basque companies. Small companies, the area's pride and joy, have scarcely fared better. Specific sectors, such as car components, are flat and overall they face the toughest competition possible. 'We are on the frontline of the south-east Asia challenge,' Mr de la Rica observes with a shrug. There are examples of the challenge being met. Employees of a local plant that manufactures sewing machines and was being undercut by a Taiwan rival were faced with the stark choice of earning less or producing more. They chose to work a six-day week. A recurring positive theme in all presentations of the local economy is that the Basques constitute one of the most industrious labour forces around. The second asset is the drive of its business community. When a 40-strong team of Basque entrepreneurs went to Cuba recently one of them travelled with pots of paint and a fistful of brushes which he personally used to spruce up a hairpin-producing plant that he had opened a year earlier in Havana. 'That's the mettle we are made of,' says Mr Marcos Vizcaya, an official of the ruling PNV party who has known the hairpin manufacturer since childhood. Such enterprise can, however, stumble over the absence of capitalisation. Because of terrorism, as well as the often violent industrial relations environment, foreign investment has mostly given the Basque Country a wide berth and there has been an equivalent shortage of Spain-based funds. As a result, capital raising has often to be done within the Basque community and the Basque Country is fortunate to have in its midst far-seeing venture backers in the local savings banks and in Banco Bilbao Vizcaya which has an umbrella industrial holding, the IBV corporation, which it shares with the electrical utility Iberdrola. Despite the recession and the internal problems, the presence of such financial resources means there are a number of brights lights pointing to an economic future for the Basque Country. CAF, a railway rolling stock manufacturer that has its main plant in Beasain, broke even in 1991 after many years of losses and turned in net profits of Pta1.5bn last year which it put aside for reserves. The company, which is 25 per cent owned by the three Basque savings banks, currently has an order book worth Pta77.7bn - 35 per cent of which has been earned outside Spain. A second clear example that all is far from lost in the Basque Country is Gamesa, a Vitoria-based weapons producer that has branched out into new materials, microelectronics and environmental engineering, now earns 50 per cent of its revenues outside Spain and is one of the most successful ventures backed by IBV. Even in the steel industry, the foundation of the Basque Country's past wealth, there are companies that have specialised intelligently, have begun to export aggressively and are making money. The top trio in this all-important sector are Aristrain which makes long products, Guivart which produces steel bars, and Tubos Reunidos which manufactures seamless pipes. It will nevertheless take a while yet before the once finely-tuned engine of the Basque economy begins to climb into the higher gears.</p>

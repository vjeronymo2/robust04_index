			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / UK Company News: From ecstatic wheeler-dealing to static management - Philip Ling, Haden MacLellan chairman and self-confessed crisis addict THERE IS a branch of hunting called drag hunting. It is fast, furious and contrived, rather like the deal-making of the 1980s. It suits those who love to gallop and jump, but who hate hanging around and have little interest in watching hounds work. It follows an artificial trail and it is over in perhaps half the time of the traditional version. Drag hunting is a favourite sport of Mr Philip Ling, chairman of Haden MacLellan Holdings, the industrial holding company he brought to the market in the midst of the October 1987 crash, too late to capitalise on the bull market. That was a pity because he thrives on the excitement of the deal. He was at home in the acquisitive 1980s. His audacity peaked in 1986 with an innovative, and highly leveraged, management buy-in bid which valued Simon Engineering at Pounds 201m. It was a spectacular flop. But now, as then, he is unashamedly uninterested in the day-to-day running of a business. Last week Mr Ling, who is only 45, stepped back into a non-executive role at Haden MacLellan, where the 40-odd subsidiaries make or supply products like paint-spraying plant, iron bridges and vandal-proof toilets. Since the company's last significant transaction a year ago - a comparatively small Pounds 4m purchase in California - the deal-based work has thinned out. His longstanding operating-manager colleagues were de facto in the ascendancy, just as the age of the Roundheads replaced that of the Cavaliers. The story of his four years as executive head of a quoted company is full of swings and contradictions. One incongruity is the attention Mr Ling proudly draws to the recent centenary of MacLellan, used as a partial shell in 1987 to receive the private companies Haden and Haleworth. Last century, the sort of Ling-engineered buy-in and buy-out deals that lie behind the modern HMH had not been dreamed of and the group's short track-record remains one of its Achilles' heels from the market's point of view. In terms of profitability, the company's growth peaked in 1990 at Pounds 23.6m pre-tax, but is estimated to have fallen nearly 40 per cent to about Pounds 14.5m last year. Although the business is diversified, it has not proved to have much of a cushion against recessions in the UK and the US. As for the share price, the October 1987 crash happened during the suspension period for the 'double reverse takeover'. When trading started, the price fell rapidly to less than half the 150p launch level. Then a near-tenfold increase in pre-tax profit between 1987 and 1989 and Mr Ling's whizzy acquisitive image sent up the share price from 67p to 257p in less than two years. Some disappointments and the malaise affecting conglomerates and small companies have since sunk it to less than 110p. Yesterday's close was 111.5p. Mr Ling, with 2.5 per cent of the equity, must know how all the other shareholders feel about this reversal of fortune. So is he another of the 1980s whizz kids who have gone phut, or is he a victim of the bear market? He might accept the latter definition. 'If we had known there was going to be a bear market followed by a recession, we would not have gone public. 'Other industrial holding companies got going earlier in the 1980s. But it might be a blessing in disguise because some of those exploded.' To be fair, there is an important difference between HMH and the casualties of the 1980s. Far from over-borrowing, it has emerged with enough cash in hand to pay an 8p maintained dividend for 1991 (costing just over Pounds 7m). Earnings per share are expected to be 11p. As for the flash, wheeler-dealer tag, he is vexed by it. While he is not interested in running operating companies, he says he is interested in creating good management teams and in establishing a culture in which they can thrive. He talks about the creative, humanist side of management - using words like communication and participation. 'It doesn't matter who gets it right, so long as someone does.' He does not like the word 'ruthless' and seems pleased that HMH has not shut a plant in the recession. He does not even have the customary missionary zeal of holding company chairmen for driving forward earnings per share. Ask about financial control from the centre and one of the nitty-gritty directors, such as Mr Clive Mayhead or Mr Mel Hawley, newly created chief executive, will answer. Mr Ling says there is no formula; they will rattle off something that sounds like one. The trouble with HMH from his point of view is that it has no big problems. So where now for the Downside, Oxford and London Business School-educated Mr Ling, whose business roots go back to the Jessel empire, Johnson &amp; Firth Brown and restructuring private steel in the 1970s? He already has an assortment of business interests outside HMH, including non-executive directorships of quoted companies and private investments about which he is rather coy. It seems he would like his future career to resemble his sporting one. Less than three weeks after having his knee crushed in a fall from his horse, he plans to be dropped from a helicopter in the Canadian Rocky Mountains so that he can ski down. He likes to be seen as a 'crisis addict'. 'I'm very interested in companies with big problems.' In the current climate, though, his energies might have to be funnelled into a financial rescue rather than a new venture. At HMH, the hope is that his more down-to-earth colleagues will strike the appropriate note for what they describe as the 'austere' and 'back-to-basics' 1990s.</p>

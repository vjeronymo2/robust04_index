			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Davenport Brewery building saved Birmingham City Council has halted plans to knock down the offices of the old Davenport Brewery, Paul Cheeseright writes. The offices incorporate a Georgian house which provided the design for other offices built between the world wars. Limewood Developments, the property arm of the Greenalls leisure group which owns Davenport, wanted to demolish the offices while it cleared the site (above) for a retail and housing development. The planning application for the shops and homes has been withdrawn. The council wants the office buildings retained but is anxious to bring life back to a site that is just off the city centre and next to the old accident hospital, which is to be converted into student accommodation.</p>

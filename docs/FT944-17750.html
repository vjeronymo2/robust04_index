			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (4): Tiddler in deep water - Ian Rodger examines the foreign policy options of a mini-state Liechtenstein has been unusually active in the diplomatic field in the past few years. In 1990, it established a mission at the United Nations In New York. The following year it opened one in Geneva accredited to the international organisations there and last year it set up an office in Brussels. The principality makes no pretence of having any power whatsoever in international affairs. Its main purpose in building up an international presence is to secure its legitimacy as an independent state. This, in turn, its leaders believe, contributes to the credibility of its tax haven in particular and to the health of the economy in general. After living under the diplomatic wing of Switzerland for most of this century, the principality first struck out on its own in 1978 joining the Council of Europe. In 1982, it achieved special status at the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Vienna and it became a full member of the United Nations in 1990. In 1991, it became a full member of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), mainly to negotiate special exemptions from the freedom of movement requirements of the European Economic Area (EEA) treaty then being negotiated with the European Union (EU). Until then, it had been an associate member under Switzerland's wing. And earlier this year, it joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Ms Andrea Willi, foreign minister, says the principality puts most of its efforts on the international stage into good causes - human rights, environmental protection, women's rights and culture. It has been especially active in the area of minority rights. In July, the reigning prince donated Dollars 467,000 to Princeton University in the US to fund a research programme on the right to self-determination. 'We really care about this subject. We are a small country. Our borders are at the door. Every day we see our limits,' Ms Willi says. On a bilateral level, efforts are concentrated almost entirely on Switzerland. Although the principality was established by the Austrian Emperor Karl VI in 1719 as a seat for the noble Viennese Liechtenstein family, its people have always been culturally closer to the Swiss than to the Austrians. Thus, when the Austro-Hungarian empire collapsed in 1921, it was no trauma for the principality to attach itself to Switzerland. It adopted the Swiss franc as a national currency in 1921 and concluded a postal treaty with its neighbour in the same year. A customs union was established in 1924 and a formal currency union settled in 1980. Bilateral relations over most of this century have been remarkably tranquil. It is only since December, 1992 that things have become complicated. In that month, Liechtensteiners voted in a referendum in favour of joining the EEA, the expanded free trade area proposed between the EU and Efta countries. But the Swiss voted to stay out. Thus, the question arose of how Liechtenstein could respect its obligation to provide for the freedom of movement of goods with other EEA countries and adherence to EEA standards and still maintain its customs union with Switzerland. It has taken a long time to find an answer to this question although Liechtensteiners blame their own frequent changes of government in the past two years for much of the delay. Officials say there were very few problem areas anyway, because the Swiss have increasingly aligned their industrial standards on those of the EU. One important exception is the motor business. Switzerland has long protected its car dealers from foreign competition with a panoply of special specifications for cars to be registered in the country. The elegantly simple solution that has been found is that a Liechtensteiner will be able to buy either an EEA or a Swiss specification car, but when it comes to selling it, he can sell it only to another Liechtensteiner or to someone in the area whose specifications it respects. This system will be easy to police because the Swiss car authorities would simply refuse to register an EEA specification car. Most other goods on which standards differ are industrial intermediates, such as poisonous substances, and these will be controlled at company level. According to Willy Frommelt, director-general of the Liechtenstein Industry Association, the principality will need the grand total of five VAT inspectors. Final agreement on the revisions to the customs union was achieved this week. Liechtenstein must now present the details of the deal to its EEA partners for their approval and then give its own people an opportunity to approve or reject it in a referendum. Assuming all this can be accomplished in the next three months so that Liechtenstein joins the EEA on January 1, the principality's anxieties will not be at an end. That would leave only Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein in Efta, and only Iceland and Liechtenstein as non EU members of the EEA. And it is likely that Switzerland, and perhaps Iceland too, will at some point join the EU. Liechtenstein, on the other hand, has no intention of joining the EU. 'It is not on the agenda,' declares Ms Willi. Being such a small state, it would be unable to fulfil the responsibilities of a full member. Moreover, it fears that EU laws would eventually hurt its tax haven. The prince and government leaders agree that the EEA is just right for Liechtenstein, giving it most of the advantages of EU membership with protections for its economic and social structures. However, the future of both Efta, which has a modest permanent bureaucracy, and the EEA do not look exactly secure. Ms Willi makes clear that there is little that tiny Liechtenstein can do, other than make suggestions. She says, for example, that EFTA and the EEA might be suitable routes towards EU membership for some eastern and southern European countries. Efta had third country trade agreements with 11 countries, and the EU had invested a lot of time and thought in creating the EEA. 'It is a useful model,' she says.</p>

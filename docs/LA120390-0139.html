			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: OF LIZ TAYLOR AND GOATS, LAWSUITS, BEAUS, FORBES, AIDS  </P> <P> IT IS my theory, which usually works out to be true, that Elizabeth Taylor  invariably makes big news during the holiday season -- announces an engagement  or divorce, breaks an engagement, enters a clinic, has an accident. And this  year is no exception. Today on your newsstands you will find a beaming, healthy  Elizabeth on the front of People magazine.  </P> <P> Taylor, who is in the midst of one of her by-now near mythic recoveries, gives  reporter Landon Y. Jones an intimate and candid interview. She speaks of her  nearly fatal bout with pneumonia of course, brushes aside ex-beau Henry  Wynberg's lawsuit with a wrinkle of that classic nose and tells of current  boyfriend Larry Fortensky's present to her during the early days of her  hospitalization -- a live baby miniature goat. Of the obvious difference in her  and Larry's financial status (he still works on construction sites in L.A.)  Taylor says, "No boy is poor if he's rich at heart."  </P> <P> Her suit against the National Enquirer is full steam ahead. She says that the  Enquirer's claim that she was drinking in the hospital resulted in thousands of  letters saying, "We've looked up to you. How could you?"  </P> <P> "I felt betrayed, and I felt I was betraying others," Elizabeth said.  </P> <P> Of the late Malcolm Forbes, Elizabeth declares, "I loved him. He loved me. He  knew how to give joy, and he loved to share. He was the least stingy soul I  ever met." When reporter Landon broaches the subject of Forbes' sexuality,  Taylor flares, "It's nobody's business what Malcolm's sexual preferences were.  It's nobody's concern. I respected him, which means I respected his choices,  all the way around. We knew each other very well."  </P> <P> And Elizabeth's work for AIDS, which began in 1984, is ongoing and her  determination to raise funds and consciousness is stronger than ever: "It was  my anger that involved me with AIDS, and it still is. Nobody asks for this  disease. Nobody deserves it. We are all as innocent as babies in the eyes of  God." Elizabeth Taylor sails into the first year of the new decade with renewed  vigor.  </P></p>

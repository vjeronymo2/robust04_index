			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Woolworth counts cost of change  -Diversification has not been a success Frank Winfield Woolworth, the farm boy from upstate New York who founded the Woolworth empire in 1879, was known as a brilliant retailing entrepreneur. His skills are badly missed at the company that bears his name today. With annual sales of nearly Dollars 10bn, Woolworth still ranks as one of the world's biggest and best-known retailers. For years, however, it has been struggling unsuccessfully to keep up with retail change in the US and overseas. On Wednesday, the company was forced to acknowledge the extent of its financial difficulties by slashing its quarterly dividend from 29 cents a share to 15 cents, the lowest level since 1987. This was just the latest, however, in a series of troubles afflicting the company. Last year Woolworth undertook a huge restructure in an attempt to bolster its flagging performance. It closed 970 stores across North America, including half its traditional general merchandise stores and a third of its Kinney shoe stores, at a cost of Dollars 726m before tax. Even ignoring the restructuring charges, operating profits slumped from Dollars 574m the previous year to just Dollars 73m in 1993. The company blamed disappointing sales and the need for heavy markdowns to clear goods. It reported net losses for the year of Dollars 495m compared with net profits of Dollars 280m the previous year. The poor performance has continued into the current year: first-quarter losses worsened from a restated Dollars 24m net loss last year to Dollars 38m, dashing hopes that the restructuring alone would be enough to bring profitable growth. Once a bastion of US corporate respectability, Woolworth astonished Wall Street and the US business community two months ago by revealing that employees had fiddled the previous year's quarterly results to make losses look like profits. An investigation into the deceit failed to attribute blame, but it resulted in the resignation of Mr Charles Young, the chief financial officer, and the demotion to vice-chairman of Mr William Lavin, previously chairman. Mr Lavin remains chief executive. Last month Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency, downgraded Woolworth's debt from A minus to triple B plus with a negative outlook, citing weakness in the company's general merchandise and Kinney shoe store operations, and concerns about continued reliance on Kinney's Foot Locker as the main driver of profitability. The root cause of Woolworth's problems lies in its failure to find a winning formula to replace the five-and-dime variety store concept on which it was founded. The format has been in decline for 30 years amid a trend towards more specialised retailing, though the pace of decline has varied from country to country. As long ago as the 1960s, Woolworth saw the way things were going, and adopted the policy still in place today: using the cashflow from the mature general merchandise store operations to finance an expansion into specialty retailing. It was one of the first big retailers to enter the discount store business with its Woolco chain, and it bought the Kinney shoe store operation in 1965. Woolco, however, was not a success. Woolworth built up big debts to support its expansion but it was in too competitive a market, and the US chain was closed in 1982. At the same time, Woolworth sold its British general merchandise store chain to help fund its expansion into niche retailing. In the years since, the specialty retailing operations have mushroomed. Today, Woolworth owns more than 7,400 specialty stores operating under 40 different names in North America, Europe, Australasia and Asia. They include the Foot Locker sports shoe stores, the Silk &amp; Satin lingerie stores, the Northern Reflections women's casual wear stores, and the After Thoughts handbag and accessory stores. The result is that Woolworth, best known for its variety stores, is now the world's biggest specialty retailer. However, as with Woolco, the diversification has not proved a financial success. The only specialty retailer to have made a significant profit over the years is Kinney Shoe, the subsidiary that runs the Foot Locker stores - and its contribution to operating profits slumped from Dollars 360m to Dollars 126m last year. Overall, operating profits from the specialty store operations, before restruc-turing charges, fell from Dollars 418m to Dollars 136m last year, with Kinney accounting for the bulk of both figures. With the fashion for sports shoes giving way to more rugged footwear, analysts are now asking whether Woolworth's only successful diversification is in decline. In a sense, Woolworth's decision to slash the dividend is part of its response to these fears. The size of the pay-out had long looked unsustainable in the light of the company's financial performance, and halving it will leave the company with more money to invest in specialty retailing. The company also tried to reassure investors by putting Mr Ronald Berens, previously head of Kinney Shoe, in charge of all its specialty retailing operations worldwide. Even so, the languishing share price says the market has little confidence in the future. The wonder of Woolworth is that it is still around after all these years: but to many investors, it is a retailer whose time has come, and gone.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Technology: Business travellers enter US quicker If you stagger from a transatlantic flight to face a long immigration queue behind hundreds of tourists entering the US, then relief may be at hand, writes Evelyn Brodie. Next month the US Immigration and Naturalisation Service will issue biometric cards to frequent business travellers from the US or elsewhere. The cards contain nine pieces of information about the passenger's hand, such as the length of the fingers. People with cards will go down a separate aisle at immigration, insert the card into a machine and their hand into a window. If they match, the traveller is admitted. The cards will be used initially at two airports - Newark and JFK. INS: US, 202 514 2648.</p>

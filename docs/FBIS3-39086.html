On Wednesday [9 February], at a conference of  the seven neighboring states of ex-Yugoslavia, the participating  foreign ministers decided to develop a security paper together  with the Western European Union (WEU) and the CSCE. Foreign  Minister Mock stated that this document is to point out the  danger of an escalation of the conflict.    Moreover, the foreign ministers of Austria, Hungary,  Romania,  Bulgaria, Albania, Greece, and Italy are planning a follow-up  meeting to discuss the effects of the sanctions against the rest  of Yugoslavia.    The international UN expert commission for war crimes has  documented 55,000 cases since 1992 and will present them later  to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, according to  Cherif Bassiouni, its head. Most of the victims are Bosnian  Muslims.</p>

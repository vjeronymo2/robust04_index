Focusing on the task of making package  improvements and breakthroughs in key areas in the reform of the  economic structure for 1994, the deputies discussed in depth the  relevant issues. They pointed out that it is necessary to  concentrate more on reform; to pay attention to careful  organization and overall coordination; to unite as one; and to  work creatively so as to ensure essential progress for our  reform this year.    Some leading comrades from the CPC Central Committee, the  NPC  Standing Committee, and the State Council participated in the  discussion meetings of some of the delegations today. They  joined the deputies in deliberating the work report and listened  to their opinions and proposals. Vice Chairman Tian Jiyun; Wen  Jiabao, alternate member of the Standing Committee of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau; and State Councillor Song  Jian focused on agricultural production when they expressed  their opinions while participating in the discussion meetings of  the Jilin, Gansu, and Jiangsu delegations respectively. Tian  Jiyun stressed: There will be overall stability only when there  is stability in agricultural production and stability in the  countryside; only when there is overall stability can reform in  various areas be smoothly implemented and can development be  promoted. People throughout the country, both at the top and at  lower levels, must take agricultural development as a task of  prime importance. Wen Jiabao stated: We must conscientiously  implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and those of the central conference  on rural work; must stabilize and improve the party's basic  policies for rural areas; must deepen rural reform; must ensure  the implementation of various policies; and must further enhance  the enthusiasm of the peasants by promoting rural economic  development, by increasing peasants' income, and by promoting  rural stability. Song Jian stressed: We should regard  agricultural production as our basic strategy and pay particular  attention to developing agriculture by relying on science and  technology.    After hearing remarks by deputies from the Inner Mongolian  delegation, Vice Premier Li Lanqing pointed out: This year's  reform covers a broad spectrum and is very intensive. Time is  pressing. This requires governments at all levels to effectively  handle relations between reform, development, and stability  while practically and realistically resolving problems appearing  in the process of reform. Taking part in the Gansu delegation's  discussion and deliberation, State Councillor Li Tieying said:  Although there is quite a gap in the level of economic  development between China's eastern and western regions, their  understanding of reform and their efforts to accelerate reform  should not differ. Accelerating reform and exploring new ideas  suitable to the western region's development constitutes the  fundamental approach to revitalizing the region's economy and  narrowing the gap between east and west. Speaking at a meeting  of the Liaoning delegation, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua paid special  attention to the technological transformation of large and  medium-sized enterprises. He suggested we must have a sense of  urgency on this issue, undertake work every year, and make  constant efforts to achieve technological progress and meet  market demands. Ren Jianxin, member of the Secretariat of the  CPC Central Committee, said at a meeting of the Shanxi  delegation that effective measures must be taken to safeguard  and ensure public order and social stability.    Taking part in the Taiwan delegation's discussion and  deliberation, Vice Premier Qian Qichen said: Peaceful  reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of all  Chinese people. Any attempt or act to divide the motherland, no  matter in what form, runs counter to the fundamental interests  of the Chinese nation and is doomed to failure. He added: As  long as people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait join hands to  develop relations, the great cause of peaceful reunification of  the motherland will surely be realized at an early date.    The reform programs to be launched by the state this year  are greater in number and magnitude, broader and deeper in  scale, and more difficult than those carried out previously.  Therefore, deputies from various provinces emphasized: We must  dare to make reforms and must seek ways for advance,  coordinating efforts to effectively implement and publicize  reform programs to ensure the achievement of concrete results.    Shandong delegate Jiang Chunyun stressed the need to devote  more energies to studying, promoting, and carrying out reforms  to ensure the smooth implementation of the central authorities'  various reform programs. To this end, he said, we should pay  particular attention to work in the following three aspects:  First, we should further emancipate our minds and seek truth  from facts, seeing to it that the thinking and concepts of  cadres at all levels conform with the requirements for the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure. Second,  we should enhance our awareness of the overall interests and  correctly handle the relationships between individual and  collective, local and national, and current and long-range  interests. Third, we should fully mobilize and harness the  enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of people in  reform. Guangxi delegate Zhao Fulin stated: We must fight an  all-out battle because many of the reform programs already  launched this year involve changes in ideology and concepts,  innovations of system, and readjustment of interests. Hence, he  called for courage and determination to overcome difficulties in  reform, adding that people at higher and lower levels must work  with one mind, consider the overall situation, and observe  discipline. Henan delegate Li Changchun said: In brainstorming  this year's reform programs, we must promote package reforms in  the five areas of the establishment of a socialist market  economic structure, while simultaneously achieving breakthroughs  in the two key areas of microeconomic market foundation and  macroeconomic market system. Therefore, leaders at all levels  should pay keen attention to promoting reforms, correctly  handling the relationship between local and national interests,  and earnestly implementing various macroeconomic regulatory and  control measures. Jiangsu delegate Shen Daren said: In the  course of introducing various reform measures, leaders at all  levels should pay keen attention to investigations and studies,  constantly keep abreast with new circumstances, promptly solve  new problems, and earnestly summarize and popularize good  experiences so as to promote reforms in a prudent and  down-to-earth manner.    Many delegates stated views on specific reform programs.  Sichuan delegate Guo Daiyi said the only way for invigorating  large and medium state-owned enterprises lies in deepening  reform, pointing out: First, we must straighten out the  relationship between the enterprises and the state with regard  to ownership; second, we must clearly define the relationship  between the government and enterprises; third, we must reduce  the financial burden the enterprises have to bear in supporting  social undertakings; and fourth, we must establish mechanisms  for the enterprises to exercise scientific management and raise  economic efficiency. Stressing the need to accelerate reform of  the financial system, Henan delegate Zhao Bingshen said: First  of all, financial system reform must be synchronized with the  transformation of the operating mechanisms of enterprises;  second, it is necessary to standardize management systems while  continuing to rectify financial order; third, it is necessary to  go all out to pool funds lying idle in society to meet the  demand of funds for economic growth; fourth, it is necessary to  adhere to the policy of stressing efficiency and repayment  capability in issuing loans; and fifth, it is necessary to  increase efforts to transform specialized banks into commercial  banks.</p>

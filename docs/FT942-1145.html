			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / International Company News: Repsol's promising new chapter - Enagas acquisition will lift Spanish energy group Mr Oscar Fanjul, the publicity-shy economist who is chairman of Repsol, Spain's partly-privatised energy and chemicals group, can afford a bit of chutzpah at the corporation's annual meeting in Madrid today. A week ago Mr Fanjul clinched an important deal, opening a promising chapter in Repsol's history. Gas Natural, which is 45 per cent owned by Repsol, bought Enagas, the state-owned importer of natural gas and supplier to leading industries, to become the virtual monopoly importer and supplier of gas in the fast-growing domestic market. Repsol, whose shares are traded in London, New York, Tokyo and Madrid, becomes a hybrid among energy corporations through the addition of a greatly increased gas business to its profitable oil exploration, production, refining and marketing activities. 'Repsol is now quite unlike all the other energy groups,' says Mr Luis Prota, an analyst at Madrid securities house AB Asesores. 'No other oil company has this sort of big gas business, intergrating supply and sales.' The Pta51.2bn (Dollars 379m) acquisition of 91 per cent of Enagas lifts Gas Natural's quota of the domestic gas market from 41 per cent to just over 90 per cent. Gas Natural has become the third-biggest gas company in Europe in terms of market capitalisation and the fourth in terms of clients. Gas Natural bought Enagas well below the Pta80bn-Pta120bn price range suggested when the takeover negotiations began nine months ago. This pleased the markets, as did the terms of the deal. Repsol, together with La Caixa, the large Catalan savings bank that has a 25 per cent stake in Gas Natural, avoided the investment burden of a gas pipeline being built by Enagas to link Spain to Algeria's gas fields via Morocco. The pipeline, due to be operational by the end of 1996, will now be built by a separate company, called Sagane, that will remain in public ownership. Gas Natural has an option, but not an obligation as was originally intended, to buy Sagane from the government in 2000 for Pta50bn, a price that represents a fraction of the cost of the state's investment in building the fixed gas link. The pipeline investment, and the original purchase figures, had prompted market fears that an Enagas takeover would drag down Gas Natural's profitability as well as Repsol's. But the energy corporation struck what Mr Juan Carlos Calvo of Madrid brokers FG called 'a very positive deal for itself'. Repsol officials say the takeover has given the energy corporation a new lease of life at a time when the domestic oil market, 60 per cent controlled by Repsol, has become increasingly mature. Mr Fanjul made the gas business a priority for the corporation in 1985, shortly after he became chairman, and he now calls the strategy 'one of those correct decisions of which we should feel proud'. Repsol has spent nearly 10 years working towards the Enagas acquisition. In the late 1980s it bought into regional gas distributors to build up Gas Madrid which it owned outright. In 1991 it merged Gas Madrid with the Barcelona-based Catalana de Gas, in which it had a 15 per cent stake, to create the nationwide Gas Natural company. The acquisitions had full government support because there was concern that the fractured domestic gas market would fall prey to foreign companies. Gas Madrid's merger with Catalana de Gas, for example, pre-empted a bid for the Barcelona company by British Gas. Over the past five years Repsol's gas business has raised its contribution to group operating income to 25 per cent from 9 per cent. The weighting of gas within Repsol will increase because of the Enagas acquisition, but it was set to rise even without the takeover because of the new momentum the Spanish government has given to natural gas. Under the national energy plan, which gave the go-ahead for the Algerian pipeline to lift domestic gas supply, natural gas will have doubled its contribution to national energy consumption from the current 6 per cent to at least 12 per cent by 2000. Repsol could not have timed the expansion of its gas business better: the turnover of Gas Natural-Enagas is likely to be Pta250bn this year and is forecast to be more than Pta600bn by 2004. Analysts believe Repsol's after-tax profit could increase annually by as much as 15 per cent over the next three years. This is the sort of message Mr Fanjul will give to shareholders today, and the timing is favourable. Repsol is expected to make a Pta200bn-Pta300bn global share offer later this year that will reduce the government's stake in the energy group to about 20 per cent from 41 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------                           1992     1993    (1st Qtr)    (1st Qtr)                                               1993         1994                                    Pesetas (m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Operating income        122.19   156.87      39.39      46.47 Net income               71.91    89.11      23.53      26.26 Cash flow after taxes   154.06   192.44      45.96      57.10 Net income per share*   239.72   267.05      78.43      87.54  ---------------------------------------------------------------- *Pta/share  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company figures  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

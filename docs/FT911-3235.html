			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Unions agree to back TUC on pay bargaining TRADE UNION leaders yesterday put aside differences on a pay bargaining structure under a future Labour government and agreed a common public line. The compromise was formulated in spite of some strong doubts about the proposed system. The general council of the Trades Union Congress unanimously approved a paper outlining plans for a system, including a national economic assessment and a national minimum wage, after making alterations to accommodate concerns of the AEU engineering union that pay differentials might be eroded. Potential difficulties in achieving a consensus on the issue were highlighted yesterday when the AEU's national committee, meeting in Eastbourne, approved a motion that noted 'with concern attempts to suppress free collective bargaining with a national wages assessment and similar devices'. Mr Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the UCW postal workers' union and a strong supporter of the co-ordinated bargaining advocated in the TUC document, admitted there could be difficulties in the future. He said: 'Problems associated with a minimum wage and a national economic assessment do not sit comfortably with free collective bargaining if that mean a wages free-for-all.' The twice revised TUC document repeatedly rejects the notion of pay norms or pay restraint. Even so, concern continues that a national assessment, involving trade unions, employers and government, might lead to restraint. From the AEU's point of view, one of the most crucial changes was to clauses involving a minimum wage. After the revision, the document says: 'Such increases shall not inhibit free collective bargaining or prevent the appropriate rate for the job being negotiated by trade unions.' It adds: 'Any exceptional increase given solely for the purpose of implementing the provisions of statutory minimum pay legislation will not be regarded by trade unions as a vehicle for general increases.'</p>

After greeting the PFP initiative of the U.S. Government and  of President Clinton in person, the statement expresses the  unreserved support of the People's Assembly of the Republic of  Albania toward this initiative, which serves peace and stability  in Europe and beyond.    The statements says that Albania manifests its readiness to  be a partner to this initiative, with the conviction that our  country has the opportunities and will fulfill partnership  conditions. With the establishment of democracy, through its  government, Albania has requested full membership in NATO,  assessing this as its desire and need, but also as a concrete  step in contributing to peace in the turbulent Balkan region.    The statement further stresses that we are convinced that  the  PFP consensus brings us closer to NATO entities and enables our  membership in this pact. Knowing its obligations toward this  partnership, Albania will always rely on the principles of  democracy and the full respect for human rights and freedoms and  the law- governed state.    After voting, the statement was approved unanimously by the  deputies present. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by V. Nugmanov: "The Chairman Has Reported and </F> Announced a Recess"]    [Text] The Kazan City Soviet 17th Session, which opened on  2 March, worked literally for several hours. Of the packed  agenda containing more than a dozen items, only the first may be  considered settled.    A report on the socioeconomic and political situation in the  capital of the republic was delivered by Kamil Iskhakov,  chairman of the Kazan City Soviet and chief of the city  administration. Having, after the report, answered deputies'  questions, he announced that the session would suspend business  until 16 March. The reason for the recess is preparation for the  approaching elections. But was it in this case worth opening the  session prior to 13 March at all?    The information communicated from the platform of the  session  was of interest inasmuch as it analyzed the present  socioeconomic and political situation that has taken shape as of  the present in Kazan and attempted in respect to certain items  to find a way out of the difficult situation.    K. Iskhakov devoted a large part of his speech to problems  of  the defense enterprises, which are experiencing a sharp--almost  23 percent--fall in production and a wholesale reduction in  orders. Despite the measures that are being adopted--a number of  fair-exhibitions with the participation of the defense  enterprises and the enlistment on a competitive basis of the  potential of the military-industrial complex in a solution of  the crisis in agriculture--and despite loans obtained in  accordance with a bill of exchange of the National Bank of the  Republic of Tatarstan, the situation remains very difficult. But  things have become somewhat easier for "defense" following the  signing of the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan. There has  been a change in attitude toward the problems of our republic in  "high" Moscow offices, and there is hope that the difficulties  of Tatarstan's military-industrial complex will gradually be  surmounted.    A whole set of most acute problems has built up in capital  construction, public utilities, and power engineering. Despite  the multibilllion-ruble injections, for the first time last year  not a single key-ready preschool was handed over. The returns on  R1 of invested capital in construction are currently only 36-39  kopeks. The wear and tear on the service lines of the municipal  economy has increased, and basic housing availability has  declined, and extremely little new housing is being commissioned.    The privatization of industrial facilities is not justifying  our hopes. As experience shows, the formation out of the  enterprises of stock companies has been no panacea against the  crisis.    Touching on the fulfillment of the recently adopted program  for fighting crime, the chairman of the city soviet observed  that approximately R1.5 billion had been invested in it already,  that the numbers of the Kazan militia were increased in the past  year by 1,200 persons, and that a growth of its ranks by a  further 1,000 officers in the present year was contemplated.  Although positive trends in the crime-solving rate has emerged,  we expect of the law enforcement authorities more effective work.    Many difficulties still have to be overcome in the  accomplishment of social tasks and an improvement in the system  of tax collection.    As of today the arrears of the city budget constitute R59  billion, and the next item after the recess will be the  session's consideration of the question of Kazan's budget.</p>

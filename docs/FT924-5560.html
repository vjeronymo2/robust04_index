			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Homes raided as police probe Alan Paul chain POLICE investigating the collapse last year of the Alan Paul hairdressing and cosmetic shop franchise chains yesterday raided 13 homes or offices of directors and senior employees in Merseyside, Cheshire and Greater Manchester. The raids, by 75 officers from several police forces, were led by Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Coady, head of Merseyside's fraud squad. Police removed papers and records but there were no arrests. Homes raided included those of Mr Alan Moss, the company's former chairman, and Mr Mike Rowlands, the managing director. Police said yesterday they were investigating possible 'financial irregularities' in the running of Alan Paul and the 'circumstances surrounding the company's rights issue' of July last year. The issue flopped with only a 15 per cent take-up, and the subsequent slide in the share price led to Alan Paul shares being suspended, followed by receivership. Alan Paul's rise was one of the more noticeable small-business growth stories of the 1980s, partly because of the flamboyance of Mr Moss and Mr Rowlands - they encouraged franchisees to emulate them by driving BMWs and Ferraris - but also because the company became Britain's only quoted hairdresser. It floated on the unlisted securities market in 1989 and Mr Moss, who founded the business in Bromborough, Wirral in 1970, celebrated with a personalised number plate for his red Ferrari, USM 1. Expansion was via franchising and taking over other chains. The group included Body &amp; Face Place cosmetics shops. From 60 outlets on flotation the group grew to 542 shops and salons. The failed rights issue, a profits warning and two changes of chairman in two months led to shares being suspended a year ago at 20p. They had floated at 140p and peaked at 166p. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, appointed receiver in December last year, contacted the police in February.</p>

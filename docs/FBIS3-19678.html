They are easily denounced for good  and notso good reasons. In contrast, some of them are  recognized abroad for their true value. It is known how much  credit and prestige Belgium has won from the activities of  Paul-Henri Spaak, Pierre Harmel or Leo Tindemans on the  contemporary international stage. Today it would be wrong to  think that these exceptional men do not have any rivals.    At the forefront of them is the prime minister himself.

In the interest of change, the Alliance is  thinking of calling on a moderate socialist who enjoys the full  confidence of Washington. A German cannot take over from a  compatriot. In Italy it is not easy to find a socialist who is  not being bothered by the Justice Ministry. It is premature to  think of a Frenchman. The British Labor Party has a label as  pacifists.

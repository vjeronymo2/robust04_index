			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["A Farewell to Arms" column by Carlos Tapia: "The Rondas </F> Campesinas and the Self-Defense Committees"]    [Text] A large sector of public opinion is confusing the  peasant rondas in the northern part of the country, which  appeared in the mid-1970's, with the peasant self-defense  committees, formed in the south-central part of the country for  defense against terrorist subversion.    The term "rondero" is used indiscriminately to describe two  very different phenomena. Gradually, beginning with TV images of  peasants, men and women, receiving shot guns, as well as the  martial bearing evidenced in military parades, there is a  tendency to identify the ronderos as armed peasants prepared to  confront terrorists. This distorts the reality.    The northern rondas appeared in 1976 at the initiative of  the  peasants themselves, to combat cattle theft, and they  subsequently broadened their activities to include the  resolution of internal disputes. They became an effective,  although informal, administrator of peasant justice.    Furthermore, they were formed within the democratic spirit  of  combating the arbitrariness and corruption expressed by the  binomial police-judge that had always been prejudicial to their  interests. At times they became a valuable instrument for the  mobilization of the peasantry against hoarding and price  increases of products from the cities.    There are currently 3,500 rondas, concentrated mostly in the  department of Cajamarca and the provinces of Ayabaca,  Huancabamba, and Morropon in the department of Piura.    On the other hand, the "armed rondas" of the south-central  part of the country, known as "antisubversive civil defense,"  began to appear in 1983 as a consequence of the need for defense  against attacks by Shining Path's platoons and columns.    From the beginning, either voluntarily or due to pressure  from the Armed Forces, they had a military organization and  purpose. They were obliged to become specialists in defensive  "patrolling" or the pursuit of Shining Path platoons and  columns. In practice, they learned the tactics of ambush and  counterambush.    In 1988 they spread out from Ayacucho--particularly from the  Apurimac river valley where they became powerful--to  Huancavelica and Satipo province, covering a large area where  Shining Path had established itself strategically. During the  same period a similar process occurred in the Tulumayo valley,  in Concepcion province in the department of Junin, which  succeeded in stopping Shining Path and putting it on the  defensive in the countryside.    These armed peasant organizations were legally recognized in  1991 and placed under the Armed Forces Joint Command, giving  them the title of Self-Defense Committees.    Inexplicably, a supreme decree in January 1993 also imposed  military norms and controls on the northern rondas. This serious  error should be corrected as soon as possible.</p>

Review of 20 regulations and statements of general policy, which have been identified as Group 1, has been completed. As a result of the review, this document proposes to remove 2 regulations, amend 1 trade practice regulation, and retain 14 regulations and 3 statements of general policy in their present form. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be submitted on or before July 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be mailed to the Administrator, Packers and Stockyards Administration, room 3039, South Building, U.

Comments were solicited, at that time, concerning the relevance and importance of each regulation and statement of general policy to today's livestock, meat, and poultry industries, and which sections should be retained, modified or removed. To complete the review process, the rules covered by the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking have been divided into three groups and this document relates to those rules identified as Group l.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the request for comments in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the Agency received a total of 1,419 comments relating to the rules in Group 1. Comments were received from 1,307 individuals not identified as producers or as members of any organization, 78 individuals identified as livestock producers, 15 livestock producer and trade associations, 8 animal welfare groups, 3 individuals representing livestock marketing interests, 3 attorneys, 1 association of veterinarians, 1 bank, 2 law enforcement associations, and 1 State Department of Agriculture.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received regarding &sect;201.5, which pertains to Agency procedures on posting a stockyard, or &sect;201.6, concerning Agency deposting procedures. Both of these regulations involve internal procedures taken by the Agency in posting and deposting stockyards and are merely expository of the explicit statutory requirements and not necessary for carrying out the P&amp;S Act. Neither provision affects members of the public. Therefore, this document proposes to remove &sect;&sect;201.5 and 201.6. Removal of these sections will not change the current posting and deposting procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters recommended modifications to &sect;201.61(a). That subsection prohibits market agencies selling on commission from entering into arrangements with dealers and other buyers that would lessen their loyalty to their consignors or impair their selling services. In addition, the subsection specifically prohibits a market agency selling on commission from providing clearing services for an independent dealer purchasing livestock from consignments made to that market agency. Both commenters, a trade association and an agricultural cooperative, recommended deleting the specific prohibition in &sect;201.61(a) against a market agency selling on commission providing clearing services to an independent dealer who purchases livestock from the selling agency's consignments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> P&amp;SA agrees with the recommendations. The purpose of &sect;201.61(a) is to protect the integrity of the relationship between the consignor and the consignee market agency. Retention of the general prohibition against arrangements tending to undermine the loyalty of the market agency or to impair the quality of selling services achieves this purpose without the necessity of specifically prohibiting the furnishing of clearing services by a market agency selling on commission. P&amp;SA has determined that the loyalty of the market agency is not likely to be impaired by the mere furnishing of clearing services to buyers, and so proposes to amend &sect;201.61(a) by modifying the last sentence of the subsection to permit market agencies selling on commission to provide clearing services to independent dealers that purchase livestock from consignments to such market agencies selling on commission, provided that full disclosure of the clearing arrangement is noted on the accounting to the consignor. Full disclosure of the clearing arrangement will protect livestock consignors without unnecessarily restricting purchases from consignments and will allow market agencies selling on commission greater flexibility in representing the interests of livestock sellers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in view of amendments to &sect;201.56(b), published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 13, 1993, at 58 FR 52884, the proposed modifications to subsection (a) are logically consistent and appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A review of the following regulations and statements of general policy has been completed and the Agency proposes to retain each in its present form:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> Sec. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> 201.1&blank;Meaning of words.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.2&blank;Terms defined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.3&blank;Authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.4&blank;Bylaws, rules and regulations, and requirements of exchanges, associations, or other organizations; applicability, establishment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.17&blank;Requirements for filing tariffs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.39&blank;Payment to be made to consignor or shipper by market agencies; exceptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.44&blank;Market agencies to render prompt accounting for purchases on order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.45&blank;Market agencies to make records available for inspection by owners, consignors and purchasers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.81&blank;Suspended registrants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.82&blank;Care and promptness in weighing and handling livestock and live poultry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.86&blank;Brand inspection: Application for authorization, registration and filing of schedules, reciprocal arrangements, and maintenance of identity of consignments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.94&blank;Information as to business; furnishing of by packers, live poultry dealers, stockyards owners, market agencies, and dealers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.95&blank;Inspection of business records and facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 201.96&blank;Unauthorized disclosure of business information prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 203.5&blank;Statement with respect to market agencies paying the expenses of livestock buyers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 203.12&blank;Statement with respect to providing services and facilities at stockyards on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 203.17&blank;Statement of general policy with respect to rates and charges at posted stockyards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the process of reviewing these regulations, it was determined that they were necessary to the efficient and effective enforcement of the P&amp;S Act and to the orderly conduct of the marketing system. The absence of any of the regulations would be detrimental to the industry and could result in increased litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. April 1990 Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of its review of potential back door safety problems, NHTSA conducted an in-depth accident analysis using 1982&hyph;1986 and 1988 (no national data file for 1987) National Accident Sampling System (NASS) data relating to door openings and ejections in passenger vehicles involved in crashes that required towing from the scene (hereinafter referred to as towaway crashes). In addition, the 1988 Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) data were used to assess the magnitude of the safety problem. The results of these analyses were published on April 5, 1990 in a report entitled ``Hatchback, Tailgate, and Back Door Opening in Crashes and Occupant Ejection through the Back Area'' (1990 Report). A copy of this report is available in NHTSA Docket 90&hyph;08&hyph;GR&hyph;001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The report concluded that back doors of vehicles so equipped open in 5&hyph;6 percent of towaway crashes, compared to 1&hyph;2 percent of side doors in such crashes. Further, a hatchback or tailgate was about 3 times as likely to open as one of the front side doors and about 7&hyph;8 times as likely to open as one of the rear side doors. Of passenger vehicles so equipped, an estimated 36,244 hatchbacks and tailgates opened in towaway crashes in 1988. More specifically, an estimated 4,986 passenger van back doors opened in towaway crashes, representing about 4 times the rate of front side door openings and about double the rate of right rear side door openings (very few passenger vans have left side rear doors).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the data showed that 53 percent of the back door openings occurred in accidents involving vehicle rollovers, as opposed to 23 percent of left front door openings and 40 percent of right front door openings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the frequency of back door openings, however, occupant ejection through the back door occurred in only 1 percent of the towaway crashes involving back door openings. This compares with 8 to 13 percent of occupant ejections through front door openings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FARS data indicated that there were 8,343 passenger car and MPV occupant ejection fatalities in 1988, 2,190 of which were from vehicles with back doors. NHTSA's report set forth two methodologies, both using NASS data, to estimate the number of these fatalities that represented occupant ejections through back doors. One methodology resulted in an estimate that 93 of the fatally injured persons were ejected through back doors. The other methodology estimated the number to be 130.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also on April 5, 1990, NHTSA wrote to nine manufacturers (Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Volvo) asking their thoughts on how to address the problem of back door openings and requesting information on design specifications used for the production of back door latch/lock systems. Eight of the nine responded, indicating that none of their back door latch assemblies, except certain Mazda vehicles, met the requirements of Standard No. 206.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They stated that they did not consider back door openings to be a significant safety problem, however, and indicated that they had certain design guidelines and requirements that are followed in designing their back door latch assemblies. Finally, they stated that proper use of seat belts is the most effective method of ejection reduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. June 1990 Petition for Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 19, 1990, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety petitioned the agency to, among other things, extend the requirements of Standard 206 to back doors. NHTSA denied this petition in a document published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (55 FR 48261) on November 20, 1990, citing the 1990 Report in its denial. NHTSA concluded that increased use of seat belts would be a more effective means of reducing back door ejections than extending the requirements of Standard 206 to back doors, and that there was not a safety need significant enough to justify the recommended rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Events Since 1990  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA continued to evaluate the issue of preventing back door ejections and on January 21, 1994, issued an update to the 1990 Report. The updated report is entitled ``Door Opening and Occupant Ejection through Rear Hatches, Tailgates, and Other Back Doors'' (1994 Report). The agency published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 3925) on January 27, 1994, requesting public review and comment on this report. This report is available in Docket No. 90&hyph;06&hyph;No.3&hyph;001.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

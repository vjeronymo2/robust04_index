			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sleeping diner As a businessman, I have encountered several times the embarrassing situation of a sleeping diner. I myself pinch my thigh under the table to deal with this peculiar syndrome (rather common among Japanese businessman especially when abroad). For the sake of fairness, I must point out I have noticed on a few occasions, Europeans drowsing in restaurants in Tokyo. The Solution is 'OSHIBORI' (literal meaning is 'a squeezed'). Perhaps you know what it is as you have surely visited a Japanese restaurant. But just for good order's sake, it is a wet hand towel served when we are seated at the table, just to clean hands. I don't know any restaurants in Europe which never served this Oshibori. Quality of towel: Thick, soft and and right size. Moisture content: Not too wet, nor too dry. Cleanliness: To say nothing of, but must be always almost new, so usually white towel if needed to demonstrate cleanliness. Presentation: Like serviette folding, how 'squeezed', and usually on the right small tray - (bamboo, knitted basket. etc) Scent:Trace of fragrance everyone can accept. Temperature: In hot summer, straight from fridge, and in winter, steaming hot. So now what I want to suggest, is that waiting staff smartly approach with (cold) Oshibori to ask the sleepy diner if he cares to use Oshibori. Kodaira City, Tokyo</p>

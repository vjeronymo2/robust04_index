			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : SEARCH PARTY COMBS HILLS FOR MISSING  OFFICER, 41  </P> <P> Authorities on Wednesday conducted an intensive search of the hills north of  Moorpark for a Los Angeles police officer who disappeared after leaving work  Sunday night in North Hollywood.  </P> <P> But by nightfall, the 80-member search party -- including many off-duty  officers -- had found no sign of Sgt. Christopher Vasquez, 41, a 20-year  veteran of the force.  </P> <P> The search for Vasquez, who was recently separated from his wife, centered on  the hilly, undeveloped area behind the townhouse where he had recently moved.  </P> <P> Authorities feared that Vasquez, described as an avid runner who often used the  trails behind his home, may have been hurt or lost. But they also acknowledged  that Vasquez may have been depressed and suicidal because of his marital  problems.  </P></p>

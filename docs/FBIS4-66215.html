			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lin Xiangjin (2651 4382 6855): "Government </F> Intervention Necessary to Eliminate Price Scissors"]    [Text] In early 1993 Comrade Wang Zhonghai [3769 1813 3189]  had his article "Leave the `Price Scissors' Erroneous Zone"  (abbreviated hereafter as Wang Zhonghai's article) published in  the 1993 No 1 issue of JINGJI YANJIU and the 1993 No 2 issue of  NONGYE JINGJI WENTI. The article contends that the emergence of  the price scissors has nothing to do with the operations of the  market economy, that it was merely one of the economic policies  of the former Soviet Union, that the price scissors cannot come  about in the absence of government price-setting, and that  elimination of the price scissors is just "around the corner"  since China has decontrolled agricultural prices. Misled by his  own erroneous thinking about the price scissors, the writer  argues that the entire academic debate about the price scissors  in the country since the PRC was founded was "misguided."  Because it was published in some of the more authoritative  scholarly journals in China, the article will have a substantial  impact on policymaking. I believe, therefore, that it is  necessary to comment on some of the major mistaken viewpoints in  the article so as to clarify the issue and facilitate the  development of a socialist market economy.    1. Price Scissors as Product of Imperfect Competition    Two questions need to be asked here. First, why does  imperfect competition give rise to the price scissors? Second,  why do the price scissors typically operate in the exchange  between industrial and agricultural products and not in other  industries?    According to the conventional theories of the market  economy,  when an economy is in a state of perfect competition, there are  usually a large number of factories and farms, all fairly evenly  distributed. Not one of them is in a position to influence  prices. On the contrary, every single producer is at the  receiving end of prices, meaning that he must sell his products  at prevailing market prices. Under these circumstances, the cost  of a product which a producer is willing and able to supply is  exactly equal to the marginal cost (that is, the total cost  incurred by the production of the last product) as well as to  the price. It also equals marginal efficiency, namely the price  consumers are willing to pay. In a state of perfect competition,  the economy operates under what has been called the "Pareto  efficiency," where allocation efficiency has been achieved with  the result that the only way to increase an individual's  well-being is to reduce another's by the same amount. However,  since the prices of every factory or farm equal the lowest  average cost as well as marginal cost, the factories, farms, and  industries are driven to a state of zero profit (after deducting  the opportunity cost return on investment). In a state of  perfect competition, therefore, the circumstances of an  individual or an industry will not worsen for no reason to the  benefit of another individual or industry, and hence there is no  unequal exchange between industry and agriculture. In other  words, there is no price scissors.    However, things are different under imperfect competition,  particularly where there is a monopoly. When most of the output  in a trade or industry is concentrated in a handful of sellers,  they will be in a position to manipulate prices to a certain  extent, thus introducing imperfect competition into their  particular trade or industry. Suppose all incomes have been  distributed properly among all social groups. Factory A is the  sole imperfect competitor in this particular economic society,  all others being perfect competitors, that is, their marginal  costs equal prices. Under these circumstances, A, being an  imperfect competitor (someone who deviates from the conventional  rules or is a monopolist in a particular industry) has some  control over prices because he faces a demand curve that slopes  downward toward the right. In the absence of external  restraints, he will, prompted by self-interests, make his  products a little scarcer, at the same time raising their prices  beyond the marginal cost to give himself extra profits. He will  not increase output to a level where marginal costs equal  prices, which also happens to be the level where market prices  are decided by consumer wishes. Thus, relative to the social  cost incurred by A's product, society does not obtain A's  product in as large a quantity as it would really want. The  upshot is unequal exchange. If A's product is an input required  by B, a perfect competitor, B would discover that the same  amount of money now purchases a lesser quantity of inputs. When  his inputs drop, his output also decreases. Furthermore, since B  has no power over prices, he must continue to sell his output at  the old price, which translates into a lower income for him.    Unfortunately, the industrial sector is better positioned to  create imperfect competition. In other words, it wields more  clout on the market, as mainly demonstrated in the following two  ways:    1) Economies of scale. Market competition, we know, has one  tendency: the larger the scale of production, the greater the  profit. This tendency leads to accumulation and concentration,  culminating in a monopoly. The reason is this. When large-scale  production makes possible significant savings, large factories  can engage in production more economically than their smaller  counterparts and sell their products more cheaply than the  latter, rendering it impossible for the smaller companies to  survive. Thus, when economies of scale become widespread, there  will only be a handful of sellers; that is, monopolists. In many  industries, such as steel, automobile, chemical industry,  plastics, and glass, producers can keep reducing their fixed  cost per unit of output by endlessly expanding their plants,  installing larger and larger boilers and machines, buying more  and more specialized equipment, enlarging their labor force, and  improving labor productivity. Let's suppose the vertical axis  represents the average fixed cost and the horizontal axis  represents output. The average fixed cost curve will then  resemble a hyperbola whose asymptotic curve is the  horizontal-vertical axis. That is, the fact that the fixed cost  is distributed among a rising number of output units brings the  fixed cost curve closer and closer to the horizontal axis.  However high the demand curve in the industry in question, for  the producer the most efficient scale of production is always  the largest. Thus it is out of question for the tens of  thousands of competitors at the mercy of prices to compete on a  level playing field. To put it differently, in an industry where  economies of scale are significantly notable or which is  sensitive to economies of scale, the market is predisposed to  monopolism. In agriculture, however, the significance of  economies of scale is severely crimped because of the  constraints imposed by the finiteness of land and the fact that  it is where natural reproduction and economic reproduction  converge.    2) Legal constraints. We know that regardless of whether a  country is socialist or capitalist, the government finds it  necessary to restrain competition in certain industries for a  variety of reasons. In most cases such restraints take the form  of entry restrictions, patents, and foreign trade restriction.  As we can see, almost all these restrictions are confined to the  industrial sector. 1) entry restrictions. Under the former  Soviet model, all factories, mines, railroads, and banks were  state-owned and entry by individuals into these industries was  prohibited. The result was a high degree of administrative  monopoly in industry. This is one example of legal constraint.  Moreover, in many developed nations such as the United States,  Japan, and those in Europe, the government believes that a high  efficiency is possible in public utilities including telephone,  water supply, gas, electricity, and roads only when the company  enjoys a monopoly or a near-monopoly. Therefore, it has granted  a special monopoly to the companies in those industries. In  return for the special monopoly, a company agrees to submit to  government regulation of their prices and operations.  Nevertheless, by taking advantage of the official monopoly, the  companies over the years have succeeded in almost completely  shutting out other competitors. In contrast, similar privileges  or entry restrictions are a rarity in agriculture. 2) Patents.  To encourage inventions, the governments of many nations grant  patents to investors, thus giving them the prerogative to use a  patented product or production process exclusively or  monopolistically. This is a legal way to limit entry into a  particular trade or industry. However, it has led to some  companies monopolize the production of a certain article for  years and years. Most patents thus far have gone to industrial  products. 3) Foreign trade restrictions. Almost all governments  around the world seek to curb imports by imposing high tariffs  or quota restrictions on foreign producers. The exclusion from  the market of large numbers of foreign suppliers and buyers also  reduces perfect competition up to a point. The principal  beneficiaries of restrictive tariffs are those industries with a  high degree of concentration. In other words, some parts of the  industrial sector, thanks to reduced foreign competition, have  been able to create a monopolistic situation.    Because of the factors noted above, many countries that were  the first to adopt a market economy have seen numerous of their  industries come under the control of a handful of companies. In  the United States, for instance, the four-company concentration  rate (the output share of the four largest companies in a  specific industry) in 1977 was 100 percent in the tobacco  industry; 96 percent, automobiles; 91 percent, breakfast  cereals; 90 percent, electric light bulb; 79 percent, aluminum;  61 percent, soap; 30 percent, iron and steel; and 22 percent,  meat processing. In contrast, agriculture has a long long way to  go before it achieves concentration of this magnitude.    The above analysis shows that the price scissors emerge as a  result of market forces when some companies behave without  restraint. It is a product of imperfect competition. Because of  a stronger objective tendency in some industries toward  concentration, that is, monopoly, the companies in those  industries are able to earn a higher profit than if the  government makes them compete like perfect competitors. Their  excess profit, furthermore, mainly comes from the pockets of  perfect competitors, primarily agricultural producers. So we  cannot but have to conclude that wherever there is imperfect  competition, there are the price scissors.    Wang Zhonghai writes in his article, "The price scissors  were  one of the economic policies of the former Soviet Government," a  phenomenon unique to a specific nation (former Soviet Union) and  a specific economic model (the socialist economy fashioned by  Stalin). It is argued that in capitalist nations, in old China,  and in China today now that it has jettisoned the Soviet model,  either the price scissors do not exist or its disappearance is  just "around the corner." This, it should be said, is where the  real mistake occurs. Wang Zhonghai confuses government functions  with the workings of the economy. To Wang Zhonghai, the price  scissors is the brainchild of some policymakers, not the product  of unrestrained monopolistic market forces. According to his  logic, government only needs to end the practice of  participating in the collection of the price scissors without,  however, limiting or regulating imperfect competition, and the  price scissors will disappear automatically. The analysis below  will show that this point of view is wrong.    2. Only Government Control Will Eliminate Price Scissors    As explained above, the existence of imperfect market  competition has deep historic roots, including both what is  inherent in market competition itself (economies of scale) and  legal restrictions adopted by the state. As soon as a monopoly  comes into existence, it will prevent the economy from achieving  the kind of high-efficiency resource allocation possible under  perfect competition and prevent society from deriving the most  satisfaction from its finite resources. Unequal exchange between  monopolists and perfect competitors will then naturally occur.  Economists refer to this situation as "market malfunctioning."  What is needed here is for the government to step in to offset  market malfunctioning by opposing monopolies and unfair  competition and preserving an orderly environment for  competition using legal and administrative tools. This indeed is  a paramount responsibility of government. Many industrialized  market economies have anti-monopoly laws and corresponding  executive agencies. Some countries regulate a small number of  monopolistic resource products and public utilities, most  importantly by determining the prices to be charged by the  monopolistic companies. In the United States, furthermore, a  rural cooperative law has been passed to make farmers better  able to fend for themselves by helping them participate in the  supply of inputs and the sale of their products. It may be said  that the price scissors do not exist, or exist only marginally  in industrialized market-economy nations, but that is because  they have at various points created a market economy that  includes macro-management and government intervention, the  so-called "mixed economy." The cornerstone of a mixed economy is  market regulation of resources. At the same time, however, the  government and other public institutions regulate economic  activities through fiscal and monetary policies and by using a  mix of legal and administrative tools.    It should be said, therefore, that it is in countries where  government malfunctioning is most extensive that the price  scissors are the largest. "Government malfunctioning" is also  known as "nonoptimal intervention." What it means is that not  only does government intervention fail to correct market  distortions, but, on the contrary, thanks to misguided policies  and conduct, the distortions are exacerbated, further  undercutting economic efficiency. In this way, with government  malfunctioning compounding market malfunctioning, the price  scissors will only worsen. Meanwhile, the failure to put  agriculture on a sound footing leads to food shortages and,  ultimately, workers' discontent. This was probably what happened  in the former Soviet Union in 1923, as noted by Wang Zhonghai in  his article. This being the case, to suggest, as Wang Zhonghai  has done, that the price scissors will not come into existence  in the absence of government administrative price-setting is to  reject all government intervention indiscriminately. Here we  need to distinguish between two issues. One, there is no direct  causal relationship between government administrative  price-setting and the price scissors. This issue has been  analyzed above. Two, justifiable and appropriate administrative  price-setting not only will not cause the price scissors, but  will on the contrary diminish or eliminate the price scissors.    Perhaps Comrade Wang Zhonghai means to say that in a  socialist market economy, natural monopolies will not occur, so  there will be no such thing as imperfect competition. But if  that is the case, wouldn't we need even more precise government  administrative price-setting to prevent the emergence of the  price scissors? In any case, among all those countries which  have tried the socialist market economy, which has managed to do  just that?    3. Decontrol of Agricultural Prices Not the Same as  Elimination of Price Scissors    Wang Zhonghai writes in his article, "The price scissors  have  not been eradicated completely, but since the 14th CPC National  Congress has made the creation of a socialist market economy the  objective of economic restructuring in China, it will be  eliminated any day now. This can be achieved by accelerating the  decontrol of agricultural prices and transforming the mechanism  of price formation." His assumption is that provided we  decontrol the prices of agricultural products, leaving it up to  the market to regulate them (that is, transforming the price  formation mechanism), we can get rid of the price scissors lock,  stock, and barrel. What will happen if we go down this road? Let  us begin by examining a number of important facts:    In Shaanxi Province, the procurement prices of agricultural  byproducts were raised 11 percent, 0.3 percent, and -1.8 percent  in the several years between 1988 and 1991, respectively. During  the same period, the retail prices of rural industrial goods  rose 22.7 percent, 2.8 percent, and 2.8 percent, respectively,  widening the price scissors 10.5 percent, 2.5 percent, and 4.7  percent for a total of 18.6 percent for the 3-year period, or  5.9 percent annually on the average. After adjusting for  inflation, agricultural inputs by peasant households rose a mere  3.2 percent each year, far short of the investment demand. Owing  to the widening price scissors, the ratio of peasant incomes and  those of urban households deteriorated from 1:2.38 to 1:2.75.    In Guizhou Province, the price ratio index for the exchange  of industrial and agricultural products shrank sharply in 1993:  The wheat-salt price ratio index retreated to the level of the  mid-1970's, a drop of 109 percentage points compared with the  peak reached in 1990; the wheat-plain white cloth price ratio  index fell to the level of the early 1960's, down 11.48  percentage points from the peak in 1982; the wheat-coal and oil  price ratio index retreated to the level of the mid-1970's, a  loss of 56.22 percentage points from the peak in 1990; the  wheat-chemical fertilizers price ratio index sank to a new low,  shedding 45.1 percentage points from the peak in 1987.    In Xuzhou Shi in Jiangsu Province, unequal exchange between  agricultural and industrial products in recent years has driven  up the costs of farming excessively. If we look at the real  return on farming one mu (0.0667 hectare) of each of seven major  crops, only wheat yields a tiny profit (25.75 yuan), while the  others are all money-losers: rice, 27.47 yuan; corn, 10.94 yuan;  soy bean, 5.13 yuan; rapeseed, 86.14 yuan; cotton, 44.79 yuan;  and silkworm, 87.47 yuan.    The decline in the price ratio index in the exchange between  industrial and agricultural products everywhere has also had a  depressing effect on the price ratio index in livestock  products-industrial goods exchange. In Guizhou Province, for  instance, the pork-salt price ratio index has fallen back to the  level of the mid-1970's, down 468.42 percentage points from the  peak in 1988; the pork-plain white cloth price ratio index has  retreated to the level of the mid-1950's, down 96.79 percentage  points from the peak in 1988; the pork-coal price ratio index  has fallen to the level of the mid-1970's, down 263.54  percentage points from the peak in 1988; the pork-chemical  fertilizers price ratio index has hit a new low, down 305.40  percentage points from the peak in 1987. (Gong Yong [7895 0516],  "Steep Decline in Price Ratio Index in Guizhou for the Exchange  between Major Agricultural Products and Industrial Products in  1993," GUIZHOU DIAOYAN, 1993 No 2.) Then there are the data on  nine cities in Jiangsu Province. The prices of mixed feeds for  cows have jumped 29.3 percent on the average since 1993, while  the prices at which milk is procured and at which sterilized  milk is sold have risen only 2.0 percent and 2.3 percent,  respectively. As the raising of milk cows becomes less and less  profitable and downright unprofitable, milk production is in  decline in seven provinces and municipalities to date. The  prices of coal, water, electricity, petroleum, and  transportation have gone up by various extents in numerous  places, greatly boosting the costs of livestock products and  hobbling the animal husbandry industry.    The situation described above occurred amid the gradual  decontrol of agricultural prices. In 1992, 22.8 percent of all  agricultural products sold by peasants had state-set prices,  down from 92.6 percent in 1978; 20.0 percent had state-guided  prices, up from 1.8 percent; and 57.8 percent had  market-regulated prices, up from 5.6 percent. Thus the  contention by Comrade Wang Zhonghai that the price scissors will  disappear provided agricultural prices are decontrolled is not  consistent with reality.    A wealth of facts proves that a major reason for the decline  in agricultural goods-industrial goods price ratio index is the  extraordinary increase in the prices of industrial resources  that are in short supply and in the charges of public utilities,  including steel, coal, water, electricity, oil, and freight  charges. According to observations at 11 points in Jiangsu, for  instance, the costs of producing 100 kilograms of wheat rose  9.94 percent in 1993 from a year ago, spending on diesel oil  jumped 28.28 percent compared with 1992, and the costs of  producing 100 kilograms of rapeseed were also up 6.30 percent,  including a 31.43 percent increase in diesel oil costs. Or take  the case of Jinghai Fishery Company in Rongcheng Shi, Shandong  Province. Its fishing fleet consumes 15,000 tons of diesel oil  each year, yet the company is allocated only 460 tons of diesel  oil under the plan. Diesel oil accounts for about 50 percent of  the fishing inputs. A fishing trip lasts from 15 to 20 days on  the average and a small or medium-sized vessel burns about 1 ton  of diesel oil a day, which works out to be 20 tons of diesel oil  per fishing trip. With the price of diesel oil as high as 2,000  yuan per ton, a fishing trip costs 40,000 yuan in fuel alone.  The catch of a small or mid-sized vessel per trip ranges between  25 and 30 tons, which translates into a total income of anywhere  from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Add the other expenses and a  fishing trip may end up costing more than it earns. The fishing  industry in Shandong Province has been unprofitable since 1992  and things got worse in 1993. To cut losses, fishery companies  up and down the coast have suspended operations and auctioned  off their fishing vessels.    The extraordinary increases in the prices of scarce  industrial products and the charges of public utilities have  also directly driven up the costs of industries making articles  for agricultural use, which, in turn, has exacerbated the  unequal exchange between industrial and agricultural products.  According to statistics, of the 55 mid-sized nitrogen fertilizer  enterprises in the nation, 27 lost money in the first quarter of  1993 because of endless hikes in the prices of raw materials,  electricity, and transportation costs. Unable to absorb these  massive price increases by tapping internal potential alone,  they have passed them onto agriculture.    Thus, without strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control, the decontrol of agricultural prices in itself will not  get rid of the price scissors at its root. On the contrary,  there is a tendency for the price scissors to expand. This  proves that in China's socialist market economy, imperfect  competition may result from the absence of the right kind of  government intervention. As I see it, imperfect competition in  Chinese industry to date may occur in either one of these two  scenarios: 1) the transitional economic system inherits some of  the administrative monopolistic habits of the past in the course  of reform. At present, about 30 percent of all capital goods  sold have administratively set prices, including energy (crude  oil, coal), raw materials (iron, steel, and chemical industrial  raw materials), and rail freight. Still under the influence of  the old system, these sectors may engage in "rent-searching"  activities and squeeze profits from price differences, which  distorts prices, which, in turn, gives rise to imperfect  competition. 2) The growth of the nonstate economy. Due to  economies of scale and improvements in managerial and sales  techniques, a number of large companies now account for a  substantial share of the sales of the decontrolled part of some  products, such as petrochemicals, coal, and steel, and in doing  so manage to control the prices of products with negotiated  prices. If this and other kinds of imperfect competition are not  brought under government regulation and control, the price  scissors will not go away.    There was a time in the history of capitalism when  laissez-faire and nonintervention policies were considered the  best. With the emergence of imperfect competition and the  consequent economic dislocations, the notion that capitalist  nations must intervene in economic life to solve inflation,  unemployment, and other problems became widely accepted. In  other words, laissez-faire economics has long been discarded in  the West. In China, people have suffered long and hard under the  planned economic system. So they assume, understandably, that  everything will be fine if only there is decontrol across the  board. But it will not be long before we realize that decontrol  alone unaccompanied by the right degree of government  intervention will not work either. Therefore the only conclusion  we can arrive at is this: We must make the most of the market  economy in resource allocation and, at the same time, step up  proper government intervention in economic life to ensure the  realization of economic efficiency.    4. Measures To Narrow Price Scissors    As noted above, the price scissors are a product of  imperfect  competition. Price decontrol cannot completely prevent the  emergence of some forms of imperfect competition, namely  monopolies. To eradicate the price scissors, therefore, we must  take the following steps:    1) Impose price controls on a small number of monopolistic  resources and the products of public utilities. Among them are  crude oil, natural gas, a handful of rare metals, urban public  transportation, running water, coal, integrated network  electricity, rail transportation, and posts and  telecommunications. The markets of these products are basically  monopolistic resource markets, natural monopolistic markets, or  public utilities markets. Without government intervention,  enterprises in these markets will take advantage of their  inherent monopolistic status or some other prerogatives to set  high monopolistic prices and reap excessive monopolistic  profits. Since the role of prices in the sound allocation of  resources on these markets is restricted, regulation by an  outside force, namely the government, is needed. These products  come under government price-setting in just about every country  in the world. Today, China is in the process of decontrolling  the prices of most coal and petroleum products and increasing  the share of steel with market prices. It is the plan of the  departments concerned to completely decontrol the prices of  competitive sectors by 1994 or 1995. In my opinion, the policy  of totally scrapping price controls and decontrolling prices  wholesale militates against the sound allocation of resources  and the reduction of the price scissors in the exchange between  industrial and agricultural goods. It should be reconsidered.    2) The government helps enhance the peasants'  self-protection  capability. As noted above, because there are so many of them  and because they operate on a small scale, peasants are in a  weak bargaining position when it comes to selling their  products. At the same time, they are confronted with imperfect  competition in the acquisition of inputs. If they are not  organized properly, peasants will remain in a defenseless  position. A peasants' supply and marketing cooperative may give  them a tool through which they can participate in the  acquisition of agricultural inputs and a means whereby they can  enter the arena of agricultural products processing and  marketing. In the United States, for instance, cooperatives  purchased 20 percent of all inputs and accounted for 31 percent  of all agricultural products sold in 1980. The farmers'  cooperative provides a dependable market where farmers can sell  their goods and purchase inputs, strengthens their bargaining  position in those transactions, and maximizes their return while  minimizing the costs of inputs and services. To make sure the  cooperative truly represents farmers' interests, government  regulations require that the cooperative be owned and managed by  agricultural producers themselves. In elections, every member of  a cooperative can cast only one vote so as to prevent large  investors or consumers from taking over the cooperative. The  interest rate on cooperative investment must not exceed the  interest rate state banks pay on deposits, the idea being to  ensure that most investment goes to improving the efficiency  with which agricultural products are marketed and sold and  imports are purchased, not to earning more interest for the  cooperative. At least 50 percent of the volume of business  conducted by the cooperative must be handled by cooperative  members, again to ensure that it is cooperative members that  really benefit from the cooperative. We can learn a lesson from  all of that.    3) Introduce a protective procurement price system for major  agricultural products and livestock products. Because of the low  comparative advantage of growing bulk agricultural products,  their growers need price support. Protective procurement prices  should be held at a level where peasants derive an income from  agricultural production roughly equal to that of laborers in  other social strata, or at least enough to ensure the normal  operations of simple reproduction in agriculture and animal  husbandry and to prevent them from being hurt. When grain prices  on the market drop below protection prices, the state must  purchase the grain on peasants' hands within the scope defined  by government regulations on protective price procurement.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (i) Each employer who is subject to this section or who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives by certified mail a standard registration form shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete a standard registration form for each work location in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento ECO Program Area. The form must be signed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highest ranking responsible officer at the location who shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attest to the accuracy of the information reported. An employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall provide the following information on the form:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (A) The name of the employer and address of the work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (B) The name and telephone of the highest ranking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible officer at the location;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (C) Designation of the location as a single site,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headquarters, or branch;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (D) The total number of employees at the location and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number assigned to report to the work location during the peak  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> travel period; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (E) The name, telephone number, and address (if different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from that named in paragraphs (f)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section) of the employee transportation coordinator (ETC) at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location to receive APO survey and compliance plan forms and who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will serve as the employer's contact with the EPA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (ii) An employer with more than one location in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento ECO Program Area shall complete a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration form for each work location, but individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration forms may be submitted together. The employer shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designate an ETC for EPA to contact at each location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding this provision, an employer may designate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single contact person to receive APO survey and compliance plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms for all work locations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (g) Average Passenger Occupancy (APO) target.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (1) Designation of target APO.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAA has established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average passenger occupancy (APO) at a work location as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance measure for determining an employer's compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The APO performance target is 125 percent of the average vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy (AVO) for the Sacramento ECO Program Area. Given a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline AVO of 1.11, the target APO for the Sacramento ECO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program Area is 1.38.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Deadline for compliance with the target APO.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Not later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than March 1, 1999, each employer is required to increase the APO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the employer's work location during the peak travel period to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the target APO. An employer that has achieved the target APO is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to maintain the location APO at a level at least as high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as the target APO, but is not required to increase its APO beyond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the target APO. Each employer shall annually document  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achievement of the target APO at each work location through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> APO survey described in paragraph (h) of this section, and report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the location's compliance with the target APO to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator in the maintenance plan, as required by paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Average Passenger Occupancy (APO) survey requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (1) Notice of requirement to survey.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 180 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving completed registration forms from employers, but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later than March 1, 1996, the Administrator shall notify each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer of the requirement to conduct an APO survey and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop and implement a compliance plan in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. The notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall include copies of the required APO survey and compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan forms. Failure of an employer to receive such notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall not relieve any employer of the obligation to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all applicable obligations of this section. Employers not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receiving such forms may request them from EPA by contacting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Region IX office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirement to survey.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purpose of documenting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the work location APO, each employer shall conduct annual APO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys of the commute patterns of the employees who arrive at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its work location during the peak travel period. An employer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with more than one location in the Sacramento ECO Program Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall conduct a survey at each location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Survey procedure.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An employer shall conduct an APO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey of all employees assigned to report to the work location  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the peak travel period using the following procedure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except as provided in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (i) Except as provided below, an employer shall use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard APO survey form provided by the EPA. The APO survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form is designed to collect information on the commute patterns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of employees and to allow the employer to calculate the work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location APO as described in this paragraph. The standard form  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be used without alteration. If the employer's individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey form has been submitted to and approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator prior to administration of the survey, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may permit the employer to use this pre-approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form as a substitute for the standard APO survey form. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator shall not approve any survey form that could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected, in the Administrator's judgement, to produce different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey results than if the standard form had been used. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employer is permitted to attach additional survey forms to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard form if desired, without prior approval of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (ii) Employers shall choose a typical week in which to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conduct the APO survey. A week shall not be considered typical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if it:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (A) Includes a holiday observed by the employer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (B) Immediately follows a week in which a holiday was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed on Friday or precedes a week in which a holiday will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed on Monday;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (C) Is a week during which the employer holds a rideshare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair or other intensive information promotion related to the ECO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

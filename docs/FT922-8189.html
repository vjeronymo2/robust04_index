			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: SEB's long-term debt rating downgraded THE LONG-TERM debt rating of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank, was reduced yesterday by Moody's Investors Service to Aa-3 from Aa-2 in a further blow to its prestige. The New York rating agency said the bank 'will experience ongoing asset quality stress, particularly in its domestic loan portfolio'. SEB's earnings growth would be limited, it added. However, the rating agency noted that SEB is currently exhibiting strong capital ratios. It said that the bank's ratings for short-term deposit obligations and commercial paper was not under review and remained at Prime-1, although the rating on SEB's long-term deposit obligations has also been reduced to Aa-3. Moody's action is a further sign of the continuing troubles at SEB which recorded a 30 per cent drop in operating profit last year following SKr4.76bn (Dollars 813.7m) of credit loss provisions and a SKr500m loss on the disposal of a 28.2 per cent share option in Skandia, the insurance group it failed to take over. The credit re-rating will add further pressures on SEB as it awaits impatiently the arrival of its third chief executive in three years - Mr Bjorn Svedberg, the former chief executive of Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications group. He takes over from Mr Bo Ramfors in September Last week's move by the Swedish state to nationalise the whole of Nordbanken, the country's loss-making second largest commercial bank, in a rescue operation has added to the pressures on SEB and the rest of the private sector. Mr Curt Olsson, SEB chairman, complained that while he accepted the Swedish government had no real alternative but to take over Nordbanken, in doing so it distorted competition in the banking system. Moody's also downgraded the long-term debt and deposit obligation ratings of Swedbank, the central bank for Sweden's savings banks, from Aa-2 to AI.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UN chief ponders permanent army A PERMANENT United Nations force that would respond to outright aggression, 'imminent or actual', has been proposed by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general. His recommendations for measures to increase the world body's effectiveness in the post-Cold War era are contained in a 52-page document, requested by the Security Council at the summit meeting in January initiated and presided over by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. Mr Boutros Ghali is to visit London early next month and will be amplifying his ideas in talks with Mr Major. The possibility of establishing a permanent force was envisaged when the UN was founded in 1945 but the Cold War, during which no fewer than 279 vetoes were cast, blocked formal action. Observing that the UN 'must never again be crippled as it was in the era that has passed', the secretary general also said the collapse of communism presented an opportunity not to be squandered. However, his proposal accords more with ideas long advocated by Moscow than with what the west has been prepared to accept. Mr Vladimir Petrovsky, a former Soviet deputy foreign minister and now a senior UN official, helped draft the report. Mr Edward Perkins, the US ambassador, was not consulted during its preparation and the State Department voiced reservations last April about any proposal to negotiate agreements to provide the Security Council with permanent troops under the control of the Military Staff Committee. Noting that the Council had not so far used military force coercively, Mr Boutros Ghali recalled that in the Gulf War members 'chose to authorise member states to take measures on its behalf'. But having UN troops ready and on call could serve as a means to deter breaches of the peace. Mr Giandomenico Picco, the UN negotiator who obtained the release of western hostages in Beirut, including the last two Germans freed this week, is resigning for personal reasons, it was announced last night. He is in Vienna this weekend for talks with Iraqi officials on a possible resumption of oil shipments. His resignation takes effect on July 31.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: American dream Fears of a large fiscal package from a Democratic administration weighed on the US Treasury bond market in the run up to the presidential election. But following President-elect Bill Clinton's victory the bond market rallied as growth became more robust. The need for a large reflationary package has thus been reduced. As a bonus, economic growth curbs the deficit directly by increasing tax revenues and cutting social security spending. Yet despite this improved supply picture real bond yields remain historically high. The bond market may thus be expressing fears about future inflation prospects, but for the foreseeable future US inflation is likely to remain subdued. Monetary aggregates are under control, commodity prices are weak, and with much of the expansion coming from productivity gains wage pressures are unlikely to become a problem. Indeed, although the burden of servicing debt has fallen for consumers, unemployment may fall only slowly, and the relatively high level of outstanding debt is likely to mute any consumer spending spree. While the balance of probability favours US growth proving stronger than currently expected, there is little chance of an outright inflationary boom. Once that positive message begins to sink in, bond yields may well start to fall. Which may in turn spark further modest gains in the equity market. The performance of shares was disappointing in 1992, despite the market hitting all-time highs. Valuations already discounted a substantial earnings recovery, and rising money market rates late in the year raised fears that the funds which had flowed out of deposits to support shares might start to flow back. If, however, the inflation outlook remains satisfactory and bond yields continue to fall, the rise in money market rates may be partly reversed. And unless growth proves much stronger than expected, official rates are unlikely to rise before the tail end of 1993. Somewhat higher growth may also lead to the earnings rebound being better than expected. Having cut costs, the US corporate sector is strongly geared to economic recovery: an additional 1 per cent on growth would add 10 per cent to earnings.</p>

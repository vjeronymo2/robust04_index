			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Buy-out of Leyland Daf's African operations backed MANAGERS seeking to buy out Leyland Daf's six truck assembly and distribution operations in Africa have won backing from Standard Bank London, UK subsidiary of South Africa's Standard Bank Investment Corporation. Neither the bank or the buy-out team would last night provide specific details of the support. The buy-out attempt is being led by Mr Arthur Zammit, managing director of Daf International, based at Eindhoven in the Netherlands. Daf International was responsible for the former UK-Dutch truck manufacturers' overseas sales but the six African companies form part of the Leyland Daf receivership in the UK. The operations employ 1,500 people and are based in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi. They are primarily assemblers of truck kits produced by Leyland Daf's plant in Leyland, Lancashire, for third world countries. Mr Zammit said there were three main aims behind the buy-out: to preserve continuity of operations at the six companies, which predate the Leyland-Daf merger of 1987; to preserve the UK and African work forces; and to maintain distribution networks which, he claims, are 'unique' in Africa. Leyland was once the biggest exporter of trucks and buses to Africa. The Littlewoods home shopping group yesterday boosted Leyland Daf's Birmingham vans operation, also the subject of management buy-out proposals, with a new order for 518 vans worth Pounds 6m.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Raul Chacon Soto] </F>   [Text] The National Telephone Company of Venezuela (CANTV)  reported its financial performance during 1993, which registered  a net profit during the year of 30.72 billion bolivares. This  net profit signifies 10.6 percent profitability based on the  firm's assets adjusted for inflation.    According to the company's communique, earnings were fully  reinvested in expansion and modernization programs and  improvement of telephone services, that have been taking place  since privatization. A total of 69 billion bolivares was  invested in these programs in 1993, considerably more than  investments in 1992, which were 34.7 billion bolivares.    Stockholder composition remains unchanged. The transfer of  10  percent of the company's shares to the workers was completed in  1993, which together with 1 percent allocated to the Incentives  Plan, accounts for 11 percent of CANTV's shareholder capital.    The Republic of Venezuela owns 49 percent of the firm's  shares through the Investment Fund of Venezuela and the Ministry  of Transport and Communications.    For its part, the Venworld consortium, made up of domestic  companies such as Electricidad de Caracas and Grupo Cima, and  international firms such as GTE, Telefonos Internacional, and  AT&amp;T, owns the remaining 40 percent of the shares.    The firm has connected more than 251,000 new clients, which  represents an increase of 456,000 new subscribers, raising the  telephone density of the country from eight to 11 telephones per  100 inhabitants.    More than 5,000 public telephones were installed throughout  the country and 12,000 units were replaced with new technology.  With regard to modernization of the telephone system, the number  of digital lines available to clients increased to 44.7 percent,  which represents an increase over 1992, when the share was 33.8  percent, and over 1991, when only 20 percent of the lines were  digital. In the area of cellular telephones, the company raised  its number of clients to 56,000 (268 percent), to finish the  year with 77,000 clients. On the other hand, debt increased by  42.4 billion bolivares during the year, reaching a figure of  68.9 billion bolivares by 31 December 1993.    Since its privatization, the firm has generated a number of  benefits. For one, Venezuela received $1.885 billion from the  sale of 40 percent of its shares.    As a privatized firm, it has invested more than 103.7  billion  bolivares in the expansion and modernization of telephone  services and more than 11.1 billion bolivares have been paid in  taxes to the Treasury. Public spending has decreased through the  transfer of 20,000 workers from government rolls to private  enterprise. New sources of employment, direct and indirect, have  been created. The firm has spent more than 20 billion bolivares  each year for material and equipment from domestic suppliers and  has contributed to the development of the capital market by the  placement of commercial paper.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Water shares Even after yesterday's bounce, the package of water shares has had a miserable run of late. Since early February, it has underperformed the market by 18 per cent. Ahead of next week's local elections, the institutions have been increasingly preoccupied with political risks for the sector. July's break-up of the package for trading purposes has persuaded some investors to move into their preferred individual water company shares. But the downward pressure may have gone too far. The package is on a prospective yield of well over 6 per cent. At Thursday's low, shares in South-West Water were yielding almost 9 per cent. That looks more than ample compensation for a long-term political threat from a Labour party which regards the curbing of other privatised companies as a higher priority. As for the technical threat from the break-up of the package, there has been less divergence between the companies than one might expect. The water companies' robust profitability and dividend growth should be familiar enough to investors by now. They are still not fully reflected in the price.</p>

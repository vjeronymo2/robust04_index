			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Flotation values Dutch telecoms at Fl 22.9bn A first tranche of shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch postal and telecommunications operator, will be floated next week at a price of Fl 49.75 per share, valuing the company at Fl 22.9bn (Dollars 12.3bn). The price is slightly higher than many analysts had predicted, and just above the mid-point of the indicative range of Fl 46 to Fl 52 a share. Private investors will be given a discount of Fl 2.50 per share on up to 75 shares. This is in line with the government's commitment to give small shareholders a discount of around 5 per cent compared with the price paid by institutional investors. The flotation of 138.15m shares, representing 30 per cent of the government's 100 per cent holding in KPN, will raise Fl 6.9bn for the state. An additional Fl 1bn could be generated if the banking syndicate exercises its 30-day right to sell a further 20.7m shares in case of heavy oversubscription. Analysts had agreed the flotation price would be Fl 50 or less, with many predicting Fl 48 or Fl 49. The government is aiming to sell half the shares in the Netherlands. The price, announced yesterday morning, was determined early on Sunday. It was based on the outcome of a 'book-building' exercise among institutional investors. Subscriptions opened yesterday and will close on Thursday afternoon. Trading on the Amsterdam stock exchange is due to start on Monday. Mr Wim Kok, the finance minister, said yesterday the transaction should give 'a substantial stimulus to the strengthening and deepening of the Dutch capital market'. The stock exchange hopes the KPN example will persuade privately- or family-owned companies in the Netherlands to seek bourse listings. KPN's total market capitalisation will make it the third-largest stock on the Amsterdam stock exchange, behind the two Anglo-Dutch groups Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever. The flotation, which is to be followed with a second tranche by the end of 1997, is the Netherlands' largest. The KPN flotation is the fifth European telecoms share offering in the past year, but the first privatisation of a state monopoly to include a postal service. The UK government will soon launch a consultation paper likely to advocate partial privatisation of the Royal Mail. Part of the case for the move is the need for the state operator to be able to compete internationally with more entrepreneurial postal services, notably the Dutch.</p>

In a statement, Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, the senior U.S. commander, denounced  the "mob attack" on Tech. Sgt. Bruce D. Harayda that took place Tuesday at the  Chonju District Court, 125 miles south of Seoul. Harayda, 29, and his Korean  wife were treated for minor injuries. Harayda is on trial for manslaughter in  the death of Chung Pan Yong, 53.  </P></p>

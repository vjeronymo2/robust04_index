			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries weaken as auction flounders The US Treasuries yield curve flattened further yesterday after a disappointing auction of five-year notes left the short end of the market bearing the burden of late selling pressure. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/8 at 95 13/16 , yielding 7.853 per cent. The short end was even weaker, with the two-year note down  7/32 at 99 19/32 , to carry a yield of 7.707 per cent. Trading was quiet in the morning as business continued to wind down ahead of the Christmas holiday. The only economic news - an upward revision in the figure for third quarter gross domestic product from growth of 3.9 per cent to growth of 4 per cent - had little impact on sentiment. Instead, the chief influence on market activity was the auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. Although the strength of demand at Wednesday's two-year note auction was encouraging, dealers were concerned that the five-year notes would prove a harder sell. As feared, the auction was poorly received, and the notes were sold at an average yield of 7.85 per cent, higher than expected. The sale left dealers holding a large amount of the new issue, and prompted them to sell shorter-term securities to make room for the new inventory. European government bonds had another quiet day, with turnover drying to a trickle as participants began to leave for their Christmas holidays. Italian bonds rose following the resignation of prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi, but some of their gains were wiped out in late trading as dealers pondered the implications of his departure. 'Berlusconi had been on the brink for so long that his resignation was just a confirmation of everyone's expectations - it had been widely discounted,' said one dealer. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro today will begin consultations on the nomination of a new prime minister. If no satisfactory candidate is found, he could dissolve parliament and call new elections. Many dealers consider elections the worst-case scenario, as they would prolong the political uncertainty which has dogged Italy's markets for months. Their favourite solution seems to be an institutional government encompassing most of the parties represented in parliament. The March BTP futures contract on Liffe ended around 99.69, up 0.24 point but off its intra-day high of 99.96. French bonds staged a smart rally, recovering from recent oversold levels. Although the March notional bond futures contract drifted slightly lower in after-hours dealings on Globex, it rose by 0.70 point on Matif to 111.36. The 10-year yield spread over Germany narrowed by five basis points to 59 basis points. At the short end, the March three-month Pibor contract on Matif gained 0.11 point to 93.36. After sharply underperforming its German counterpart in recent weeks, it needs to get more in line with the German euromark contract, given that France's monetary policy is likely to continue tracking Germany's, dealers said. German bonds posted small gains on scattered cash buying and some late short-covering in extremely thin volume. As expected, the Bundesbank left its M3 money supply growth range for 1995 unchanged from this year's, at between 4 and 6 per cent. The March bund futures contract on DTB ended at 89.87, up 0.22 point. UK gilts had a slow day, shrugging off news that the current account turned into surplus for the first time in years. The long gilt future on Liffe ended at 102 5/32, down 3/16 point.</p>

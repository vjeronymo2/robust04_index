			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Blue chips lower after late program selling Wall Street AFTER HOLDING firm in positive territory for most of the day, a late round of program selling left blue chip stocks slightly lower at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.43 at 3,427.55, well below its peak of 3,446.19. Other indices fared better. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 1.30 higher at 440.19, the Amex composite finished up 2.21 at 420.96, and the Nasdaq composite rose 2.97 to 661.42. Volume on the NYSE was 240m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,205 to 669. Thursday's late rally, when prices recovered from early losses to end broadly higher, set the tone for a confident start to trading. Within minutes of the opening, the Dow was up almost 15 points as buying followed through from the end of the previous session. Dealers said that buying was a mixture of computer program trading, and some end-of-month acquisitions by big institutions. Sentiment was also buoyed by news that flows of investors' cash into stock mutual funds had reached record levels in March and the first quarter, and by an early decline in bond yields. Bond yields, however, later reversed direction, and combined with a rush of late sell programs to leave Dow stocks with modest declines at the end of trading. Economic news was mostly ignored because of the conflicting nature of the reports. Personal income rose 0.6 per cent in March, but personal spending fell 0.2 per cent and factory orders dropped 1.5 per cent, also last month. Interest in cyclical stocks revived, in spite of recent poor economic news. Allied Signal rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 65 1/4 , International Paper added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 65 3/4 , and Caterpillar rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 69 1/4 . Bethlehem Steel rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 19 5/8 in volume of almost 1m shares after the company said it would raise prices on steel plate products on July 4 by Dollars 10 to Dollars 20 a ton. Aetna jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 52 7/8 after the life and casualty insurer announced first quarter net income of Dollars 166.3m, well up on the Dollars 118.7m earned in the same period a year ago. Eastman Kodak rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 48 3/4 on reports that the company plans to sell a major asset to improve shareholder value. Genentech climbed Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 37 1/2 on the news that the company's blood-clot dissolving agent, Activase, had better results in preventing heart attack deaths than a rival product. On the Nasdaq market Lin Broadcasting rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 89 after a ratings upgrade from Prudential Securities. Canada TORONTO STOCKS extended their winning steak to four sessions, closing higher in moderately active trading. Based on preliminary data, the 300 composite index was up 34.35 points, or 0.91 per cent, to 3,789.41, with advances leading declines 460 to 270. PWA Corp. reported increased losses in the first quarter but said it has resumed making payments to its creditors as of today. PWA rose CDollars 0.03 to CDollars 0.53.</p>

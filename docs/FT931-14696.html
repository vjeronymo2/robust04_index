			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / The Long View: Ride down Gilt Mountain YOUR UK edition of the FT is costing you an extra 5p this week at 65p, but will it soon set you back 76p by courtesy of Norman Lamont? The chancellor has a fair chance of finding ways to escape from his daunting problems this year, but somebody will have to pay. It could be you (and me). The New Year started badly in the securities markets in London, with profits being taken in equities and long-dated gilt-edged yields climbing back up to 9 per cent as the announcement of next week's gilt auction has provided an early reminder of the coming flood of paper. On the other hand yesterday's drop in the inflation index to 2.6 per cent, though entirely dependent on falling mortgage rates, gave a reminder of the kind of short-term opportunities that the politicians will be able to exploit this year. Meanwhile, the pound sterling has bounced firmly off Dollars 1.50 at the beginning of the month, and sterling has been able to watch the latest round of speculative pressure on the European exchange rate mechanism from a distance. The ERM has survived, because the markets are now discounting a significant cut in German interest rates this year; the French franc need not be devalued against the D-mark because the D-mark has depreciated by 15 per cent against the dollar since the height of the currency crisis last September. From the British point of view the danger is that gains in competitiveness in Continental markets might be significantly eroded, which could be awkward now that recovery has become the main official economic objective. Although there is some nervousness in official quarters about cutting interest rates again so soon, before the response of the economy can be properly judged - it is just two months since base rates dropped to 7 per cent - this is a card which Lamont will want to play, possibly in his March 16 Budget. The big financial problem, remember, is that the government will need to sell Pounds 50bn or more of gilts in the 1993-94 financial year. This is more than can be readily financed out of regular savings flows within the British economy so there will have to be some reliance on shifts in holdings of existing financial assets, and on investment by foreigners. In a catastrophic scenario the Bank of England would be raising gilt yields to whatever level was required to entice pension funds into dumping equities, but fortunately we are a long way from that 1970s-type crisis point. All the same, it looks increasingly inevitable that Norman Lamont will have to resort to escape route one, a switch to underfunding. This is jargon for saying that the government will finance part of its deficit through the banking system. Essentially the banks will shift a proportion of their assets into the public sector: at present British banks have only 3 per cent of their portfolios in public sector assets, whereas in the US, where the government has been underfunding like crazy, the banks have 22 per cent. Escape route two is likely to be a low level of short-term interest rates. Six months ago long-term rates were lower than short rates, now they are two percentage points higher, and the bigger that gap becomes the easier it will be to sell gilts. Low interest rates will also serve to weaken sterling which is important if substantial sales are to be made to foreigners: they will not buy gilts unless they are convinced that sterling is at a bargain basement level from which it is more likely to rise than to depreciate further. Alternatively the government could borrow in foreign currencies, but that would only highlight the lack of confidence in the pound. There are important limitations on the scope for cutting sterling interest rates, however. Already the building societies are tending to suffer a net loss of savings and they surely could not follow money market rates down much below 6 per cent. The banking sector became bloated through high deposit rates in the 1980s but could be nastily squeezed by low rates now - although it would be open to the building societies to finance mortgage lending through longer-term savings products. While instant access accounts might yield little, five-year fixed-rate bonds could offer a lot more. But this does not look like a year in which it will be much fun running a building society. Lamont's third escape route could be through tax increases. Lenders are much happier when they think the borrower does not really need the money - but nobody wants to lend to a desperate man. Above all, the gilt market will want to be able to see a way in which the budget deficit can shrink in 1994-95. In any case, fiscal tightness is an appropriate counterweight to monetary relaxation. This government will not increase income tax, as it probably should, but a temporary dip in the headline inflation rate in the early part of this year would give a window for an extension of the coverage of value-added tax. The sins of the press could be punished at last; and those children's clothing lobbyists had better polish up their heartstring-plucking arguments. So the Treasury's escape committee should have reasonable scope for initiatives this year. The funding requirements are demanding, but we start from the relatively strong position of an historic government debt burden of only 36 per cent of GDP: this is nothing like Italy, where the corresponding figure is over 100 per cent. The trouble is, each tactical shift could weaken the room for manoeuvre in the longer term. In particular, there is no anti-inflationary anchor now that we have left the ERM, in last year's death-defying policy switch. You need to be smart and lucky to be a successful escapologist. And even Harry Houdini turned out in the end to have a soft underbelly.</p>

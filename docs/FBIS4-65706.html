			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (DPA) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin on 19 May deplored the decision of a number of laender  governed by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) to halt  the deportation of Kurds. No one should doubt that, like  Germany, Turkey was a state that is ruled by laws, he said.  "Friendship and mutual confidence between Turkey and Germany  are the strongest guarantee for solving these problems."</p>

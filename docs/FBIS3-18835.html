			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt by an </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Not With Us"]    [Text] [FOCUS] France wants to get out of the Leuna  refinery. Does Germany have to accept this?    [Rexrodt] Elf [Aquitaine] obviously wants to reduce its  participation and throw this part at the feet of the Germans.  We cannot accept that. Contracts must be fulfilled,  particularly since there has been strong pressure in French  politics. In addition, this would delay follow-up investments  in Saxony-Anhalt and cost jobs.    [FOCUS] Can Germany force Elf to build the refinery?    [Rexrodt] We have made our position very clear to the French  Government for weeks. The chancellor sent a letter to Prime  Minister Balladur, but the answer was noncommittal. I do not  want to put a strain on the German-French relationship, but we  cannot be dealt with in this way. Elf must begin with the  construction immediately. Then we can help to find more  partners later on.    [FOCUS] What can Bonn use as a threat?    [Rexrodt] If the French do not build the refinery, they must  give back Minol, and we will claim 1.5 billion German marks in  contractual penalty. Then the French side has to see how it  wants to include such penalties in Elf's stock exchange profile.  Withdrawing will not work.    [FOCUS] Elf loses its incentive because Minol does not yield  as much as expected.    [Rexrodt] In the long run, the involvement will pay off. We  deliberately offered the beautiful bride Minol with its  hump-back relative, the outdated refinery. If Elf had tackled  Minol with real entrepreneurial elan, Minol would not have  incurred such high losses either.</p>

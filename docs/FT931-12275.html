			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / E German subsidies plan urged GERMANY'S engineering industry employers said yesterday they were ready to back plans for substantial subsidies to loss-making east German enterprises, provided engineering workers accepted a slowdown in their wage increases. Details of the proposals were leaked yesterday by IG Metall, the engineering workers' union, and promptly denounced by the employers, because the union had rejected a revised wages agreement in east Germany. The 'solidarity pact' for the engineering industry would, if agreed, be a central element for the wider solidarity pact between the German government, opposition, employers and unions, to finance the cost of east German economic recovery. A renegotiation of the engineers' existing wages deal in the east, which grants a 26 per cent pay increase on April 1, and parity with western workers by 1994, has been a central demand of the government and industrialists for the planned solidarity pact. This deal, the key to a series of wage equalisation contracts in the east, is seen as the main reason eastern industry has been so uncompetitive, and slowed down private investment in the region. The joint paper worked out by negotiators for IG Metall, and Gesamtmetall, the employers' organisation, calls for extended investment subsidies beyond 1996, special preferences for the products of east German manufacturing industry, and a new deal to support exports by east German enterprises to eastern Europe. It proposes a long-term trade deal with states of the former Soviet Union, including guaranteed exchange rates. The programme would be financed by savings and re-ordered priorities in the government budget.</p>

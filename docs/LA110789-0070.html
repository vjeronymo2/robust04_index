			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELEMENTS OF EDUCATIONAL 'CHOICE'  </P> <P> The idea that parents and teachers should be directly and actively involved in  children's education is a solid, old-fashioned notion that has been revived  this year as one of the hot topics of national discussion. Educational  "choice," giving parents the option of choosing which public schools their  children will attend, is said to be the reason for leaps in reading scores and  increased parent and teacher involvement in the once-languishing East Harlem  school district. That district is regularly cited by the Bush Administration as  the premier example of choice. But a close look at the East Harlem system, the  only long-standing national example of choice, points out why it should not  become the catch-all term to avoid the tough education-funding decisions that  lawmakers and taxpayers must make.  </P> <P> The idea behind choice is that a free market system can work as well for  schools as it does for private businesses; the good schools will attract more  students and the ones that fall short will have to improve or perish. While the  East Harlem students, teachers and parents do exude an infectious enthusiasm  and pride in their now famous schools, Times writer Stanley Meisler found that  it is not at all clear that instituting choice was the key factor in the  improved test scores. Other factors, including the use of a different  standardized test and an overall jump in scores throughout New York city,  apparently played important roles.  </P> <P> The parents of East Harlem know themselves that good will and parental  involvement in a school are not enough: They assailed Secretary of Education  Lauro F. Cavazos during a recent visit there because the federal government  rejected the district's application for a $1.4-million magnet- school grant,  leaving the local board to struggle to save 30 teaching and staff positions.  </P> <P> School-choice programs are being explored by some 20 states. Already in  Richmond, Calif., Montclair, N.J., and the state of Minnesota, parents can  choose another public school if they do not want their children to attend the  neighborhood school. In Los Angeles, the magnet schools that focus on areas of  interest and are designed to attract different ethnic groups citywide are a  successful but limited example of choice.  </P> <P> The full-scale Minnesota program is being monitored to see how well the system  works; there, as in an "open enrollment" program in Irvine, most parents so far  have opted to keep their children in schools close to home. In East Harlem,  even supporters of choice have been careful to point out its limitations. One  of the early architects of the East Harlem system said that it worked there  because it came gradually, one school at a time, and successful programs were  kept small. That observation is a reminder that ideally a parent wants many  excellent schools to chose from; but absent the ideal, it's far better for a  school district to offer a few excellent programs than lots of slapdash poor  choices.  </P></p>

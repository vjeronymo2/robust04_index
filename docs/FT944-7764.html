			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National retail banking margins widen A widening of margins in its retail banking business during the third quarter of this year was reported by Abbey National, the home loans and banking group. In the three months to September 30 Abbey said it had increased its share of net lending to the UK mortgage market to about 10 per cent. Its share of the liquid savings market was, at more than 10 per cent, higher than its more usual 8.5 per cent. Mr Ian Harley, finance director, said that the wider margins partly reflected the fact that Abbey had eased its pricing of loans in the third quarter after a particularly successful first half of the year. The mix between fixed rate mortgages, which accounted for fewer than 5 per cent of loan applications, and variable rate lending had also had an effect, he said. Mr Harley said the changes were not unique to Abbey and would apply to others in the retail savings and mortgage business, 'though I like to think we've been ahead of the game'. A further widening of margins could be expected for mortgage lenders in general over the fourth quarter, which would take account of the opportunity provided by the 0.5 percentage point interest rate rise in September. Competition for personal savings had also eased, since the lack of vigorous demand for home loans meant there was less pressure to attract large amounts of retail funds. Abbey's wider margins on the retail side have more than made up for the tightening of the spreads earned on its treasury investment portfolio, because of competition for high quality assets. It also said that as the continuing downward trend of mortgage arrears and repossessions slowed, the level of provisions against bad and doubtful debts was approaching the bottom of the cycle. This suggests that mortgage lenders in general will find falling provisions will decrease in importance on the headline increases in pre-tax profits. This is likely to intensify pressure to find income growth. Abbey said that new business premium income from Scottish Mutual, one of its life insurance subsidiaries, was 15 per cent higher in the first nine months of this year, against the trend of the life sector. Within this increase there had been a small drop in regular premium business. Over the same period Abbey National Life, the other life offshoot, saw new business premium income more than double, although this partly reflected the fact that the operation was launched in February last year.</p>

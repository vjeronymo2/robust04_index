			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TED TURNER  </P> <P> Regarding "The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate," by Stephen Farber (April 30): The  still photograph from "Camille" that illustrates your excellent story on Ted  Turner's misguided mania for colorization is from the silent film starring  Nazimova. I assume that Turner will colorize the Greta Garbo version.  </P> <P> THOM RHODES  </P> <P> Coronado  </P> <P>  The still photograph is from the 1921 version of "Camille," starring Rudolph  Valentino and Alla Nazimova. And, yes, the 1936 "Camille" with Greta Garbo is  the version to be colorized. -- The Editors  </P></p>

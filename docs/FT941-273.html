			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (2): 'We will surprise ourselves and the world' / Interview with finance minister Manmohan Singh discusses development and makes a five year prediction Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, was interviewed by Richard Lambert and Stefan Wagstyl a few days after presenting his 1994-95 Budget, which sets out the government's latest plans for further economic reform. Here are highlights from the interview: QUESTION: Was this Budget framed with political rather than economic considerations in mind? SINGH: I think every Budget is a political document. The economy anyway does not function in a political vacuum. Could you please comment on the fiscal deficit? Well I would say that the fiscal deficit which has emerged in the current financial year is not a happy development. As I said in my Budget speech we have to get back to the path of reducing the fiscal deficits. But this year had peculiar circumstances largely because of the very sluggish industrial economy, which reduced the government's customs and excise revenues. I could have cut expenditure further. But in the public sector we have cut expenditure to the bare bones, except for social sector expenditure. Cutting that would be economically as well as socially and politically an unproductive exercise. It would perpetuate the stagflation and low-level equilibrium with the fiscal deficit remaining as high as before. That would discredit the whole reform process. The only effective way to get the economy out of stagflation was to create an enviroment which was friendly to higher growth. Now there are risks in what I have actually done. If for example we have a drought things could go wrong. But if we have a big drought, things could go wrong anyway. But today we have an insurance against the drought which we never had for many years. Record foodstocks of 23m tonnes, idle industrial capacity, and record foreign exchange reserves. If we can ever bring about a balance between demand and supply at a higher level of activity then this is the year it could happen. Hasn't over-spending also contributed to the size of the fiscal deficit? It is true that our food subsidies, for example, have turned out to be much higher than expected. It has happened because it was an election year. The government raised prices paid to farmers but prices paid by consumers were not adjusted until last month. We did the same with the administered oil and fuel prices. Will forthcoming state-level elections and the prospect of the next general election, due by mid-1996, effect policymaking? I think this is a normal cycle. We have this year four or five important states having elections. But I am heartened I am being criticised that the fiscal deficit is too much. That is a measure of the success of our programme. When I started I was accused of inventing the fiscal deficit to destroy the Indian planning system. Looking at the reforms overall, what are the remaining challenges? I have done a sweeping reform this year of customs and excise duties. In two more Budgets the process of tax reform can be completed. Capital market reforms have also gone pretty well, including deregulation, the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (the markets supervisor) and new codes of conduct. Our capital markets will function with greater transparency. The badla system (speculative forward trading in equities) has now been banned so that the bulk of deliveries are cash deliveries. We are now in a position to create a futures and options market. The National Stock Exchange, which links trading across the country and should have started operation in April, will start operating in the next few months. As regards the banking sector, the bill to allow the government to disinvest up to 49 per cent in public sector banks has just been passed. The State Bank of India already had legislative permission and has raised Rs30bn. That process will now start for other banks. We will have private sector banks. Banking is no longer a monopoly of the government. International banks will be more active. Next on our agenda is the insurance sector. We have a report I propose to deal with (which suggests liberalisation). Since it was our party which nationalised the banks and insurance I have to create a new climate, therefore I want an extensive debate on insurance over the next two or three months. As for exchange control, we have now a system of current account convertibility. The next logical step is capital account convertibility. But I would like to wait for some time more. The prerequisite is a credible fiscal and monetary stance. As far as foreign trade is concerned, the over-protection of industry is being reduced and reduced fast enough. The levels of protection which will prevail in the longer run, in two years we will reach them. We still don't import consumer goods but I have started a debate. I feel confident we can manage that too. Once that comes about I think foreign trade system will have only moderate tariffs and the exchange rates will be the only determinant of trade flows. We are 70-80 per cent of the way there. We must also remove restrictions on farmers to enable them to export and have an import/export regime with moderate tariffs and without quantitative restrictions. Finally, there is exit policy (redundancy laws). This is a sensitive issue, even though the present rigid system is hurting labour itself because it gives our employers a strong disincentive to employ more labour even where more labour is justified. But it takes time to carry conviction in a country of high unemployment. If we reach an economic growth rate of 6 per cent then I think we will reach conditions where jobs are being created and we can make changes. But we are still not there so that's why we are deliberately going slow in this area. To help this change, we have to establish social security institutions. We have an industrial relations bill which talks about all these things including getting flexibilities. I have to convince our Cabinet colleagues. I feel this thing also can be tackled in less than a year's time. I think this whole programme should be completed in less than two years' time, before we go to the next general election in 1996. But we are deliberately not adopting the shock therapy of the kind that has been advocated. Because I believe civilisation is a very delicate plant. It's very easy to destroy it, especially in a large and complex country like India. Can you comment on the role of foreign capital? As far as foreign direct investment is concerned, we welcome it, including foreign majority participation for which permission is automatic in most sectors. We have also opened markets to foreign institutional investors in the past year. People have warned me that these are fair-weather friends so we have moved cautiously. But these investors have behaved responsibly. What is your attitude to disinvestment on a larger scale ? I said in my Budget speech that in order to reduce my deficit in a big way I must do something about my interest burden which is a heritage of the past. Given my options I can reduce interest in a big way if I have the freedom to disinvest in a much bolder way. How bold that is I will have to test with my Cabinet colleagues and party. We have got consensus on disinvestment. But the other ministers would like to keep the proceeds for themselves. Politics is about patronage and patronage is about spending. So they say if we disinvest you allow us to expand our empires. I have now to persuade them to use the proceeds to retire debt. How does India compare with other developing countries, including those in east Asia? I certainly would like the pace of reform to be faster in India but we have to realise we are a large and complex country trying to carry out social and economic transformation in the framework of an open society. Maybe the changes we make will be more durable than changes in countries where you can carry out reform by fiat. Development is a complex process, it cannot simply be imported. We have made mistakes for example in not universalising elementary education. At the same time given our size, given our natural resources, given our science and technology infrastructure, our skilled manpower, I have a gut feeling that India in the course of the next five or six years will surprise itself and surprise the world also.</p>

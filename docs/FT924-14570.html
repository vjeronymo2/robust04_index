			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television An odiously sycophantic book on royal gardens - the present royals, that is  -landed on my desk only last month and I binned it in disgust. In Royal Gardens (BBC2, 8.30) Sir Roy Strong, art-historian and topiarist, takes an historical journey through the gardens of the British royalty - Dutch too, since tonight's opening programme includes Dutch William's wonderful garden at Het Loo. Not the least interesting thing over the next six weeks will be to see whether Strong manages to tread royal turf and sniff regal lilies without turning into a fawning nincompoop. I Renounce War (9.30) continues BBC 2's series, 'War and Peace' with a portrayal of the changing status of the pacifist in wartime since 1916 when the Military Service Act introduced a conscience clause. One of the last surviving conscientious objectors from the Great War describes his experience of spending most of it in solitary confinement in Wormwood Scrubs. While we wait for the Bush-Clinton dialogues, BBC2 starts the ball rolling with Campaign (11.15), a weekly series presenting the best and the worst of the US election campaign coverage.</p>

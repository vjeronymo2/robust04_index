Recalling that U.S. State Secretary Christopher finally  confirmed that the demand for the abrogation of the "NSL" in  South Korea was an official position of the United States, the  spokesman said:    As the whole world admits, the "NSL" is an anti-democratic,  anti-national and anti-reunification fascist law unprecedented  in the world history of legislation.    It is due to this cursed, murderous law that many champions  of democracy and reunification and patriotic people of various  social strata have suffered behind bars and the dialogue,  cooperation and exchange between the North and the South have  been blocked.    The "NSL" is, indeed, a means for maintaining the fascist  system and prolonging their days in power, which is worse by far  than the Japanese imperialists' "Public Peace Law" and is an  obstacle to great national unity and the country's reunification.    The Kim Yong-sam group is now scheming to keep the "NSL"  intact, discontented with the demand for its abolition. This  clearly shows that "democratization," "improvement of  North-South relations" and "resumption of dialogue" which the  Kim Yong-sam group is crying for are all lies and it, in  actuality, wants neither the democratization of the South Korean  society nor reconciliation and dialogue between the North and  the South.</p>

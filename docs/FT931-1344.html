			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Bank hints it should lose 'protector' role THE Bank of England hinted yesterday that its role as protector of bank depositors should be devolved to an outside institution. In a speech on bank supervision, Mr Brian Quinn, the director in charge of supervision, said that present arrangements for supervising and regulating banks 'may have to be reconsidered'. Although his speech gives few details on this issue, it is understood that Mr Quinn believes there is a distinction to be drawn between his department's two main functions: the protection of the financial system and the protection of depositors. Under the 1979 and 1987 Banking Act, the Bank has explicit responsibility for both functions. However, he said that the depositor protection function has encouraged bank customers to believe that 'the banking supervisor is there to protect them from every deficiency they experience - or perceive - in the service they get from their bank'. But he was adamant this was not his role: 'I have to say that the role of the banking supervisor is to seek to enforce prudent conduct by banks, not customer satisfaction.' Mr Quinn stressed that the bank is a supervisor but not a regulator. He defined regulation as the process of ensuring that financial institutions follow appropriate rules when selling financial products, to protect consumers from buying bad or unsuitable products. The Securities and Investments Board and the self-regulatory organisations act as regulators of banks when they sell non-deposit products and services, such as life policies or shares. But there is a regulatory vacuum in deposit taking and lending services. Mr Quinn is understood to believe that there is an argument for giving the Bank's deposit-protection functions to an outside body - though not until the present reorganisation of the regulation of investment and life products is completed. However, he did not make this view explicitly in the speech. He did argue that the Bank should retain its role as supervisor, in the sense of ensuring that there is the minimum risk of a collapse in the payments system. Although he said that there is a potential conflict between the Bank's role as the executor of monetary policy and its role as supervisor, he believes that there are advantages to combining the functions. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said for the first time that his bank would join the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new regulator of the retail investment industry, if the PIA could demonstrate that it would be an efficient and effective regulator. The Bank of England yesterday supported the winding up of a small company which had been operating illegally as a bank and is thought to have taken deposits of about Pounds 1m. The Bank supported a petition in the High Court from the landlords of General Credit Finance. It said it wanted to hear from depositors of GCF.</p>

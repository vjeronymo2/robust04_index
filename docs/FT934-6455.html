			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Japan to offer rice compromise Japan is likely to present its official proposal to open its rice markets after the US and the EU manage to reach an accord on agriculture on the Uruguay Round. A senior Japanese government official told Japanese reporters yesterday: 'Japan is involved in negotiations to prepare a plan it deems acceptable.' Until now, the government has been reluctant to reveal that it was under talks over the lifting of its rice ban. Japan is likely to put forward officially a compromise plan under which it will accept rice imports of 4 to 8 per cent of its domestic consumption for six years, and reach a decision over tarification of its rice market in 1999. The government wants to appease domestic opposition to opening the rice market by leaving a decision up in the air, and it is unclear whether such a proposal would be acceptable to its trade partners.</p>

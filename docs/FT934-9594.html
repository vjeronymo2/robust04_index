			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Boycott call in council dispute UNISON, the public services union, is calling on members in a London local authority to refuse to work with employees who take up disputed posts. The boycott proposal follows a decision by Camden borough council to introduce revised terms and conditions, including a longer working week for new posts and vacancies in all areas other than teaching. Camden branch members will be asked on Thursday to boycott members working with anyone who accepts one of the new contracts.</p>

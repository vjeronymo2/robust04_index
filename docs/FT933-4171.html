			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Italy to wield public spending knife: Rome has found it can no longer afford an inefficient bureaucracy and welfare state THE Italian government was last night due to announce cuts in pension benefits, further streamlining of the health service, a reduction in the number of ministries and a continued freeze on civil service recruitment to save L28,000bn (Pounds 11.6bn) in the 1994 budget. Before the cabinet met late yesterday, the unions lobbied to head-off a freeze on civil servants' pay during 1994. But if a pay rise is conceded this is unlikely to exceed 2.5 per cent - well below projected inflation of 3.7 per cent. The public spending cuts are an unequivocal signal that the state can no longer afford to support an inefficient, overmanned bureaucracy and a welfare state that has been funded out of debt rather than taxes. The austerity measures are also aimed at Italy's international partners, especially the EC, demonstrating the government's seriousness in cutting back the huge public sector deficit. The 1994 budget deficit will be held down to about L144,000bn on the latest calculations, compared to L155,000bn for the current year. This would be equivalent to 9.7 per cent of gross domestic product, still nearly twice the EC average. But yesterday the Bank of Italy dropped the discount rate from 9 per cent to 8.5 per cent in response to the Bundesbank's move and this promised a further annual reduction of some L7,000bn in the overall burden of Italy's debt. Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, is seeking to raise L32,000bn through spending cuts and extra taxes. Officials said he had opted to obtain the bulk through spending cuts because fiscal pressure was already high and increased taxes risked being counter-productive. The cuts are to be focused on pensions. The Amato government last year introduced a reform of Italy's generous state pension system; but this did not go far enough. The new measures will penalise state employees who seek to leave (as they previously could) after only 20 years work. Those leaving the state sector before making 35 years of contributions and the private sector before 38 years will have their payments scaled back progressively the earlier they retire. At the same time the government is expected to postpone the revision of existing pension payments. All ministries are being asked to find across-the-board cuts of 3 per cent while the Ministry of Posts is expected to be abolished. Tighter control will be exercised over government procurement contracts, and some 130,000 civil servants risk being switched to new jobs or face unemployment. Additional income is due to come from the sale of government buildings. But privatisation revenue has been deliberately excluded from the budget. On the fiscal side, the government is due to make minor adjustments to value added tax payments, reduce the scope for tax write-offs on government investment and refine the 'minimum tax'. The latter was an attempt to bring the self-employed and professions within the tax net by assessing people on notional incomes for their declared jobs. The tax was strongly contested by trade and professional associations. However, so long as they are seen as the principal source of evasion, the Ciampi government is unlikely to be too sympathetic.</p>

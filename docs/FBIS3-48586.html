Chairman Nong Duc Manh was briefed by the comrade head  delegate on the socioeconomic situations in all villages in the  district. Next, two delegates -- one from the village that  scores the best achievements and the other from the village that  faces the most difficult problems -- briefed him on the living  conditions, economic growth, and party-building work at the  grass-roots establishments under their charge.    Chairman Nong Duc Manh was very happy to learn about those  changes for the better. He warmly commended grass-roots party  organizations and administrative organs in Bac Son District for  having upheld the traditions of a revolutionary base and scored  encouraging economic achievements.

All those achievements have contributed to improving the  living conditions of ethnic minority compatriots to an important  degree.    Chairman Nong Duc Manh expressed his hope that grass-roots  party committee echelons and administrative organs in Bac Son  District would continue to develop their revolutionary  traditions and direct the people in satisfactorily carrying out  the renovation cause and in materializing the goals of making  the people rich and the country powerful and of bringinging  about justice and civilization in society.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Barclays in talks on US disposal Barclays Bank is in discussions to sell its commercial credit company in the US, marking the latest in a series of disposals of personal and small company finance businesses there. The bank confirmed yesterday that it was in negotiations with Shawmut National, a New England banking group, over the sale of Barclays Business Credit, a Connecticut-based subsidiary with assets of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn). According to one person with knowledge of the company, Business Credit 'is highly profitable and has had extremely low losses'. Much of the company's lending is to small and medium-sized companies to finance assets ranging from trucks to machinery. Barclays has sold a string of consumer and commercial finance companies across the US in recent years, marking the reversal of an unsuccessful attempt, dating from the 1980s, to grow a broad-based US financing business. The failure has cost it Dollars 1.1bn in write-offs in the past three years. On a recent visit to New York, Mr Martin Taylor, the bank's chief executive, said Barclays was planning to shrink the 'monster lending book' it had built up. It would shed 'those (corporate) relationships that are frankly not real, where we have simply been stuffed in a syndicate, and we have no genuine prospect of building a serious relationship quickly', Mr Taylor said. Instead, it would concentrate on doing business with a smaller number of companies where it had a better chance of earning a profit, he said. The operations already sold by Barclays include retail branch networks in New York and California, a business banking operation in North Carolina, a consumer finance company and a private-label credit-card company. Earlier this year, the bank sold its US factoring business to CIT. In addition to Business Credit, the relics of the expansion include a company which services mortgage loans, on which Barclays was forced to take a Pounds 236m (Dollars 387m) write-down last year, and a portfolio of non-performing assets which stood at Dollars 1bn at the end of 1993.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Scots colliery to open funds appeal A PUBLIC appeal is to be launched to raise money for Monktonhall Mineworkers, the miners' consortium operating Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh. The colliery is in serious financial difficulties. The appeal is supported by the Rt Rev Richard Holloway, the bishop of Edinburgh, and by voluntary organisations. Yesterday Lothian regional council, which has hitherto refused to help Monktonhall Mineworkers, agreed to pay for a Pounds 25,000 study of the company's financial and technical viability by Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh merchant bank. Caledonian Mining, a company based at Newark, Notts, said that it was withdrawing from further discussions with the mineworkers and their advisers, Price Waterhouse. It had been dismayed by reports that it did not enjoy the support of the miners, and by adverse publicity in Scotland. Monktonhall Mineworkers, which leased the pit from British Coal in June, said last month that it was seeking outside investors because it faced a critical shortage of funds. Its only source of capital is the Pounds 1.6m raised by the 160 miners themselves. Although Monktonhall continues to produce coal for its main customer, British Coal, it has a deficit of Pounds 1.7m. The miners have not been paid for seven weeks. Bank of Scotland has refused further advances. The Quayle Munro report may lead the regional council to put money into Monktonhall. It is also hoped that investors from the public and private sectorsmay respond.</p>

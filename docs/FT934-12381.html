			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Tarmac consortium aims to build second Forth bridge A CONSORTIUM of European construction companies has been formed by Tarmac Construction to tender for the building of the second Forth road bridge. It is the fourth consortium known to have registered an interest in the project, which could cost Pounds 275m. The government is expected to announce early next year whether it wants to proceed with the new bridge. By next month it will have received feasibility studies on the project, which would be privately funded and operated, and earn revenue from tolls on the new and the existing bridges. The Scottish Office will draw up a shortlist of three consortia to tender for the project after the deadline for expressions of interest closes next Tuesday. The project will involve building Pounds 100m worth of new roads. Scottish Office ministers have already said they believe a new bridge will be needed early next century because of the volume of peak-time traffic on the existing bridge, which opened in 1964. Labour MPs have accused ministers of having already decided to build a new bridge, while environmental groups argue that it is not needed. The consortium led by Tarmac includes the construction companies Bilfinger and Berger of Germany, Bouygues of France, and HBM (Civil Engineering) of The Netherlands, as well as Transroute, a French toll-road operator. It is advised by Morgan Grenfell with lending to be led by NatWest Markets and Banque National de Paris. The grouping is called E15, after the European number of the road that crosses the Forth. Other consortia to have declared their bids for the contract are: Forthspan, led by Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty, advised by Kleinwort Benson; Forth Link, consisting of Taylor Woodrow, Sir Robert McAlpine, John Mowlem and Morrison Construction, together with Dragados of Spain and Monberg and Thorsen of Denmark, advised by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and John Laing, GTM-Entrepose of France and Miller Group of Edinburgh, advised by Bank of America. The Scottish Office says that if the project proceeds the winning consortium should be announced late next year or early in 1995. The project would then have parliamentary procedures to go through, and possibly a public inquiry. Construction could begin in 1996 or 1997 and could take four to six years. Tarmac and Bouygues are partners in the Channel tunnel project, while Bouygues is a leading partner in the Pont de Normandie in northern France, which will be the world's longest cable-stay bridge.</p>

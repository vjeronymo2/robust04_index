			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JERRY HULSE'S TRAVEL TIPS  </P> <P> With the two Germanys no longer divided, a "first-ever" pass for travel through  East Germany can be obtained as an add-on when buying either a GermanRail pass  or a Eurailpass. Fares are $79 for four days, $119 for eight days (or for  travelers possessing Eurail Youth Passes, the cost is $59 for four days, $79  for eight days). Both passes are good for unlimited travel in East Germany. To  order rail passes, call toll-free (800) 223-6036. Additional information is  available from GermanRail's Los Angeles representative at (213) 479-2772.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, travelers are cautioned to obtain hotel reservations wherever they  go in East Germany. What with a shortage of first-class hotels, you could wind  up without a room. Berlin, in particular, is crowded. One tourism official told  us: "I'd wait until next year when East Germany will be better prepared for  heavier tourism."  </P> <P> Other details from the German National Tourist Office, 444 S. Flower St., Suite  2230, Los Angeles 90071, (213) 688-7332.  </P> <P> West Germany by Coach: For travelers planning a visit to West Germany, a new  coaching tour takes in King Ludwig II country. Horse-drawn coaches leave from a  village south of Munich on Thursdays/Sundays through October. Tours include  transfers from Munich, meals, accommodations, an English-speaking guide. Groups  visit two of King Ludwig's castles as well as several Bavarian villages. For  details/prices, contact the German National Tourist Office locally or write to  Coaching in Bavaria, R. Nermitz, Kerschlach 2, 8121 Pahl, Federal Republic of  Germany.  </P> <P> Leaf Peepers: Soon the highways, byways and back roads of New England will be  crowded with travelers taking in the fall colors. To assist motorists, Vermont  has published an eight-page guide describing 13 foliage tours. Provides driving  instructions, mileage, etc. Covers all areas of the state. In addition, there's  a calendar of events for September/October (craft fairs, foliage festivals,  concerts, hayrides, art exhibits, ice cream socials, quilting bees, antique  fairs). A total of 242 attractions.  </P> <P> For an "Autumn Survival Kit," write to the Vermont Travel Division, 134 State  St., Montpelier, Vt. 05602.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, visitors are reminded that Vermont innkeepers frequently require a  two-night minimum booking during the foliage season. A favorite of ours is The  Inn at Wethersfield, where innkeeper Ron Thornburn plays the piano for guests  while his wife Mary supervises the kitchen (her culinary talents are famous  throughout New England). This old farmhouse exudes all the warmth that leaf  peepers dream about. It's homey, informal. Candles glow of an evening while  Thornburn performs at the piano.  </P> <P> The 18th-Century, two-story inn sits back from a country lane at the base of  Hawks Mountain between Springfield and Woodstock in southern Vermont. Guests  have included Paul Newman and his family and novelist J. D. Salinger. The rate  per couple is $160, including a four-course breakfast, high tea each afternoon  and a five-course dinner. At Christmastime, the inn takes on a special glow  when guests bundle into a horse-drawn sleigh and ride off into the woods in  search of a tree. This is a special place -- no matter what the season.  </P> <P> The Inn at Wethersfield, Vermont 106, Wethersfield, Vt. 05151. Telephone (802)  263-9217.  </P> <P> Italian Inn: This note from Burt and Sally Clapper of Encino: "We took your  advice and spent the last week of June at Tramonto D'Oro in Priano, Italy. We  are genuinely well traveled and money is not a major concern. This was an  excellent choice. The Esposito family, who are the owners of this little inn,  were most kind and helpful. They spoke little English, but every effort was  made toward our comfort. The food was excellent and varied and very fairly  priced. The rooms are a bit small, but lovely balconies face the sea. The room  price was $80 and certainly worth it. I absolutely recommend Tramonto D'Oro,  Priano, Amalfi, Italy. It would be difficult to do better for the money."  </P> <P> This little inn is south of Naples on the Amalfi Drive. Only a few miles beyond  Positano, which was the late John Steinbeck's favorite Italian village.  </P> <P> Air Fares: There are more airline fares than new car models. It gets confusing.  And costly. Here's our advice: Book your flight as far in advance as possible.  For the lowest domestic fares, reserve 14/21 days in advance. I booked a coach  flight to Hawaii a couple of years ago. The fare was quoted in excess of $800.  I asked about an advance-purchase fare. The answer: $425. Same seat, same  plane. And a savings of $400. Suggestion: Inquire about midweek fares. Busiest  days are Monday/Friday. Often you'll get a better break on Tuesdays/Wednesdays.  Additional savings are available by taking a one-stop (rather than nonstop)  flight. Ask your travel agent to explain the other options.  </P> <P> A Letter From Britain: Sherry Voss is an American living in England where she  operates a B&amp;B (in Northampton) and maps out trips for guests doing trips  to Cambridge, Oxford, Stratford-upon-Avon, the Cotswolds, etc. Voss writes:  "There is lots to do locally as well -- touring medieval castles and stately  homes, including George Washington's ancestral home and Princess Diana's family  estate. We (she and her British husband, Peter) can offer a great visiting  experience to travelers from the U.S." The Voss home is in a 16th-Century  village complete with pub and a cricket green. Rates at the B&amp;B are $25 per  person per night, including a full English breakfast. The trip advice is free.  </P> <P> Sherry and Peter Voss, 7 The Bartons Close, Dallington, Northampton NN57HQ,  England. From the United States, call 011-44-604-583994.  </P> <P> London Apartments: L.D. of Corona asks for the name of an agency that rents  apartments in London. A U.S.-based company (London Apartments Ltd.) books  accommodations in the heart of the city. A pool of more than 500 apartments  near theaters, shopping areas, museums. These are fully furnished units.  Laundry, maid service available. With hotel prices out of sight, more travelers  are opting for apartment rentals this year. Still, nothing is cheap these days  in London. Rates from $100 U.S. a night per couple for a studio. Write to  London Apartments (USA) Limited, 5 Hidden Valley Road, Lafayette, Calif. 94549.  Or call toll-free (800) 366-8748.  </P> <P> Channel Islands: A couple of one-day cruises to the Channel Islands National  Marine Sanctuary are being booked for Aug. 26 and Sept. 23 from Santa Barbara.  The motor vessel Condor will sail to waters off Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa  Rosa, San Miguel and Santa Barbara islands (comprising the nation's largest  marine sanctuary). Fares are $45 for adults, $30 for children under 12.  Included is a barbecue lunch served aboard the ship. The all-day excursions  will leave Santa Barbara at 8 a.m. Contact Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary,  735 State St., Santa Barbara 93101, (805) 966-7107.  </P> <P> Reader Recommendations  </P> <P> California -- Joan Hatfield, Santa Monica: "The Briar B&amp;B Inn, 897 E.

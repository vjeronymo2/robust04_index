			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Putting a floor under markets FOR THOSE whose first experience of markets was gained under the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system, the events of the past week on the European exchanges will have looked thoroughly familiar. In the argot of central bankers, fixed rate systems make the financial system crunchy; and the best insurance that governments can take out against a financial crunch is policy credibility. Within the European exchange rate mechanism Britain, with its well-judged Pounds 7.3bn foreign currency borrowing package on Thursday, had just enough of that commodity left to put off an unwelcome interest rate rise. Italy, in contrast, was unable yesterday to defer the crunch. It raised short-term interest rates by a swingeing 1 3/4 points to 15 per cent and the markets are still far from convinced that the lira has been stabilised. That does not mean that Britain is out of the woods, for want of a better phrase. By borrowing in D-Marks it raised the cost of any future devaluation, which is the kind of gamble that foreign exchange markets find reassuring. But while the British are playing by the rules of a fixed exchange rate system in which the D-Mark provides the main anchor, the Americans are playing a game of their own in which the rules are purely domestic. After yesterday's dismal US employment data there appeared to be no alternative to further cuts in short-term dollar rates. Sterling could thus wilt again, since it tends to feel the backwash when capital deserts the dollar for the D-Mark. The larger question, as European finance ministers meet in Bath this weekend, is how much more of this hard pounding the currencies of the ERM can take. Under the old Bretton Woods system, realignments were permitted when a currency was in fundamental disequilibrium and exchange rates could only be shored up at the cost of undesirable distortions in domestic economic policy. The system broke down when disagreements between the US and Europe over underlying policy became irreconcilable, after the Americans refused to confront the crunch to which their fiscal policy was leading during the Vietnam war. Exporting deflation This time the US-European differences are being managed through the mechanism of floating exchange rates. The more painful policy conflict is within Europe, where the combination of loose fiscal policy and tight money in Germany has had the effect of exporting deflation to the rest of Europe via the fixed exchange rates of the ERM. Given that the French electorate's misgivings about Maastricht partly reflect this depressing German influence on French unemployment, it was ironic that President Mitterrand should have called on Chancellor Kohl for support in his broadcast on Thursday night. While the Bundesbank has taken most of the flak, Mr Kohl, whose determination to avoid hard fiscal choices has been one of the more striking features of the German unification process, offers a more deserving target. The French referendum on September 20 is widely regarded as a test that could lead to a resolution of this economic conflict one way or another. Yet that seems implausible. Despite the apocalyptic rhetoric that permeates the debate, the ERM will survive, whatever happens to European Monetary Union. France, for one, will not lightly abandon the franc fort. The real question is who will stay within the hard core of the system. Vicious circle The European finance ministers will no doubt do their best to shore up confidence this weekend. But Italy is an enduring problem. A crisis in which real interest rates are approaching 12 per cent will usefully strengthen the Italian government's hand in pushing through unpalatable budgetary medicine. Yet with the lira trading below its D-Mark floor yesterday afternoon, the markets are still not convinced that the medicine is tough enough. Italy is caught in a vicious circle whereby an increase in interest rates further undermines credibility because of the impact on an already excessive budget deficit. Britain in many ways poses a more interesting conundrum. An interest rate rise may have been avoided before the politically sensitive party conference season. But the combination of a stagnant economy, an overhang of private sector debt and sharply deteriorating public finances is not designed to buttress credibility over a longer period. Nor does a robust economic recovery seem compatible with any realistic assessment of German monetary policy for the foreseeable future. In the short run real interest rates continue to rise as inflation comes down. House prices, according to the Halifax Building Society, are still falling. Corporate profits, witness the interim figures now emerging, are squeezed. In the absence of a deus ex machina Mr Major's government may yet be forced to choose between maintaining a fixed exchange rate and dealing with what appears to be an increasingly serious financial crisis. Credibility, on unchanged policy, is a wasting asset.</p>

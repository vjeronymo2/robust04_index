			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSIDERING THE TRIBULATIONS OF 'PARENTHOOD'  </P> <P> Oh puh-leeze!! Since when is a film about family life necessarily intended for  family viewing? Didn't any of these letter writers ever see "The Godfather,"  "Long Day's Journey Into Night?" or "Splendor in the Grass?"  </P> <P> Regarding Calendar's Parental Film Guide (criticized by letter writer Baker),  we think that the comment "adult themes but good for teens" means just what it  says, and that any teen would get a lot out of the film. (Unlike Baker, we  don't consider teens to be small children, and we're certain most teens would  agree with us.)  </P> <P> NINA LEIBMAN DONNEY  </P> <P> KENNETH DONNEY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

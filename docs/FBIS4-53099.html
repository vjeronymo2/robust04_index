			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  will hold a subcabinet-level meeting May 24 in Washington to  discuss global cooperation, one of three areas in the bilateral  trade "framework" talks, a senior Foreign Ministry official said  Tuesday.    Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi and Sozaburo  Okamatsu, vice trade minister for international affairs, will  attend the meeting, the official said. Undersecretary of State  Timothy Wirth will head the U.S. delegation.    The two countries are expected to discuss bilateral  cooperation to battle illegal drugs, promote children's health,  protect coral and observe geological processes, in addition to  five fields that the two nations have been discussing under the  framework talks, the official said.    Japan and the U.S. have been studying bilateral cooperation  on the environment, technology, the development of human  resources, population and AIDS.    Unlike the other two deadlocked areas of the framework talks  -- macroeconomic and microeconomic areas -- the negotiations on  global cooperation have seen some progress.</p>

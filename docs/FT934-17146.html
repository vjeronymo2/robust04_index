			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Spy services reveal more secrets ANOTHER veil was torn away from the intelligence services yesterday with the publication of a guide to Whitehall's intelligence machinery and the terms of reference of the intelligence-gathering agencies. Mr William Waldegrave, public services minister, launched a booklet describing the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee which supervises the work of the intelligence services. He said that the booklet was a further example of the government's commitment to eliminate unnecessary secrecy and make Whitehall more open. Mr Waldegrave also announced that from January the chair of the committee will be Miss Pauline Neville-Jones. She is the second woman to be given a top intelligence post, following the appointment in 1991 of Mrs Stella Rimington as director-general of the security service. Miss Neville-Jones, 53, is an Oxford-educated career diplomat. She is head of the Defence and Overseas Secretariat in the Cabinet Office and has the rank of deputy secretary. Miss Neville-Jones said she thought her appointment would be a boost for other women civil servants, although it was 'something of an accident' that two women had ended up in senior intelligence service positions. She will be working closely with Mr Gerald Warner, the intelligence co-ordinator who plays a key role in drawing up budgets for the intelligence agencies. Mr Warner is also a deputy secretary. The present chairman of the joint committee is Sir Rodric Braithwaite, foreign policy adviser to the prime minister and a former ambassador to the former Soviet Union. According to the booklet, the committee advises the government on intelligence priorities and assesses the results. It publishes a weekly survey on intelligence known as the Red Book, which is circulated to ministers and officials. It monitors direct and indirect threats to UK economic interests, as well as threats to British political and military interests. It collates information from the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), which gathers intelligence overseas, and from GCHQ, the electronic eavesdropping agency. The committee also assesses 'events and situations relating to external affairs, defence, terrorism, major international criminal activity, scientific, technical and international economic matters'. In a foreword to the booklet, Mr John Major, the prime minister, says it is government policy to be as open as possible about security and intelligence matters 'without prejudicing national security, the effectiveness of the security and intelligence services or the safety of their staff'. Mr Major adds: 'It is a strength of the British system that ministers do not receive conflicting or piecemeal intelligence assessments on situations or issues of concern.'

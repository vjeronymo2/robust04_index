Section 340B provides that a manufacturer who sells covered outpatient drugs to eligible entities must sign a pharmaceutical pricing agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the ``Secretary'') in which the manufacturer agrees to charge a price for covered outpatient drugs that will not exceed an amount determined under a statutory formula.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 340B(a)(5) of the PHS Act identifies certain requirements for covered entities concerning potential double price reductions and drug diversion. A covered entity must permit the manufacturer of a covered outpatient drug that has signed the Agreement, to audit the records of the covered entity directly pertaining to the entity's compliance with the requirements of section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B) as to drugs purchased from the manufacturer. These audits must be conducted in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary, as stated in section 340B(a)(5)(C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Office of Drug Pricing anticipates that disputes may arise between covered entities and participating manufacturers regarding implementation of the provisions of section 340B. To resolve these disputes in an expeditious manner, the Office of Drug Pricing has developed a proposed informal dispute resolution process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on the proposed manufacturer audit guidelines and the proposed informal dispute resolution process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The public is invited to submit comments on the proposed audit guidelines and dispute resolution process by July 11, 1994.

Section 340B(a)(5)(A) prohibits a covered entity from accepting a discount for a drug that would also generate a Medicaid rebate. Further, section 340B(a)(5)(B) prohibits a covered entity from reselling or otherwise transferring a discounted drug to a person who is not a patient of the entity. The participating entity must permit the manufacturer of a covered outpatient drug who has signed the Agreement with the Secretary to audit its records that directly pertain to the entity's compliance with section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B) requirements with respect to drugs of the manufacturer. Manufacturer audits must be conducted in accordance with guidelines developed by the Secretary as required by section 340B(a)(5)(C). This notice does not include the audit guidelines to be used by Government auditors where the Government performs the audit of the records of the covered entity's compliance with the requirements of section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following is the proposed ``Compliance Audit Guide'' concerning manufacturer audit guidelines as developed by the Secretary pursuant to section 340B(a)(5)(C):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. General Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A manufacturer shall conduct an audit only when the Office of Drug Pricing determines that there is reasonable cause to believe a violation of section 340B(a)(5) (A) or (B) has occurred. The manufacturer must submit a request for an audit of a covered entity to the Office of Drug Pricing. [See section II for audit steps]. Auditors have an ethical and legal responsibility to perform quality audits conducted in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, Current revision, developed by the Comptroller General of the United States. Patient confidentiality requirements must also be observed. Audit reports must be prepared at the completion of the audit. Copies of the audit report shall be prepared in accordance with the reporting standards for performance audits in Government Auditing Standards, Current Revision. The cost of a manufacturer audit will be borne by the manufacturer, as provided by section 340B(a)(5)(C) of the PHS Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Number of Audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with Government auditing standards, the organization performing the audit shall coordinate with other auditors, when appropriate, to avoid duplicating work already completed or that may be planned. Only one audit will be permitted at any one time. When specific allegations involving the drugs of more than one manufacturer have been made concerning an entity's failure to comply with section 340B(a)(5) (A) and (B), the Office of Drug Pricing will determine whether an audit should be performed by the (1) Government or (2) the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Scope of Audits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHECKING THINGS THAT BUMP AT NIGHT;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO'S OWN GHOSTBUSTERS SCOPE OUT BIZARRE PHENOMENA  </P> <P> Slime makes Kay Sterner cringe.  </P> <P> It's not that she's afraid of the make-believe psychomagnetic goop that  threatens to drive Manhattan residents crazy in "Ghostbusters II." And it's not  that she's afraid she'll succumb to its supposed diabolical powers.  </P> <P> No, Sterner is concerned that anyone would create the idea of slime at all, or  make fun of the discipline she and other members of the Spring Valley-based  California Parapsychology Foundation have devoted much of their lives to.  </P> <P> "They are distortions of the truth and they hurt people . . . especially young  people who are impressionable," the parapsychologist said about the recently  released movie.  </P> <P> For Sterner and her colleagues who investigate bizarre psychic phenomena in San  Diego County, parapsychology is not to be taken lightly, as Bill Murray, Dan  Aykroyd and Co. do in the movie.  </P> <P> Yet, as much as Sterner bristles about the movie, there are some noticeable  similarities between the ghostbusters of New York City and the  parapsychologists of San Diego County.  </P> <P> First of all, they believe in psychic happenings. They live to investigate  these strange occurrences. And they want to help people who cross paths with  ghosts, or other mysterious phenomena.  </P> <P> But, if you call on Sterner's services, don't expect her to come clad in the  baggy brown jumpsuit and high-top sneakers preferred by her celluloid  colleagues. Sterner's ghost-busting garb is her everyday wardrobe: double-knit  pants, white button earrings and a beige blouse dotted with tiny red and blue  flowers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hates to Be Called a Psychic  </P> <P> And don't expect the wisecracking affability of Murray's character, Dr. Peter  Venkman. Sterner pointedly tells you over and over again that she hates to be  called a psychic. If you mispronounce a word, she won't hesitate to correct  you.  </P> <P> Should you question her credentials, she'll note that she has a doctorate from  UCLA in education and psychology, has helped members of the British royal  family with psychic endeavors and was once among the most sought-after  parapsychologists in the world, shuttling from the United States to Europe to  perform experiments. She has taught accredited courses in parapsychological  research at San Diego State University and other colleges.  </P> <P> Many people who call the California Parapsychology Foundation to report unusual  happenings are terrified. About two months ago, Sterner and another  parapsychologist visited the Rancho Penasquitos home of one such family, whose  members reported pots and pans flying around their kitchen, cabinet doors  slamming of their own volition and furniture rearranging itself in the living  room. They even heard voices.  </P> <P> Such psychokinetic activity is nothing to be afraid of and often happens to  families with children in puberty, according to Sterner. The explosion of  energy that occurs during those years is usually the culprit that triggers the  activity, she said, especially among children of parents who are psychic.  </P> <P> This investigation, however, wasn't wildly adventurous. When the team went to  observe the Rancho Penasquitos home, they saw nothing as dramatic as what the  family had reported. That's not unusual . . . ghosts generally don't appear on  command.  </P> <P> "When we get there, usually nothing happens," Sterner said. "The children are  all quiet and on best behavior, sitting with their hands folded."  </P> <P> She tried to assure the family that the weird occurrences would eventually  stop, but they insisted on moving.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strange Footsteps  </P> <P> Perhaps Sterner's best-known accomplishment in parapsychology is her purported  discovery of spirits and ghosts haunting the Whaley House in Old Town.  </P> <P> In 1963, docents working in the historic two-story mansion began reporting  strange occurrences. They heard footsteps in an upstairs bedroom and piano  music in the parlor. Sometimes they smelled cigar smoke or perfume.  </P> <P> Sterner investigated and concluded that several of the Whaleys, a  turn-of-the-century merchant family, still inhabit the home in spirit. Without  knowing the history of the house or family, Sterner accurately recounted  incidents that had occurred on the property. Her findings were later  substantiated historically, according to museum director June A. Reading.  </P> <P> The staff at Whaley House still hears the sounds, and, on occasion, visitors to  the house report whiffing Thomas Whaley's cigar.  </P> <P> One recent day, a telephone call dragged Sterner off the flowered, velvet couch  in her Spring Valley home that houses the parapsychology foundation. The caller  was a woman who thought she had seen a ghost superimposed on a movie she was  watching on television.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Associates Help Out  </P> <P> Sterner talked with the woman for about 15 minutes, took her name and phone  number, then promised to have another foundation member check it out. She turns  such tips over to one of five or six core group members, who include a La Jolla  tax attorney and a young federal budget analyst who, probably to Sterner's  dismay, says he loves and even envies the fictional Ghostbusters.  </P> <P> "I think everyone has had experiences that defy empirical reasoning," said Kris  Sorenson, a University of San Diego graduate whose studies in philosophy led  him into parapsychology. "There is something out there that's going on . . . ."  </P> <P> That something is no more than the psychic energy everyone is born with,  parapsychologists maintain. Whether it's labeled intuition or precognition,  psychic ability or simply a gut feeling, everyone has the power to tune in to  the "inner voice" that can guide them toward good experiences or away from bad  ones.  </P> <P> "We need to have people understand how truly remarkable we all are," Sterner  said. "And that we all have these powers to a degree."  </P></p>

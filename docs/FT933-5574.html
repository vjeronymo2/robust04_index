			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: KOP sharply reduces shortfall KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, yesterday announced a FM768m (Dollars 130m) loss for the first seven months of 1993, a sharp reduction on losses of FM2.3bn in the 1992 period. It said the figures showed it was on target to halve last year's FM3.7bn deficit during the full year. It is the first indication that the bank has turned the corner to better times, as its figures for the first four months of the year showed a worsening trend. The bank is likely to have taken the unusual step of issuing January to July figures to win investor confidence for its plans to raise up to FM3bn in new capital through share and debt issues. Its capital adequacy ratio had fallen to near the 8 per cent international minimum at the end of August. The bank is aiming to raise FM750m in new equity through an issue of up to 67m shares in the next two months, according to Reuters news agency. Around 50m shares will be offered to international investors. It is also planning a perpetual subordinated debenture to be launched this month, which will increase its capital adequacy ratio by 0.6 percentage points. The aim is to have a capital adequacy ratio of around 10-11 per cent by the time the bank expects to return to the black in 1995.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jan 04, BNS -- The Ignalina nuclear power  plant, Lithuania's chief electricity producer, shut down New  Year's eve one out of two turbines of the first nuclear reactor,  the RESPUBLIKA newspaper said.    The stoppage reportedly resulted from a crack in the  turbine's pipe system. Repairs will presumably be completed Jan.  10. The reactor will continue to operate with one turbine until  then.    Experts said the shut down of one turbine will not have any  noticeable effect on the country's energy system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Diyarbakir, June 23 (A.A.) -- Regional Emergency  Supra-Governor Unal Erkan said on Wednesday [22 June] that the  separatist terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  organization was abducting children rather than the adults.    `The terror organization has massacred 4,000 citizens in 10  years,' Erkan said. `A thousand of these have been women and  children.'    Erkan arrived in Mus to receive information on the problems  of the region. After being briefed by Mus Governor Ahmet Refik  Tekerek, he visited the mayor in his office.    Proceeding to the Varto township, Erkan chatted with the  residents.    Addressing citizens gathered at a coffee house, Erkan said  that they will eradicate the terror organization.    `Do not let the collaborators of this organization survive.  A single collaborator can bring turmoil to the whole place. Do  inform the state whenever you see one,' he said.    `The separatist organization is dragging children, not  adults  to mountains. It has so far massacred 4,000 people here. Is  this the state they are promising?' He said.    `The state will construct 12,000 houses in this region this  year for the citizens fleeing terrorists,' he said.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / People: Electronic switches Keith Earthrowl, a former board member of English &amp; American Group, which has just withdrawn from the London Market and appointed a provisional liquidator for a portion of its activities, might have thought he had got out in time when the IT and computer systems subsidiary he ran, Tower Hill Services, was purchased by Sherwood Computer Services. He joined the Sherwood board last month on completion of the acquisition - only to hand in his resignation four weeks later. Charles Taylor, finance director of Sherwood, explains: 'The courtship stage is always quite attractive for an individual, but unfortunately when we got down to business, it did not work out. We have a very flat and interactive management structure, whereas he was used to a classically hierarchical set-up. We discussed ways of making it work, but soon agreed it would not.' Earthrowl had been a longstanding client of Sherwood before English &amp; American decided to set up their own systems in-house. 'A client/provider relationship is quite different from working with someone as a colleague,' says Taylor. Twenty five years in the insurance business, Earthrowl had been in the underwriting management division of CT Bowring/Marsh McLennan before joining English &amp; American Group in 1983.</p>

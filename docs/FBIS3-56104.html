			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1800 GMT on 12 January in its  "Novosti" newscast carries a report by television correspondent  Sergey Suntsov on the work of the State Duma today. Suntsov  briefly interviews deputy Georgiy Lukava. He says the view  among deputies is that the present State Duma will find it  difficult, if not impossible, to reach agreement.    Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov makes the following comments on the  situation: "This is not a puppet parliament for the  authorities, but I am quite convinced it has the potential to  understand the situation, and I think it is capable of  agreement."    Suntsov goes on to speak briefly about the session of  factions and the talk about the formation of deputies' groups.  All are united in the opinion that organizing the work of the  Duma is the key issue, Suntsov says. He says the faction heads  appear to be intent upon taking charge of this themselves. In  an interview with Suntsov, Nikolay Travkin, leader of the  Democratic Party of Russia, stresses that the leaders or  representatives of the factions are taking fundamental political  decisions. They are doing the ground work, including drawing up  the agenda or questions for discussion. He concludes that only  this can make parliament's work predictable.    Suntsov further reports that this evening the first session  of the party leaders of the deputies' groups took place. They  were to discuss the agenda for tomorrow, he says, and determine  the nominations for the post of chairman, deputies, and a number  of others. Suntsov comments: "Once again Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  was the initiator of a conflict who demanded that he should have  the right to take the session as the leader of the major  parliamentary faction. Nikolay Travkin issued an ultimatum. If  Zhirinovskiy does not change his behavior, the faction will  resort to the tactics of completely blocking the Liberal  Democratic Party."    Suntsov concludes with an interview with Gennadiy Zyuganov,  leader of the Communist Party, who states he is convinced a  common-sense party will be formed that will vote in favor of  professionalism and will listen to the opinions of authoritative  persons. Zyuganov concludes that there are very many  authoritative, professional deputies in the auditorium to whom  people will listen.    Announcer Pavel Ogorodnikov winds up the report with the  following comment: "After today's fuss, in the corridors of the  State Duma, journalists have given Zhirinovskiy the nickname of  the `incident man who cannot take even 20 steps without  declaring war on someone.'"</p>

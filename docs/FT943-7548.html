			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Australia drops plan to privatise shipping line Australia's federal government yesterday ditched plans to privatise the Australian National Line (ANL), claiming the state-owned shipping line was in a poor financial state and would not attract any buyer interest. Mr Laurie Brereton, transport minister, said the decision was supported by a private report, conducted by Salomon Brothers Australia and Price Waterhouse, for the government. 'I don't see privatisation as being in any way a realistic proposition either now or in the foreseeable (future),' he commented. While ANL has been consistently loss-making in recent years, the move also has heavy political overtones. The Labor government's current privatisation plans, which encompass the sale of the remaining 75 per cent stake in Qantas, the international airline, and the 22 Commonwealth airports run by the Federal Airports Corporation, have been coming under heavy attack from left-wing sections of the party. This issue is widely expected to dominate the Australian Labor Party's national conference to be held in Hobart next month. But by making concessions now over the ANL privatisation, the government may consider its prospects of pushing through the airports sale will be enhanced. The government first mooted the sale of 49 per cent of the shipping line business in 1991.</p>

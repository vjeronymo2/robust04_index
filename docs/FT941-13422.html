			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Hosokawa to seek popular backing for political reforms Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, will today hold a televised press conference calling for popular support for his plans to reform the corruption-tainted political system. This is an attempt to put pressure on a divided opposition Liberal Democratic party to accept a compromise on the four political reform bills before they expire at the end of the parliamentary session next Saturday. There is widespread support for reform, between 50 per cent and 60 per cent according to recent polls, indicating that Mr Hosokawa's address should increase his already high popularity. Last week his plans were voted down at the last parliamentary hurdle, the upper house, by members of the two largest parties, the LDP and the Social Democratic party - the largest coalition member - which both fear losing seats under the proposed new system. Officials from the seven-party coalition and the LDP yesterday agreed to ask the lower house of parliament to agree to the formation of a panel to discuss a compromise. However, the panel has slim chance of striking a deal in time for parliament to vote on it before the Saturday deadline. The LDP and Social Democrats are too deeply split on reform to be able to take coherent positions. If the panel fails to reach an accord, Mr Hosokawa has threatened to try to override the upper house's rejection by putting the plans to a last-minute vote in the lower house. Support of two-thirds of the lower house is needed to overturn the upper house, in what one political analyst dubbed the 'kamikaze option'. Mr Hosokawa is unlikely to win such a vote, but it could encourage a fresh round of defections from the LDP, thereby strengthening the coalition's fragile majority. The coalition is divided over what to do if, as is likely, Mr Hosokawa fails to achieve reform by the weekend. Mr Hosokawa has hinted that he would resign, leaving it to the coalition - possibly strengthened by LDP defections - to form a new cabinet. A close aide to Mr Hosokawa, Mr Shusei Tanaka, was yesterday reported as saying that resignation was 'highly possible' as a result of the difficulties facing the political reform bill. 'The prime minister is not the type of person who seeks to cling to a position,' Mr Tanaka told Kyodo News Service. But some coalition leaders say Mr Hosokawa should stay in office regardless of the fate of the reforms and work on stimulating Japan's sluggish economy. 'When we're in this severe a recession, it's not at all desirable to create a (political) vacuum,' said Mr Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democrats. However, Mr Ichiro Ozawa's Japan Renewal party, the most influential coalition partner, has suggested that a general election should be called. Japanese press reports yesterday said Mr Ozawa has asked Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a former LDP prime minister who supports reform, to defect to the coalition as a possible successor to Mr Hosokawa. Mr Kaifu is among the 70 LDP members of parliament who openly support reform. But it is uncertain whether all LDP reformists would follow Mr Kaifu, because he is not a powerful political fund-raiser, the vital ingredient that Mr Ozawa provided when he led the LDP defection that brought down the former LDP government last summer. The business community views the prospect of a snap election with dismay, because this would delay an urgently needed economic stimulus package and threaten the government's finances when it is already late with the budget for the fiscal year starting in April. However, public distaste for the horse-trading over reform could manifest itself as a protest vote against the LDP, if a snap election were called. That would suit Mr Ozawa's strategy of further dividing and weakening the LDP.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Novell surges on growth of network computing NOVELL, the US computer networking software company, reported a 50 per cent jump in revenues for its second quarter, with earnings up 60 per cent as the company continued to benefit from rapid growth in network computing. Net income rose to Dollars 61.3m, or 40 cents a share, from Dollars 38.4m or 26 cents. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 225m, up from Dollars 150.2m last time. In spite of the strong performance, Novell's stock price was down yesterday morning on news of the results. Wall Street analysts had hoped the company would outperform their projections. Novell aimed to expand its sales further by providing operating system software for networked desktop computers, said Mr Raymond Noorda, chairman, president and chief executive. For the first six months net income increased 65 per cent to Dollars 113.5m from Dollars 68.9m, while income per share was 74 cents, up from 47 cents. Revenue was Dollars 430m, against Dollars 284.8m in the same period last year. Total revenue growth for the half year reflects a 37 per cent rise in sales of network computing software. Sales outside the US increased 85 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars 104m. For the first six months of fiscal 1992, international sales were Dollars 207m, accounting for 48 per cent of total revenue.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-HOSTAGE SENT TO JAIL IN FRANCE IN CUSTODY CASE  </P> <P> Jacqueline Valente, freed in Beirut in April after more than two years as a  hostage, was sentenced Wednesday to two months in a French prison for taking  two daughters from her ex-husband in defiance of a custody ruling.  </P> <P> Prosecutors had requested only a one-month suspended sentence during the  hearing in Toulon, but the presiding judge, Andre Fortin, decided to impose the  harsher penalty.  </P> <P> He said that Valente, 32, had committed a "premeditated kidnaping" in 1983 and  expressed irritation that she refused to answer questions about the mysterious  circumstances of her own abduction.  </P> <P> Valente was allowed to remain free pending an appeal. She was sentenced to six  months in prison, four of which were suspended.  </P> <P> The case dates to August, 1983, when Valente refused to return her daughters --  Marie-Laure and Virginie -- to their father after one of their regular visits  with her.  </P> <P> No word was heard about Valente and the girls until November, 1987, when the  Revolutionary Council of Fatah -- a Libyan-backed Palestinian group led by  terrorist Abu Nidal -- declared it had taken them hostage, along with five  Belgians also aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean.  </P> <P> The two girls were freed in 1988, and Valente, her Belgian companion, Fernand  Houtekins, and their own daughter, Sophie-Liberte, were freed April 10.  </P></p>

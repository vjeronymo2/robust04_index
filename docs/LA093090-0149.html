			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> THREE TIED FOR LEAD IN THE SOUTHERN OPEN  </P> <P> Jim Hallet finished birdie-eagle Saturday to complete a round of 65 and gain a  share of the lead with Kenny Knox and David Peoples after the third round of  the Southern Open.  </P> <P> Knox had a 68 and Peoples, who led by two shots entering the day, had a par  round of 70 over the tight, hilly, 6,775-yard Green Island Country Club course  at Columbus, Ga.  </P> <P> Both Knox and Peoples birdied the 18th to join Hallet at 199, 11 under par.  There are 14 players within three shots of the lead.  </P> <P> Greg Buckner had a double-eagle 2 on the par-five, 585-yard 18th when he used a  four-wood to hit 243 yards into the hole on his second shot. He is in a group  at 202.  </P> <P> Ian Woosnam, angry because of a round that took more than five hours, shot a  four-under-par 67 and took a three-stroke lead over Mark McNulty after three  rounds of the Grand Prix of Europe at Chepstow, Wales.  </P> <P> Persistent rain that eventually turned into a downpour slowed play, but  Woosnam, at 14-under-par 199, said the main culprits were the players.  </P> <P> "We took 4 hours and 15 minutes for the first 15 holes, which I think was  disgraceful," he said. "I know it was wet, but there are obviously some very  slow players out there."  </P> <P> Defending champion Bob Charles added a 66 to his first-round 65 and leads by  two shots after two rounds of the senior tournament at Melbourne, Fla.  </P> <P> Charles is at 13-under-par 131 at the 6,590-yard Suntree Country Club course.  Dale Douglass shot a 67 and is at 133. Homero Blancas is next at 135.  </P></p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Ercros formally files for protection from its creditors ERCROS, the big Spanish chemicals group controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), yesterday formally filed for protection from its creditors, along with its troubled fertiliser division, Fesa-Enfersa. The two companies have combined debts of Dollars 1.56bn. The filings, in Madrid and Barcelona, end weeks of agonising over how to deal with the Ercros groups' total debt of Dollars 2.15bn - yesterday's filings exclude the group's chemicals, mining and explosives businesses - following the KIO's refusal to make new funds available without a broader agreement on assistance from creditor banks and the Spanish government. KIO, through Torras, its Spanish holding company, owns 39 per cent of Ercros, which lost Dollars 160m last year. Salomon Brothers has been appointed as adviser to the KIO in an effort to sort out its Spanish investments. Mr Francisco Luzon, chairman of the state-owned Banco Exterior, which is owed more than Dollars 200m by Ercros, has sharply criticised the decision to go into receivership and has warned that all of KIO's industrial companies may be threatened by it. In London yesterday, KIO was taking legal advice on the effect of its filing on a Pounds 100m convertible guaranteed by Torras. The trustee of the bond issue, the Law Debenture Trust Corporation, is still considering whether the filing, which represents an event of default, is prejudicial to bondholders. If the trustee decides to ask for repayment of the bonds, they would be repaid at 102 per cent of their face value. Such a step would be subject to the approval of bondholders. But bondholders will have the option to put the bonds at 125.25 in August 1993. If they believe the principal is safe, bondholders may chose to sit it out until next year's put option. The price of the bonds has fallen sharply in the last few days, due to the risk of early redemption. In the wake of yesterday's filing, the bonds were bid at 103, down eight points on last week.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: McLeod Russel declines to Pounds 1.9m MCLEOD Russel Holdings, the paints producer and distributor which in March acquired Wheway, the environmental engineering group, announced a reduction in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.05m to Pounds 1.91m for the six months to March 31. Turnover amounted to Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 21m) and operating profits edged ahead to Pounds 1.59m (Pounds 1.55m). However, lower net interest received of Pounds 326,000 (Pounds 500,000) cut the pre-tax line. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.75p, payable from earnings of 3.01p (3.13p) per share. Mr Nigel Openshaw, chairman, said the full year's result would depend on the success in turning round the Wheway businesses. He added that in spite of little improvement in market conditions, the McLeod Russel companies continued to be cash generative and traded satisfactorily.</p>

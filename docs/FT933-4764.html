			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Light seen at end of tunnel for aluminium producers THE ALUMINIUM market would move back into balance next year and prices rise above the industry's break-even level again if there were further relatively modest cuts in capacity and producers resisted the temptation to re-start mothballed smelters, analysts suggest. 'Knock out another 300,000 tonnes (of annual capacity) and the aluminum market next year could be quite good,' says Mr Stewart Spector of the New York-based Spector Report consultancy organisation. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suggests that, even if western imports of Commonwealth of Independent States aluminium remain at about 1m tonnes a year, 'the upturn in demand would still leave the west in considerable supply deficit by 1995. Much will depend on western producers exercising restraint. If they rush to restart the 1.4m tonnes of capacity temporarily mothballed over the past two years, they will simply condemn themselves to low prices'. He points out in the latest Metals Report that the prolonged period of depressed prices has caused a large number of new smelter projects to be cancelled or postponed so there is little new capacity in the pipeline. 'A marked resurgence in demand over the next three years could leave the west in considerable supply deficit.' The recent fresh cuts announced by the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) and Reynolds Metals, the biggest and second-biggest US producers, which will take another 356,000 tonnes of annual capacity out of production, are the first in two years that will not be offset by new capacity coming on stream, Mr MacMillan points out. He urges producers not to restore any capacity until the aluminium price reaches 65 cents a lb and suggests this will not occur until the second half of 1994. 'While prices next year will be significantly higher than in 1993, it will be 1995/96 before the industry enjoys the full benefit of rising demand.' Billiton is forecasting an average London Metal Exchange aluminium price of 53 cents a lb this year, rising to 62 cents next year and to 75 cents in 1995. Both Billiton and Spector expect western aluminium output to fall next year. Mr Spector suggests it could slip by 1.8 per cent from the 1993 forecast level of 14.92m tonnes to 14.64m. He says it would then take only a 4 per cent rise in demand for stocks to start falling and for prices to improve. Mr Spector says that recent increases in LME, trader and producer stocks were offset by a fall in unreported CIS metal of a grade too low to be delivered to LME warehouses.</p>

Except as hereinafter noted and until further notice, the Agency adopts and will follow the Federal Advisory Committee Management Regulations for the operation of this and future advisory committees (41 CFR 101&hyph;6.1001_101.61035 (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the Committee is to provide input and advice to the Board and General Counsel on changes in Agency procedures that will expedite case processing and improve Agency service to the public. The Committee will function solely as an advisory body and in compliance with the terms of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and its charter will be filed in accordance with the provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee will consist of 50 members divided into two panels, one composed of 25 Union-side representatives and the other of 25 Management-side representatives. Membership on the panels will be broadly representative of persons who represent labor and management before the Agency, and members will be selected for their expertise in representing labor and management before the Agency. Balance of Committee composition will be ensured through geographical, ethnic minority and women representatives, and through representation by the Co-Chairs of the NLRB Practice and Procedure Committee of the Labor and Employment Law Section of the American Bar Association. Appointments will be for two years unless otherwise directed by the Chairman of the Board. Committee members will be required to bear their own costs for travel and other expenses in connection with their participation on the Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, the two panels of the Committee will meet separately. The date, place and time of the panel meetings will be published in the Federal Register. The notice will also announce whether the meetings are open or closed to public attendance, and if closed, the reasons why. A session of the Committee will consist of one scheduled meeting of each panel. When the panels meet on different dates, the adjournment of the latter of the two panels will constitute an adjournment of that session of the Committee. Within 30 days of that adjournment, any member of the public may present written comments to the Committee on the matters considered during the previous session. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments should be submitted to the Committee's Management Officer and Designated Federal Official, Miguel Gonzelez, Executive Assistant to the Chairman, National Labor Relations Board, 1099_14th Street, NW., suite 11104, Washington, DC 20570&hyph;0001; Telephone: (202) 273&hyph;2864.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ACTION> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William B.

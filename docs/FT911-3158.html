			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Slovak PM falls victim to tide of economic reform: The political demise of a volatile 'hero' who clung to the past BEHIND this week's downfall of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the volatile and highly popular prime minister of Slovakia, lay deep-seated economic differences with Prague over the future of economic reforms. Mr Meciar strongly opposed the radical free market reforms of Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czechoslovak finance minister. Slovakia, an agrarian backwater only 40 years ago, was saddled with huge armament factories and processing industries under the communists. Economic restructuring now threatens mass unemployment in a region where the standard of living - in sharp contrast to the Czech republic - has risen since 1948. Mr Jan Carnogursky, who sought confirmation last night from parliament as the new Christian Democratic prime minister of Slovakia, is aware that collectivism and reliance on the government is stronger among Slovaks than among more individualistic Czechs. Despite deep-seated Slovak fears of economic reforms, he also realises that impoverished Slovakia, with only 5.5m people, can ill afford to follow a separate economic route from the 10m Czechs. He will attempt, however, to squeeze every Koruna he can get for Slovakia out of the Czechoslovak budget. As the man who first raised the threat of Slovak independence last year, Mr Carnogursky can be counted on to play the separatist card, to gain greater economic aid for Slovakia. His more recent statements on the need for Slovakia to remain in the Czechoslovak federation give rise to hopes in Prague that he will not compete with Mr Meciar on the incendiary issue of Slovak independence. There could be no greater contrast between the shy, ascetic-looking Mr Carnogursky, who was first deputy prime minister until this week, and the extrovert, bull-necked Mr Meciar, who is idolised by ordinary Slovaks. Mr Meciar threatened that after a month of peace for the new government he would march on Bratislava with the jobless and starving and demand to know what the government would do for them. More than 50,000 of his supporters - in the biggest demonstration in Bratislava since the communists' overthrow in November 1989 - demonstrated on Wednesday evening, demanding his reinstatement and hurling paving stones at parliament. Mr Meciar's erratic behaviour as prime minister was an important reason the main body of his Public Against Violence (PAV) movement - the Slovak counterpart of Civic Forum in Prague - joined with Mr Carnogursky to oust him. Mr Meciar angered the PAV leadership by forming a rival group, PAV-Platform for a Democratic Slovakia, which aims to put the brakes on the economic reforms. Not surprisingly, his main allies are the former communists in Slovakia who regard Mr Meciar, himself a former communist youth movement functionary, as a guarantor of social justice.</p>

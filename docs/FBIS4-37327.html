			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  said after his meeting with the Yemeni delegation that Lakhdar  Brahimi, special representative of the UN secretary general, is  currently making contacts with the parties involved in the  Yemeni dispute and that these contacts will continue all day.    He added that today's meeting was held to exchange views and  listen to the Yemenis' viewpoint. He pointed out that the  Egyptian contacts are independent of those being made by Brahimi  and that they aim to spare Yemen the misfortunes of a continued  war and help establish a cease-fire and begin a dialogue.    Musa said that a north Yemeni delegation will arrive in  Cairo  today.    Touching on his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton's  envoy, he said that it concerned the envoy's special mission in  Sudan. He added that views were exchanged on the situation  there.    Musa explained that Egypt's stance is clear and that it  emphasizes the need to preserve Sudan's territorial integrity,  despite our political differences with that country. However,  preserving Sudan's territorial integrity is an important matter  that is part of mutual respect and safeguarding the rights of  all the Sudanese people, he added.</p>

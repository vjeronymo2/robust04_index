			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Desperate for a white knight - The prospects of a rescue for Ferranti FERRANTI, the troubled defence electronics group locked in discussions over a possible rescue bid which would value the company at just Pounds 9.4m, is the victim of a classic 'Catch-22' bind, City analysts said yesterday. 'Ferranti had been hoping for further orders but these haven't come through because people are worried about their cash difficulties,' said one analyst. As a result analysts speculate that cash is continuing to drain away at the company, once one of the most distinguished names in British industry and a world-renowned technology leader. Although Ferranti has not identified its potential suitor, which might offer 1p a share, the City is convinced that Britain's GEC, which bought large parts of Ferranti's defence business after the disastrous fraud at International Signal and Control, the US company it bought in 1987, is the only potential bidder. GEC has declined to comment. However Thomson-CSF, the French defence group, would probably be interested in securing the sonar joint venture it has with Ferranti, although this is probably covered by a buy-out agreement in the event of a third party bid for Ferranti. If a bid were to emerge analysts speculate that it could lead to a virtuous circle of new orders for the new owner as confidence returned. Among the large orders which might be won is an early warning defence system order from Bahrain called Delmon Eye, said to be worth about Pounds 100m. 'Other people looking to give Ferranti contracts would see them getting a large contract and take confidence from that,' said one analyst. Yesterday, analysts and City bankers were picking over the Ferranti assets and liabilities in an attempt to put a realistic value on the group. Ferranti's audited fixed assets consist of about Pounds 50m in land and buildings and assets and Pounds 40m in plant and equipment. The company has land in the UK - about 30 sites - and in the US. The main assets are a 150,000 sq ft factory at Bracknell, Berkshire, and a 75,000 sq ft site in Cwmbran, Gwent. Both are used for manufac-turing. The company also owns a site close to Manchester airport, but concedes it is difficult to value, depending as it does on progress with a proposed second runway for the airport as well as planning permission. One prize that might attract a buyer is a property in southern California. When Ferranti sold a subsidiary called Marquardt in December 1991, it kept ownership of 20 acres of land near Van Nuys Air Force base. It says that independent Californian valuers have put a figure of 'more than Pounds 30m' on the value of the site. Ferranti has a Dollars 25m loan secured on the land, so if a buyer of Ferranti succeeded in selling it for the valuation figure it could realise a net gain of about Dollars 20m. However, there is no guarantee that such a sale could be made at that price in the depressed California property market, especially since Ferranti has been trying to dispose of the property itself. The company's main manufacturing site, in Oldham, Lancashire, has much in the way of plant and machinery, but the site itself is not owned by Ferranti. Similarly, a business park at Manchester Airport is leased. The company's accounts also show a number of other items which might be of interest to a potential purchaser. Among these the group has unutilised losses carried forward of about Pounds 375m, of which about Pounds 109m are attributable to the UK and might be available to a bidder to offset against future taxable profits. In addition, based on the latest actuarial assessment, Ferranti's pension fund showed a substantial surplus of about Pounds 100m, but it is not clear to what extent, if at all, a buyer of Ferranti could utilise it. Ferranti itself, which has a Pounds 15m loan from the fund, said at its recent extraordinary general meeting that it could not further tap the surplus because of Inland Revenue rules. Set against this the company still has debts of some Pounds 100m, despite a series of disposals which have slimmed the company down drastically and reduced debt from nearly Pounds 700m since the ISC fraud was discovered within the company in 1989. At the same time Ferranti's workforce has been cut from 23,000 to about 4,000. Ferranti chairman and chief executive, Eugene Anderson, warned earlier this month that losses for the first half to end-September would be larger than the deficit of Pounds 10.9m last year. It lost Pounds 24.5m in the year to March 31. He said liquidity continued to be tight, which made relationships with suppliers difficult and added Ferranti was seeking an equity injection or 'strategic partnership.' The City feels in the dark about the full extent of Ferranti's liabilities or the full worth to a buyer of the financial engineering potential of a deal. In these circumstances, analysts are unable yet to challenge the credibility of the 1p a share offer Ferranti said is being discussed. The fact that the shares rose 1 1/2 p to 4p yesterday on heavy volume indicates some investors are willing to take a punt. If a bid does finally materialise, it will be the second time Ferranti has been rescued. The group had to be rescued by the government and then subsequently refloated in 1978.</p>

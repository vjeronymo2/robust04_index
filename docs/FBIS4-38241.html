			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>   [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 28 (AFP) -- Northern troops aided  by a blaze of artillery fire smashed through another defense  line around Aden and were poised Tuesday [28 June] to capture  the key southern city's water plant, an AFP correspondent  reported.    Northern forces since late Monday were seen to have advanced  five kilometers (three miles) south to the edge of Bi'r Nasir,  the site of the water plant which southern officers said has  already been destroyed.    The advance to Bi'r Nasir, 15 kilometers north of here,  followed the north's entry Saturday into Aden's western suburbs  where it gained control of the city's power station and cut the  road to the oil refinery.    A southern officer told AFP that 1,000 shells were fired  during the advance.    Hospital officials said that one civilian was killed and 18  wounded overnight in shelling and rocketing of the northern  suburbs and that three children died of dehydration.    The city has been totally without running water since Sunday  after a few days of availability due to partial repairs to the  water plant which was first hit at the start of the month.    Southern forces dug trenches and built sand barriers at the  approaches to the city, withdrew artillery to the suburbs and  the city center, and deployed Soviet-built surface-to-air  missiles around the city.    Several rockets were fired at the city's television station  but daily programing had not started and it was not clear if it  had been damaged.    Aden Radio has been off the air since northern forces  entered  the western suburbs on Saturday and residents were glued to  foreign stations.    The breakaway southern leadership meanwhile urged the  international community to stop talking and come to Aden's  rescue, implicitly criticizing the slowness of UN efforts to end  the fighting in Yemen.    Five ceasefires have collapsed since the United Nations  Security Council on June 1 adopted a resolution calling for an  immediate truce and sending a special envoy on a 10-day mission  earlier this month to set it up.    Each side accused the other of firing the first shot.    The United Nations was meanwhile considering another draft  resolution.    "The civilized world is not reacting and is holding only  consultations while the bloodthirsty Sanaa regime scorns UN  resolutions, pursues its bombardment of Aden and its repression  of the (south) Yemeni people," the leadership said.    In a statement carried by the official news media here, it  said southerners were determined to "defend their land and their  honor and to resist the occupation."    It issued an "appeal to the international community to stand  by the people and save the city of Aden."    The statement denounced "Sanaa's determination to demolish  the homes of Adenites and deprive them of water," accusing the  northerners of taking as hostage women and children over six  years old.    "Who would agree to union with such a regime," the  leadership  asked.    Southern Yemen declared a separate state on May 21 two weeks  after war broke out between the former Marxist South Yemen and  tribal North Yemen, which had formed a fragile four-year union.    Northern forces are led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  and  southern troops by his southern rival and former vice president  'Ali Salim al-Bid.</p>

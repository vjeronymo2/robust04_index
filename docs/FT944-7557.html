			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Health officials forced to disclose information The parliamentary ombudsman has forced the Department of Health to release information about talks it claimed to have held with pharmaceutical industry representatives. It is the second time that Mr William Reid, the parliamentary ombudsman, has used his powers under the government's code of practice on access to official information and forced civil servants to hand over information they wanted to keep secret. The code was introduced by in April amid claims that it would open to the public documents and research previously kept secret. The ombudsman was appointed as an independent referee to rule on disputes between indivi-duals and civil servants. Mr Reid reveals his decision in a report published today. The report also gives details of another case in which he upheld the Inland Revenue's refusal to reveal information about an individual. Earlier this year Mr Reid disclosed that he had forced the Department of Transport to hand over a report it had tried to keep private. Mr Reid said: 'My report shows that the code can work to enable members of the public to acquire information which would otherwise be denied them.' The Campaign for Freedom of Information asked in May for information from the government on its discussions with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry about introducing a voluntary code on disclosure of the contents and production of pharmaceuticals. The pressure group suspected that formal talks had not begun and argued to the ombudsman that reference to discussions by the government were 'spurious'. The department refused to give any details until the ombudsman intervened. The group was then told that 'an informal meeting on January 26 1993' had been held between a DoH official and the ABPI and that there was 'further contact by letter on February 1 1993'. Meanwhile, the ombudsman has hinted that he believes there may be too many areas under which access to information can be refused. He said yesterday: 'It may be that the code goes further than it need in some of its exemptions.'</p>

Six criminals guilty of the most heinous crimes were escorted  to the execution ground and shot to death.    Among the serious criminal activities, cases on robbing taxi  drivers and stealing taxis have increased notably. In 1993, 273  such cases occurred, 340 percent more than in 1992. Of the  total, 165 were cases on robbery of taxi drivers, an increase of  217 percent over 1992; and 108 were cases on stealing of taxis,  a substantial increase. Such criminal activities damaging taxi  drivers have greatly threatened the public security of the  capital and the lives and property of the people. Implementing  the principle of dealing strict blows to criminal activities,  Beijing's public security and judicial departments concentrated  forces and devoted time to strictly crack down on robbery and  stealing of taxis and other criminal activities.    The six criminals who were executed on 4 March were Zhang  Yong and Liang Cuifa, peasants from Wuji County of Hebei  Province, who ganged up and fled to Beijing to rob a taxi and  cruelly killed the driver; Fu Qiang, a jobless person, and his  partners Li Feng and Du Guijun, who robbed taxis and killed the  drivers on many occasions; and Wang Shili, a jobless person, who  anesthetized taxi drivers and robbed money from them on many  occasions. Liang Zhaoming, Liu Xiaogang, Qi Shoufeng, Liu  Quanlu, and Wang Guoli, who also joined the above-mentioned  criminal activities, were sentenced to life imprisonment or  fixed-term imprisonment.

In the initial stage, the source said, the government plans  to call for improvement of human rights conditions in the North  in cooperation with international organizations like Amnesty  International and the International Red Cross.    "Through these bodies, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to allow  visits by human rights inspectors and to stop torture and all  other forms of maltreatment of prisoners," he said.    Another method is to have North Korea accept a human rights  manifesto applicable to all member countries in return for  economic cooperation when Northeast Asian multilateral security  dialogue involving the North is set up, he continued.    "When inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation are promoted in  earnest, the South could extend support to the North with  emphasis on those areas which could be helpful in elevating the  quality of North Koreans' lives," he said.    "At this stage, efforts could also be made to arrange the  reunion of dispersed families by South and North Korea without  linking it to political questions such as the nuclear issue," he  added.    The source said that the Unification Board feels the need to  think about a method to have the North Korean authorities  release political prisoners and facilitate the reunion or  meeting of dispersed families.    "Before their integration, West Germany paid 3,440 million  marks in all to East Germany from 1963 until 1989 to get the  communist regime to set free 34,000 political prisoners and  allow the reunion of 250,000 displaced families," he noted.</p>

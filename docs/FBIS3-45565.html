The talks, scheduled for 70 minutes, lasted more than 90  minutes, said Oleg Lobov, Russian National Security Council  secretary.    He said the talks included discussions of economic  cooperation between Russia and the United States, as well as  U.S. assistance for Russia's economic reforms, including how to  build closer ties between Russia and international lending  organizations such as the World Bank and the International  Monetary Fund.    Yeltsin spoke to Clinton of "positive shifts" in the process  of reform, and said that they will not slow down.    Clinton said the United States would provide "maximum  support" for the reform process, particularly in the social  sphere.    The two presidents will meet again Friday [14 January]  morning after the planned tripartite summit with Ukrainian  leader Leonid Kravchuk, during which a historical agreement "to  make the world a safer place with fewer nuclear weapons" is due  to be signed by the leaders of the three countries.    Kravchuk will arrive in Moscow this afternoon, and is  expected to sign an agreement on Friday to remove the 176  nuclear missiles and 1,500 nuclear warheads which were deployed  on ukranian territory by the former Soviet Union.    In the first round of talks this morning, which lasted one  hour, the two leaders focused on the political and economic  situation in Russia, said Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian  presidential spokesman.    Clinton introduced the "partnership for peace" proposal to  Yeltsin, said Kostikov, who added that the concept is still  little known in Russia.    The problem of possible NATO expansion was also discussed  during the initial talks.</p>

According to a statement issued by the Press Center of the  President's Office, it was recalled that certain statements  regarding the Cyprus issue were attributed to Ciller in today's  issue of a newspaper [not further identified]. The statement  notes that at the meeting between the delegations held in  Washington, Clinton stated that there was a deadlock regarding  the confidence-building measures [CBM's].    Ciller, in turn, said the following at the meeting: The  original CBM's package was, in principle, approved by the  Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and was also endorsed by  Turkey. The package was subsequently changed. It will be  appropriate to discuss the issue once more before the end of  April and achieve a rapprochement between the views of the two  sides.    The statement further notes that the minutes of the meeting  were dispatched to the Foreign Ministry the day of the meeting.</p>

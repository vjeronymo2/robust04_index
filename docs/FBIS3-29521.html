			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kim Myong-chol] </F>   [Text] Seoul, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's  visits to Japan and China in March are designed to cement  cooperation with the two powerful neighbors, serving to promote  peace on the Korean peninsula and enhance Seoul's status to  better prepare for a new order in Northeast Asia.    Just as cooperation with the four major world powers -- the  United States, Japan, China and Russia -- is important to  security on the Korean peninsula, so is cooperation with Japan  and China vital to the growth of the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum as a driving force for regional  cooperation and prosperity. Kim is visiting Tokyo and Beijing to  strengthen such cooperation. It is significant that Kim is  meeting the leaders of these two countries when a new post-cold  war order in Northeast Asia is in the making, especially when  the North Korean nuclear issue is taking a turn for the better,  Chongwadae [presidential office] spokesman Chu Ton-sik says.    Kim's visits will provide an opportunity for him to lay a  regional footing upon which to promote peace on the Korean  peninsula and build a multilateral dialogue system for regional  security, according to other Chongwadae officials.    They will also help create an environment for cooperation  among nations in the region, including Japan and China,  conducive to a peaceful solution to the North Korean nuclear  issue and to improved inter-Korean relations leading to eventual  reunification. Kim will likely ask the two countries to play a  constructive role in prodding North Korea to emerge from its  international isolation and ride the world trend of  globalization.    Chong Chong-uk, Kim's senior secretary for Foreign Affairs  and National Security, says the visits are part of diplomatic  efforts to secure the firm support of China and Japan in  attaining peaceful reunification of Korea. They will provide a  practical opportunity to build a multilateral dialogue system  benefiting security on the Korean peninsula, including solution  of the North Korean nuclear issue.    Kim is holding summits with the Japanese and Chinese leaders  to discuss a new post-cold war order in Northeast Asia, while  talking about nurturing APEC -- which is still in an infant  stage -- as a regional organization.    On the basis of his experience at the first APEC summit in  Seattle last November, Kim will focus on how to best develop the  forum as a regional engine of economic cooperation in  preparation for the second APEC summit slated for November in  Indonesia.    In view of Japan and China's emergence as South Korea's  second and third largest trade partners -- with two-way trade  reaching 28.7 billion U.S. dollars and 9.2 billion dollars,  respectively, last year, next only to the United States -- Kim's  trips should lead to increased economic cooperation with the two  countries.    Thus, the visits are part of his summit diplomacy aimed at  increasing the nation's international competitiveness in an era  of tough trade competition unleashed by the Uruguay Round accord.    In China, Kim will taste the fruits of such summit  diplomacy,  including the signing of a Korea-China aviation treaty. But he  is against the hasty conclusion of any economic pacts just to  enjoy ceremonial fruit.    In Japan, Kim will promote cultural and educational exchange  programs.    Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa promised in a  recent telephone conversation with President Kim to increase the  number of Koreans studying in Japan under the Japanese  Government's scholarship program for foreign students from 100  to 200.    Ambassador to Japan Kong No-myong has raised the issue of  opening the country to Japanese arts, especially to Japanese  music and films, drawing both positive and negative opinions  from the public. This issue is expected to attract public  attention again when Kim visits Japan.    In Japan, Kim will make a speech at the Japanese Diet  calling  for a forward-looking relationship between the two countries.  Whether Kim raises the issue of their unhappy historical  relations at the Japanese emperor's dinner remains to be seen,  as he wants Japan to settle all pending historical problems. On  the other hand, Japan will use Kim's visit to push ahead with  its plan to have Emperor Akihito visit Seoul.    In China, Kim will visit the old provisional Korean  Government building in Shanghai, meet President Jiang Zemin and  Prime Minister Li Peng and speak at Beijing University. The  itinerary arranged by Beijing for President Kim is rather  exceptional in view of China's traditional relationship with  North Korea, Foreign Ministry officials say.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 27 KYODO -- Retail prices of  government- controlled rice took a steep downturn in March with  large amounts of inexpensive imported rice on sale, a government  report said Wednesday [27 April].    Medium to short grains, such as Chinese and California rice,  were priced on average at 4,100 to 4,300 yen per 10 kilograms,  about 2,000 yen less than the average 6,365 yen that top quality  domestic rice fetched the previous month.    Thai rice, at about 3,000 yen per 10 kilos, sold for less  than half the February price for domestic rice, while prices for  foreign rice blended with Japanese rice stood at 4,300 to 5,200  yen, 1,000 to 2,000 yen lower.    Meanwhile, prices of domestically-grown rice being traded  outside government-approved channels kept sliding as sufficient  supplies of imported rice have eased consumer worries about the  availability of the staple grain, market sources said.    For instance, wholesale prices for the popular koshihikari  brand of rice grown in the central areas of Niigata Prefecture  have recently dropped below the 50,000 yen line per 60 kilogram  sack for the first time in two years.    The downfall in domestic rice prices has led some analysts  to  declare that the price run-up seen after last year's poor  harvests and massive hoarding by consumers has finally come to  an end.    Rice Databank Inc., a research firm specializing in rice,  said producers and wholesalers, believing that black market rice  prices have peaked, are in a hurry to unleash their stocks onto  the market.    As an example, a Kansai-based dealer on the black market  said  he wants to sell his stocks by August, when early-harvested rice  will start to appear on the market.</p>

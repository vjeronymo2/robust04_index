			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats after drop in NAPM index Wall Street AFTER a brief move upwards at the opening, US share prices fell back in the wake of more bad economic news to end little changed on the day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.54 at 3,510.54. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finished 1.53 lower at 449.00, while the Amex composite ended up 1.63 at 435.87, and the Nasdaq composite down 0.36 at 703.59. Trading volume on the NYSE was 283m shares. Prices opened slightly firmer, helped by reports of an 11,000 decline in the latest weekly jobless claims numbers. The fall was bigger than expected and briefly raised hopes that today's employment report for June will not be as weak as feared. The markets could not hold on to their initial gains, however, and prices turned tail soon after the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing activity had dropped from 51.1 per cent in May to 49.8 per cent in June. Any reading below 50 per cent is regarded as indicative of a contraction in the manufacturing economy. Moreover, the June figure was the lowest level in the NAPM index since December 1991, a time when the economy was in recession. The data was especially worrying because it suggested that it was unlikely that manufacturers added to their payrolls in any significant numbers last month. Consequently, today's June employment report could prove even weaker than anticipated. The latest batch of Wall Street forecasts predict that non-farm payrolls will have risen by between 100,000 and 150,000 last month, and that the unemployment rate will be at 7.0 per cent. Cyclicals ended mixed despite the fresh economic worries. General Electric dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 95, Caterpillar gave up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 74, but Minnesota Mining&amp;Manufacturing held steady at Dollars 108, and International Paper bounced back from early losses to finish Dollars 1 3/8 higher at Dollars 65 3/8 ,. Aluminium Company of America rallied strongly, rising Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 72 1/8 as the stock continued to benefit from its recent decision to cut its aluminium production capacity. Westinghouse Electric firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 16 as investors responded mostly favourably to the appointment of Mr Michael Jordan as chairman and chief executive. Santa Fe Pacific slipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 18 after Merrill Lynch cut its short-term rating on the stock from above average to neutral. Drug stocks ran into heavy selling after two of the sector's biggest constituents - Merck and Pfizer - were cut from the recommended list of Goldman Sachs. Pfizer tumbled Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 64 7/8 in volume of 2.1m shares, Merck gave up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 34 7/8 , Bristol-Myers Squibb dropped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 57 and Schering-Plough fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 68 1/2 . Toronto was closed yesterday for Canada Day.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed by "J.-L.L.": "Chirac: Manifesto To Open </F> the Campaign"]    [Text] The secret had been well kept. Everybody knew that  Jacques Chirac was calmly filling dozens of pages in a country  house close to Paris. But the RPR [Rally for the Republic]  president caused editorial and political surprise by publishing  his initial thoughts on changing France. Thus the mayor of  Paris is resuming the initiative with a view to the 1995  presidential election in the sphere of ideas, by cautiously  refusing to officially reveal his intentions. "Is this a  declaration of candidacy?" he was asked. "Certainly not. A  declaration of candidacy is the opening of the campaign. That  would be absolutely premature at this stage."    Basing himself on a tough "media schedule" (30 minutes live  from the City Hall at 2000 on TF1 yesterday evening; interviews  with AFP, LE FIGARO, and Luxembourg Radio and Television), the  RPR leader is displaying modest ambitions. He simply says that  this little work of 141 pages is aimed at "fueling the big  exchange of ideas" with one year to go before a crucial election  for the country. "I have neither the ambition nor the desire to  review all the subjects with which we are dealing or which  concern us. Still less to draw up a plan for society. I have  tried to provide some possible answers," the Paris mayor warns  in the introduction to this book entitled A New France.  Reflections 1.    Dedicating his book "to post-1968 young people," the RPR  president wants to win them over to his conviction that "in a  changing environment, there is no greater risk than standing  still." His diagnosis? At the end of the seven-year  [presidential] term, France "shows the signs of a dangerously  divided society, one which is dependent and, to some extent,  demotivated." Is Edouard Balladur to blame? Without naming the  prime minister, Jacques Chirac does him the credit of saying  that "our country has been wisely governed for the past year."  He even thinks that a "degree of recovery is perceptible," but  reaffirmed that "the problem is still a deep one." This problem  relates to the unsuitability of the existing "tools," "forged at  a time of full employment, growth, and inflation" and which  require "great efforts for paltry results."    The RPR president, the advocate of "real changes," is  convinced that the French are ready to accept the "constraints"  provided these reforms are "simple, that they seem effective,  that the burden is fairly distributed, and that the weakest  countries are protected." Two key words define Jacques Chirac's  ambition: "solidarity and social cohesion." And the solutions?  The RPR leader merely defined the main axes of his social and  European policy, the role of the institutions, taking up  proposals made during his tour of the regions. The objective  was not to submit "ready-made solutions," one of his close aides  explained, but to give a few initial ideas for consideration (a  second volume is planned). "I hope that the coming presidential  election will make it possible to open up a real broad debate on  ideas, eliminating, once and for all, the eternal personal  rivalries," Jacques Chirac writes in conclusion out of an  obvious concern to "rise above" these.</p>

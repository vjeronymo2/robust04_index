			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Investment banking The job cuts and hiring freezes announced this week in the City and on Wall Street will provide some relief to investment banks in a difficult year, but they are not the complete answer to the industry's problems. Action is also needed to link pay more closely to performance and to reduce the capital devoted to the industry. The snag is that neither will be easy. Most banks pay lip service to the idea that pay should consist of a small fixed element and a potentially large but variable bonus. In that way, costs would fluctuate in line with revenue and profits would be less volatile. But banks are scared that, if they forcibly introduce such flexibility, they will lose their best employees. Rivals have shown themselves ready to offer star brokers and traders fixed-term contracts and guaranteed bonuses. A reduction in the capital employed in the industry would be an even better way of boosting profits. Bankers complain that margins in formerly lucrative markets such as derivatives have been squeezed as competition has hotted up. Prospects would improve if weaker groups such as Kidder Peabody were driven from the industry. The problem is that, for every Kidder, there is a deep-pocketed commercial bank keen to expand its investment banking presence. Banks therefore seem left with the option of crossing their fingers and hoping for markets to recover. But if the structural problems are not dealt with now, they will return to haunt them in the next downturn.</p>

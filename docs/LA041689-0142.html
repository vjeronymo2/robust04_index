			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ITALY OKS SABBATH OFF FOR JEWS  </P> <P> Italian Jews were allowed to take Saturday off under a decree by the Interior  Ministry recognizing Jewish religious holidays.  </P> <P> The decree, published Thursday, says Jews who work in the public or private  sector as well as those in the military and civil service do not have to work  on their religious holidays.  </P> <P> Jews who take Saturday off will in most cases have to work on Sunday or put in  extra hours on other days.  </P> <P> Many Italians employed in the public sector work a six-day week that includes  Saturday morning.  </P> <P> The decree also instructs schools to keep in mind the Jewish Sabbath when  scheduling examinations since Jewish students do not have to attend classes on  Saturday.  </P> <P> The decree was the result of talks between the Italian government and the  country's Jewish community.  </P> <P> There are about 40,000 Jews in Italy, where the population of about 57 million  is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.  </P></p>

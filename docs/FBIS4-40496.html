			<p>BFN     [Text] On 16 June in Tashkent a joint sitting of the  Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet of the Republic was  held. It was chaired by Uzbek President Islam Karimov. The  introduction of the national currency, replenishing the home  consumer market with necessary goods, strengthening the export  potential of the enterprises in the Republic, and the new system  of state and social protection of families with children were  discussed. The president said the main prerequisite for  establishing an independent state, providing for the welfare and  [word indistinct] of the people is the creation of a highly  developed and independent economy. The main aim of the current  economic reforms being carried out in the Republic is directed  at this. An independent economy requires that the country has  its own currency with a high purchasing power and credibility.    The national currency, like the flag, the hymn, and the  constitution, is one of the symbols of the state and the people  and is a sacred symbol of independence. We prepared ourselves a  long time ago for introducing the unit of national currency.  Our specialists carefully studied the experiences of foreign  countries and CIS countries in this field. During the first  phase the sum-coupons will be circulated along with this  national currency, and we have gained sufficient experience in  this area and carried out necessary checks. With the help of an  intermediate currency we tackled a number of financial tasks,  and now the time has come for the full national currency, said  the president. It is well known that one cannot fulfill great  aims only with the introduction of a new currency. It is,  therefore, necessary to start preparing now for increasing the  purchasing power of our currency and provide it with credibility  at world standards. This demands that we replenish the consumer  market and ensure the priority of exports over imports. This  requires sharp increases abroad in the sale of goods produced in  the Republic. A mechanism for a finance and credit policy in  the country, reliable social protection for the needy,  particularly families with children, is necessary for the  country.    At the session Mullojonov, chairman of the directorate of  the  Central Bank; Deputy Prime Ministers Usmonv and Sultanov; and  [name indistinct], first deputy minister for labor, talked about  the issues in question. The order and time of transfer to the  national currency, the government measures to be taken in  relation to this, the new structure of the state, and social  protection of families with children were discussed in detail.  There is an old saying that the humanity of any state and the  spirit of the community comes from respect for women and  children, said the president. Improving the structure of the  social protection of families with children, aimed at their  material support, is of great importance. In essence, a child  up to 16 years old will be under the care of the state. The  budget's contributions to this will be increased many fold.    In conclusion, the president noted that independent  Uzbekistan is on verge of a taking a great step. We are taking  another big step on the path to economic independence and will  have our own currency. This is also a great step. We should  fully understand that our national currency is like a newborn  child of which we should be proud and at the same time take good  care of it and protect it. We all must work for increasing the  value and the purchasing power of our sum. Prime Minister  Mutalov; Bugrov, deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet; chairmen  of the committees of the Supreme Soviet; and deputy prime  ministers and heads of corresponding ministries, departments,  organizations, and banking institutions participated in this  session.</p>

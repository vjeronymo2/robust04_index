			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Are there significant signs of recovery?: Weak economy reins back rising pound; Manufacturers sceptical of 'green shoots'; Jobs agency chief is optimistic MORE than two years into its longest recession since the 1930s, a weary Britain is sensing that better times might be near, Peter Marsh writes. But any upturn is almost certain to be modest. Cautious optimism is abroad in the City and industry because several economic indicators in recent weeks have pointed to a recovery of sorts. Few observers are being upbeat, however. The Treasury, which has predicted an imminent upturn several times during the past two years, is notably cautious, saying only that 'conditions for recovery' are in place. There have been several encouraging developments. M0, the narrow measure of the money supply, which mainly comprises notes and coins in circulation and is a good indicator of consumer demand, grew by 3 per cent in the year to November. Retail sales volumes expanded by 0.9 per cent in the three months to the end of October, underlining the resilience of shop spending. Import volumes have grown, there are signs that the housing market may be picking up slowly and some job agencies are reporting increased demand for office workers. Against those positive factors, industry order books are still thin, consumer confidence has yet to show much sign of an uplift and projected growth in unemployment to more than 3m over the next year is likely to damp confidence for the foreseeable future. Here FT reporters examine the main sectors of the economy for signs of the long awaited recovery. MANUFACTURERS remain highly sceptical about the prospects for any significant recovery next year, in spite of patchy evidence of some recent improvement in trading. Companies are emphasising that any recovery in business will start from extremely low activity levels - with many manufacturers still recording output running as low as 30 per cent of capacity. The Engineering Employers' Federation said it saw signs that output would begin to increase slowly from the beginning of 1993, but only in the vehicle and electrical and instrument engineering sectors. Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, the industrial conglomerate, said: 'We expect tighter margins in the UK for 1993 than in most of 1992.' Lord Weinstock, managing director of GEC, the electrical engineering group, said he was deeply cautious over the outlook for next year. Mr Duncan Allen, managing director of Compair Broomwade, the industrial compressor manufacturer, said vital export markets had picked up significantly since the pound's devaluation. Housing House sales have picked up during the past fortnight, according to some of the country's biggest builders and mortgage lenders. But the industry feels that might merely show a transitory improvement after one of the worst autumn selling seasons in memory. Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, Britain's second-largest house builder, said: 'I would like to believe this was the beginning of a more sustained recovery, but it is far too early to be talking of an improvement.' Halifax Building Society, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, noticed a slight increase in sales during the last week of November. The society reported that house prices, assisted by the late surge in sales, increased on average by 0.1 per cent last month, the first monthly increase recorded by the society since June. But Nationwide, Britain's second-largest society, reported a 2 per cent fall in prices last month. Retailers Retailers are concerned that Thursday's bombings in Manchester were the start of an IRA campaign targeting shopping areas, which might further depress the sector. Mr Liam Strong, chief executive of the Sears retail group, said demand was flat. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, the electrical retailer, was more optimistic. 'The high streets are bustling and it looks like Christmas will come this year,' he said. John Lewis Partnership, the department store chain, said sales were better in the final week of November than in previous weeks, but were still 1.3 per cent down on the same period last year, while food sales were 1.7 per cent down. The company said: 'As far as we are concerned, the jury is still out on (the degree to which sales will rise) this Christmas.' Food and drink Among the big brewers, few signs of economic recovery were apparent. Mr Ian Prosser, chairman of Bass, said: 'Emotionally, I feel more confident; but, having said that, trading conditions are still extremely difficult and there is no real evidence of any recovery.' Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, said: 'At present, evidence of early economic recovery is sparse.' Transport The transport sector provides a picture of almost unremitting gloom, with demand for goods and passenger services at best bumping along the bottom, and operators seeing little prospect of an upturn. Mr Chris Green, managing director of British Rail's InterCity sector, said demand in his part of the rail business was 'absolutely flat', although things were not getting any worse. The Freight Transport Association, the trade body for freight carriers, said confidence among members was patchy to non-existent. Almost the only operators expecting to increase fleet sizes next year were those in food retailing. Jobs agencies Although unemployment will continue rising well after the upturn has begun, the jobs market provides useful clues to recovery. There are some grounds for optimism. Some evidence exists that demand for temporary staff is picking up strongly. Mr Alec Reed, chairman of Reed Personnel Services, was one of the first to predict the downturn in 1988. 'Now, I am pleased to say that I can confirm that recovery is under way,' he said yesterday. Mrs Lillian Bennett, chairman of the employment agency Manpower UK, is more circumspect but also sees some signs of recovery. 'There has been some increase in demand over the past few weeks but it may be partly seasonal,' she said. Information technology Few companies in the industry see many signs of improvement. Mr John Gardner, managing director of UK operations at computer maker ICL, said: 'The UK market for information technology is flat and there is no sign of growth.' Meanwhile, the picture in the semiconductor industry is mixed. Manufacturers supplying memory chips and microprocessors to the computer industry are experiencing a strong pick-up in demand. Mr Ernie Pusey, sales and marketing director of GEC Plessey Semiconductors, which concentrates on telecommunications and military markets, said: 'Business in the UK is still in the doldrums.' Advertising The advertising world is still in a deep recession in spite of a short-lived burst of increased spending by advertisers immediately after the election. Industry estimates suggest that television advertising revenues this quarter will be down by at least 5 per cent in real terms against the same period for 1991. Immediate prospects for 1993 are that advertising expenditure (in real terms) generally will be no higher, and perhaps lower, than this year. Property The industry is shell-shocked, with confidence at a low ebb. Tenant demand continues to be weak and rents are still falling, as might be expected in an industry that traditionally trails the rest of the economy. 'Tenants are still in the driving seat,' says Mr Richard Guignard, managing director of Greycoat, a London-based property developer. The slide in rental values, which was largely confined to London and the south-east until the start of this year, has spread to northern England and Scotland. Industrial property, which had been relatively resilient in the downturn, has suffered a particularly sharp decline. Landlords report that an increasing number of tenants have asked to defer or reduce their rent payments. Leisure In spite of the recession, bingo clubs are flourishing. The number of club licences has risen this year for the first time for nearly 20 years, attendances are up by 2 per cent and the average amount staked has increasing steadily to over Pounds 660m a year. Mr Mike Robinson, managing director of Top Rank, a big bingo operator, said: 'People in such difficult times still want to have a night out where they can forget their immediate worries.' In book publishing, the industry has been in the doldrums for two years, and there are conflicting views as to whether 1993 will see an improvement. Meanwhile, holiday companies report that demand has remained reasonably resilient. Thomson, the UK's biggest travel company, said it had sold almost all its Christmas holidays. Hotels and travel There are few indications that the sector is starting to hum. Forte, the UK's biggest hotelier and a large restaurant operator, said: 'There are no significant signs of an upturn.' Luxury goods Hope springs eternal in this sector. Truffles and champagne will be fashionable in the 1990s as consumers shake off the recession gloom and look for new ways of spending money, according to suppliers of such items. After very poor results last year, sales of luxury items seem to have picked up again at the end of the spring. Harrods, the London department store, said sales of luxury items had shown very good results this year and had in general fared better than overall sales. Insolvency practitioners A boom sector during the recession; and unfortunately for much of the rest of industry, the trend of increased activity shows little sign of ending. Few insolvency practitioners believe business is about to decline. In the year to April, the fee income of the insolvency departments of the leading 10 firms in the sector was more than Pounds 300m, at a time when audit and other work has been suffering, with many of their clients in decline. Mr Mark Homan, head of insolvency at Price Waterhouse, says 'We are the surgeons of the commercial world rather than the undertakers.'</p>

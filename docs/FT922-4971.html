			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / A Guide to the Rio Maze WHAT is the Earth Summit? A UN-sponsored gathering of 185 countries to address the world's growing environmental problems, many of which now have global rather than national ramifications. It will last 12 days. For the first 10 days officials will negotiate, and on the last two more than 100 heads of state and government will attend the formal signing ceremony. Is it just about the environment? Its official name is the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED). The inclusion of word development emphasises the close links between the two issues. What is it supposed to achieve? High ideals have been steadily whittled down by compromise during preparations. The summit was supposed to approve several international treaties to clean the atmosphere and protect the world's plant and animal species. But these have been so reduced that many people have denounced it as a waste of time, among them Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner. So what will actually happen? There are two draft treaties on the negotiating table. One addresses threats to the climate from greenhouse gases. This will commit signatories to formulating plans for reducing their carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Originally it was supposed to place a binding obligation on countries to achieve these targets. Softer wording was insisted on by the US, which is opposed to over-strict regulation. The treaty also provides for wealthy countries to help poorer nations. The second treaty aims to protect the planet's biological diversity. It obliges signa-tories to take steps to preserve plant and animal life but also gives them the right to exploit them. The tension between these two conflicting aims has made the draft difficult to negotiate, and its provisions are not as tough as many hoped. However, the US announced that it would not sign even this watered down version of the treaty, and other industrialised nations have expressed doubts. Generally the countries with the greatest biological diversity are third world countries which are mainly interested in obtaining the technology to exploit it. This has raised further issues, such as protection of rights to this technology and the extent to which rich countries will help the poor gain access to it. There was to have been a third treaty on protection of forests, but this was dropped because third world countries objected to being told not to cut down trees which were essential to their economies. The intention now is to have a legally non-binding declaration of principles, but this is also proving hard to negotiate, showing that preservation of the rain forests is probably the toughest issue on the Rio agenda. Anything else? The summit will also try to approve Agenda 21, an 800-page plan to clean up the environment. This will address issues such as water, forests and land, but will also deal with poverty, and even women's rights (for which read the thorny question of population control) and the role of children. Although three quarters of this plan has been approved in the preparatory meetings, the remaining quarter still promises tough bargaining. If everyone agrees the environment is under threat, why is agreement at the summit proving so difficult? Countries have sharply differing perceptions about what should be done. Most of them want a cleaner world, provided someone else makes the sacrifice. It comes down to where you strike the balance between economic growth and protecting the environment. Industrial countries tend towards the green view, but developing countries see environmental protection as a luxury. Why, then, is President George Bush so cool on the summit? The US administration fears the summit could trigger a stifling wave of environmental regulation, and land rich countries with heavy commitments to aid the poor in the name of the environment. Mr Bush also wants to protect trade and the patent rights of US companies. We hear a lot about sustainable development. What is that? It is the economic theory which argues that the world must grow in such a way as to leave its resources unimpaired for future generations. It sounds good in theory but is difficult in practice because growth consumes resources almost by definition. Critics also say it is more important to deal with today's pressing problems, particularly poverty, than worry about trees for one's grandchildren. What is likely to come of it all? The key point will be what sort of machinery the summit sets in motion to hold participants to the pledges they make. People stress that Rio is the beginning of a process, not the end. How quickly will it happen? Some participants are looking for kick-start measures to implement Rio decisions quickly. But, more likely, the event will make little difference to people's day-to-day lives. In the longer run, though, it could create pressures on governments which would lead to far-reaching changes. What will the clean-up cost and who will pay? The UN has estimated that the global clean-up will cost more than Dollars 600bn (Pounds 333.3bn) a year, Dollars 125bn of which would be in the form of aid from rich countries to help the poor. Most third world countries are looking for big promises of aid in Rio, but the industrial countries insist there will be 'no pledges'.</p>

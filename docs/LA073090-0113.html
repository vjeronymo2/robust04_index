			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> TEENS KILL GRANDMA ON BIRTHDAY  </P> <P> Two Belgian teen-agers murdered their grandmother on her birthday -- but it  took them several attempts to do so, police said today.  </P> <P> They first gave Solange Deval a present of chocolate eclairs laced with Valium,  but she did not die.  </P> <P> They then forced the 62-year-old woman to inhale tear gas from a small canister  used by women to fend off attackers. But again she did not die.  </P> <P> They finally killed her when they knocked her out with chloroform, beat her  with a broom handle and strangled her, a police spokesman said.  </P> <P> Gravedigger Frans Mahau, the father of the pair, had confessed under  questioning to plotting with his children to murder Deval at her home in the  southern town of Charleroi on July 21, the spokesman said. "This was a family  plot of the most macabre kind," he added.  </P> <P> e10116  </P></p>

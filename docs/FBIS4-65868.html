			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Robert Shrimsley: "Key to Future Lies in Full </F> Integration, Says Ashdown"]    [Text] The Cover of the Liberal Democrat manifesto bears  the slogan "Unlocking Britain's Potential."    Inside, the 28-page document takes a straightforward tone.  Britain could achieve far more if at the heart of a fully  integrated Europe.    It opposes a "centralised superstate," preferring a  streamlined Commission and a strengthened Parliament. The  Council of Ministers would be required to take its decisions in  public and the use of qualified majority voting would be  extended.    Nevertheless, the Lib-Dems are ready to put their views to  the test. If the 1996 inter-governmental conference proposes  significant reforms the party will seek "popular assent for  them." Mr Ashdown said yesterday this meant that if all parties  remained pro-EC he would hold a referendum on any major changes .  <H5>  SOCIAL POLlCY </H5>   The manifesto calls for the scrapping of the Social Charter  opt-out and says the party will try to guarantee equal rights  for women and part-time workers.    It rejects however, an imposed 35-hour week while supporting  greater employee rights.  <H5>  EDUCATION </H5>   It calls for the reskilling of the British workforce by  investing in education.    A pre-school nursery place for every three and four-year-old  and nore spending on books, equipment and school buildings is  pledged. The Lib-Dems promise to fund this with an extra penny  in the pound of income tax.  <H5>  UNEMPLOYMENT </H5>   The party recommends spending in investment and  infrastructure, making full use of European social and regional  funds.    These would be used to generate more private investment in  major capital projects.  <H5>  FINANCE </H5>   The party would back moves towards a single currency. The  Bank of England would become independent, making interest rate  changes, prior to the creation of a European Central Bank. Low  taxes are promised wherever possible.    Local income tax would replace the council tax.  <H5>  ENVIRONMENT </H5>   Green taxes are also favoured -- a Europe-wide carbon/energy  tax should be phased in -- and there should be cross-Continent  initiatives to tackle pollution.  <H5>  COMMON AGRICULTURAL POLICY </H5>   It should be replaced by a "Common Rural Policy," aimed at  sustainability, diversification towards forestry and less  intensive use of land. CAP (Common Agricultural Policy)  payments would be redirected on environmental lines.  <H5>  DEFENCE </H5>   While supporting NATO, the manifesto says Europe should take  more responsibility for its security and for world  peace-keeping.  <H5>  CRIME </H5>   Europe-wide co-operation to tackle the drugs threat is  proposed. The European Convention on Human Rights would be  incorporated into UK law.  <H5>  DECENTRALISATION </H5>   The greater emphasis on Europe is counter-balanced by a  policy of downward decentralisation with measures aimed at  recreating communities and giving more power to local, parish  and neighbourhood councils.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: UAPT says yes to Equifax offer UAPT-Infolink, the British credit reference company, has recommended shareholders to accept the Pounds 51m offer from Equifax after the US credit data group learned that its bid of 650p per share would not be referred to the Monopolies and Merger Commission. UAPT's board had previously recommended a 550p per share offer from Trans Union, Equifax's main competitor in the US, because Trans Union had no UK operations and so did not risk a referral to the MMC. Equifax already owns a credit information business in the UK. However, UAPT's board later rescinded its recommendation, effectively leaving the outcome of the bidding war to the Office of Fair Trading.</p>

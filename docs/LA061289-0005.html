			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Members of the House Ethics Committee, not former Speaker Jim Wright, initiated  an attempt to strike a deal and negotiate his resignation, the Dallas Times  Herald reported. The newspaper reported that sources who asked not to be named  said that Ethics Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon (D-Los Angeles) phoned Rep.  Louis Stokes (D-Ohio), the former ethics chairman, and said that Wright's  resignation would "spare the House a harsh and divisive confrontation." Wright  reportedly authorized negotiations but did not approach the committee to  discuss a deal when it convened later. Wright announced his plans to resign in  a speech May 31.  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Books: Shades of real life - Fiction SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY: THREE TALES by Saul Bellow Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 13.99, 222 pages THE PLAGIARIST by Benjamin Cheever Hamish Hamilton Pounds 9.99, 322 pages TWO VOICES are there: one is of a 77-year-old living novelist, the other of the son of a not-quite-so-famous dead short story writer. The latter, Benjamin Cheever, invites the description because of his inability - as a psychiatrist tells his fictional alter ego - to distinguish between where he begins and his father ends. Because Cheever's novel, The Plagiarist, is his first, it might seem unfair to compare his performance with that of the mature Bellow, but the book has been received with such acclaim in the US that a closer look is needed. In real life Benjamin Cheever is of course the son of the New Yorker writer and New England novelist John Cheever. The hero Arthur of The Plagiarist is the son of Icarus Prentice, a 'famous writer'. He gets a job on a digest magazine where everyone is paid a great deal of money for doing almost nothing. Bored, he writes a story - about a man who has a son called Arthur  -and submits it over his father's name. The turning-point in Arthur's life comes with his confession that his father's 'contribution' is actually his own work. Almost at the same time the cantankerous old man who has ruled his career for so long dies and suddenly a new self-reliant life seems possible. The Plagiarist has a certain winsome charm because of the very nakedness of the autobiographical element. But Cheever fils does not seem to have learnt the first rule of novel-writing - a measure of detachment, even ruthlessness is needed to make what DH Lawrence called 'the one bright book of life' out of intensely personal material. Merely setting down the facts is not enough. By contrast Bellow's story entitled Something To Remember Me By is writing of a high order - although considerably different in tone from the stories which precede it in this volume: A Theft and The Bellarosa Connection, previously published on their own and reviewed here on publication. This new piece is set in the Depression in Chicago. One winter's day, 'armoured in gray ice', Louie, a teenage boy whose mother is dying of cancer, is delivering flowers to a funeral. On his way back he calls at the office of his brother-in-law a dentist, who is not there. He goes to find out whether he is with Marchak the doctor next door and discovers a naked woman on a couch. From her appearance - although he is no expert - Louie suspects that the woman has just had intercourse. Her wrists are wired to a machine and he knows that Marchak is in the habit of getting women off the street to record their reactions to sex. The woman senses that Louie is excited and takes him back to her room where she tells him to take all his clothes off and get under a blanket. When he is undressed she throws his clothes out of the window and disappears after them. Louie rushes to the window and sees an accomplice gathering them up. Louie finds a filthy dress and braves the killing Chicago cold outside dressed as a girl. The local druggist sends him to a speakeasy where he is interrogated by a Greek and persuaded to help a drunk back home to his two little girls. When Louie gets home himself and his father hits him, the blow 'fills him with gratitude'. In a sense, Saul Bellow's story could also be thought of as autobiographical in that he was the same age as his protagonist in February, 1933, and also lived in Chicago. There is also a seemingly personal note to his son: 'I haven't left a large estate, and this is why I have written this memoir, a sort of addition to your legacy.' In this case, however, it does not matter whether the subject-matter is autobiographical or not. The test is that we are not invited at every twist and turn of the story to refer back to Bellow's own life. The style is conversational and personal, reminding us of that tradition of American literature which runs from Mark Twain to Sherwood Anderson. In its theme - the transition from innocence to experience - it is also in the Anderson mould, reminding us of those moving stories 'I Want to Know Why' and 'I'm a Fool'. Although Something To Remember Me By does not have the pyrotechnic brilliance of A Theft and The Bellarosa Connection it is no less impressive.</p>

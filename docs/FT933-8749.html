			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: Johnson &amp; Johnson to shed 3,000 jobs JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON has followed other US healthcare companies in announcing big staff cuts in the face of pressure on drugs prices. The company said this week it expected to shed 3,000 jobs this year, 1,000 of them through voluntary redundancies. The Dollars 200m cost has already been provided for in a reserve set up last year. The compulsory job losses will come through moves to streamline administrative and other functions. However, the company said it had no plans to abandon its decentralised structure, involving 28 operating companies in the US alone. Analysts said the job losses, from a total of 84,000, would have little impact on overall costs. 'If they really want to concentrate on cost-cutting, they will have to look again at their whole philosophy of decentralisation,' said Mr Glenn Reicin, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York. Operating companies will decide for themselves whether to implement the voluntary redundancy plan. All of the voluntary redundancies and most of the compulsory lay-offs will come in the US. Job losses abroad will come from factory closures in France and Brazil, as well as the consolidation of several European medical businesses. Other drugs companies that have announced job losses this year include Warner Lambert and Bristol Myers-Squibb, while Merck recently said that 2,100 had accepted its voluntary redundancy plan.</p>

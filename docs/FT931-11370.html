			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Fleming extends bank charges ROBERT FLEMING Save &amp; Prosper yesterday confirmed that it is to introduce charges for its current account customers even when their accounts are in credit. The bank, which has 50,000 customers, is the first to make such a change. From April 1 there will be a Pounds 5 charge a month on its Classic current account when the balance falls below Pounds 1,000. A charge was previously only made when there was an overdraft.</p>

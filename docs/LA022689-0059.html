			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HELPING LATINO STUDENTS SUCCEED;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA COLLEGE LAUNCHES COMMUNITYWIDE EFFORT  </P> <P> Santa Monica College has launched a drive to increase the number of Latino  students on campus and to offer additional support to help them succeed.  </P> <P> The drive, which started this month, is being run by the college's Hispanic  Students Center which has received nearly $37,000 in school funds this year to  organize a variety of activities, including mentor programs, cultural events,  field trips and essay contests.  </P> <P> "The idea is to take a more active roll in trying to increase the success rates  of Hispanic students in higher education," said Rocky Young, the college's  assistant superintendent of education.  </P> <P> School officials said that Latinos account for 11.7% of the college's 22,000  students while the population of Los Angeles County is 35% Latino.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Role Models  </P> <P> To attract more Latino students, school officials said they are doing a more  effective job of selling the two-year college by meeting with students on a  regular basis at local high schools.  </P> <P> The college also plans to hold a series of workshops to give Latino students  from Santa Monica, Fairfax, Los Angeles and Venice high schools a taste of  college life. The young recruits will be taken on tours of the campus by Latino  college students serving as role models.  </P> <P> "The lack of role models has always been a big problem for many Hispanic  students," said John Gonzalez, a college counselor who was recently named  director of the Hispanic Student Center. "We will match the high school  students with college students who will be able to give first-hand experience  of the college. It will expose them to college life."  </P> <P> The educational workshops and other programs are needed to combat the serious  dropout problem in the Latino community, said Maria Martinez, a 22-year-old  student and vice president of the college's Club Latin United for Education.  </P> <P> "There is a real problem in the high schools -- students are dropping out like  flies," she said. "The (role model) program would certainly help. I would like  to encourage others to continue in school."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Turning Point  </P> <P> The new series of programs at Santa Monica College marks a turning point for  the Hispanic Student Center, a five-year-old group run by the counseling office  which has sponsored cultural events on campus. Gonzalez said the center will  have its own office and staff when the college's new student center is  completed later this year.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Gonzalez said he has been meeting with Latino student groups  trying to enlist more support. One plan would encourage instructors and members  of the staff to become mentors for some of the college students, helping to  guide their careers. "The college should take a more active role in encouraging  this type of relationship between its instructors and staff," he said.  </P> <P> Another proposal calls for workshops for Latino college students on financial  aid, career guidance, job interviews and four-year university transfers. The  center is also planning to sponsor a week in May celebrating the ethnic  diversity of all the students on campus, and a Cinco de Mayo essay contest with  cash prizes.  </P> <P> "It's a dual role of attracting students and then motivating them to explore  all the options open to them," he said.  </P></p>

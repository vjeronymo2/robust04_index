			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Union discovers vote discrepancies AN INITIAL internal inquiry by the Association of University Teachers into the recent election of its general secretary has uncovered discrepancies, the union has told the government's Certification Office. Mr Alan Waton, AUT president, says in a letter to the office that a number of significant differences had been found in eight local associations between 'the number of members paying dues last September and the number of labels received in the general secretary and recent officer elections'. He added: 'We have immediately put in hand investigations to ascertain the reasons for these differences.' The inquiry follows a formal complaint from Dr Peter Borchards who was defeated by Mr David Triesman, the executive's preferred candidate, by 7,088 votes to 6,812 for the top post in the union in the postal ballot in December. A final report on the election is to be made to the AUT executive on July 2.</p>

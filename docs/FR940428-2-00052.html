An Amendment to that application was filed on November 8, 1993. To facilitate the transportation of gas to these new markets, Mojave's application also proposed to expand Mojave's existing mainline through the addition of looping and compression. Mojave requested the Commission to issue a certificate prior to April, 1, 1994, in order to meet a projected in-service date of April 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its initial application, Mojave submitted for Commission review two alternative designs for the Northward Expansion facilities. Under the first alternative, ``Case 1'', Mojave proposed to construct a 475 Mmcf/d expansion on a stand-alone basis, requiring the construction of new mainline and related facilities and additional looping on Mojave's existing facilities, as well as a number of additional meter stations. Under the second alternative, ``Case 2'', Mojave's proposed 475 Mmcf/d expansion would be built in conjunction with a proposed 475 Mmcf/d expansion would be built in conjunction with a proposed expansion by Kern River Gas Transmission Company (``Kern River'') of 452 Mmcf/d. Kern River's proposal is currently pending at Docket No. CP92&hyph;198&hyph;000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mojave states that the Amendment has two purposes. One is to identify 29 minor route modifications to the previously-proposed Cases 1 and 2 that more specifically address environmental, cultural resource, engineering and/or right-of-way matters. Mojave also states that 24 of these alternates constitute route revisions of approximately 1000 feet or less and affect, in total, approximately 47.3 miles of its proposed pipeline route and do not result in changes to the previously-filed cost estimate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mojave states that the second purpose is to present to the Commission for review, two alternative project designs (Case 3 and Case 4) that incorporate recent developments in the Northern and Central California markets to be served by the Northern Expansion. Mojave indicates that Case 3 consists 635.1 miles of pipeline of various diameters, related facilities and 103,228 horsepower of compression at an estimated cost of $488,084,000 dollars while Case 4 consists of 679 miles of pipeline of various diameters, related facilities and 92,728 horsepower of compression at and estimated cost of $494,907,000 dollars. Cases 3 and 4 do not supersede the previously-filed alternation project designs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should, on or before May 5, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a protest or motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of Rule 211 or 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214) and the Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

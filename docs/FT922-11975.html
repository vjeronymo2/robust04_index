			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Company News: Amoco posts 52% first-quarter fall AMOCO, one of the leading US oil companies, yesterday reported a 52 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings due to lower crude oil and natural gas prices and squeezed downstream margins. The Chicago-based group reported earnings of Dollars 234m, or 47 cents a share, compared with Dollars 492m, or 98 cents, in the same period last year. Revenues fell to Dollars 6.4bn from Dollars 7.3bn. The figures were helped by a Dollars 67m tax benefit and Dollars 20m due to early debt retirement, partly offset by a Dollars 39m Norwegian tax charge. Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman, said: 'The earnings decline reflects lower crude oil and natural gas prices and continued weak margins and sales volumes for chemicals and lower margins for refining, marketing and transportation.' The company, which previously announced a capital and exploration budget of Dollars 3.7bn for the year, said it was re-evaluating this in view of the 'current adverse economic conditions affecting the industry'. Domestic exploration and production earnings of Dollars 145m were down 33 per cent, while foreign activities incurred an Dollars 11m loss, compared with earnings of Dollars 95m. Refining, marketing and transport made Dollars 65m, down from Dollars 214m, while chemicals earned Dollars 35m, compared with Dollars 83m.</p>

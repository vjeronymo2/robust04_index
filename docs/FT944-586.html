			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Outdoors: A Volvo snow ride - Motoring It was proper Father Christmas country. The firs and birches hung heavily with hoar frost. The surface was snow that had packed down into rutted ice. In the day-long Arctic twilight, the main problem was deciding where the snowbanks ended and the road began. The big estate car I was driving through Sweden felt re-assuringly sure-footed and could be persuaded easily to take bends sideways in a spectacular-looking, but entirely controllable, four-wheel drift. It was Volvo's latest 2.5-litre, six-cylinder 960 with five-speed manual transmission, studded tyres, and a differential that locks automatically when the rear wheels spin at low speeds on ice. As I flung it around, I wondered what the average Volvo estate owner in Britain would make of it all. Volvo estates are esteemed in the UK as family hold-alls ideal for school runs and camping holidays - and by antique dealers as the nearest thing to a van that is still a most comfortable car. Motoring magazines - read mainly by enthusiasts who judge all cars by their 0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration times - have poured scorn on the traditional, rear-wheel driven Volvos. They are dismissed as unwieldy, boring machines bought by the status-conscious and safety-obsessed. I have never gone along with this. In the past 20 years, I have driven Volvos extensively, from the 240 version onwards. Some trips involved three-day, mid-winter journeys from the Gulf of Bothnia to Bodo in northern Norway, or from southern Sweden to Kiruna, near Murmansk. Others were in Britain, where the year-round hazards of heavy traffic are different. In Arctic Scandinavia, you must keep your eyes peeled for reindeer emerging from the forests and the flashing amber lights of a distant snow-plough. Until the front-wheel driven 850 came along recently, Volvo cars have had rear-wheel drive only - certainly, never four-wheel drive. In Britain, many believe that front-wheel drive, with the engine's weight increasing traction, is better for driving on snow and that, for serious snow of more than an inch or two, four-wheel drive is essential. Volvo disagrees. It says four-wheel drive has become a fad in the past decade and that, in any case, it does not guarantee that a car will be free from wheel-spin. To be totally effective, a 4x4 car must have locking or power-distributing differentials on both axles. According to Volvo, four-wheel drive justifies its extra weight, cost and complication only when a car has to force its way over difficult terrain, or has a very high power-to-weight ratio. Not having four-wheel drive in its technological armoury, there could be an touch of special pleading in this. But any 4x4 owner who has tried to get going on slightly sloping wet grass or black ice will know what the company means. The answer to safe driving on snow and ice is three-fold: the right kind of tyres - ideally, fitted with studs; anti-lock brakes; and a differential that locks on a rear-drive car, or allocates the engine power to the wheel with most grip on a front-drive car. (Locking the differential on a front-drive car would cause severe steering problems). Winter tyres with treads that stay grippy at low temperatures are even better when fitted with 100 or more studs which actually dig into the top millimetre of an icy surface. The trouble is, they also dig into tarmac or concrete and wear out roads. For this reason, Germany banned them years ago. If you know you will be driving on snow for half the year, you fit a set of studded tyres in October and hope to be able to take them off in April. This would be a pointless expense in Britain where unstudded, all-season tyres such as the Goodyear Vector, Vredestein Snowstar or Semperit Top-Grip SLG are the best option; they combine the virtues of winter and summer tyres. Before having fun on the closed tracks of the Arctic Driving Centre, I drove one of Volvo's latest three-litre 960 saloons for 200km on roads that had been snow-ploughed but otherwise left alone. With a self-locking differential and automatic transmission in winter mode, it started in third gear. Wheel-spin, even when pulling away on a slope, was minimal. As it was the first time I had driven on hard-packed snow for a year, I took no liberties. Not so on the way back from the centre. Having reminded myself how stable and controllable a Volvo on studded tyres could be - even when panic-braked - I drove as I would in a summer-tyred car on wet roads. No, I promise there were no dramatic moments. Just a feeling that Britons who drive Volvos - like most of those who drive Range Rovers - have absolutely no idea how good they really are in the conditions for which they were bred.</p>

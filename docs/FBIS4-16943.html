			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 19/4/1994 -- Andrei Sangheli  strengthened his popularity though his forming of a new ministry  cabinet, reduced at his suggestion, commented alongside the poll  made by "Axa" service and published in the weekly "MOLODEZH  MOLDOVY." The results of the poll show that Premier Sangheli is  preferred by 46 percent and Speaker Petru Lucinschi by 31  percent of respondents. In third place of the poll is situated  Nicolae Andronic, vice-president of the Moldovan Parliament,  preferred by 23 percent of those interviewed. The same poll  also charts the popularity of the Parliamentary factions. The  Democratic Agrarian Party [PDAM] is the most popular, 67 percent  preferred it. The Socialist Party and "Unitate-Edinstvo"  Movement received, respectively, 29 percent and 4 percent. The  unionist forces have a low popularity compared with the  electoral period. This is prompted by an apparent lack of  constructive activity. Until now the right wing opposition  confined itself only to "undivided rejection and tough, emotive  and unfounded attacks against the deputies of the majority  faction," states the commentary in "MOLODEZH MOLDOVY."</p>

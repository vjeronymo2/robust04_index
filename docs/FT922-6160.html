			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Letter: Automatic not for the sensible ecologist Sir, Having commendably recommended diesel engined cars because of their higher fuel efficiency ('Motoring: Diesels for sensible ecologists', May 23), Stuart Marshall's assertion that a car with automatic transmission 'is ideal for the 1990s' is a complete contradiction of what a 'sensible ecologist' should go for. It has long been known that automatic transmission consumes 7 to 8 per cent more power than a car with manual exchange. Unless there is some health or medical reason for saving the driver the minute effort of using a gear lever, surely the great majority of drivers at all interested in saving the environment from unnecessary pollution and in minimising consumption of irreplaceable fuel should avoid this expensive and unnecessary luxury. Using, say, a pint of fuel per hour to obviate such a very slight personal effort seems to me to be nothing short of an ecological crime.

A report by the state media in Luanda on 17 January said  that the state bank did not have the money to honor public  service salaries.    That rather senseless report came as a shock to the various  state departments and is already causing much resentment among  public service workers, who have threatened to go on strike  without notice should the matter not be urgently resolved.    Meanwhile, reports from Luanda say that delays in the  payment  of salaries or, simply, the decreasing buying power of salaries,  have been the cause for many public service protests, including  a strike by the workers with the Luanda Identification Archives  and the threat of strike by Lobito Harbor workers.

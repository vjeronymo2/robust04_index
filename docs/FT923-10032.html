			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' transactions AT LAST, directors are showing their true form. With the market seemingly in inexorable retreat, a surge of buying by directors was long overdue. In the week of July 20-24, it duly arrived - in emphatic fashion. Sir Anthony Bamford, of the privately owned JCB Group, has long been a fan of Tarmac. As a non-executive director, he has been buying shares since last October when he paid 160p. His latest purchase, at just 70p, comes after a period of considerable uncertainty for the building materials' sector. John Haggas, the textile group, appears to have emerged from recession rather earlier than most manufacturing companies. In July 1991, finance director Martin Scriven and Steven Barker bought shares at 58p. The same two have been buying again, this time paying between 104-106p.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          No of Company                  Sector     Shares   Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BWD Securities            OthF      40,000     22         2 Courts Furnishers         Stor      44,000    143         3* Dencora                   Prop      60,000     65         1 Dunhill                   Stor      15,703     67         1* Headline Book              Med       8,700     16         1 Marling Ind (N Pd)        OthI  11,942,672     60         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alexon                    Stor      30,000     59         2 Ashley (Laura)            Stor      17,900     15         1 Berkeley Group             C&amp;C      60,000    134         2 Christie Group            BuSe      50,000     15         1 Etonbrook Props           Prop      20,000     14         1 General Electric          Elec      17,355     38         3 Haggas John               Text      30,548     32         2 Lyles (S)                 Text      13,300     12         1 Morland &amp; Co              Brew      10,000     45         3 Northn Fine Foods          FdM      89,136     20         5 Property Sec IT           Prop      30,000     25         1 Shaw (Arthur)             BdMa     350,000    157         1 Stirling Group            Text     150,000     46         2 Tarmac                    BdMa     200,000    140         1 Usborne                   FdMa     100,000     16         1 Wheway                    EngG     100,000     14         1 Willis Corroon            InsB       8,150     17         2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

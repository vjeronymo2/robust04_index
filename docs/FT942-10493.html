			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Markets Report: Exchanges ponder dollar Foreign exchanges spent yesterday in fruitless anticipation of a tightening of US monetary policy that never arrived, writes Philip Gawith. The weakness of the dollar last week, combined with stronger than expected April jobs growth, has convinced the market that it is a question of when, rather than if, the US Federal Reserve raises rates again. Many had expected a move yesterday, ahead of the Dollars 29bn quarterly Treasury refunding that takes place today and tomorrow. A weak dollar and unstable US assets markets were seen as obstacles to foreign participation in the refunding. The dollar finished lower in London at DM1.6579 from DM1.6661 but it closed against the yen at Y102.875 from Y102.780. In New York it ended at DM1.6540 and Y102.85. Elsewhere, sterling failed to gain any support from strong April credit figures, and slid lower against the background of political uncertainty. It closed in London at DM2.4801 from DM2.4859. In Europe, the D-Mark finished mostly weaker. It closed in London at FFr3.427 against the French franc from Friday's FFr3.429. Against the Italian lira it was down to L958.9 from L961. The release of Japan's March capital account figures shed considerable light on recent dollar weakness. The Dollars 21.92bn capital surplus was the highest on record. The Ministry of Finance said it was the result of Japanese companies selling US and European bonds ahead of the March year-end, as well as foreign buying of Japanese stocks which hit a record high in March. Combined with a large current account surplus, this provides a key explanation for recent yen strength - although figures for March show a 16 per cent fall from a year earlier in the current account surplus. If the capital account figure proves to be a one-off phenomenon, as some analysts are suggesting, and the current account surplus falls in the second half of the year, the combination could prompt the revival of the dollar against the yen. Analysts said the failure of the Fed to act yesterday merely meant that the market would continue each day to await a move, expected at the latest after next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. What the market is hoping for from the Fed is that it will act sufficiently boldly so as to be able to declare that rates have reached the 'neutral' level. This should stabilise asset markets as it will allow investors to re-enter equity and bond markets without the fear of another policy tightening hanging over them. Some clarity will emerge today on what sort of succour the dollar can expect from the Bundesbank. Decisive confirmation that German rates are on a downward path is seen as one way of supporting the US currency. The Bundesbank will announce the terms of its weekly repo operations. Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Midland Global Markets, is expecting a 4 to 6 basis-point cut in the repo rate from its current 5.41 per cent. Call money yesterday was trading at 5.35/50 per cent, which suggests a fairly small reduction is likely. There has also been speculation that the Bundesbank might lower its discount rate when the council meets on Wednesday. Ms Cottrell said that, on balance, she did not expect a move. The spread currently between the discount and repo rate is standard, and will not complicate money management. Sterling started the day weaker with the exchange rate index opening at 79.2 compared to Friday's close of 79.5. Analysts said the pound's opening level of DM2.4750 was the lowest this year. Analysts attributed sterling's weak performance to a delayed reaction to the Conservative's poor showing in last week's local elections, aggravated by negative weekend press coverage. Mr Mark Geddes, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, commented: 'On the basis of recent economic data, which has almost uniformly been stronger than expected, the pound should be significantly stronger. In spite of this, the extent of Tory party losses do now, however, tend to rule out a significant rally in sterling over the coming month as political considerations continue to dominate.' In the money markets, the Bank of England provided Pounds 360m of assistance after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 350m. The overnight rate traded in a 3 1/2 to 5 1/16 per cent range. Sentiment soured in the sterling futures market, with contracts losing ground across the board. In light trade, the June future closed at 94.56, from 94.59 on Saturday. The December contract fell 10 basis points to 93.66. Mr Brian Durrant, head of research at brokers GNI, commented: 'Although the market is in principle oversold, there is nothing for buyers to bite on.' Buoyant consumer credit figures failed to help sterling, or interest-rate markets. The Central Statistical Office (CSO) reported March net consumer credit up Pounds 516m, ahead of market forecasts of about Pounds 350m.  ---------------------------------------------------           POUND IN NEW YORK  --------------------------------------------------- May 9       ---Close---    ---Prev.

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SPLASH II;  </P> <P> STAGE  </P> <P> Three playwrights who have been known to surprise us before will be launching  the uncommonly busy theatrical summer: Irishman Brian Friel, whose  "Aristocrats," a Chekhovian tale of landed gentry falling from grace in County  Donegal, opens Thursday at the Mark Taper Forum; American David Mamet, whose  comic Hollywood horror story, "Speed-the-Plow," opens June 8 at South Coast  Repertory, and Caribbean poet-playwright Derek Walcott, whose new piece, "Viva  Detroit!," kicks off June 9 at the Los Angeles Theatre Center.  </P> <P> All three plays are new to Southern California, which can also look forward to  another new play at the Taper: David Feldshuh's "Miss Evers' Boys" (July 19), a  piece about medical prejudice in 1932 Alabama that finds resonance in the  current AIDS crisis. And Neil Simon's farce,"Rumors," coming to the Doolittle  July 12.  </P> <P> In addition, the Los Angeles Theatre Center, which likes to mix it up between  classics and contemporary work, is offering Ibsen's "The Wild Duck" beginning  July 11. It will be staged by an iconoclast who should know his Ibsen: Stein  Winge, artistic director of Oslo's National Theatre.  </P> <P> "August 29" (on Aug. 28), a piece commemorating the death of Times reporter  Ruben Salazar in an East Los Angeles police action in 1970, will cut close to  home. It is being developed by LATC's Latino Lab.  </P> <P> Another potential notable: The L.A. Theatre Works production of "The Love of a  Nightingale" by expatriate American Timberlake Wertenbaker. The show, to be  staged at the Santa Monica Museum of Art starting June 15, played the Royal  Shakespeare Company last year and is described as an expose of the violence  that stems from silence based on the Greek myth of Philomel.  </P> <P> To the south, Lloyd Richards will stage Lee Blessing's "Cobb," on the life of  hated and celebrated ball player Ty Cobb, for the San Diego Old Globe (June  28), which is also presenting Stephen Metcalfe's new play about male bonding,  "White Man Dancing" (July 3), and a new "Hamlet" (Aug. 30), starring Campbell  Scott, son of actors George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst.  </P> <P> At the La Jolla Playhouse, two good bets may be Keith Reddin's surreal comedy  about locking people in (and out) "Life During Wartime" (opening June 24) and  Athol Fugard's newest play about his racially torn South Africa, "My Children!  My Africa!," which opens Aug. 28, with Fugard directing.  </P> <P> Off the beaten track: Look for the June 22 opening at LATC of a group of Latino  satirists called, appropriately enough, "Culture Clash." Japan's Grand Kabuki  will play the Orange County Performing Arts Center (June 30-July 1) and the  Japan America Theatre (July 3-4). And "Dear Yelena Sergeevna" will open at Cal  State Dominguez Hills on June 29. This is a production from Moscow's Mossoviet  Theater of a politically touchy play by Ludmila Rasumovskaya that was banned  for years in the Soviet Union. Performed in Russian (with a detailed synopsis  in English), it was seen in Atlanta last year and is recommended.  </P> <P> Among the shows already running that will be around for at least part of the  summer, we recommend you check out the luminous "Cherry Orchard" at the La  Jolla Playhouse or A. R. Gurney's brittle "The Cocktail Hour" at the Doolittle  Theatre. And for pure unpretentious  </P></p>

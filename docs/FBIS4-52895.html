			<p>BFN     [Text] President Ramos yesterday issued Proclamation No.  377 disqualifying from the presidential amnesty military and  police personnel who committed "serious human rights violations,  including extralegal executions during counterinsurgency  operations."    Earlier, the president issued Proclamation 347 and 348  ushering in the second round of amnesty to be granted under his  regime. These proclamations are currently pending Congressional  seal of approval even as government negotiations with rebels are  on-going.    Under the new proclamation, the grant of amnesty to  personnel  of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine  National Police (PNP) is preconditioned on the fact that their  acts do not constitute "serious human rights violations" such as  acts of rape, torture, extralegal execution, arson, massacre,  other crimes against chastity or robbery of any form.    The proclamation amends Section 1 of Proclamation 348 which  grants amnesty to certain AFP of PNP personnel "who have  committed certain acts or omissions punishable under the Revised  Penal Code, the Articles of War, or other Special Laws in  furtherance of, incident to or in connection with  counter-insurgency operations."    Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon backed  yesterday  the Philippine National Police's continued detention of Wilma  Tiamzon, secretary general of the Communist Party of the  Philippines, despite the Bulacan provincial fiscal's dismissal  of the illegal possession of firearms charge against her.    Mr. Drilon said Ms. Tiamzon is still facing a kidnapping and  serious illegal detention case pending before a Quezon province  court, noting that the kidnapping charge is a non-bailable  offense. He also said the PNP has appealed to the justice  department on the Bulacan fiscal's dismissal of the illegal gun  possession charge against the communist leader.    "We are going to follow judicial processes," Mr. Drilon  said,  as he suggested Ms. Tiamzon apply for bail if she wants to be  released from detention.    He also said the communist leader can apply for provisional  liberty before the Presidential Committee (PC) on the grant of  bail, pardon and clemency. The PC serves as the forerunner of  the National Amnesty Commission pending the latter's formation.    The PC handles the applications for bail or pardon of those  who are either charged or convicted of non-bailable offenses  like kidnapping.    The Justice Secretary also said if Ms. Tiamzon wants to be  released for humanitarian reasons, a recommendation for such  should come from the PNP.    As to government's pronouncement that it will continue to  make arrests while there is still no substantial progress in the  peace negotiations with leftist rebels, Mr. Drilon said the law  has not been "suspended" and that police agencies must "continue  to enforce the law."    Mr. Ramos downplayed news that the National Democratic Front  (NDF) would back out of the peace talks because of Ms. Tiamzon's  continued detention, stating "so what's new?" during his weekly  press conference. "We have bent over backwards to make sure  that every opportunity to dialogue with government is given to  them," he said.    The President added that despite threats to withdraw from  the  talks, "the door is still open."    In another development, the Department of Interior and Local  Government (DILG) yesterday reported that 21,106 rebel returnees  availed of P [Philippine pesos] 670 million worth of financial  assistance from the National Reconciliation and Development  Program (NRDP) from 1989 to 1992.    This came amidst reports that the funds released by the  NRDP,  now known as the National Program for Unification and  Development Council (NPUDC), were meant as amnesty fund alone.    NPUDC executive director Alberto Bernardo pointed out "the  reported P670 million is not an amnesty fund alone but an  umbrella fund which covers the various activities of the NRDP."    The activities include, among others, the immediate  assistance project, livelihood loan assistance, balik-baril  [return gun] project, livelihood skills training and bayanihan  [mutual aid] resettlement community project.    Mr. Bernardo further said the NRDP did not incur expenses  for  amnesty applications "as these were shouldered by the local  government units, DILG, Philippine National Police, Armed Forces  of the Philippines and Philippine Information Agency."    The NPUDC chief added that the NRDP, in coordination with  the  Department of National Defense, documented 36 cases of forgery  in 1992 and 1993 resulting in savings of P68.8 million.    In this connection, six fake rebel groups were arrested by  the PNP Criminal Investigation Service Command and four forged  checks amounting to almost P130,000.00 were recovered by the  NRDP.</p>

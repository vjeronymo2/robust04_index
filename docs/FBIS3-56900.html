			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Two days after a bloody attack, Crimean People's  Deputy Iskandr Mamedov has died after having not regained  consciousness. Mamedov had been the organizer of Mikola Bahrov's  presidential election campaign in the Crimea.    As we have already reported, as the result of a terrorist  attack -- in which still-unidentified assailants opened fire on  Mamedov's house -- 11 people, including two of Mamedov's  children, were wounded, two people were killed, and Mamedov was  taken to the emergency room of a local hospital in extremely  critical condition. Surgeons removed several bullets and grenade  fragments from his body, which he had tried to use as shield to  protect his children. Surgeons did everything possible, but, to  our great regret, neither two operations nor modern methods of  treatment could bring this kind and talented man -- the father  of seven children -- back to life.    Ukrainian Radio expresses its sincere sympathy to the family  and friends of the deceased.</p>

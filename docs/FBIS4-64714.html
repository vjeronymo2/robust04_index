			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi by </F> Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "Berlusconi: `I Will  Continue Alone'" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [Prime Minister-Designate] Berlusconi at  the head of a "totalitarian government?" "Not every accusation  deserves an answer," says the prime minister-designate in this  interview with IL GIORNALE in reference to the accusations made  by [Northern League Secretary] Bossi. "Rather, I would say that  these accusations are totally unfounded and certainly deserve to  fall on deaf ears."    [Guiglia] Do you feel like a winner, given that the most  important ministries have gone to Forza Italia?    [Berlusconi] The most important ministries are in the safe  and expert hands of independent individuals whom I trust, of  course. Or is a minister who enjoys the trust of the prime  minister against the Constitution?    [Guiglia] [Northern League lower house floor leader] Maroni  says that you do not trust the League: Why did you bring it  into government then?    [Berlusconi] I trust the League, its voters, and most of its  ideas and battles. I trust [League ideologue] Miglio, Speroni,  Maroni, and even Bossi, even though he is doing all he can not  to deserve this.    [Guiglia] Will you allow yourself to be influenced by  Bossi's  pauses for reflection or will you take the list of ministers to  the Quirinale [office of the president] anyway?    [Berlusconi] If I were not to inform my allies, if I were  not  to discuss patiently with them, I would make the mistake of  being presumptuous and of disdaining the rules of politics. If  I were to allow myself to be influenced to the point where my  right or duty to be accountable to the head of state and  parliament for the task of forming the government and  designating the ministers under my responsibility would be  called into question, I would be going against Article 92 of the  Constitution.    [Guiglia] Bossi maintains that you are in a hurry to form  the  government because you are afraid of the judges: What do you  have to fear?    [Berlusconi] I have absolutely nothing to fear. I am in no  hurry to form a government, it is the country that cannot  understand the reappearance of the old temptation to share and  parcel out. Bossi has become like Oscar Wilde: He can resist  everything, apart from temptation. [Berlusconi ends]    The long distance thrust and parry between Berlusconi and  Bossi lasted the entire day. Probably the League's request for  a pause of reflection had been taken into account. Berlusconi  certainly does not lose his composure when the news comes that  Bossi will not take part in the summit meeting called to resolve  the Viminale [Interior Ministry] dilemma: "I will go ahead  anyway."    The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] seems determined to apply  Article 92 of the Constitution whether the League ally is  (temporarily) absent or not. It is up to the prime  minister-designate to choose the ministers and submit the  proposal to the Quirinale. Berlusconi pretends not to see the  empty interior ministry box and continues to draw up the rest of  the list, knowing well that -- or hoping well that -- the League  will nevertheless return to the negotiation table.    "As for what has happened up to now," the Knight explains,  "I  think I have given due consideration to all the allies in the  Freedom Alliance and will continue to do so without losing sight  of what clearly emerges from the fundamental law of the  Republic." An indirect and unequivocal message to Bossi: come  back to the negotatiations, but in the knowledge that in the end  the prime minister is the only one who is responsible for making  the choices. Berlusconi will not let go. Moreover, this is not  the first time that Bossi suddenly abandons talks that have just  started. "This does not seem a threat to me," the Knight adds.

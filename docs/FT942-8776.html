			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Progress seen in Golan talks: Christopher ends second shuttle in two weeks Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, wound up his second Middle East shuttle in two weeks yesterday with US officials reporting clear resolve from both Israel and Syria to negotiate away differences over the Golan Heights, but stressing again that while there had been progress, there remained long discussions ahead. Mr Joubran Kourieh, Syrian spokesman, said President Hafez al-Assad had reiterated that a settlement had to be based on UN resolutions calling for total Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands. 'President Assad was briefed by Mr Christopher on the outcome of his talks in Israel which showed the differences were still big because Israel's position was still far from the basis and requirements of the peace process which began in Madrid,' Mr Kourieh added. Mr Christopher and his entourage kept the secretary of state's pledge on arriving in the region four days ago that observers would be 'disappointed' by what he could reveal of the content of his meetings. This silence is taken in Damascus as a clear sign of the substantive nature of his proxy negotiations between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and President Assad with whom Mr Christopher held a further four hours of talks yesterday. Syrian officials said only that the two sides are now talking about 'core issues' of a peace agreement. Mr Christopher is understood to have exchanged what one diplomat described as 'very, very detailed position papers on both sides.' Mr Christopher's central task is to bridge the differences between Israel, which has so far offered a phased and partial withdrawal from the Golan over five to eight years, and Syria, which wants nothing less than a full withdrawal over a 'reasonable' timetable. Diplomats in Damascus say Mr Assad would accept withdrawal over a maximum of three years, but only after an initial pledge from Israel of Syrian sovereignty over the whole area occupied in 1967.</p>

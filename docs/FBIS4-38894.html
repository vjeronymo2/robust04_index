			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [No dateline as received] -- Education Minister  Yerezhep Mambetkaziyev held a news conference devoted to the  situation in the education system and its future development.  All these painful topical problems in our education system were  described in an appeal to the Supreme Kenges deputies. The  appeal contains a concept of the education reform on all levels.  It is a matter of prestige for the new parliament to give total  support for national education.    It was stated that today, more than ever before, it is  necessary to take legal measures to actively protect and support  education. Laws should aim at establishment of a common  educational space within the framework of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly.    It is an open secret that economic problems have badly  affected the preschool educational system. It is here that  formation of new citizens begins. However, hundreds of  nurseries are closed down, about 60 percent of children have no  access to these institutions, and their parents do not receive  reimbursement. Against the background of the overall economic  trouble the most problematic issues are organization of the  study process, of nourishment and every day consumer services  for children and teenagers. During the previous three years  enrollment to technical vocational schools decreased by one  third, and the number of unemployed graduates increased by a  factor of eight. Some of these youngsters are employed in  commerce, and others are idle, which means they can potentially  join the criminal world.    The prestige and priority of education are impossible  without  social protection for educational establishments, their staff  and students, without financial help. Hopes are pinned on local  budgets. The state does not allocate sufficient money for  education. Over 25,000 teachers need home improvement. They  lose hope and quit -- only last year over 30,000 teachers left  the education field, and today schools need over 17,000 teachers.    The reform, which will help to overcome the crisis envisages  a better budgeting from the state and support for nonstate  budgeting of schools, vocational schools, and nurseries. Some  of the vocational schools will be transformed into colleges, or  technical lyceums, and their graduates will have bachelors'  degrees. The reform envisages a multilevel structure, a new  mechanism for giving jobs to graduates and setting up of a  research institute of the higher school problems.    The journalists were particularly interested in a new system  of comprehensive testing prior to enrollment to universities.  On 26 July for the first ever time all universities of Almaty  will give tests checked by computers, so as to exclude lack of  objectivity and nepotism. [passage omitted]    The Importance of a new information technology, intensive  methods of teaching, as well as of the trilingual principle  (Kazakh, Russian, and foreign languages) and enhancement of  training in social and liberal arts was stressed at the news  conference.    Over 3,000 Kazakhstanis are currently educated abroad. These  are talented children who merit the elite-type education. In  future, the network of elite-type educational institutions will  be increased, and computer databases will be created to find out  talented young people.</p>

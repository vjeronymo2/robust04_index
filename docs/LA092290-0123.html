			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> SAUDI ARABIA MAY REJECT COMIC BOOKS SENT TO GULF FORCES  </P> <P> Some American heroes are just not welcome in the Middle East.  </P> <P> The owner of a comic book store in Thousand Oaks sent 700 books featuring some  of America's favorite super-heroes earlier this week to cheer up U.S. forces  stationed in the Middle East.  </P> <P> But scantily dressed heroines such as Wonder Woman probably will not make it  through customs.  </P> <P> "If anything is mailed to Saudi Arabia it must adhere to their regulations,"  said Linda Wadley, public affairs specialist at the Construction Battalion  Center in Port Hueneme.  </P> <P> And in a country in which the women wear veils and do not bare their legs or  arms, Wonder Woman, decked out in a flashy costume not much bigger than a  swimsuit, is considered pornographic.  </P> <P> Pornography, pork products, religious items and alcohol are not permitted to  enter Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> And advertisements for alcohol and lingerie are off-limits.  </P> <P> Myron Cohen-Ross, owner of Pantechnicon comic book store, is accustomed to a  little opposition to his sexy super-heroes.  </P> <P> "My biggest problem comes from moms who think the heroines don't wear enough  clothing," he said. "But none of this stuff is pornographic. And I ask them,  which one's better, letting their kids read comic books or letting them watch  violence on T.V.?"  </P> <P> Cohen-Ross said he sent the books because many of his customers are in the  service and it's his way of saying thanks.  </P> <P> About 200 Seabees are already in Saudi Arabia, Wadley said, and about 1,800  more have been given their orders to go, but she could not say when they will  be on their way.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Diplomatic sources reported that negotiations  between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay on the  establishment of a common external tariff for Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] member countries could reach a successful  conclusion this week. The countries would establish a 12  percent common external tariff, which would become effective in  the year 2001, on investment goods, software, and hardware.    The agreement between Argentina and Brazil, after frantic  bilateral negotiations, would result in the implementation of  customs duties on the aforementioned products, something Uruguay  and Paraguay would accept during the meetings that will take  place in Montevideo this week. The controversy between  Argentina and Brazil stemmed from their different stances, both  on when the common external tariff should take effect and on the  tariff level. Brazil did not want investment goods, software,  and hardware included in the customs union for five years and  wanted to be protected by a 35 percent tariff. Argentina, on  its side, contended that these products had to enter Mercosur  countries duty-free and that this provision had to be enforced  immediately.    The possible agreement would give Mercosur member countries  some leeway to negotiate a zero common external tariff until  2001. Furthermore, it would entail an increase in tariffs for  agroindustrial machinery, industrial equipment, hardware, and  software for Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay.</p>

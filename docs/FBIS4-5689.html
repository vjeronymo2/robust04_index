			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan Cannot Shake Off `Enemy State' Brand" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Shunji Maruyama,  deputy permanent representative of Japan to the United Nations,  reportedly told a recent meeting of a working group that the  provision of the U.N. charter specifying Japan as an "enemy  state" was outdated and it must be deleted.    His unreasonable assertion is an insult to the U.N. Charter  and a mockery of unbiased public opinion critical of the past  crimes of Japan.    However angrily Japan may grumble, pointing its finger at  the  United Nations as now, in an attempt to cleanse itself of the  disgraceful brand of "enemy state" specified in the U.N.  charter, it is no wise way of solving the problem.    If the problem is to be solved, Japan must liquidate its  shameful past, first of all. Japan's past is spoiled with  never-to-be-condoned crimes; it is a war criminal state in World  War II and imposed all sorts of misfortunes and sufferings on  the Korean and other Asian peoples.    It is the height of effrontery for Japan to attempt to  delete  the brand of "enemy state" while keeping mum about its criminal  past.    Striking out the brand of "enemy state" is out of question  today when Japan, forgetful of the lesson on the past, is  hastening its nuclear armament and its conversion into a  military power in real earnest to realise its old dream of "the  greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and thus hindering the  denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the establishment  of a nuclear weapon-free world and posing a great threat to the  Korean and other Asian peoples.</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Ukraine nuclear pact threatened UKRAINE and Russia are at odds over the terms of their agreement last month for the transfer of strategic nuclear weapons on Ukrainian soil to Russia. The viability of the accord reached at a summit meeting in Massandra in the Crimea is now in doubt. Russia has accused Ukraine of fraudulently changing the wording of the agreement to exclude 46 modern SS-24 missiles from removal to Russian territory. Two weeks ago Moscow quietly announced that it considered the transfer agreement null and void. Ukraine has responded by saying that Russia misled Ukraine during the signing of documents by setting down a text that was not what Ukraine had negotiated. Ukraine insists its changes were made in the presence of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, before he signed. The penned-in changes are not initialled in the margin as is customary diplomatic practice. Ukraine sticks to its interpretation that all nuclear weapons are not covered under the protocol. It says it is ready to renegotiate but has set a list of conditions before any pact can be implemented. These include compensation for the short-range tactical nuclear weapons it voluntarily transferred to Russia in May 1992. There is currently no timetable for reopening nuclear talks between the two sides. Nor is there a timetable for the Ukrainian parliament to ratify the 1991 Start 1 nuclear arms reduction treaty signed between the US and the Soviet Union.</p>

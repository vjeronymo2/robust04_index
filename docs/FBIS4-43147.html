			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial report: "How To Deal With Iran"] </F>   [Text] "The revolution is not about the price of a  watermelon," declared Ayatollah Khomeyni of the creation of the  Islamic Republic of Iran. Any hopes that such ardour might cool  with time have again been dashed in recent weeks. Like a poor  man's Communist International, the Iranians still seek to export  revolution and violence across the globe. This was most  recently exemplified by the crude forgeries of British  Government correspondence on Bosnia -- in an attempt to prove  anti-Muslim bias -- which triggered the round of Anglo-Iranian  diplomatic expulsions. Along with Cuba, Iraq, Libya and North  Korea, Iran not only chooses to remain outside the family of  nations, but also assaults its basic values. While all these  countries lack the resources of a superpower, they share a siege  mentality that prompts them to acquire weapons of mass  destruction -- as Iranian funding for the North Korean Rodong  missile programme so chillingly demonstrates.    In Iran's case such behaviour is, of course, always affected  by the regime's internal power struggles. Divisions between the  pragmatists led by President Rafsanjani and the radicals led by  the spiritual leader, Ali Khamene'i, endure; indeed, far from  being a figment of Western imagination the distinction between  the two camps is made by the Iranians themselves. In the West  there is a general belief that it should be easier to treat with  the "pragmatists." But if anything, it might in fact be easier  to live with the religious radicals, because they are less  interested in the non-Muslim world. By contrast, the  pragmatists pay far greater attention to Iran's strategic  interests. Merely because they believe that Iran and Islam  cannot triumph through spiritual elan alone, and require Western  capital and technology to accomplish their ends, does not make  them easier partners.    But the truth is that neither faction is as concerned with  foreign policy as many in the West suppose; to be seen publicly  to undo any segment of Ayatollah Khomeyni's legacy is to court  disaster, and so Iran's overseas adventurism continues as though  on autopilot. The Clinton Administration's policy has been one  of "dual containment" towards both Iran and Iraq, based on the  assumption that as long as Iran is kept weak there will be no  need to depend on Iraq to contain it. Pressure on Iran should  be maintained, especially as the Iranians are vulnerable  following the halving of their oil revenues since the Gulf war.  Britain, for its part, should join America in pressing for an  end to concessional finance and the transfer of high technology  goods, even if countries such as France and Germany are willing  to soft-pedal their differences with Iran over terrorism for  short-sighted commercial and political gain.</p>

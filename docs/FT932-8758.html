			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / UK sparks worries in Belize THE opposition in Belize has accused the government of having no alternative plans for the country's defence after British troops leave. Local economists are also expressing concern about the impact of the pull-out, announced by the British government last week. The garrison of 1,400 troops was stationed in the central American country to deter neighbouring Guatemala, which threatened many times to invade the former British colony in pursuit of a 130-year-old territorial claim. The overall responsibility for defence will pass to the 600-strong Belize Defence Force. Britain said it was closing the garrison, but would leave 150 soldiers in Belize and use the facilities for training. The move follows agreements between Belize and Guatemala in the past two years which have cleared the way for a diplomatic end to the dispute. The contingent is a significant contributor to the Belize economy. Maintaining the garrison in Belize costs the British government about Dollars 40m (Pounds 26m) a year. Economists say the country earns Dollars 35m a year (about a fifth of the country's gross domestic product) from the presence of the garrison. The government denied it was unprepared for the British decision.</p>

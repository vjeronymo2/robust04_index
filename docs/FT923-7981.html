			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Personal View: Risky bet on lotteries There are insufficient funds to support UK theatres and opera houses, to improve sports facilities, to retain art treasures for the nation and to restore historic buildings. The government's solution to all these is a white paper entitled 'A national lottery raising money for good causes'. The white paper refers to two principles on which gambling policy is based. First, gambling should be properly regulated to ensure that it is conducted honestly and fairly; second, the demand for gambling should not be positively encouraged because, if taken to excess, it can cause distress for the individual and the family and have damaging consequences for society as a whole. Proceeding from the view that lotteries are the 'softest' form of gambling, the government is said to believe that a fairly relaxed regime of control for a national lottery is consistent with overall government policy on gambling. This assertion is, at best, naive. The white paper makes it clear that, for a national lottery to succeed, it will have to be widely encouraged. It cannot be assumed, therefore, that the dangers of excess which characterise all types of gambling would not occur in a national lottery. One should not extrapolate from the limited experience in the UK which is confined to small lotteries. Recent reports concerning the Irish National Lottery and of other overseas lotteries suggest that there will also be difficulty in preventing abuse by mass-buying and syndicates. In such circumstances, limited controls would be inadequate. Further, the advent of a national lottery will result in the pools as well as other sectors of the gambling industry wanting some relaxation of the controls on them, and the white paper states that the government would be prepared to consider the case for this. Much is made, in the government document, of the fact that the proposed national lottery is for 'good causes'. But whatever the intentions concerning the use of the money that will be made out of a national lottery, the fact that the latter is nevertheless a form of gambling is played down throughout. For many people gambling, within limits, provides a pleasurable and harmless activity and the existing lotteries are a means whereby such activity can benefit charitable, sporting and other good causes. In a national lottery, however, it is to be expected that the gambling element would predominate over any considerations of charitable giving. It is an undesirable departure in public policy that the government, through the establishment of a national lottery, should endorse gambling, as a substantial fund raiser. A national lottery is not an efficient way of raising revenue. The government estimates that Pounds 1bn could be obtained from such a lottery for good causes. While one can wholeheartedly support the proposition that such a sum should be spent on the arts, sport and the heritage, it is arguable whether we should raise three times this amount and then give half of it back to some winners, in order to do this. An alternative, for example, would be to add an appropriate amount to the duty on cigarettes and in this way find money for the 'good causes'. The impact on the retail price index would be far outweighed by the beneficial health effect and cost savings for the NHS, resulting from the reduction in the amount that is smoked. However, the true intentions of the government become evident in the actual implementation of the proposed national lottery. Since the social impact of gambling is of such importance, the Home Office has until now been the department responsible for the law and policy on gambling. Consequently, the social factor has been the primary consideration in the formulation of public policy on gambling. Those, including the Exchequer, who benefit financially from gambling in any way, are consulted but do not take the lead in this matter. Yet the Department of National Heritage, whose purpose will be to maximise the turnover of the national lottery, is to be responsible for the legislation to authorise it. This is a serious departure from established procedure and will result in a significant weakening of the policy of providing gambling facilities on the basis of unstimulated demand. It is not surprising that the betting industry has already indicated that it will seek a lifting of restrictions on betting offices. The result is likely to be an increase in excessive gambling, with all its damaging consequences. The white paper states that it would be inappropriate for a national lottery to be seen as a way of funding the National Health Service, education or similar programmes. This implies, however, that the arts, sport, heritage and other charitable purposes are lower-division activities which can never look to securing adequate finance from central and local public funds, or from individual and collective private charity, and must look for help through inciting people to gamble.

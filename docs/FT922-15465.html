			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris pins hopes on Beregovoy for premier DOMESTIC matters continued to influence bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS continued its vigil for the resignation of Prime Minister Edith Cresson, which was expected to be announced in the next 24 hours. Dealers said the market would welcome the appointment of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, as the new premier because of his efforts to increase equity investment in France. Mr Robert Lyon, the head of Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the French state financial institution, is tipped as Mr Beregovoy's successor. The CAC-40 index ended 1.32 lower at 1,942.43, off the day's high of 1,962.24 on selling linked to the expiry of options and futures. Perrier accounted for FFr1.2bn of total turnover of FFr3.6bn, as holders sold into the market for the second day. Perrier was steady at FFr1,700, with 723,250 shares traded. BSN jumped FFr17 to FFr1,126 as fund managers re-invested their Perrier proceeds. BSN was also boosted by a buy note from James Capel, which reportedly bought 50,000 shares of the total 116,370 traded. Hachette fell another FFr8.30 or 5.2 per cent to FFr150 on fears of a heavy rights issue to strengthen its balance sheet, following the La Cinq losses. FRANKFURT was encouraged by firmer engineering orders in February and some positive results from steel and engineering groups. The DAX rose 7.55 to 1,717.86 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, gained 4.01 to 699.86. Turnover rose to DM5.1bn from DM4.5bn. Mannesmann, which forecast 1992 group sales of DM30bn, put on DM3.70 to DM280.00. The engineering group also reported that sales in the first two months had risen nearly 30 per cent. Hoesch weakened 70 pfg to DM255.80 after saying that group sales in the first two months were flat. Linde put on DM11 to DM827 following Monday's news that group net profit had risen nearly 19 per cent. Volkswagen advanced another DM7.8 to DM363.8, while the rest of the car sector was lacklustre. MILAN saw active interest in the telecoms, while the broad market staged a technical rebound. Dealers said the market had now discounted disastrous results for the main parties in the general election this weekend. The Comit index added 7.98 or 1.6 per cent to 502.47 in turnover estimated at L90bn after Monday's L57bn. Sip jumped L56 or 4 per cent to L1,456 in 8m shares, double Monday's level, on reports of a big foreign buy order executed by a Milan broker which has close ties with a leading London broker. The latter was said to have issued a belatedly bullish note on Sip this week. Sip was also buoyed up by hopes of a rise in the dividend following Monday's news of a 19.5 per cent increase in 1991 profit. Mediobanca rose L195 to L13,585, encouraged by news of a better gross profit performance in the first eight months of fiscal 1992.

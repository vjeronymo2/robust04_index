			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Japan-US summit to discuss financial stability MR Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, will meet Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, late next month to discuss international financial issues, including the stability of the financial systems in the US and Japan. The meeting, which the New York Fed said would be held at its Manhattan offices on February 20 or 21, comes amid widespread anxiety about the health of banks, sharp falls in prices in worldwide property markets and the weakness of the Japanese stock market. The New York Fed has responsibility in the US Fed system for relations with foreign central banks and is the institution that holds Dollars 260bn (Pounds 145.6bn) of US Treasury securities for foreign central bank and monetary authorities. The two central bankers and their deputies are expected to discuss ways to prevent failure of an institution in one country triggering the collapse of markets and banks elsewhere in the world and endangering the whole financial system. Possible counter-measures include exchanging information on troubled institutions, improving the foreign exchange settlement procedures in Japan and New York and greater co-ordination between the US and Japanese monetary authorities. The Bank of Japan confirmed that it had received an invitation for the meeting at the New York Fed. A Bank of Japan official said that, given the state of the international financial markets, it would 'not be surprising' if financial stability was on the agenda. But he said the exact timing, attendance list, and programme of any meeting had yet to be decided. The Japanese press has said the measures for countering financial instability would include extending the trading hours of the Tokyo foreign currency markets in the evening and of the New York markets in the morning so that yen-US dollar currency trades could be settled at the same time. This would help banks avoid holding positions unnecessarily after the markets had closed. In Washington, a spokesman for Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said a meeting between Mr Greenspan and Mr Mieno about the same time 'is not now on our agenda' although the two men will meet in Garden City, New York, at today's meeting of finance ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. Mr Corrigan, who is chairman of the Basle committee on banking supervision, may also discuss with Mr Mieno ways of tightening international bank regulation in the wake of the scandal over the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. An internal paper on the subject was recently completed and is expected to be a topic of forthcoming monthly meetings at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. World stocks, Page 21</p>

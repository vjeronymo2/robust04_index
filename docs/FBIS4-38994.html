			<p>BFN     [Text] We have a fragment of an interview between our Kursk  correspondent Natalya Zhurba and Aleksandr Rutskoy:    [Begin recording] [Rutskoy] People want to know the truth  because the media lie and distort everything I say and the  positions that I defend. We shall see who was right, history  will judge us. As long as Yeltsin is president there will be no  positive changes in the country. Because this is all his fault  - the destruction of that great power, the Soviet Union, and the  destruction of the country's economy. All this is his doing --  the poverty, refugees, local conflicts, bloodshed.    [Zhurba] But at that time you were there by his side.    [Rutskoy] I was with him for six months only. After he  signed the CIS treaty we were no longer together. I stated my  position on this clearly and defended it until the Supreme  Soviet was gunned down. And I am still defending my positions  and will never change them.    [Zhurba] Do you see yourself as a leader who, on becoming  president, could change the course and the policy of the state  and make our state richer and people's living standards better?    [Rutskoy] It is the people who should judge me, Yeltsin and  others. The people should choose their leader. [end recording]    Nevertheless, the last word will be said by those who do not  just listen to Aleksandr Rutskoy, but sometimes see him on the  television screen calling on all the healthy, strong men and  urging them to storm this building or that building.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has  denied that the ballot papers for the elections next week will  be numbered. The IEC said in a statement that the counterfoil of  the ballot paper had a serial number, but that there was no mark  on the ballot paper itself. It said that no inscription would  be made on the counterfoil by an electoral officer. The voter  would have his knuckles sprayed with invisible ink, and his  document marked with invisible ink to control voting.</p>

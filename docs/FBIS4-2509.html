			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Yesterday, as noted dissident Wei Jingsheng was  reportedly treated inhumanely during a period of "surveillance  and investigation," the United States expressed -- for the third  time -- its concern over his arrest, but China strongly warned  that the United States should not involve itself in the incident.    Wei Ling, the younger sister of Wei Jingsheng, said during  an  interview with a foreign press agency yesterday that the  authorities had on many occasions hinted to Wei Jingsheng's  family that there might be some problems with Wei's health, and  this made people worry that Wei Jingsheng had been inhumanely  treated while being "kept under surveillance at a certain place."    She said: "They told my father it was necessary for them to  give my elder brother a health check-up. However, he was in  good health before he was arrested."    Wei Ling worried that the doctors in the prison might do  harm  to her elder brother.    However, when she was answering MING PAO reporter's  questions, Wei Ling said she knew nothing about her elder  brother. She only said that she thought it was possible that  Wei Jingsheng's secretary, Tong Yi, might be sentenced to  imprisonment, and it was even more possible that Wei Jingsheng  would be sentenced to imprisonment, because this had already  been implied in some statements made by public security  departments.

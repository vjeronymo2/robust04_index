Engineer Barqe'i, general manager of Hamadan Province's  Office of Industries, speaking at an ideological meeting of  province managers, announced the above. He added: Since the time  of the establishment of the Ministry of Heavy Industries in the  year 1361 [21 March 1982-20 March 1983] to the year 1369 [21  March 1990-20 March 1991], the Office of Heavy Industries in the  province of Hamadan has operated independently. With only five  employees, this office supervises the work of 406 foundries,  mills, and builders of agricultural implements and other similar  goods.    He emphasized the need for the government to create heavy  industry units in the Hamadan Province. He said that one of the  most important reasons for the increase in the unemployment rate  in this province is the lack of heavy industries in Hamadan.    Our correspondent reports that with the continuation of this  meeting, which was attended by Governor-General Khorram, the  deputy governors-general and all the province's executive  directors, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Musavi, the  vice-regent's representative in the province and the Friday imam  of Hamadan, gave a speech in which he discussed God's days, and  said the 10 Days of Dawn celebrating the triumph of the Islamic  revolution of Iran is one of the valuable divine gifts to the  Islamic Republic of Iran. He said it is important to preserve  this blessing and that this is the duty of each and every person  in society.    As for Hamadan Province, he discussed the arrival of the  blessed month of Ramadan and emphasized purity, cleanliness, and  preparedness to enter this blessed month. He said the secret of  the human being's success and triumph is the presence of  spirituality and the clergy in society. He added: The violence,  the commotion and the killing and slaughter in the Western world  arises from the lack of spirituality in those societies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bangalore -- India has embarked on a project for the  development of anti-missile missiles system in the wake of  reports that Pakistan was acquiring such missiles, Chief of the  Air Staff Air Chief Marshall S.K. Kaul said on Thursday.    Kaul told reporters at the Avia India '93 international air  show at the Yelahanka Indian Air Force (IAF) base that the  Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the nodal  agency for the integrated guided missiles programme (IGMP), had  already begun working on such a missile.    An anti-missile system detects the long range missile fired  by the enemy and ensures its destruction in mid-air by firing  another missile.    Kaul said, the indigenous missile ``Prithvi'' would first be  acquired by the Army followed by the IAF, on completion of test  firing. However, the anti-missile programme would depend on the  availability of finances in the light of the budgetary cut. ``We  will have to do some juggling with the available resources.''    Referring to the United States' proposal to repeal the  Pressler Amendment (which had embargoed supply of arms to  Pakistan) the Air Chief Marshall noted ``the threat to the  nation will be viewed in its totality and not only in the light  of the proposed repeal. We will conduct our own assessment and  equip ourselves accordingly, whenever there is a need to augment  our capability.''    The IAF had drawn up a perspective plan covering the  strategies to be adopted to counter threats to the nation over a  15 year period. Implementation of such a plan would, however,  depend on the quantum of funds available with the Government, he  added.    IAF would fully back the indigenous airborne early warning  (AEW) project. ``Such a system is very expensive and  complicated, and not many countries have the technological  expertise. The IAF will support any indigenous venture.''    The indigenous AEW is being developed by the Centre for  Airborne Systems (CABS) in Bangalore. The AEW has been  successfully integrated on Avro HS 748 aircraft and test flown.    A. P. J. Abdul Kalaam, Scientific Advisor to the Defence  Ministry, said the country was ready to sell Akash integrated  ground to air missile systems abroad once the domestic  commitments were met.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Apr (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak has  described ties between Egypt and China as "historic ones" and  noted that Egypt was the first Arab and African country to  recognize the People's Republic of China.    In an interview with a Chinese media delegation that  represented Chinese media organs, President Mubarak said that  recent international developments in the Middle East and in east  Asia stress the importance of consultations between Egypt and  China to have an objective assessment of these developments and  of searching for fair solutions acceptable to all parties in  order to enhance world peace and security.    President Mubarak stressed that Egyptian-Chinese relations  are so unique as to distinguish them from bilateral relations  with a number of other friendly countries, explaining that the  two countries' cooperation covers many fields of joint activity  in the economic, cultural, scientific, and other spheres. He  expressed hope that economic cooperation and trade exchange will  rise to a still better level.    He said that the great leap made by the Chinese economy and  the important achievement of the Egyptian economy will open  broad scope and horizons for expanding trade between the two  countries and for increasing their share in world trade to the  benefit of the two fraternal peoples.    President Mubarak went on to say in the interview that the  achievement of stability in Egypt and the Middle East creates  the right climate for giving impetus to the economic growth  cycle and the attraction of investments. He stressed that Egypt  has succeeded, through a gradual process, in restoring a large  part of the Egyptian economy's activities, vitality, and ability  to produce, export, and create job opportunities for thousands  of young people. He added: The problems are not over yet but  the diagnosis was accurate and the treatment was not sudden.  Signs of health and strength have started to reappear in  Egypt's economy in the fields of industry, agriculture, and  reconstruction, and in the improvement in the level of services.    President Mubarak explained that Egypt's policy follows an  active diplomacy with the majority of African countries at the  political, economic and cultural levels and the exchange of  visits and delegations. He added that he is following the  development of this policy with great interest. He said: We  are contributing, with other countries and international  organizations, to the search for solutions to problems that  might appear from time to time in order to achieve security and  stability in the continent where most peoples are living.    President Mubarak stressed that Egypt has firmly abided by  the strategy of peace based on justice in order to fulfill the  hopes of the region's peoples after a 50-year-long conflict. He  said that this strategy began with the historic peace initiative  of 1977 that aimed to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict  and open the door to peaceful coexistence between the  Palestinians and Israelis.    He added that Egypt's policy has pursued this course that  advocates negotiations and dialogue within the framework of  legitimacy and the principles of justice and international law  until it saw its persistent efforts crowned with success at the  end of 1991, when the peace conference was held in Madrid to  implement Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the  principle of land in return for peace. He said that he regards  the Madrid conference as a historic turning point in the peace  process and in starting direct negotiations between all the  Israeli, Arab, and Palestinian parties.    He stressed that the Palestinian-Israeli agreement in the  form of the Declaration of Principles last September was another  important landmark that brought everybody to the verge of  reaching a peaceful and acceptable settlement that places the  Palestinian issue at the threshold of a new era where self-rule  will be achieved and of transitional measures in preparation for  the negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories.    He said that equally important and serious negotiations have  been held on the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks with  Israel and that this shows that everyone is convinced that  dialogue and mutual consent and acceptance are the best way to  reach an agreement. He added: Another important process also  began in parallel with these negotiations, namely the  multilateral negotiations on regional cooperation that involves  the parties to the conflict and other countries, including  China. These talks cover issues of economic development,  environment, water, disarmament, and refugees.    He noted that all these are important fields to which the  parties and other world countries concerned with the region's  stability are paying attention in the hope of attaining security  and stability and thus bringing about benefits to all the  peoples of the Middle East and the world.    President Mubarak went on to say that Egypt's role, which  the  political leadership plans and the diplomatic branch implements,  has not stopped since the start of the Madrid conference. It  even started a long time before then because of Egypt's ties  with all regional and international parties to the conflict. He  added that Egypt has open channels of communication with all  these leaders and constantly receives their leaders and  representatives in order to narrow the gap of differences and  bring views closer.    He said: Within this context, Egypt has received most of the  leaders concerned with the conflict who are participating in the  peace process. Talks have also been held in Cairo between the  Israeli and Palestinian sides, and the Egyptian capital has been  visited by U.S., European, and other delegations to give impetus  to the peace process and to reach tangible results as early as  possible that will put an end to the cycle of violence and  counter violence, expand the circle of support for peace and  coexistence in the Middle East, and achieve a dignified and  secure life for everyone. He stressed that the achievement of  peace in the Middle East will ultimately be a great historic  contribution to the establishment of peace and stability in the  whole world.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with I. Isahakian, governor of the Bank of </F> Armenia; date and place not specified]    [Excerpts]    [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Mr Isahakian, could you first say  a  few words about the situation preceding the decision of the  State Commission on Money Circulation and the organizational  measures that the central bank undertook?    [Isahakian] In earlier statements I mentioned a few times  that, based on all classical examples and the experience of  other nations, before putting a new national currency into  circulation it is necessary to have an intermediate means of  payment which will take upon itself the full weight of  inflation. During that period, the government, the central bank  and the entire public must take steps to prevent the decline of  the economy and to stabilize it. Only after that can genuine  monetary reform take place.    However, in recent weeks events unfolded very rapidly, as  the  president of the republic noted with justification. We were  forced to replace the 1991-1992 issue 1,000, 5,000 and  10,000-ruble notes with dram bills. Thus we were unable to  implement the classical method--we could not have done it. I  must say that we had only 1 to 1 and 1/2 weeks for  organizational and preparatory work. During that time, the State  Commission on Money Circulation and the working group associated  with it performed important work. [passage omitted]    [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Mr Isahakian, although the  Commission's decision is quite clearly drafted, some issues need  to be made more comprehensible to our people. For example, if a  citizen buys something and pays 10 dram, should that be  interpreted as 10 dram or 2,000 rubles?    [Isahakian] It should be interpreted as 2,000 rubles. For  example, if a citizen buys something that is worth 100 rubles  and pays with a 10-dram bill, then the seller must return 1,900  rubles. Similarly 25 dram is equivalent to 5,000 rubles, 50 dram  to 10,000 rubles, 100 dram to 20,000 rubles, 200 dram to 40,000  rubles and 500 dram to 100,000 rubles.    [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Will not the concurrent  circulation  of 1, 3, 5, 25, 100, 200 and 500-ruble bills with the Armenian  notes create a certain confusion?    [Isahakian] Of course, there will be certain difficulties at  the beginning. However, both the buyers and the sellers must be  very careful. I think that they will get accustomed fairly  quickly. This issue is also of immediate concern to the  directors and accountants of enterprises and corporations. I  must say that nothing has changed. If they had, say, 100,000  rubles on their books, that should be counted the same way as  before. In the future, when we make a full transition to a  national currency and introduce notes and coins with lower  denominations and in luma [presumably a subdivision of dram],  then all accounting can be done in terms of dram. For the  moment, ruble notes in lower denominations will perform the  function of the notes I mentioned.    [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] This means that this is the first  stage of a full transition to a national currency.    [Isahakian] Yes, it is an intermediate stage. We will have  entered the final stage when we introduce notes with lower  denominations and coins. At this time we are embarking on a new  era in the life of our republic. The government and the central  bank must take all necessary steps to ensure the stability of  our currency and to raise its exchange value. That is not  dependent on the currency's name or looks. That depends on our  economic base and productivity of our economy. We are all  committed to strengthen the dram. That means encouraging  exports, the production of goods that consumers demand and  making imports manageable. It is also important that we cut the  budget deficit by correct financial policies and that we build  hard-currency reserves. Thus our financial situation and the  stability of our currency depends on us.    [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Here is another issue that needs  to  be explained to the people: according to the Commission's  decision, sums of more than 50,000 rubles will be deposited in a  savings bank for six months with an interest rate of 48 percent  per annum. Based on the experience of past years, the people are  a little worried. To what extent is the repayment of those funds  guaranteed? Can the people be certain that they will not lose  their money?    [Isahakian] The people can rest assured that their deposits  will be returned. I believe that the people trust the savings  banks because the indexation of funds deposited in August has  already inspired some confidence. Confidence in the savings  banks increased especially among rural people who received their  payment for their produce from the savings banks without any  problems this year. If we could pay those sums in conditions of  dependence on the Bank of Russia, we can be more certain making  those payments on time now.    [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Can the people use those deposits  to pay, for example, for certain services in noncash form?    [Isahakian] We are thinking about that issue. After 27  November, when we will know how much money was changed and how  much money was deposited, those issues will be examined and  somehow resolved.    [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Now a technical question: Can  those  citizens of the republic who have not had the time to obtain an  identity card or who have lost theirs exchange their rubles for  dram? How about those who are away from the republic on business  or who are away from their homes in hospitals or sanatoriums?    [Isahakian] First, if a person does not have an identity  card  he or she cannot exchange his or her money. This does not apply  to military servicemen.    Those individuals who are outside the republic because of  their work can apply to the appropriate exchange boards provided  that they have the necessary documents. As for those citizens  who are in hospitals or sanatoriums or away from their permanent  homes in other parts of the republic, if they do not return to  their permanent homes by the expiration of the deadline for  exchanging their money, they can exchange their money by  presenting their identity documents to the post office or  savings bank at their location. The procedure is the same. The  exchange is done only once and their identity documents are  stamped as appropriate.    [HAYASTANI HANRAPETUTYUN] Would you like to say anything  else  to the people?    [Isahakian] Based on the experience of exchanging 50 and  100-ruble notes in 1991, I would like to ask the people to be  very careful, to remember where they have kept their ruble  notes--excuse the expression, under pillows or inside cracks in  walls (although I do not think that in conditions of rapid  devaluation anybody would have kept large sums)--so that  complications do not arise in the future. I would also like to  remind them that there will be only one exchange and one chance  to open a deposit account.</p>

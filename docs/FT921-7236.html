			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Leading Article: A role for Mr Rabin MIDDLE EAST peace talks reopen in Washington today against a more than usually dispiriting backdrop. The cycle of violence between Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas over the past week has set back the prospects for worthwhile negotiations. Moreover, the Israelis, by invading Lebanon, again showed a disdain for the wishes of the international community which scarcely encourages optimism about a peace process that has depended thus far on external pressure. It would be premature to write the effort off, however. The fact that Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and the Palestinians are still planning to sit down with Israel - after two rounds of largely procedural talks and repeated affirmations by Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, that he has no territorial concessions to offer - testifies that all sides still see mileage in not being blamed for aborting the negotiations. And developments over the past week in Israel - with general elections due in June - suggest that its position may not be set in stone. The event that has raised at least the possibility of progress is the re-emergence of Mr Yitzhak Rabin, a 69-year-old former prime minister who consistently tops the polls as Israel's most popular politician, as leader of the opposition Labour party. The result may be a modest revival in Labour fortunes - and, perhaps, an Israeli government more amenable to territorial compromise. Pragmatist Mr Rabin is no dove. He is as tough as any graduate of the Israeli defence establishment. As defence minister when the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip broke out in 1987, he was responsible for a policy of repression that makes his Likud successor seem liberal. Yet unlike Mr Shamir, who believes in Israel's eternal sovereignty over the West Bank, he is a pragmatist concerning Israel's need to trade land for peace with the Arabs, and opposes extending Jewish colonisation of the occupied territories. He is also someone with whom Israel's allies think they can do business. If the US administration had a vote in the coming election, Mr Rabin would undoubtedly be its choice - a matter of some importance when Israel is attempting to secure from Washington loan guarantees worth Dollars 10bn to help it absorb hundreds of thousands of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Land concessions The prospect thus opens up of a genuine electoral contest between Likud and Labour - one focused for the first time on a negotiation in progress, fought over the central issue of Jewish settlement in the territories, and perhaps unfolding against a background of real pressure from the US, which is tying approval of the loan guarantees to a freeze on settlement-building in the occupied territories. Implausible as it may seem to outsiders, Mr Shamir will compete with Mr Rabin for the mantle of peacemaker-from-strength - in other words, for the centre-ground of Israeli politics, where polls consistently show that most voters favour peace talks and sometimes that most favour territorial concessions. One not inconceivable result would be the formation of another so-called national unity government incorporating both main parties, as happened after the 1988 election. From the point of view of the peace process, this would not be a disaster. Mr Shamir and Mr Rabin have worked together before, notably in producing a plan for Palestinian elections and self-rule that may resurface in the current peace talks. A Likud-Labour coalition might be strong enough to bypass fractious party politics, ignore the extremists to Mr Shamir's right, and pay serious attention to the critical issues concerning Israel's future that are now under discussion. Outside powers have every interest in encouraging Israelis to elect a more accommodating government, and should not be squeamish about using political or financial pressure to show them where their real interests lie. There is a reasonable chance that, in this election more than in the past, the message will be understood.</p>

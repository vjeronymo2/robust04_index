			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 28 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR] leader  Khieu Samphan has raised the possibility of group members  joining the Cambodian Government and armed forces in a speech to  peace talks in Pyongyang.    In the speech dated Friday, and obtained here Saturday,  Khieu  Samphan said Cambodia should set up a framework "to be used as  the basis for the formation of the national government and the  unified national army which include all the Cambodian national  parties."    The government has yet to give a statement on the progress  of  the talks which started Friday and are scheduled to last until  Monday. Officials said no other information was available  outside Pyongyang.    King Norodom Sihanouk is hosting the talks between  co-premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, parliament  chairman Chea Sim and Khieu Samphan at his residence near the  North Korean capital.    The talks are based on a peace plan proposed by King  Sihanouk  six months ago that would give the Khmer Rouge government posts  in return for ceasing guerrilla activities. They would have to  open up their zones and merge their fighters with the Royal  Cambodian Armed Forces.    The Khmer Rouge earlier expressed support for a ceasefire  proposed by the king and the setting up of a joint ceasefire  commission. But the group said final approval would be dependent  on the participation of international observers.    Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen have already agreed to a  ceasefire if the two sides fail to reach a political solution at  the talks and suggested June 15 as a starting date.    The rebels, however, accused the government Friday of  undermining the peace process by seeking foreign military aid,  citing the visit of a U.S. defence official as evidence that  Washington wanted to arm Phnom Penh.</p>

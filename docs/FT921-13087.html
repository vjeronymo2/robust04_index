			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt falls after steel talks break down PROFIT-taking, a weak Wall Street overnight and consolidation were the watchwords in bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT tried to go higher again, but slipped on a combination of the breakdown of the steel wage talks, and technical factors. The DAX index closed 5.19 lower at 1,680.10 against an intraday high of 1,688.23 and after a fall of 2.08 to 685.12 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume fell from DM9.5bn to DM7.4bn. Mr Jens Wiecking of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that the bond market had been strong for several hours but eventually weakened in the afternoon. As for equities, he said, their relative strength indicator had been saying for several days that the market was overbought. Among blue chips, the gold refiner, chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, Degussa, rose DM6.40 or 2 per cent to DM332.40 after DM339.90, reflecting the move from defensive to cyclical stocks in brokers' buy lists. Thyssen fell DM3 to DM218.30 on the steel talks breakdown. Deutsche Bank rose early on hopes of a rise in its 1991 dividend, peaking at DM711 but then easing back to close unchanged at DM706.50. It said that a final decision on the dividend would be taken in March; last year, the bank gave an early indication of the 1990 payout in late January. PARIS was hit by a wave of selling in the afternoon, which some dealers suspected might be linked to futures arbitrage. The CAC 40 index dropped 26.59 to 1,841.32 in turnover of FFr2.3bn after FFr2.9bn. Leading blue-chips bore the brunt of the day's fall, with BSN losing FFr14 to FFr1,095, Peugeot dropping FFr23 to FFr685 and Total falling FFr45 or 4.1 per cent to FFr1,059. Eurotunnel fell as low as FFr42.70 before recovering to close FFr1.10 lower at FFr44.15 with a hefty 3.2m shares traded after a UK appeals court ruled in favour of Trans-Manche Link, the Anglo-French building consortium in dispute with Eurotunnel on cost overruns. Alcatel Alsthom fell FFr7 to FFr584 as the market gave a thumbs-down to reports in the French press that it was going to take a stake in SGS-Thomson. The company later denied the reports. ZURICH closed mixed in active trade, with banks and some insurers attracting buying interest, while industrials and chemicals consolidated recent gains. The all-share SPI index closed 0.8 higher at 1,111.2 but Union Bank and CS Holding bearers each put on SFr30, to SFr3,810 and SFr1,950. There was some speculation about whether the rating agency, Moody's, would downgrade Credit Suisse, CS Holding's major asset. The decision was expected this week, but Moody's said yesterday that it had not been taken yet. MILAN saw some interest in the insurer Generali, in view of the industry reforms currently going through parliament, but trading was thin. The Comit index fell 1.99 to 537.97 in turnover estimated at L100bn after Tuesday's L103.6bn. Generali was initially weak, falling L105 to an official close of L30,390 but it later rose as high as L30,550 on the kerb. Among industrials, Olivetti added L44 to L2,709 while Fiat shed L95 to L5,080 but recovered to L5,150 after hours. AMSTERDAM ended a quiet session with the CBS Tendency Index closing a fraction higher at 121.2. Selling pressure from Germany caused DAF to fall 4.4 per cent, losing Fl 1.10 to Fl 23.70. In a generally firmer food and drinks sector, brewer Heineken closed up Fl 0.90 at Fl 168.20 after a new 12-month high of Fl 169.40. DSM, the chemicals group, closed up Fl 0.60 at Fl 103.00, although off its day's high of Fl 104.00. Dealers said DSM was still attracting foreign demand in anticipation of an earnings recovery later in the year. Royal Dutch fell Fl 1.10 to Fl 150.40, and Unilever Fl 0.30 to Fl 180.90. MADRID, described by one analyst as apathetic, saw the general index closing down 1.26 at 251.36. Block trades were the only feature to liven the market, and turnover was strong at some Pta18bn. STOCKHOLM closed lower for the second consecutive day due to profit-taking after strong advances and reaction to declines on Wall Street. The Affarsvarlden General index closed down 3.89 at 966.52. Volume remained heavy at SKr456m, down from SKr498m. Astra restricted A shares, open only to Swedish residents, were down SKr3 to SKr512, while the pharmaceutical group's unrestricted A dropped SKr18 to Skr542. Analysts reported that the fall was fuelled by a government statement setting January 1 1993 as the date for the abolition of restricted shares. COPENHAGEN fell with recent buyers taking to the sidelines. Novo Nordisk fell DKr6 to DKr523 on technical selling, and uncertainty about US senate committee hearings which could affect its American sales. The all-share index fell 1.46 to 359.37.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JAN 22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1135.53  1136.16  1138.39  1137.25  1135.60  1134.32  1134.77  1134.07  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1138.46    Day's Low  1133.63  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Jan 21    Jan 20    Jan 17    Jan 16    Jan 15 1136.99   1135.91   1135.24   1131.02   1140.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Gingrich faces trouble in Georgian primary REPRESENTATIVE Newt Gingrich, the mop-headed right-wing Republican from Georgia, has long been the scourge of the Democrats in Congress, castigating their politics, their perks and their personal probity. But the Democrats are now relishing a sweeter revenge than they could have dreamed of: Mr Gingrich today faces a tough primary election against a fellow-Republican who has turned all his taunts against him, branding him as just another Congressional fat cat. Mr Gingrich's gadfly tongue so irritated the Democrats who dominate Georgian politics that they seized the opportunity presented by the 10-yearly redrawing of Congressional district boundaries to squeeze him out of his home constituency in the suburbs south of Atlanta, which he held by fewer than 1,000 votes in 1990. By way of irony, if the Democrats had been less determined to hurt Mr Gingrich, who as the minority whip is the second-ranked Republican in the House of Representatives, they might have stood a better chance of beating him in the general election in November. Instead, Mr Gingrich was forced to move to a much more Republican district in Atlanta's opulent northern suburbs. Although he has been stung by his Republican primary opponent, former state Assemblyman Herman Clark, he seems likely to face a much easier battle against a Democrat in November. Mr Clark's venomous campaign has won national press attention and local kudos, with its echo of Mr Gingrich's own jibes at Congress. He has attacked Mr Gingrich for voting for a Congressional pay rise, and for allegedly writing unfunded cheques on the House bank and abusing Congress members' free mailing privileges. He even forced the Congressman to give up his chauffeur-driven limousine. Mr Gingrich's foes are chuckling to see him running a classic incumbent's campaign, vaunting his ability to bring money from the federal pork barrel to the district.</p>

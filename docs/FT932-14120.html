			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (27): Route to zippier graphics - . . . For Zoom Z is for the last word in graphics: zoom in and see the detail. Better still, rotate it, explode it into components, animate it, change its colour, freeze it, and drop it into a document, surrounded by text. Producing graphics used to be a painfully slow and limited business, restricted by the power of the processor, the resolution of the screen, and the fairly limited capabilities of the software. A decade ago it was a triumph to present two pie charts on the screen with associated text. Now it is possible to see a video running on a workstation, complete with sound. This is partly due to the explosion in desktop computer power, enormous advances in screen resolution, and the development of associated peripherals such as colour printers. Computer graphics are the icing on the cake for some users, who simply want to make their presentations zippier. For others in the printing and pre-press industries, the leaps made in the processing of graphics and images have revolutionised their business. NEW APPLICATIONS Skills that took years to acquire have been outdated by rapid changes in technology, and seem to belong to another century rather than a few years ago. With the spread of low-cost CD-ROM and video disk hardware, and software packages to create interactive applications, multimedia techniques are becoming affordable in everyday applications. Image processing was happening 15 years ago, but using 32-bit processors was beyond the reach of all but specialised businesses. Computer-aided design, CAD, is one of the few areas where the hardware costs more than the software, due to the processing power needed to plot a three-dimensional image, and constantly re-calculate it on the screen for rotation or to show different views. More casual users, for whom graphics are an occasional tool for business presentations, still struggle to get the text in the right place on the slide. Products such as IBM's Storyboard opened up a Pandora's box of filmic and animation effects in the mid-1980s, making them comparatively easy to use. Graphics vendors have removed one of the most tedious tasks, that of entering data, by integrating graphics with other applications. The ability to use data which originates elsewhere has become essential. WordPerfect's Presentations, for example, can take data from other packages, such as Lotus 123. Animation has become commonplace, but ease of use is still an issue. Lotus Development's own Freelance package now incorporates a range of 32 animated effects, such as wipes, fades, flying texts, and 'canned' animations such as a spinning globe, which can be customised with text. The magnifying glass icon provides 'zoom' with close-up detail. 'We've designed Freelance so that people can get good results in half a hour,' says Steve Jack, European brand manager for graphics at Lotus Development. He adds that people have better things to do than fiddle around working on presentation slides late into the night, so Lotus has used multimedia techniques to create an animated, interactive tutorial. COMPUTER POWER Steve Morton, technical director of SAS Institute in the UK, sees computer power as the main factor holding back the rising tide of interest in animation, currently being fuelled by IBM and Microsoft. SAS Institute's SAS/Nvision software produces 3D computer graphics and animation, creating models, rendering images, and animating scenes. It evolved from a US film animation product, Neo-Visuals, acquired by SAS Institute in the late 1980s to incorporate the animation technology into its own SAS information delivery software. 'At the moment there is little interaction with our standard applications for information delivery: you can capture and freeze a business graphic, and then animate it,' explains Morton. 'To be sensible, it requires specialised 3D graphics processors, still a relatively expensive option on workstations. What we envisage is that the ties with live data will become closer, with luck co-inciding with the availability of cheap 24-bit graphics cards for PCs, which would make the technology affordable and practical for business users.' Some users already incorporate graphics into every aspect of their work. Products such as Parametric's Pro/Engineer is typical fo the new generation of Unix products that integrates the entire design-through-manufacturing process. But the Macintosh still leads in visualisation with products such as Abvent's multimedia Zoom, Autodesys' Form-Z, and Electric Image's animation software. Innovation Design Engineering Opportunities, Ideo, uses graphics and animation in every stage of designing products. The technique Ideo calls 'interaction design' applies to pocket mobile phones and microwave ovens as much as to screen interfaces. 'Whenever we design a product with a chip in it, we simulate it to make it more satisfying to use,' says John Stoddard, head of design at Ideo. Ideo uses Macintosh products, Studio 32 to design, and then Macro-mind Director to 'visualise' the display or control panel, and simulate the very behaviour of the product in use. A full-time psychologist assists with the testing process. 'The design is based on solid scientific practice as well as having that creative leap which gives the users pleasure and satisfaction,' says Mr Stoddard. The process also cuts down documentation. Mobile phones commonly come with a hefty 100-page manual whereas Ideo's self-explanatory Dancall boasts a mere six pages. In the 1990s, users are being offered an exciting but very confusing convergence of several different technologies, as the usage of desktop PCs for graphics and presentations expands to include multimedia, and other technologies seep down from the 'top-end' of CAD and print-publishing. The last word belongs to Barnaby Page, editor of a magazine called Pre-Press which keeps 8,000 professionals in the print, design and reproduction industries up to date with the latest in graphics and processing technologies. He has identified a shift in the attitude of users. 'People saw the computer as a means of producing paper, but now they are beginning to see the computer file itself as the original. The by-product might be paper, or just as easily, an animation on CD-ROM.' Once developed, he points out, an animation has several applications, such as a business or sales presentation, or in a freeze-frame form in a printed brochure. He points to Kodak's Photo-CD, a scanner for CD-ROM, as a typical example of how technologies draw together to create new potential - 'in fact, there's nothing new in the technologies themselves . . . it's the combination of them that's powerful.'</p>

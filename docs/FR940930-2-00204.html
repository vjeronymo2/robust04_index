			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The elimination of the requirement to ``retest'' circuits or equipment which are already tested at power cannot create any failure modes which could result in a new or different kind of accident. The controls which presently exist on revisions to procedures and on testing will ensure that any revisions to test procedures which allow testing which is now performed while shutdown to be performed while operating, are technically and operationally acceptable and will not result in an unreviewed safety question and as such will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``during shutdown'' or ``during the REFUELING MODE or COLD SHUTDOWN'' restriction on these surveillance requirements was intended to provide a margin of safety by avoiding unnecessary unit transients and by avoiding placing the unit in an unanalyzed condition. This intention seems reasonable based on the knowledge that portions of the testing should not be performed at power and that doing the entire surveillance test while shutdown should not have an adverse impact. The proposed changes do not affect system performance or acceptance limits. Because a large portion of the testing, and in some cases the entire test, would be performed at power as a result of other requirements or expectations, the proposed technical specification changes eliminate duplicative testing and, as such, will not reduce the margin of safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The impact of revising existing test procedures, as a result of this technical specification change, to allow additional testing to be performed at power, would be properly addressed in the reviews performed as part of the procedure changes, including the required 10 CFR 50.59 review, and when considered along with the reduction in shutdown risk that could result from such changes, it is concluded that such procedure changes will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

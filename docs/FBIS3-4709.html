			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yi Sung-chol] </F>   [Text] The prospect of a South-North envoy exchange has  dimmed as North Korea has failed to express its clear position  on our 28 February proposal that South and North Korea hold a  working-level contact on 1 March for the exchange of envoys.    This means that North Korea has broken the promise it made  after a working-level contact with the United States in New York  on 26 February. North Korea made an abrupt announcement of the  delay in expressing its position after the South-North Liaison  Office at Panmunjom closed at 1600 [0700 GMT] on 28 February,  embarrassing our government.    The government analyzes that North Korea is delaying in  expressing its position because it has not yet made a clear  decision on its position on South-North dialogue. In the course  of its negotiations with the United States, North Korea has  insisted on resolving the nuclear issue through "an agreement  between North Korea and the United States," trying to exclude  South-North dialogue.    North Korea opposed the stipulation of the South-North envoy  exchange up to the last moment in the DPRK-U.S. working-level  contacts that were resumed in New York on 22 February and  created a crisis in which the nuclear inspection team's entry  into North Korea was doubtful.    North Korea is probably calculating that by making the South  lose face on South-North dialogue, it will gain the upper hand  in negotiations when working-level contacts are resumed. This  can be one of the reasons North Korea is delaying in expressing  its position. North Korea, however, is not likely to ultimately  refuse South-North working-level contacts.    It seems that when working-level contacts are resumed,  intensive discussions will be held on the subjects the South and  North Korean envoys will discuss and the method of exchange of  the envoys. South and North Korea failed to reach a complete  agreement on this matter until they concluded the third  working-level contact on 25 October 1993. In the third contact,  they came to a virtual agreement on the level and mission of  envoys by agreeing that "high-level envoys nominated by the top  authorities" of South and North Korea will "deliver verbally  each top authority's intent and personal letter" to the other  side.    Our side proposed hypothetically [chusangjoguro] that "they  discuss the nuclear issue and the implementation of the  South-North basic agreement," while North Korea clearly  suggested that they discuss the implementation of the  declaration of denuclearization, measures for easing tensions  and implementing the North-South agreement, the promotion of the  grand unity of the whole nation, pending issues between the two  sides, and the South-North summit talks.    It seems that there will be no problem with this matter as  our side at a meeting of unification-related ministers on 27  February expressed the position that the envoys "can discuss not  only the nuclear issue and the issue of summit talks, but  anything else."    North Korea's demand for the "suspension of the South's  nuclear war exercise" and the "abandonment of the international  cooperation system," which North Korea persistently raised in  South-North working-level contacts last year -- no matter what  the agenda items of each contact were -- cannot be a big  problem, either, because it will be met automatically when the  North Korean nuclear issue is resolved.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Technology: Blinded by the light - Michiyo Nakamoto explains why recordable compact discs are proving so elusive The crisp, clear digital sound of compact discs, those shiny, silvery plates that bounce little rainbows off their surface, has fundamentally changed the way we listen to music. The problem for audio buffs, however, is that having become used to the superior quality of digital recordings, they still have to make do with dull-sounding conventional analogue tapes if they want to make recordings at home. It is not that the manufacturers have been blind to the potential for this market. Audio tapes that can be used to record music at home, digitally, are already on offer. Sony's digital audio tape has been on the market since 1986 and Philips is launching its digital cassette player this autumn. The quality of sound which digital tapes offer is just as good as that of CDs. But digital tapes are still tapes, with the attendant problems that anyone who has played their favourite tune over and over again is familiar with. So the search has been on for recordable CDs, which would provide random access to any music track. The CDs that are currently available are of the 'read only' type. They are pre-recorded digitally and cannot be recorded on once they have left the factory. To record on a disc, laser technology uses heat to make marks of light and dark. To read what is recorded on a disc, the laser beam goes over the disc and picks up the light and dark marks on it as digital signals, which it then converts into sound signals. Recordable CDs would have to be made in a form that would allow the laser beam in a CD player to make marks on the disc and then read back what was written. There are two technical problems faced by manufacturers making recordable CDs. The laser in the compact disc player picks up certain data from the disc, such as the number of tracks and the length of each, before it will play the disc. This is known as the table of contents. But since recordable CDs, which are blank, do not have a table of contents, the laser cannot pick up the information. Any existing CD player would refuse to play such a disc. This is a problem for Philips and Sony since they are committed to allowing any new CDs to be used on existing players. The other technical obstacle has been that the industry standard for CDs requires them to have 70 per cent reflectivity (the disc has to reflect 70 per cent of the light that hits it) after they have been recorded on. In order for a laser beam to write on the CD, however, the surface needs to be dark enough to absorb the heat from the laser beam. The reflectivity needs to be 15 to 20 per cent. To put a recordable CD on the market, manufacturers have had to come up with a material that has a low enough reflectivity to be recorded on but that will still end up as a shiny disc with a reflectivity of 70 per cent so that it can be played back. The first of these two problems has been overcome by including a function in recordable CD players that will put a table of contents on the disc after it has been recorded. Thus any CD that has been recorded on can then be played on a conventional player. The problem of reflectivity has been solved by Taiyo Yuden, a Japanese electronics company. Taiyo put a chemical layer just above the layer of metal coating in the CD on which the laser beam would make its marks and off which it would read them. The chemical layer is easily activated by heat. When the laser beam hits this layer it reacts with the heat and works on the underlying metal coating to make the necessary marks. Taiyo's recordable CDs have been on the market for professional use and for use in computers at a cost of about Y4,400 (Pounds 20). The disc has a life expectancy of 100 years, says Taiyo. However, the company has no immediate plans to manufacture recordable CDs for the consumer market, largely due to the high price of recordable players which still sell at about Y1m. It is also unlikely that the price of the recordable discs will fall in the foreseeable future on a par with pre-recorded CDs. The high price is mostly due to the complex manufacturing process and mass production may not automatically bring the price down. Plasmon, a Cambridge-based manufacturer of optical discs, and Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss chemical company, have agreed a joint development project to produce a second type of recordable CD which would use what they claim is a more stable chemical than that used by Taiyo. Plasmon is hoping to bring the price down to Pounds 5 within five years. Meanwhile, others are working on rewritable CDs. Sony has opted to develop magneto optics, a technology that uses light, heat and magnetism, for its minidisc system of small recordable CDs. Matsushita, on the other hand, has opted for the 'phase change' approach based on laser technology, which it already employs in recordable and rewritable systems for computers.</p>

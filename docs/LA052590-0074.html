			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL PARK CONCESSIONAIRES BLOCK RELEASE OF FEDERAL AUDIT  </P> <P> National park concessionaires, accused of earning excessive profits at the  government's expense, have blocked release of a government audit to prevent  their finances from being made public, a congressional committee said Thursday.  </P> <P> The audit, a detailed appraisal of problems outlined in an Interior Department  task force report released in April, was conducted by the agency's inspector  general and contains specific profit figures for businesses that operate  concessions in national parks.  </P> <P> A group representing the concessionaires was granted a temporary restraining  order Wednesday from a federal court in the District of Columbia, preventing  release of audit information that the concessionaires consider confidential.  </P> <P> A copy of the audit, with the disputed material removed, was released Thursday  by the House Interior and Insular Affairs subcommittee on national parks and  public lands.  </P> <P> "These findings seem to paint a picture of sweetheart deals, whether intended  as such or not, resulting in excess profits at taxpayer expense," said Rep.  Bruce F. Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the subcommittee.  </P> <P> More than 100 private firms operate concessions in 355 national parks, many  holding several contracts. They range from small food stands to large  operations.  </P> <P> The April task force report criticized current government policies, such as  giving concessionaires preferential rights to renew their contracts, granting  contracts for as long as 30 years and reducing fees in return for physical  improvements to concession property.  </P> <P> After reviewing 45 of the 500 concession contracts in force, the auditors  concluded that "the U.S. Treasury did not receive adequate fees from the larger  concessioners in the national parks," Inspector General James R. Richards told  the subcommittee.  </P> <P> Richards said that while the concessions generated gross receipts of $500  million in 1988, the National Park Service received only $12.5 million in  franchise fees, or about 2.5% of the concession revenues.  </P> <P> But Phyllis O'Connell, secretary of the Conference of Park Concessioners, told  the subcommittee that the audit was conducted "in relative isolation from many  facts needed for full evaluation."  </P></p>

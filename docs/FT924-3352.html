			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (4): A global game for allies and rivals - New exchanges around the world have reduced the Chicago giants' market share / Technology has broken down domestic barriers and spanned time-zones THE FUTURES industry is becoming increasingly competitive, as new exchanges spring up around the world and competing exchanges launch rival products. Paradoxically, this has spurred greater interest in creating links between exchanges. Technological advances have enabled traders around the world to come together on screen-based systems, while the breakdown of barriers between domestic markets has furthered the internationalisation of futures as well as cash markets. The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), after 10 years of dynamic growth, have seen their world market share fall in the last year or so, due to growing competition from European exchanges, though year-on-year volume continues to grow and membership sales in the second half of 1992 hit record levels. As a share of global futures trading, volume on the CME and CBOT dropped to 40 per cent this year, compared with 80 per cent in 1985. In the first half of 1992, the CME and the CBOT saw volume grow at 28 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. But volume on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) surged 84 per cent rate, and on Germany's Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) jumped 143 per cent. Chicago has a natural disadvantage in its time-zone. While European centres sit in the middle of the world's financial markets, overlapping Asia's afternoon and North America's morning, Chicago gets the tail end of London's afternoon, and misses Japan entirely. In 1983, the CME franchised an exchange in Singapore to capture business in a portion of the world that slept while Chicago traded. It aimed to capture the interest of Hong Kong and Tokyo traders with the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, in advance of Japan's entrance into the financial futures arena. But the Simex project was quickly overtaken by new exchanges in Japan and other parts of the Pacific, and there have been no other franchises. By 1987 Chicago exchanges were turning from aggressive expansion to defensive market positioning as foreign competition increased. That year the CME proposed a sort of electronic futures supermarket with the potential to offer products from every exchange in the world 24 hours a day. In June, Globex, the international after-hours screen trading system, was finally launched after five years in development by the CME, CBOT and Reuter, at an estimated cost of Dollars 80m (Pounds 43m). So far only the Marche a Terme International de France (Matif) has joined the system. Its French bond futures will start trading on the system in the first quarter of next year. But at least a half dozen other exchanges, including the Sydney Futures Exchange and Liffe, are in advanced discussions on signing up to Globex Liffe appears to be getting closer to agreement on two stumbling blocks  - the length of its initial commitment to the system, and the terms for listing contracts on Globex. Exchanges have also been in engaged in bilateral attempts at mutual offset trading. The CBOT has been courting Liffe, offering to swap part-time rights to its 10-year US Treasury note contract for night-time trading rights to Liffe's successful Bund and Italian Bond futures. Old rivalries and a leadership change at the Liffe have so far prevented consummation of the deal. This would be only the second link of its kind, after the agreement between the CME and Simex, on their Eurodollar contracts. In a recent letter to members, Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said the exchange was discussing with the CBOT 'the possible establishment of a mutual offset arrangement for certain products. This approach is consistent with your board's long-held view that the trading of identical products in different time zones is best achieved by exchange linkages,' he added. The DTB, Liffe's rival for dominance of Bund futures trading, is also in negotiation with Globex, and is further considering links, outside Globex, with the CBOT, or with other exchanges. 'We are still in talks with the CBOT and Globex, but there are some legal obstacles,' said Mr Jorg Franke, chief executive of the DTB. Until new laws are introduced next year, the DTB's plans will be hampered by its inability to comply with US rules on disclosure and market supervision. The DTB is also planning to expand internationally by establishing trading terminals throughout Europe. The exchange hopes to have terminals in London during the first half of next year. Meanwhile, some smaller European exchanges have already joined together in an effort to broaden their distribution. The European Options Exchange in the Netherlands, OM Group, with exchanges in Stockholm and London, and Switzerland's Soffex signed a co-operation agreement in May. The alliance, known as First European Exchanges (Fex) has since been further expanded by the admission of Otob, the Austrian exchange. They plan to offer local access to derivative financial products developed on other exchanges. Meanwhile, some exchanges are still trying to grab contracts from other time zones, a less than convincing competitive strategy, although it does generate volume and preserves certain opportunities. In the past five years Chicago has launched two Japanese stock index futures contracts, a yen bond contract, English stock index futures, and a handful of currency cross-rate futures. Versions of the CBOT's US Treasury bond futures trade at the Liffe and the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the CME's highly successful Eurodollar futures contract has been imitated by the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange. The New York-based Comex, best known for its precious metals contracts, this month expanded its trading hours in a different direction. In a bid to bolster its fledgling Eurotop 100 contract, it is asking its traders to open the pit at 0530 EDT to catch part of the European morning stock markets. But despite direct competition, the CBOT still keeps a stranglehold on US bond futures, the Osaka Securities Exchange still dominates the Nikkei-225 index market, and Liffe trades far and away more FTSE-100 contracts per day than the CME. Whether the future lies in Globex, which has yet to prove itself, or in bilateral links between exchanges, greater co-operation between exchanges seems to be on the way. Although competition in some areas remains fierce, exchanges seem to be finding that their common interests exceed their points of conflict. 'We currently have more than 20 futures and options exchanges in Europe (including those dealing in commodity derivatives), and we have to look at how to come together,' said Mr Franke, of the DTB.</p>

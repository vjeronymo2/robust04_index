			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party President Ricardo Lagos by </F> Monica Gonzalez in Santiago, date not given; first paragraph is  LA NACION introduction]    [Text] Thin, cat-like Ricardo Lagos radiates happiness. And  not because of the election results. One could say that from the  ideas brewing in his head and the movements of his hands, he has  been concocting something new over the past few months and has  finally found the occasion to put it in the oven. Alongside his  wife, Luisa Duran, he laughs heartily in his new home, a  beautiful apartment in Providencia. The evidence is clear that  now is a fine time for him to take on new challenges that are  not confrontational. Lagos's new undertaking will create  problems for him with the officers of the PPD [Party for  Democracy] and with other well-known figures from his sector;  there can be no doubt that he is a difficult person. Nor can  there be any doubt that we will soon find out whether he will be  in the new cabinet.    [Gonzalez] The results of an election prompt individual  politicians to assess how they have been affected. Do you think  that the absence of your name from the ballot was a good thing?    [Lagos] The country wanted an election like this one, in  which the lines were drawn very clearly in advance, inasmuch as  people realized that the Coalition was the only real choice to  form a government. And this is what happened.    [Gonzalez] Was it the election that the country deserved?    [Lagos] No! Chile has gone through epic, exhausting events  and wanted to have a calm election like this one.    [Gonzalez] Deep down, would you have liked to see your name  on the ballot?    [Lagos] Whether someone appears on the ballot depends on  circumstances, and I do not think that circumstances were right  for me to be on it.    [Gonzalez] What would have happened if there had not been  primaries?    [Lagos] My name would have been on the ballot! That is the  way it would have been, as I always said. The primary election,  above and beyond its results, lent dignity to public life, which  consists not of negotiation but rather ideas and principles.  Everybody was asking what Lagos was demanding to withdraw. I did  not ask for anything! I am proud of that! The primaries were a  major source of dignity for our world.    It was an intelligent way of dealing with a dilemma and, in  passing, lent tremendous legitimacy to Eduardo Frei in our world.    [Gonzalez] We also saw that the PS [Socialist Party]-PPD  world is afraid of confrontation.    [Lagos] Well...Life has been tough (He laughs  mischievously).    [Gonzalez] Aren't you afraid of it?    [Lagos] No. What is more, confrontation is part of the  democratic system. The results of the senatorial elections,  which appear elsewhere in this paper, are tremendously  encouraging. Just look at how the senatorial candidates of the  PDC [Christian Democrat Party] and the PR [Radical Party] did  and how the PS-PPD did. They were quite even, which enables us  to look to the future with optimism. Competition is not bad for  us.    [Gonzalez] Isn't there a fear of losing positions, ground,  power?    [Lagos] That would be very petty thinking, and I would  rather  think about other things...But it takes all kinds. I do think  that a lot of people became set in their ways. There were  friends of the congressional world who thought that if there  were two candidates or a confrontation, they would lose their  seat. And just look at where we stand. I have once again  traveled around Chile supporting our candidates because they are  all running against the DC [Christian Democracy] or someone  backed by the DC. When all is said and done, there is  competition. I have always said: the party that has the  presidential candidate has a very big advantage.    [Gonzalez] Has it been hard for you to play the supporting  role on stage?    [Lagos] Actually...no! I have accompanied Frei and when I do  so, I am number two, in the background, because that is my  place. The truth is that I have not found it hard!    [Gonzalez] How are your relations with the PPD?    [Lagos] I have good relations with my friends in the rank  and  file, in the regions, and we have had a different way of  approaching certain problems with their leaders. You are talking  about a party that has come of age and that does what it feels  it ought to do.    [Gonzalez] Is your heart divided between the PS and the PPD?    [Lagos] No, my heart lies firmly with a single agenda, and  this is what has to be pursued, and in earnest. We have walked a  long road, and the time has come, not tomorrow or the day after.  These are not immediate issues....    [Gonzalez] But just a few months ago you thought that a  merger of the PS and PPD was imminent.    [Lagos] Yes.    [Gonzalez] What stopped it?    [Lagos] Many still think that they can manage the little  spheres that they have. The real world will teach them that when  you have a battleship traveling at 30 knots and, alongside it,  two small motorboats each going 10 knots, the motorboats cannot  measure up to the battleship. You have to try something new and  different. And I think that what happened in this election  proves me right.    [Gonzalez] Is Ricardo Lagos advocating a new movement?    [Lagos] Yes.    [Gonzalez] And what will you do if you do not become a  minister this time?    [Lagos] I do not think that being a minister is all there is  to life. My project today is to put together a group for  reflection and thought and to try and marshal the 1,800 or 2,000  professionals who took an active part in our program.    [Gonzalez] Are you talking about a movement that is  independent of the parties?    [Lagos] No, with the parties. All of these professionals  belong to the parties, aside from the ones who are independents.  But I think that it is important to have a place for reflection  and thought, for coming together, but not a research center. The  idea, rather, is to make sure that this major effort can sustain  and develop itself so that it does not go to waste. When we did  "Chile 21," I told them that this did not end with the  elections. This is why we have undertaken this project.    [Gonzalez] Max Neef has said that they will start today to  build a movement that aims to become a swarm of mosquitoes.  Isn't this the same thing that you are proposing?    [Lagos] Ha, ha, ha. No, these are professionals, not  mosquitoes. I think that it is important to have a place where  people can express their views no matter what party they belong  to.    [Gonzalez] I will say it again. The movement that you are  calling for sounds like something new outside the parties that  exist today.    [Lagos] No, it is not outside the parties. Is the Freedom  and  Development Institute outside the parties or is it a channel  through which the right expresses itself?    [Gonzalez] So what you want is to start the unification  process from the side, not head on.    [Lagos] (Laughs) No! But if that helps, fine. But this is  not  my aim, because we do not want to wind up with anything  organizational.    [Gonzalez] Honestly, aren't you interested in joining the  administration?    [Lagos] One joins an administration when one is invited, and  the person who does the inviting is the president, not the  candidates. Consequently, I was not able to receive an  invitation.    [Gonzalez] And what if you receive one tomorrow?    [Lagos] I would feel very honored, and at that point I would  have to see what things look like, what the overall team looks  like, what other people are in there. I try to think about how  it was when I joined President Aylwin's cabinet. We talked about  what the cabinet was going to be like, its makeup, and at one  point he asked me to be justice minister. I told him that I did  not think so, that if things went too well for me, he might not  remain president (laughs loudly again). And if I failed...He  hinted at another ministry. I asked him whether what he wanted  was to have me in the cabinet. He said yes, that the country  would not understand it if I were not a part of his  administration and that he would have to explain that I was not  in there because I did not accept the post he offered me. In  that case, Mr. President, I said, I am going to work with you.  President Aylwin was very kind to me.    [Gonzalez] What you wanted was to choose a ministry, wasn't  it?    [Lagos] I told him Education.    [Gonzalez] Are you going to be the new interior minister in  the Frei administration?    [Lagos] I do not know. I cannot answer that. I might accept  any ministry. Any one is a great honor, depending on the  conditions in which it operates.    [Lagos] Do you agree with Genaro Arriagada that the next  administration will lay a new groundwork?    [Lagos] If we are able to rebuild certain foundations for  greater democracy, it would be very significant. I do think that  we have to propose this at the outset, not at the end. The best  proof has been the shortening of the presidential term. The  conditions are in place for this to happen once the appointed  senators disappear and more important reforms can be proposed.  At the outset I would bring up the issue of reforming the  electoral system. There are other, more complex and difficult  issues, but at the outset at least I would focus on the  electoral system. Otherwise we run the risk of holding a broad  theoretical debate on the things that we ought to do.    [Gonzalez] What differences do you perceive between the  alliance that will presumably govern as of March and the  outgoing one?    [Lagos] First of all, the agenda is different. President  Aylwin's agenda has been typical of a transition:  civilian-military relations, human rights violations, containing  potential social outbursts, restoring freedom in culture,  education, and the intelligentsia. And lastly, incorporating  Chile into the world.    Today, in contrast, as a result of Aylwin's partially  successful agenda (because we have not settled the human rights  issue or taken care of civilian-military relations, but we have  made headway), these issues are much lower on the agenda. And  there is a very strong perception that although the country has  had growth, it has not benefited everyone alike. This is why the  number one item on the agenda is how do we see to it that  progress benefits everyone.    [Gonzalez] Not the gains of the political transition?    [Lagos] No, there is still much to be done in connection  with  human rights, but the next administration is going to be judged  by what it does in connection with the first item on the agenda.  The speeches that we all heard cannot be repeated, like the one  in which Aylwin asked for forgiveness on Chile's behalf for what  happened in the area of human rights. The challenges are  different.    [Gonzalez] Was the cabinet's last stage as successful as the  first?    [Lagos] That is an unfair question because it creates the  impression that someone was very important in the cabinet, which  is not true. But the final stage is different from the first.  The president tried to address two or three issues, and I  honestly think that he addressed them poorly. I thought that it  would be difficult, if not impossible, to pass a law to resolve  the problem of the missing detainees with the backing of the  right. How is the right going to back anything that would  satisfy us! Overall, though, the administration is leaving  office with a spectacular approval rating that any other would  be hard put to achieve.    [Gonzalez] How are your relations with President Aylwin?    [Lagos] Very good and with his wife Leonor too. Her  understanding of her position has been exceptional.    [Gonzalez] How are your relations with Eduardo Frei?    [Lagos] They are good. I think that before the primary  elections we had good relations and when they were over, they  were even better. This is amusing because we ran against each  other in the primaries but became closer friends. Ours is a  relationship in which we speak frankly.    [Gonzalez] Do you have confidence in him as Chile's next  president?    [Lagos] Yes. He joined public life out of a major ethical  commitment. I have never talked with him about why he left  private life and got involved in this. I think that he felt he  had a job to do. When you see him giving speeches and traveling  around, particularly in small towns, with few people, you see  that he feels deeply motivated by what can be done. As a result,  he has acquitted himself well. At this point no one thinks that  he is just a name.    [Gonzalez] Did you think that at one time?    [Lagos] Honestly, when you looked at him at the beginning,  you thought that it would be very unlikely that he would get  where he has gotten. He had problems communicating and has made  great progress. Being president obviously does not require a  gift for communication, but he developed one, besides the other  qualities that are required and that he possesses. He has clear  ideas on basic directions and delegates a great deal.    [Gonzalez] It was easy for the ministers, you included, to  show obedience to Aylwin. Will it also be easy with Frei?    [Lagos] I think so. He has a leadership that he will have to  maintain from day to day. Leaderships are not permanent.    [Gonzalez] You are well aware of that, aren't you?    [Lagos] Yes (laughing). It is one thing to be president and  another to remain in the ascendancy. Aylwin was able to assert  his leadership in the sense that if you had a disagreement with  a minister, and I did, you went to talk with the president, and  whether he agreed or disagreed with you, you knew for certain  that his decision had nothing to do with whether the other  minister was from the DC or not. The thought never occurred to  me. He was the president, period.    [Gonzalez] Do you have doubts that it will be the same under  Frei?    [Lagos] The two or three times that I have asked Frei to do  something, he has done so with total independence. That is the  basis for leadership.    [Gonzalez] Will the parties play a different role under the  next administration?    [Lagos] That has been said often, but I find it hard to  understand how it will happen. It arises from a real situation;  it is a desire that I think President Frei shares. What I am not  clear about is how it will come to pass. And I realize that it  is different, because Aylwin's cabinet was a continuation of the  Coalition. In contrast, a different relationship is going to  develop as the parties conduct their talks through channels  other than the ministers. We have to establish a relationship  between the parties and the president that does not entail a  joint government, of course.    [Gonzalez] What would you say has been the Aylwin  administration's weak point?    [Lagos] The fact that the constitutional reforms should have  been proposed at its outset, not its end.    [Gonzalez] And its strong point?    [Lagos] The reconciliation that it achieved and the  leadership that it developed vis-a-vis all Chileans.    [Gonzalez] What has happened with Pinochet after a four-year  transition?    [Gonzalez] This is Aylwin's strong point. Everyone is  asking:  "Where is Pinochet?" Foreigners find it hard to believe that he  is no longer a factor in spite of his expressions of displeasure  with the government. Pinochet can dress himself up in warrior's  garb and send his soldiers out on the streets (he has yet to  send out his tanks); he can do all that and more, but the only  thing that he cannot do is stage a coup d'etat. The world is  different. Circumstances are completely different, although  legally speaking things have not changed.    [Gonzalez] Is that why his arbitrary power lost its effect  when people stopped being afraid?    [Lagos] People are still a bit afraid. Many thought, for  example, that Lagos may be fine but he could cause something  like that...If you let yourself dream but see the risk of  interrupting the present calm, then you conclude that it would  be better to postpone your dreams. This is still the case in  Chile. But the country senses that a job remains to be done.    [Gonzalez] Today we can see the PPD moving more towards the  center to vie for voters with the PDC. Does this strategy put  you off?    [Lagos] No. I have always thought that our role is to become  a party that commands a majority in the country, and this means  covering a broad spectrum. The thing is, though, that you do not  control the center or the left just by taking positions more  towards the center or left. You control them with visions of  what you want the country to be. And you do not do this in  day-to-day work; you do not do this on small things: if the  other person disagrees, then I abstain and move more to the  center. No!    [Gonzalez] Is this why you are proposing a new movement of  professionals?    [Lagos] Because I think that certain visions of Chile are  lacking. I was invited to a gathering in honor of Anibal Pinto  on the 35th anniversary of his book Chile: un caso de  desarrollo frustrado [Chile: A Case of Thwarted  Development]. Chile was thwarted because late last century  no one thought about the medium term. People thought that the  sodium nitrate boom was going to last forever. Vargas Llosa's  question "At what point did Peru mess up?" has great  significance for us. A party captures the imagination of most of  society, not the center, when it expresses a clear-cut agenda.  This is what remains to be done.    [Gonzalez] Didn't Manfred Max-Neef occupy the space that  Lagos left when he withdrew from the race?    [Lagos] No, I would have gotten more votes than Max-Neef  (guffaws again). Let's be serious! Max-Neef has sought to  express a different way of interpreting public life and to bring  up certain issues that he said were missing.    [Gonzalez] And what would you call them?    [Lagos] I was very mindful of them, and they exist, but my  way of addressing them is different. The votes that Max-Neef got  are a factor that the PS and the PPD have to analyze in earnest,  because they always thought that the MIDA [Allendist Leftist  Democratic Movement] was the big problem. And that is not the  case.    [Gonzalez] You have said that the MIDA is obsolete.    [Lagos] Of course, because I do not see the problem there. I  have always said: Watch out! Every society requires a force that  embodies change. And if we are not the ones, it will be someone  else. And the votes that Max-Neef got came from the people who  thought that the Coalition or we, as part of it, were incapable  of bringing about enough change. I spoke with a lot of people  who voted for Max-Neef and for the PS and PPD in the  congressional elections, and that explanation sounded right to  them. It shows that we have not been explicit enough in saying  what we want to do.    [Gonzalez] And so?    [Lagos] We have to find a way of understanding and drawing  near this very obvious group. When I say that there is a great  chance of creating a movement, a party, in short, something new,  it is because we have to be capable of making this effort.</p>

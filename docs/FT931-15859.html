			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Grade names new director of programmes at Channel 4 MR Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, demonstrated some of his legendary chutzpah yesterday when he named the successor to Ms Liz Forgan, director of programmes, before her departure was formally announced. The BBC will announce on Monday that Ms Forgan - who was hired by Channel 4's founding chief executive Mr Jeremy Isaacs when she went to interview him for The Guardian newspaper - will be moving to the corporation. It is believed her new job will be to run BBC Television, but not as deputy director-general. Mr Grade, a former managing director-designate of BBC Television, decided to make his move in advance of the BBC's announcement by naming Mr John Willis, Ms Forgan's deputy, as her successor. Channel 4 issued a statement yesterday: 'Commenting on Liz Forgan's departure, Michael Grade said: 'We are all very sad to say farewell to Liz',' it said. Channel 4 also paid tribute to her commissioning of Channel 4 News; the creation of Right to Reply, the programme for viewers to comment on programmes; and for originating the Video Box, which allows people to walk in off the street and record their views for the programme. However, it did not say where she was going. The announcement of Ms Forgan's appointment to the BBC will be accompanied by the first public indications of Mr John Birt's philosophy since he took over formally as director-general of the BBC on Monday. All the signs are that Mr Birt will be looking for a powerful deputy to handle a fundamental reorganisation of the corporation. The BBC has been embarrassed by an overspend in its television budget which totalled Pounds 38m in the 1991-92 financial year. It is facing a potential overspend this year of at least Pounds 20m. The BBC refuses to put a final figure on the overspend but some in the organisation believe the total could be about Pounds 90m over the two-year period. An obvious candidate to be Mr Birt's deputy would be Mr Bob Phillis, chief executive of Independent Television News and former managing director of Central Independent Television. Mr Phillis is credited with improving financial disciplines at ITN where there were embarrassing, but smaller, overspends. ITN is in the middle of a shake-up of its ownership - some conditions of a transfer of its ownership from the original 15 ITV companies to a seven-company consortium led by Carlton Communications have been met, but the deal has not yet been completed. There has also been unconfirmed speculation that Mr David Hatch, managing director of BBC Radio, may soon decide to leave. Letters, Page 9</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by D. Isaacson] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 20 SAPA -- The National Party  [NP] could enter into a post election alliance with two parties  to gain control of the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] region, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha said  on Wednesday [20 April].    Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg, he said the  NP stood a good chance of winning the region on its own or  through an alliance with two parties which had similar policies.  Mr Botha declined to name the parties, saying it would be  improper to do so because they were presently opponents.    NP PWV premier designate Oulaas van Zyl said he had received  a report by a reputable company showing the African National  Congress' support in the region had dropped to less than 50  percent.    If the ANC and Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] received less  than 50 percent combined, the NP and other parties would work  together anyway, he added.    Mr van Zyl dismissed reports that Johannesburg's old city  council offices would house the new regional parliament, saying  the venue would be decided after proper investigation. Minister  of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer added Soweto as a  possibility.    Mr Botha suggested PWV was not a sufficiently romantic name  for a province, and suggested the new region be entitled  Transvaal.    Mr Meyer highlighted the importance of the province, saying  it was the financial powerhouse of South Africa which, in turn,  was the powerhouse of Africa.</p>

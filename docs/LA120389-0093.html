			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTING ON WITH IT IN HYPERDRIVE;  </P> <P> AFTER 'CATS' AND 'PHANTOM,' CHOREOGRAPHER GILLIAN LYNNE HAS SET HER SIGHTS ON  THE FILM VERSION OF 'LES MISERABLES'  </P> <P> The odds are that she even sleeps fast. It's impossible to imagine Gillian  Lynne, England's top commercial choreographer, in any state of repose.  </P> <P> That's probably one of the reasons why Lynne seems to be in such good physical  condition. Even though she's laughingly admitted her age by saying she'll be 74  in the year 2,000, she still has a body that any member of "A Chorus Line"  would kill for.  </P> <P> Unlike her American counterparts however, Lynne makes no real effort to hide  her age. She seems proud of the crow's feet and is the sort of practical woman  whom you could never picture nipping off for a face lift.  </P> <P> Lately Lynne's been strutting her stuff in rehearsal for a Burt Bacharach  British television special that she has conceived, choreographed and is  directing for Christmas broadcast.  </P> <P> In the studio she's an unstoppable whirlwind dealing with 14 different things  all at once. Camera angles, dance steps, costume approval and dialogue  re-writes -- to say nothing of selecting from the bewildering variety of  luggage assembled as candidates for the "Trains and Boat and Planes" number.  </P> <P> Fame came to Lynne with "Cats" and she capped it off with "The Phantom of the  Opera." Being involved in the creation of two worldwide mega-hits has given her  the financial freedom to pretty much do as she wishes and what she wants to do  most now is direct a movie.  </P> <P> Her upcoming project as choreographer on the film version of "Les Miserables"  (which she had nothing to do with in its stage incarnation) could be viewed as  a trial run for that ultimate ambition.  </P> <P> A couple of seasons back Lynne took full control of a West End production when  she directed and choreographed a revival of "Cabaret." It didn't go down too  sweetly with the critics, but that hasn't deterred Lynne from directorial  aspirations.  </P> <P> One of the fascinating things about Lynne is that she's an adult working in the  youth-oriented world of dance gypsies. The Bacharach project is populated by a  gang who dance as well as sing and even get to say the occasional line of  linking dialogue.  </P> <P> Lynne and her co-creator, music man Marvin Laird, have taken Bacharach's songs  and meshed them together into something like a television pop opera. There are  five leading characters: Juliette Prowse, Ute Lemper, Michael Howe, Philip  Casnoff and Daniel Massey, who plays a philosophical bartender. Their lives are  linked, split and re-glued via the lyrics, backed up and illustrated by the  choreography.  </P> <P> Lynne, no matter what her chronological age, still looks like the best dancer  in the rehearsal room. She's a coaxer, a prodder who massages dancers towards  what she's after rather than terrorizing them into line.  </P> <P> She won't take less than 100%, but she also knows enough about her profession  to let some things go for the moment. Instead, she shoots Australian assistant,  Joanne Robinson, a note. She'll get back to it later.  </P> <P> Prowse, who has spent all morning in a costume fitting, materializes, watches  for a couple of seconds and then without even being asked, steps in at the  right place to join the dancers in a bridging step that links one song to the  next.  </P> <P> Later, when she's off-stage, Prowse sits on the sidelines working on an  elaborately detailed crewel tablecloth which is big enough to give some  indication of the long hours that even the most prestigious of stars has to  spend waiting around in rehearsal studios and on sound stages.  </P> <P> Massey, in the meantime, is meticulously practicing pouring just the right  amount into a cocktail glass without having to look down at it.  </P> <P> Lynne takes it all in and does so as if she herself were the camera. She's  constantly darting from corner to corner, trying to be a lens. From the outset  this project has been storyboarded in her mind (with each camera shot worked  out ahead of time so that when they move from the London rehearsal studios to  the Liverpool sound stage, there will be little shooting time wasted).  </P> <P> For one big scene she follows a weaving path in, around and through the dancers  so that they can get a sense of where the camera is going to be tracking.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Martin James, who is a principal dancer with English National Ballet  (the newly re-christened London Festival Ballet) has gone off with his parent  company on an American tour. He's being used in a specialty number that starts  out very classical and slowly transforms into jazz dance.  </P> <P> Last year, Lynne, who began her dancing career with the Royal Ballet in 1944,  returned to her roots to choreograph a work for Manchester-based Northern  Ballet Theatre. That project, "A Simple Man," started out on the tube as well  and ended being nominated for all sorts of awards. It starred Royal Ballet  alumnus Christopher Gable, the artistic director of the Northern company, as  L.S. Lowry, the famed Lancashire artist who was then having a centenary  anniversary.  </P> <P> Between them Lynne and Gable managed to coax Moira Shearer, another Royal  luminary and the star of "The Red Shoes," out of retirement to play the  character role of Lowry's disapproving, domineering mother.  </P> <P> On Nov. 21, Lynne danced in public for the first time in 25 years, replacing  Shearer in an excerpt (with Gable) from the ballet at the annual Royal Command  Performance at the London Palladium.  </P> <P> As soon as the Bacharach program is in the can, Lynne hot foots it back to  Manchester to create her second ballet for Northern, this time inspired by the  famed Royal Riding School in Vienna. Then it's a Metropolitan Opera debut when  she works with Harold Prince on "Faust."  </P> <P> The twosome really clicked on "Phantom" and Lynne proudly points out that  Prince turned over several of the scenes to her from the beginning of  rehearsals. "He said what he wanted them to be like in general and told me to  get on with it."  </P> <P> It's clear that getting on with it is a Gillian Lynne specialty. She's good at  spot decisions and obviously has enough faith in her own powers of judgment to  keep the projects bouncing in the air.  </P> <P> Brushing her hair back, she gives a husky laugh and crows, "If my friends could  see me now."  </P></p>

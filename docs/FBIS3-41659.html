Though  the process of replacing them with products  (hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and hydrofluorocarbons  (HFC's] that cause less damage to the ozone layer is now  proceeding extremely rapidly, old refrigerators still contain  the much feared gas.    The solution to this problem comes from Bologna and is  called  ICF (Refrigerator Components Company) and ENEA [Agency for New  Technologies, Energy, and the Environment]. The joint effort  between the Emilia-based company and the research body has led  to the development of Cleaner 12 and Cleaner 134: semiautomatic  systems for the recovery and recycling of CFC's that are capable  of regenerating the R12 and R143a gas. The Cleaner is a filter  system. The CFC is separated by evaporating the oil from the  system and is filtered a first time. Two other filtering  stations are used to neutralize the acidity, absorb humidity,  and withhold the solid particles. A third filter completes the  purifying operation and finally the cryogenic gas that is  regenerated is stored in a dosage container.    The Cleaner can also automatically load and unload the  purified gas directly into the refrigeration system by simply  using different pressure levels. The ENEA-ICF patent is  currently the only means of recycling CFC's. Another CFC  treatment system is thermal destruction. This operation  requires a great deal of energy and is a highly costly one. The  technology tested by ICF is suitable not only for the treatment  of CFC's but also for the HCFC's and HFC's that are currently  used as CFC substitutes.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GAMBRELL CASE CASTS A SHADOW OVER FOOTBALL TEAM AT MOORPARK  </P> <P> It was late afternoon and the sun danced across the Moorpark College athletic  field as another football practice began. It was, as the long shadows plainly  showed, nearly the end of another day. But for James Gambrell, this day, this  very long day, was about to begin.  </P> <P> Gambrell had loosened up with his teammates and was preparing to break off into  his specialty group with the other receivers. But before the first pass was  thrown, the field became smothered in silence. Two men in suits and ties were  striding slowly but purposefully toward midfield. Toward Gambrell.  </P> <P> In seconds, one of them brought out a pair of handcuffs and snapped them  smartly onto Gambrell's wrists. Then, flanking the 19-year-old football player,  they led him off the field as his teammates and coaches looked on in stunned  silence.  </P> <P> Gambrell, Moorpark's leading receiver, faces a felony charge of assault for his  alleged role in the beating death of a fellow student earlier this year. His  preliminary hearing is Nov. 17. If convicted, he faces as many as four years in  prison and a $10,000 fine.  </P> <P> He is not the first Moorpark football player to be charged in the attack on  John Flores, 19, who died from massive head injuries sustained during a brawl  at a party in Thousand Oaks on Jan. 20.  </P> <P> In August, Larnell Bush, a defensive back who starred for the Raiders last  season and was expected back this year, was sentenced to 90 days in jail after  being convicted of assault against Flores. He is due to be released from jail  later this month after serving 60 days.  </P> <P> The cloud hanging over the Moorpark team in the wake of Bush's felony  conviction and the felony charges against Gambrell has apparently not affected  the team's play, however. The Raiders are 4-1 this season, their lone defeat a  one-point loss last week to Bakersfield, the junior college national champion  in 1988.  </P> <P> And Gambrell, a sophomore from Clovis, Calif., who was the team's top receiver  last season, is having another outstanding season. He has 20 receptions for 263  yards.  </P> <P> "We've all learned how to leave our personal problems off the field," Moorpark  receiver Pete Marine said. "We can hang up our problems in our lockers when  it's time to play."  </P> <P> The first repercussion -- Bush's arrest and conviction -- from that ill-fated  party in January shocked Moorpark administrators, students and coaches during  the winter and again in the summer. The second stark reminder swept down on  Moorpark's campus with a heavy hand Oct. 5, the day of Gambrell's arrest on the  practice field.  </P> <P> "That was tough," Marine said. "When they took James off the field that day, it  was a real shock."  </P> <P> Mack Humphrey, a defensive back, said that the action left his teammates  speechless.  </P> <P> "We had heard about the trouble from the party," he said, "but we really didn't  think much of it. We figured it was all over and done with. But then, when  those two guys in suits walk across our practice field and handcuff your  starting receiver and take him away, that was a real shock. I think a lot of us  were stunned."  </P> <P> Gambrell was released later that day on $5,000 bail and he returned to practice  the next day. He played a fine game a day later against Pierce College, leading  the team in receptions with three for 49 yards.  </P> <P> Through it all, Moorpark's coaching staff and administration have taken this  simple approach to the problem: It is not a problem.  </P> <P> "There has been no discussion of James Gambrell's situation among the  administration," said Paul Dunham, Moorpark's athletic director. "I'm sure all  of us have given it some thought, but we have never discussed any possible  measures. There has never been any talk of suspending him.  </P> <P> "But my thought is that a person is innocent until proven guilty. I don't know  how anyone else at the school thinks about it, but that's what I think."  </P> <P> The football coach, Jim Bittner, had similar thoughts when he spoke with a  Times reporter five days after Gambrell's arrest.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, James is still on the team," he said. "Nothing will  change unless he's brought to trial and convicted. Then, naturally, he won't be  on the team. When you are only accused of something, that doesn't mean a lot to  me."  </P> <P> Bittner has declined further comment.  </P> <P> "We have never faced this kind of situation before," Dunham said. "It is new  territory for all of us."  </P> <P> Indeed, Moorpark College, nestled in the grassy hills at the end of the Simi  Valley Freeway and seemingly far from the frenetic life of Los Angeles or the  San Fernando Valley, would appear to be an unlikely place for such an ugly  drama to unfold.  </P> <P> But, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Holmes, the scene at the Jan. 20  party in nearby Thousand Oaks was ugly. There was a lot of drinking at the  party, according to Holmes, and an argument broke out between Flores and Bush.  After the two got into a second argument, they went outside to fight, Holmes  said.  </P> <P> But Bush was pushed aside by another party-goer, John Terry Yurek, 20, of  Northridge, who is the brother of Moorpark football player Scott Yurek. John  Yurek threw Flores to the sidewalk and began slamming Flores' head against the  pavement, the prosecutor said. At that time, Holmes alleges, Bush and Gambrell  waded through the crowd and began kicking the already-injured Flores in the  head.  </P> <P> Yurek was charged with manslaughter for his alleged role in the attack, but he  was acquitted in September. During Yurek's trial, however, the jury heard  testimony from a Chatsworth woman, Jaime Franco, that linked Gambrell to the  beating. Franco, also a student at Moorpark College, testified that later that  night, when she returned to an apartment shared by Gambrell and her boyfriend,  Gambrell gave her a pair of heavy hiking boots and told her to dispose of them.  She further testified that Gambrell told her that he had kicked Flores while  wearing the boots.  </P> <P> Gambrell was later called to the witness stand in the Yurek trial, but he  refused to testify on the grounds that his testimony might be  self-incriminating.  </P> <P> "We have those hiking boots," Holmes said. "They are currently being analyzed  for any further evidence."  </P> <P> Through it all, Gambrell has been silent. But even as his football success  continues, teammates can see a change.  </P> <P> "I know he's worried about it," Marine said. "I know that he thinks about it  all the time. He somehow puts it aside when we play football, but I can tell  that it's on his mind all the time."  </P></p>

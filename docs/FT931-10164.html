			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Receivers expect Daf break-up: Talk of non-EC buyer 'very premature' - Attempt to reassure dealers / Major rejects Labour call for government aid THE RECEIVERS for Leyland Daf believe that several parts of its operations can survive last week's collapse into receivership, but the group will probably have to be broken into its constituent parts. There will be heavy job losses and some locations are likely to be closed. Talk of an outside buyer - speculation has focused on truckmakers such as Paccar of the US and Hino of Japan - is 'very premature' and no formal contacts have been made. In the first week since their appointment last Wednesday as joint administrative receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of accountants Arthur Andersen have done little but fight immediate fires. Mr McKillop said: 'Our main aim has been to stabilise the sales and production operations. Then you can have a stabilised business to sell, but it is still very premature to talk about a sale.' To date the receivers have: Agreed financing for the short-term working capital needs of Leyland Daf amounting to Pounds 7m - the sum they requested from Daf's banking consortium. Made arrangements for the immediate payment of wages and salaries for the 5,500-strong workforce in the UK. Set about restoring production at the truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire, and at the Birmingham van plant. Made arrangements with the court-appointed administrators for Daf in the Netherlands that should allow the resumption of the 'vital' flow of trucks and components between the UK and the Dutch and Belgian operations. Addressed a full meeting of UK dealers to try to maintain some confidence in the dealer network. All these actions may secure the businesses for a few weeks, but the hard task will now begin of assessing what can be salvaged for the long term. The UK receivers believe that the rescue plan being prepared by the Dutch administrators - which calls for the creation of a new limited company with the working title of New Daf - could make good sense. This would absorb the core operations of Daf's Dutch and Belgian medium and heavy-duty truck activities. Most importantly for the UK, however, New Daf would probably also include Leyland Daf's truck assembly operations at Leyland. The UK receivers will develop this plan at a further meeting with the Dutch administrators, Mr Louis Deterink and Mr Friso Meeter, later this week. Both sides believe at present that New Daf's future lies in being able to continue to offer an integrated product range to the 1,300-strong Daf dealer network across Europe. This product range would include light trucks made at Leyland and the medium and heavy-duty trucks made at Eindhoven in the Netherlands, with cabs coming from Westerlo, Belgium. 'The key concept is to try to keep that integrated product range together,' said Mr McKillop. 'For the core business the sum of the whole is worth much more than the sum of the parts.' The Leyland plant also has two lucrative military contracts with the Ministry of Defence, one of which runs until early 1995. Mr McKillop rejected the criticism that the New Daf rescue plan is inimical to UK interests. He said: 'There will be severe pain too in Holland and Belgium.' The ownership of a slimmed-down Leyland truck assembly operation within New Daf is still to be resolved. It could be wholly or part-owned by New Daf or could be partly owned by UK interests. The vital element, however, is that this operation would be tied by ownership or supply contracts to New Daf and would remain an integrated part of the Daf truck range. Even under this plan there will still have to be painful job cuts at Leyland. Only half of around 2,200 employees there are employed in the assembly plant. Some 430 are involved in components assembly, 340 in truck product development and 160 in headquarters administration. Many of these jobs are now at risk, as are some of the assembly jobs. The Birmingham van operation appears at much greater risk, however. Its long-term future depended on Daf's ambitious joint venture with Renault of France to develop a new generation of medium and heavy vans, code-named Excel, for launch in the mid 1990s. This product was to have replaced the present ageing Daf 200/400 series - the former British Leyland Freight Rover vans - and was to have been built both in Birmingham and at Renault's plant at Batilly in eastern France. As far as Daf and the future of the Birmingham plant are concerned, this project appears to be dead. It is understood that even before the company went into receivership last week, Daf had decided that it would have to pull out of the Excel project because it did not have the finance to continue. Renault and Daf have each spent around Pounds 45m on Excel, but it is estimated that a further Pounds 100m must be spent to complete the development work with another Pounds 100m-Pounds 200m needed to bring it into production. Excel has now become one of the receivers' most pressing problems. Around 270 Leyland Daf jobs in the UK, mainly in Birmingham, are tied up with the project and are immediately at risk. Urgent discussions are being held with Renault to clarify whether it intends to press ahead with the project alone or with another partner. Without Excel and excluded from the core truck strategy of New Daf the Birmingham plant - with around 2,000 jobs - faces a most difficult future. The receivers believe that it could survive in much reduced form, however, with a strategy directed towards producing very basic, low-price utility vans, essentially for the UK market only, and for a core of loyal, large fleet customers. This plan is still at an early stage and would probably require a management buy-out and may need to be kick-started by some form of government selective regional assistance. At Glasgow the receivers will seek to make the Albion van and truck axle plant into an independent operation with the hope of selling it to an engineering sector buyer. As a supplier to Leyland and Birmingham its future will be tied closely to the ability to save these plants in some form, and again heavy job losses are inevitable. At Chorley, Lancashire, Leyland Daf has a modern automated warehouse and distribution operation with an annual turnover of around Pounds 100m and a workforce of some 400. At present this activity is excluded from the plan for New Daf, but the receivers believe it could well attract an outside buyer as a going concern. Parts sales are a vital element in any truck manufacturer's profitability, however - much better returns are derived from the after-sales operations than from the sale of the new vehicle itself - so New Daf would be vitally interested in a continuing link with the parts business. The Leyland Daf sales and marketing operation at Thame, Oxfordshire, which has about 330 employees, is expected to be reduced in size and will probably be moved. New Daf will have to have a sales and marketing operation in the UK, however, to run the dealer network, so a slimmed-down operation is expected to survive, although at another location and with the nature of the ownership still to be clarified. Leyland Daf Finance is not in receivership in the UK but the Dutch administrators have said that Daf Finance, its Dutch parent company, will be 'run down and closed'. Whatever strategies are evolved by the administrators and receivers for Daf and Leyland Daf, considerable job losses are inevitable. The pain is likely to begin before the end of this week.</p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> Give me one-on-one golf any time. Neither Hale Irwin nor Mike Donald was up to  par Monday, but their U.S. Open playoff was tense, tactical and competitive.  Maybe the PGA Championship, which needs a boost, should return to its old  match-play format. . . .  </P> <P> As early as the 18th hole, you got the feeling that this was going to be  Irwin's day. . . .  </P> <P> I was rooting for Irwin because, unlike many golfers, he doesn't wear a visor  with advertising on it. . . .  </P> <P> Relief Isn't Spelled W-e-l-l-s: When the Dodgers traded Franklin Stubbs to  Houston, they got Terry Wells in return. He had been a reliever in the Astros'  chain the last couple of seasons. As a starter at Albuquerque, he is 5-3 with a  5.03 earned-run average. . . .  </P> <P> The National League suddenly has become the hitters' league. Last season, 26  American Leaguers and only 13 National Leaguers batted .300 or more. Sunday's  averages showed 24 National Leaguers and only 21 American Leaguers batting at  least .300. And, remember, there are two more teams in the AL. . . .  </P> <P> Former Baltimore Oriole first baseman Jim Traber is hitting up a storm in  Japan. Will he be next season's Cecil Fielder? . . .  </P> <P> I hope the Detroit Tigers aren't looking at John Shelby as pennant insurance. .  . .  </P> <P> The Dodgers and Angels are both closer to last place than they are to first. .  . .  </P> <P> Carlos Elliot is a likely opponent for Sugar Ray Leonard in Tokyo in November.  Carlos who? Elliot, 28, is ranked first in the junior middleweight division by  the World Boxing Assn. and, at last count, was 24-2 with 21 knockouts. He was  born in Huntsville, Ala., but has done virtually all his professional fighting  in Japan. It would be a 10-round non-title bout. . . . Dick Maestro of the  Official Boxing Record informs me that the heaviest George Foreman has been for  a fight is 267 pounds for the first bout of his comeback March 9, 1987, against  Steve Zouski in Sacramento. Gorgeous George got down as low as 235 for his  seven-round stoppage of Dwight Qawi on March 19, 1988. . . .  </P> <P> Another reason to like Marvelous Marvin Hagler is that he was loyal to his  managers, the Petronelli brothers, in an era when most fighters dump them when  they start making big money. . . .  </P> <P> My favorite automobile commercial is the one that shows Rocky Marciano winning  the heavyweight title from Jersey Joe Walcott in the 13th round in 1952. . . .  </P> <P> Still don't invite Bob Arum and Don King to the same party. . . .  </P> <P> Meldrick Taylor and Pernell Whitaker are scheduled for bouts on the same card  with Macho Camacho vs. Tony Baltazar in August. . . .  </P> <P> Donald Trump's financial problems probably will leave the biggest fights wide  open to Steve Wynn's Mirage and Caesars Palace. . . .  </P> <P> So a lottery is going to decide who advances in the aptly-named Group F of the  World Cup if all four teams tie. How quaint. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Alfredo Griffin and Garrett (Baseball Has Been Very, Very Good to  Me) Morris. . . .  </P> <P> ESPN baseball commentator Norm Hitzges doesn't need a microphone to be heard. .  . .  </P> <P> How did the Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners think up that Darnell  Coles-for-Tracy Jones trade?. . . .  </P> <P> Any chance the Milwaukee Brewers had to win the American League East title  probably went down the drain with the injury to Paul Molitor. . . .  </P> <P> News item: Chris Mills is named as a finalist for the U.S. national basketball  team. Reaction: No wonder Arizona will be a prohibitive favorite to win the  Pacific 10 championship next season. . . . The hockey draft was more  interesting when the age limit was higher and players who could help NHL teams  right away were picked. . . .  </P> <P> Seven of the top 13 seeded men at Wimbledon are Americans, but it will be a  major upset if one of them wins. . . .  </P> <P> Whatever happened to the museum that was supposed to be built at Dodger  Stadium? . . .  </P> <P> Don Nelson wanted Mike Dunleavy to succeed him as Golden State Warrior coach. .  . .  </P> <P> Art Shell on Irrelevant Week honoree Demetrius Davis, the Nevada Reno tight end  who was picked last by the Raiders in the draft: "He has a lot to learn. He is  a good blocker, but he has to get better at running routes and getting  downfield."  </P></p>

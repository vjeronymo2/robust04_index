			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Blinkered View"] </F>   [Text] Considering that the U.S. State Department's South  Asian desk has begun to compare the situation in Kashmir with  the civil war in Afghanistan and has even been questioning the  validity of the state's accession to India, Mr Clinton's latest  remarks which have brought great joy to Pakistan are not all  that surprising. In essence, what they denote is a strange  reluctance on Washington's part to view the problem in all its  complexity and an equally peculiar propensity to endorse without  a thought the patently-motivated Pakistani propaganda on human  rights violations in the valley. To the Americans, the problem  is not really and probably never has been one of  terrorist-inspired insurgency in an area which was entirely  peaceful till the mid-eighties, presumably because such a stance  will bring into focus Pakistan's clandestine role both in  Kashmir and Punjab. Instead, the United States is bent on  describing what is happening in the valley as an intensifying  civil strife in which the Indian security forces are supposedly  acting like an occupation army while an innocent Islamabad is  merely standing on the sidelines, wringing its hands in despair  about the plight of Muslims in the state.    There is no appreciation in this blinkered view of  Pakistan's  earlier futile forays into the state, the threats, including one  of a nuclear confrontation, that its leaders have been issuing  about making India atone for the sins of liberating Bangladesh  and of the treatment of minorities in Pakistan, compared with  India's incomparably better record. If anything is clear from  this inexplicably partisan attitude, it is that the United  States cannot hope to act as a "catalyst," as it claims it wants  to do, to promote better India-Pakistan relations. All that it  can achieve through its tilt reminiscent of the Nixon-Kissinger  period towards a country it was on the verge of declaring a  terrorist state not long ago is to cause widespread dismay and  disillusionment in India. Such feelings will be all the greater  because the American stand is liable to be seen not as an  expression of naivete, but as a cynical ploy to put pressure on  India if only because the latter is recognised as far too  independent-minded and dismissive of global American strategies.  Clearly, the resentment in the American establishment about  India's role as a leader of the nonaligned movement persists  despite the total transformation of the international scene.  Until now, India's open society had dissuaded the United States  from complaining about human rights violations, but the  unfortunate situation in Kashmir has given it an opportunity  which it is seemingly loath to miss even if it means turning a  blind eye to Pakistan's more blatant transgressions. In the  process, it is again siding with elements in Pakistan that are  basically inimical to democracy.</p>

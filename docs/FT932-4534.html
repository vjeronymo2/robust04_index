			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Bolivia deficit highest for decade Bolivia's trade deficit was far greater last year than feared, rising to its highest level in more than a decade and damping hopes of growth, according to central bank figures, Christina Lamb writes from La Paz. The deficit reached Dollars 561m in 1992, way above the original estimate of Dollars 410m. Imports reached a record Dollars 1.169bn while exports fell from Dollars 760m to Dollars 608m. This was mainly because of a 50 per cent drop in the value of hydrocarbon exports due to the ending of a fixed price agreement on gas sales to Argentina.</p>

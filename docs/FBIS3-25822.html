This is the substance of the speech given by Gu  Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, at the  forum sponsored by the provincial party committee on the morning  of 13 January during his investigation and study tour to a party  school. His speech aroused a sympathetic response among the  trainees.    The forum was held in the meeting room on the third floor of  the newly-built party school's building. The atmosphere was as  warm as spring though the weather outside was extremely chilly.  Cao Mingyuan, president of the provincial party committee party  school, first delivered a report on the school's teaching  reforms and on the construction of the school teachers'  contingent. Gu Jinchi fully acknowledged the achievements scored  by the school in this regard. He said: Party schools are in an  important position to enhance party building. In order to  enable various circles to pay attention to the work of party  schools, we must have party committees at all levels to place  the work of party schools on their important daily schedule, to  conduct regular research, and to help party schools deal with  their difficulties on the one hand and have party schools do a  good job in self-improvement to win over the attention from  various circles, on the other. Meanwhile, various localities  and departments should also do their best to help party schools  improve their school conditions and particularly and actively  dispatch their trainees to the party schools in line with the  demands. Gu Jinchi particularly stressed: The more heavy tasks  the leading cadres have assumed, the more attention they should  pay to participating the training of party schools.    In citing the teaching reforms of party schools, Gu Jinchi  said: Party schools should further deepen their teaching reforms  and collect all questions raised by the trainees during the  course of their studies in a certain period. They should also  have their teachers analyze and study these questions by  applying dialectical and historical materialism, as well as have  them successfully do their papers in line with these questions.  Only by so doing can the party school reinforce their teaching  targets. Party schools should make efforts to have their  teaching systems suit the tremendous changes cropping up in the  transition between the planned economy and the socialist market  one. After the forum with the leading personnel and a number  of teachers of the party school, Gu Jinchi cordially called on  the third class attended by cadres from the units at the  department (city) level, who were engaging in the study of  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Ai  Tingjuan, representative of the trainees and vice mayor of the  Shenyang City People's Government, briefed Secretary Gu Jinchi  on their study situation. Then, he delivered a short speech and  said: In studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping, leading cadres must concentrate their efforts on  carefully reading the original writings. Efforts should be made  to foster a correct idea of development and to correctly  understand that it will not do without the theoretical guidance  of socialist market economy. He urged the trainees to firmly  bear the reality in their minds while studying Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; to further  emancipate their minds; and to emphatically study the issue of  how to have the province's economy achieves sustained, rapid,  and healthy development. He also urged them to work out ways of  how to have their ideological and working methods truly suit the  demands of establishing the socialist market economy, to  heighten their spirit, to seize the opportunity, and to make  contributions to restoring the province's imposing prestige.    Gu Jinchi also visited the trainees' dormitory and the  reading room of the newly built library.    Yu Junbo, member of the provincial party standing committee  and director of the organizational department under the  provincial party committee, accompanied Gu Jinchi during the  investigation and study tour.</p>

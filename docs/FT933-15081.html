			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / International Company News: Unauthorised deals at Nippon Steel NIPPON Steel Chemical, a listed chemicals subsidiary of Nippon Steel, the largest Japanese steel maker, has foreign exchange losses of Y13.9bn (Dollars 130m) on unauthorised trades made by an accounting division chief attempting to lift the company's investment income. The losses were uncovered after the death of the division chief in late May. The company said there were no suspicious circumstances, but, on checking his books, found he had lost Y13.9bn in playing dollar future markets. It is common for Japanese manufacturing companies to supplement their core profits with zaitech, sometimes speculative financial investments, which have left otherwise conservative companies with large losses following the stock market collapse and currency market volatility. Nippon Steel Chemical has a regulation that foreign currency investments of more than Y100m need board approval, but the division chief apparently had invested the equivalent of Y47.3bn in contracts now worth Y33.4bn. Mr Enji Moriguchi, the company's chairman, has offered to resign after preparations were made to deal with the loss, which is expected to be written off over the next two years and covered by the sale of shares and other assets. 'We are now studying ways to strengthen our management system and control financial investments,' the company said. Nippon Steel Chemical, based in Tokyo, produces carbon materials, chemicals and construction supplies. Nippon Steel said the subsidiary had an independent management which must take responsibility.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Related Issues for Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Public Disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency also seeks comment on whether publicly disclosing a clinical investigator's financial interests would serve a useful purpose. FDA also requests comment on what might constitute an appropriate forum for such release_for example, whether it would be useful to disclose such information to an outside advisory committee considering the tested product. Public disclosure of such information is subject to any limitations on disclosure imposed by the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act and other applicable Federal statutes. FDA requests comment on whether the value of public release is outweighed by the right to privacy of clinical investigators with respect to their financial affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Definition of a Clinical Investigator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purposes of this proposed rule, FDA defines a clinical investigator as including the spouse and each dependent child of the investigator. FDA is aware of instances in which problematic financial interests or arrangements have been listed under the name of a business partner or business associate of a clinical investigator with whom the investigator shared the interests or arrangements, so that the potentially biasing factor is not readily traceable to the clinical investigator. The agency seeks comment on whether the definition of a clinical investigator should include business partners of the investigator as well and, if so, how ``business partner'' should be defined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Scope and Amount of Financial Interests that Should Be Disclosed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In proposing to require disclosure of any significant equity interest held by a clinical investigator in the sponsor, the agency has defined a significant equity interest as ``any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial interest whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices, or any equity interest in a publicly traded corporation that exceeds 5 percent of total equity (see proposed &sect;54.2(b)). FDA seeks public comment on this definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA also seeks comment on whether to require information on other investigator interests or payments to investigators that are not directly related to the conduct of a study. These types of arrangements might give the investigator an ``interest'' in the company, such as financial ties with a firm or other entity that supplies, or is likely to supply equipment, materials, or services for work performed by the investigator; financial ties with parties whose financial interests would be, or would seem to be, directly and significantly affected by the investigator's work; financial ties with, or financial support from, any firm that markets, produces, or has in premarket testing a product that is, or will likely be, affected by the investigator's research. FDA also requests comment on whether there should be a ``threshold of concern'' with respect to such payments, (i.e., whether the agency should be concerned only when these forms of compensation to investigators exceed a certain threshold amount). Several academic institutions have instituted de minimis levels for disclosure, such as $5,000 cash and $20,000 equity interest in a publicly held and widely traded company. FDA has not identified a threshold amount and seeks public comment on whether a threshold dollar amount should be set, and if so, what that amount should be. The agency also seeks comments on any other financial relationships or arrangements that should raise concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Ownership by a Clinical Investigator of Stock in a Competing Product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The approach taken by FDA in this proposed rule differs from that of PHS and NSF in that the agency has not included ownership by a clinical investigator of stock in a product that would compete with the tested product for market share. This issue, FDA believes, is appropriately of concern to sponsors. The agency seeks comment on whether such ownership substantially threatens an individual clinical investigator's objectivity and whether there is a manageable basis for reporting this kind of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Disclosure of Financial Interests by Full-Time Employees of the Sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA's approach also differs from that of PHS and NSF in that FDA is not proposing to require disclosure of financial interests and arrangements in or with the sponsor by full-time employees of the sponsor. FDA assumes the clinical investigator who is a full-time employee of the sponsor has a clear interest in the outcome of research and accounts for this potential bias in the level of scrutiny with which the agency reviews the submitted data. FDA seeks comment as to what disclosure, if any, by a clinical investigator, who is a full-time employee of the sponsor, of interests in the sponsor other than salary might contribute to minimizing bias.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Disclosure by Clinical Investigators to Both PHS and FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PHS notice of proposed rulemaking on objectivity in research (59 FR 33242) would require that an institution receiving a PHS grant for research must solicit and review financial disclosure statements from each investigator who is planning to participate in PHS-funded research. The Institution would make available to the Department of Health and Human Services, upon request, information regarding all significant financial interests identified by the institution and how those interests have been managed, reduced, or eliminated to protect the research from bias. In this proposed regulation, FDA would require that the sponsor of a marketing application for a regulated product either certify as to the absence of certain financial interests and arrangements of the investigators conducting clinical studies of the sponsor's product, or disclose those interests and describe the steps taken to minimize the impact of possible bias.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

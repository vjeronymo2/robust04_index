			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VISTA'S DEBATES TOBACCO BAN FOR MINORS  </P> <P> The Vista City Council had a lukewarm reception Wednesday for a proposal to  make illegal the possession of cigarettes and other tobacco products by minors,  and decided to ask for further input from the public before taking action.  </P> <P> "It needs more investigation, obviously," Councilwoman Nancy Wade said at the  meeting. "I just think we're getting so restrictive on everything. I certainly  don't want youngsters to smoke . . . but, at the same time, I just find that it  is getting to be a very restrictive life."  </P> <P> Councilman Gene Asmus disagreed, saying, "When you're dealing with minors, I  think you've got to be a little more restrictive and tell them what the rules  are."  </P> <P> The proposal to ban possession of cigarettes and other tobacco products by  persons under the age of 18 is the first of its kind in California, according  to Rick Dudley, senior management analyst for the city and author of the  proposal.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be a real pro-active thing, it's going to be more of a tool  that juvenile officers would use," Dudley said.  </P> <P> The proposal would also ban cigarette vending machines in areas accessible to  minors, including gas stations, restaurants and entertainment centers. In  November, Duarte became the first city in California to pass such a law, which  went into effect April 1.  </P> <P> Vista's proposal arose from the city's Crime and Substance Abuse Prevention  Commission as a way of denying minors access to "gateway drugs" such as  cigarettes that may lead to dependency on other, "harder" drugs.  </P> <P> "Nicotine is a gateway drug and it leads to other drugs," said Detective Carmen  Martinez of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. "A youngster's body is  not fully developed. . . . An adult's body can handle it much better than a  juvenile's, especially before the age of 15."  </P> <P> State law prohibits the sale of cigarettes and tobacco products to minors, but  possession of those products by youths under 18 is not illegal.  </P> <P> The tobacco industry opposes the law because of the potential for police  harassment.  </P> <P> "Who is going to enforce this? Does that mean if a police officer sees a  young-looking person with a cigarette, he can detain that person? This law may  have the police burden without getting the job done," said Thomas Lauria, a  spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Tobacco Institute.  </P> <P> "While none of us want kids to smoke, what precedents are being set? People are  using kids to get at adults."  </P> <P> Lauria said the law does not get to the heart of the problem and that focusing  on peer pressure and role models would be more effective in preventing kids  from smoking.  </P> <P> The proposal received strong support from the Sheriff's Department, which sees  it as a tool for officers dealing with juveniles.  </P> <P> "We would use it as another lever to get kids away from illegal substances,"  Sheriff's Lt. Scott McClintock said before the meeting.  </P> <P> McClintock said the proposed ordinance would be used in the same way the state  uses the seat-belt law: a person would be cited only when found in violation of  another, more serious offense.  </P> <P> "We wouldn't specifically go out and target kids with cigarettes," McClintock  said.  </P> <P> Possession of tobacco by a minor under the proposed law would be an infraction  of a city ordinance, and the minor would be subject to a fine.  </P> <P> Rudy Hinojosa, manager of the Vista Entertainment Center, the city's only  bowling alley, said his establishment would have no difficulty complying with  the ordinance if it were to pass.  </P> <P> "In the event that they ask us to remove the vending machines from the underage  children, we can always put them in the lounge, where only adults are allowed,"  Hinojosa said.  </P> <P> Hinojosa said the center has long had a policy prohibiting minors from smoking  inside the building, and it has not been a problem.  </P> <P> In Duarte, only two business owners have complained about the ordinance, saying  their customers have lost the convenience of buying cigarettes at their  establishments, said Manuel Ontal, assistant to the city manager.  </P></p>

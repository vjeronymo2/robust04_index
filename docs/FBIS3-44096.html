			<p>Language: <F P=105> Zulu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment and Opinion" page: "End-game for </F> negotiations" -- article published in English]    [Text] The visit by the Zulu monarch, King Zwelithini  Goodwill Zulu, to the State President in Pretoria this Monday  brought a healthy dose of realism to the political scene.    It is difficult to imagine how anybody could believe that  the  200-year old Kingdom, the mightiest in Africa, could simply  vanish. But that is exactly what would have happened -- on paper  at least -- in terms of the deals President de Klerk and his  chosen partners in the SACP [South African Communist Party]/ANC  [African National Congress] alliance had secretly struck. Not  even the name of KwaZulu appeared in the constitution they had  cooked up together. Well, he seems to have now understood the  implications of what his communist negotiating partners had  hoodwinked him into accepting. He was, by all accounts,  prepared to go to almost any lengths to accommodate the King and  his Kingdom.    Was it the 50,000 people on the lawn outside his office that  focused his mind, or was it the rather blunt dressing down he  got from the King?    Either way, there was another important lesson to be learnt  from Monday's events. It is that the self determination of  peoples is a reality that will play a decisive role in our  future. The Zulu people issued a blunt warning that their  rights will be ignored at the country's peril.    Pretoria seemed to have grasped the lesson. But it is a fair  bet that the ANC's jockey, the SACP, will never learn the  lesson. It will stick to its class analysis, no matter what.  The government still has it within its power to ensure that  sanity prevails. If its fails now there will be conflict. And  the NP [National Party] government will not escape the blame.</p>

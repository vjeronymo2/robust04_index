			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: DOG CATCHERS  </P> <P> Remember Ashley Whippet, star of that '74 pennant race game between the Dodgers  and Reds? His catch brought 50,000 Dodger Stadium spectators to their feet, not  to mention the national TV viewers.  </P> <P> It's late in the game; fignernail biting time.  </P> <P> He's running -- 30-plus m.p.h. and leaps nine feet into the air to bring it  down! A Frisbee that is. Ashley's between-inning heroics started a naionwide  dog-soaring, Frisbee-catching craze. Unfortunately, his owner did time behind  bars for trespassing. But this was no "agony of defeat." The thrill lives on.  </P> <P> Saturday the Ventura Department of Parks and Recreation will host the Ventura  and Santa Barbara County regional "1990 Ashley Whippet Invitainal Canine  Frisbee Championships"' for both novice and experiences high-flying dogs and  their owners. The competition will be held at the San Buenaventura State Beach,  901 San Pedro St., Ventura. Registration is free and will commence at 9 a.m.;  competition starts at 10 a.m. There is a $4 parking fee at the beach. For more  information, call 648-1895 or 658-4726.  </P></p>

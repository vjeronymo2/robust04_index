			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Brazil corruption inquiry is 'opportunity for democracy': Hopes of a flushing out of the political system In an annex to the Brazilian Congress in Brasilia, government and central bank officials have been poring over the financial records of some of the country's leading politicians. The findings, released amid the din of a congressional hearing, have detailed a wide network of political corruption, led to the downfall of several senior figures and threaten many others. There is no consensus about whether these politicians are likely to be punished. But there is that the process is positive for Brazil's still emerging democracy. After the peaceful removal of ex-president Fernando Collor last year amid separate corruption allegations, the latest scandal is seen as marking another chance to modernise the country's political system, which emerged in the mid-1980s from two decades of military rule. 'With democracy you learn by mistakes. After so many years of the military, it is taking time for society to win back control of their government,' says Mr Fernando de Hollanda Barbosa, a Rio de Janeiro-based economist. The scandal surfaced last month when a former government official accused nearly 30 politicians and former and acting ministers of involvement in corruption schemes. He said those involved had received fees in return for approving construction projects detailed in the government's budget. A special parliamentary inquiry was set up and has unearthed payments, often of several million dollars, in the bank accounts of some of the accused. Although no politician has admitted wrong-doing, the affair has already forced the resignation of Mr Henrique Hargreaves, the equivalent of a chief of staff, and two of the most senior figures in the country's largest political party, the PMDB. It is also likely to lead to further inquiries into related allegations, including claims that large construction companies paid fees to politicians in return for favours. Among ordinary Brazilians, already cynical about their institutions after the resignation of former president Collor and his replacement by President Itamar Franco, the affair has led to a wave of protest. Helped by intensive media coverage, public anger has been visible in marches organised in many Brazilian cities to demand action. Mr Lucia Bemquerer, a businessman in the south-eastern state of Minas Gerais, helped organise a march to the country's capital Braslia and the lighting of a special torch. 'The torch will burn until these people are punished,' he says. It may need to burn long. Constitutionally, congressmen have immunity from prosecution for any crime unless their respective house votes to withdraw it. This unusually wide immunity was introduced after the military period to bolster the powers of Congress against the executive. Immunities have rarely been lifted. Meanwhile, the inquiry's only form of punishment is the cassacao of anyone suspected of guilt, equivalent to the withdrawal of political rights and immunities. Even without congressional protection, proving money came from corrupt sources would be difficult. For example, some of the accused claim that money was left over from campaign contributions (though other politicians point out that campaigns usually run up big debts rather than profits). These difficulties have prompted suggestions that, other than the cassacao of about 10 main suspects, the affair will blow over once the inquiry finishes just before Christmas. For real change, some analysts argue, Brazil needs an independent judiciary willing to prosecute. At present, Brazil's judiciary is poorly funded and is perceived as neither independent nor willing. However, this view overlooks two important changes which are already taking place. Public anger has accelerated moves in Congress to confront long-standing problems for the first time. For example, the rules on immunity are likely to be tightened and the lower house is already considering lifting immunities more regularly. New regulations on regular disclosure of assets for all members of Congress are also being proposed. Mr Jarbas Passarinho, a respected senator and the chairman of the inquiry, believes Congress now has the chance to show it can tackle its own problems. 'We have to convince the public that Congress is not the centre of all Brazil's wrongs,' he says. The scandal has also forced political parties to rethink plans on candidates for congressional and presidential elections next year. Any politician with links to the accused is now vulnerable to press or political attack. This has greatly worried the PMDB, which has been most closely linked with the allegations. Some party leaders say it will not survive the elections intact and that some groups may break away so as not to be tainted. At least three potential presidential candidates have been touched by the scandal or have become targets of other allegations, such as the taking of illegal commissions, since the inquiry began. Although the media, middle classes and the left will increasingly demand probity in politics, the process may take longer to take root elsewhere. For example, a frequently heard sobriquet in Sao Paulo about one of its leading politicians translates as 'he robs but at least he gets things done'. Mr Nelson Jobim, a leading PMDB congressman, argues that candidates seeking re-election will have to prove their honesty, while new candidates will have to promise it convincingly. 'Discussion of morality will be acute in the 1994 elections,' he says. However, a proportional representation system which strengthens regional rather than national affiliations and a weak party system which exaggerates the power of individuals will remain problems. 'The majority of actors will change, but the personality-types will remain more or less the same,' Mr Jobim says.</p>

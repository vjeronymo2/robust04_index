Major tasks of  this conference are, taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, to  conscientiously implement the guidelines of the third plenary  session of the 14th party Central Committee and the national  economic work conference, to study the important issues on  current economic development in line with the guidelines of the  second plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee,  to unify understanding of the situation and tasks, to make  overall arrangements for this year's economic work, and to  mobilize people across the municipality to raise spirit, make  concerted efforts, and strive to accelerate Tianjin's  development.    Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave  an important speech at the conference. Mayor Zhang Lichang  delivered an important report entitled "Uplift Spirit, Work With  All-Out Efforts, and Create a New Situation in Accelerating  Development." Municipal leading comrades Liu Fengyan, Li Huifen,  Song Pingshun, Zheng Zhiying, Ye Disheng, Zhang Haosheng, Zhuang  Gonghui, Wang Dehui, Zhu Liankang, and Zhang Guanwen attended  the opening ceremony.    Gao Dezhan said in his speech: After the second plenary  session of the sixth municipal party committee concluded, people  throughout the municipality have swung into action to relay and  implement its guidelines. Based on their specific conditions,  many units have explored new ideas, studied and formulated major  measures, assigned the responsibility for attaining defined  targets, and notably quickened the pace of their work. Through  this conference, we should make conscientious efforts to fulfill  the various tasks and targets of economic work, further develop  the good trend, and accomplish the tasks as put forward in the  work priorities of the municipal party committee.    Regarding Tianjin's economic work for this year, Gao Dezhan  emphasized five issues.    --It is imperative to persistently take economic  construction  as the central task and seize the opportunity to accelerate  reform, opening up, and economic development. As far as Tianjin  is concerned, economic development decides on the public  interests and the entire situation of the municipality and  affects the development of various undertakings and the  improvement of living standard. Therefore, we should firmly take  economic construction as the central task. The most important  thing for the present is to seize the opportunity to accelerate  reform, opening up, and economic development. This is the theme  of this year's economic work. To accelerate economic  development, all work should be made successful, and major  efforts should be devoted to the following tasks. First,  Tianjin's growth rates of GNP and other major economic  indicators and all its important work should be made better than  in 1993; large breakthroughs should be achieved in key work and  some weak links; and some aspects of work should continue to be  ranked among the best in the country or should strive to become  so. Second, development of the primary, secondary, and tertiary  industries should be accelerated in an all-round manner. In  particular, we should strengthen the fundamental position of  agriculture, strive to improve large and medium-sized  state-owned enterprises, greatly raise economic efficiency, and  expand the tertiary industry with greater efforts. Third, we  should adhere to the principle of developing the various sectors  of the economy simultaneously while keeping public ownership  predominant and give a free hand to the faster development of  township enterprises, the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises, urban collective enterprises, individual  enterprises, and private enterprises simultaneously while making  state-owned enterprises successful. Fourth, all enterprises,  all departments, and all districts and counties should improve  their level and achieve major breakthroughs in work. In other  words, all departments and all areas should accelerate  development. Fifth, Tianjin should open to all domestic areas  and foreign countries in all directions and quicken the pace in  directly using foreign capital. Sixth, the principle of  "developing Tianjin with science and technology" should be  further implemented, scientific and technological achievements  should be transformed more rapidly, and great efforts should be  made to industrialize high and new technology. Party committees  and governments at all levels in the municipality should devote  greater efforts to accelerating reform, opening up, and economic  development, conscientiously strengthen leadership over economic  work, correctly analyze and estimate the situation, earnestly  study new conditions and new issues, and be determined to  resolve the conspicuous contradictions in economic operation so  as to gain initiative in economic work. All localities,  departments, and enterprises, economic or non-economic, should  channel their work to the track of accelerating Tianjin's  economic development and take the initiative in serving reform,  opening up, and economic construction, which represent public  interests.    --It is imperative to accelerate economic development by  deepening reform. In particular, enterprise reform should be  made successful. Only when enterprises are prosperous, can  Tianjin be prosperous. In conducting reform, we should promote  package reform while giving prominence to key areas. Enterprise  reform--the key area and central link of the reform of the  entire municipality--is the most important of the reforms in all  fronts. Enterprises are the foundation of the national economy,  and enterprise development has a direct bearing on Tianjin's  economic strength and its capacity for sustained development.  Therefore, to accelerate reform, enterprise reform should be  accelerated first; and accelerating enterprise development is  the key to accelerate development. We should embrace the idea  of pooling the efforts of all fields to conduct enterprise  reform. We should adopt every means to fulfill the tasks of  enterprise reform in order to improve and invigorate  enterprises. We have issued a clear-cut call for doing  practical work for the masses. Likewise, we should also do  practical work for enterprises. This should be the major  criterion for assessing the work of a department or a locality.  Leaders of various committees, offices, bureaus, districts, and  counties should go down to enterprises to help them address  problems one by one. Departments in charge, departments with  overall responsibilities, and other departments should enhance  the sense of service and provide service to the endeavor of  deepening enterprise reform. Meanwhile, focusing on deepening  their reform, all enterprises should achieve success in  deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, adjusting  the structure, developing new products, strengthening  management, conducting technical transformation, improving  grass-roots levels, building the spiritual civilization,  training staff members and workers, and improving leading  bodies. Through the work, enterprises with good efficiency  should pursue greater development, and those with poor  efficiency should overcome difficulties and achieve a turn for  the better.    --It is imperative to have a good command of the orientation  to ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development.  At the second plenary session of the sixth municipal party  committee, the municipal party committee called for attention to  five principles concerning the guiding thought for Tianjin's  work for this year. These principles are very important, and  they play an important role in guiding economic work. To make  economic work successful, we should particularly handle well the  relationship in the following three aspects. First, we should  handle well the relationship between the quantity and the  quality of economic development. We should establish new ideas  for economic development and truly channel economic development  to the track centering on improving economic efficiency. In  developing the economy, we should emphasize not only the  increase of quantity but also the improvement of quality and  exert greater efforts in adjusting the structure, strengthening  management, and achieving scientific and technological advance.  We should see to it that an increase is achieved in the  revenues at all levels, in the profits of all types of  enterprises (a decrease of deficits on the part of loss-making  enterprises), and in the income of the vast number staff members  and workers, and that the standard of living is improved  continuously. Second, we should handle well the relationship  between reform and development on the one hand and stability on  the other. We should understand that development is the  purpose, reform the motivation, and stability the condition. We  should achieve faster economic development by deepening reform  and opening wider to the outside world and, meanwhile, provide a  more relaxed environment for reform when arranging economic  work. Third, we should handle well the relationship between  faster economic development and comprehensive social progress.    --It is imperative to take the increase in the income of  urban and rural staff members and workers as an important  criterion for judging economic work. In developing reform,  construction, and all other work, we should take the "three  advantages" put forward by Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the  fundamental criteria. To be specific, our work should be  advantageous to developing Tianjin's productive forces,  increasing Tianjin's economic strength, and improving the  standard of living of all its people. Party committees and  governments at all levels should regard the income increase of  staff members, workers, and peasants and improvement in their  living standard as an important criterion for judging economic  work, attach great importance to it, and make it a success. We  should exert utmost efforts to do practical work for the benefit  of the masses and successfully fulfill all the tasks designed  for this purpose. The most important practical work for the  masses is to continuously increase the income of staff members,  workers, and peasants, and to improve their standard of living.  We should adopt every means possible and devote every effort to  benefit the masses and increase their income. The issues  concerning retired cadres, staff members, and workers should  also be addressed well. Regarding the staff members and workers  who have difficulties in their life for the time being, we  should work out ways and do meticulous work to resolve the  difficulties. The system of responsibility for attaining work  targets will be instituted across the board this year. The  income increase of staff members, workers, and peasants should  be taken as an important indicator for evaluation.    --It is imperative to fulfill responsibilities, improve work  styles, and work hard and in a down-to-earth manner. The system  of responsibility for attaining work targets should be  implemented across the board. An important task of this  economic work conference is to assign all departments and all  enterprises with economic tasks and specific targets in line  with the requirements of the plenary session of the municipal  party committee so that everyone will have pressure and targets  on their shoulder. It is hoped that party and government organs  at all levels, especially leading cadres, will set a good  example in instituting the work target responsibility system.  The year-end summary of work and appraisal of leading bodies  and cadres should all be based on how they have implemented the  system. We should further change work styles. Leaders at all  levels should take the lead in changing work styles, working  hard, and making earnest efforts to do practical work. They  should resolutely overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and  formalism. They should renounce exaggeration and fraud in favor  of truth, practical work, and realistic results. They should  firmly rely on the masses and mobilize all positive factors.  Regarding the important issues on economic work, reform, and  opening up, they should give heed to the opinions, voice, and  requirements of the masses and win their understanding and  support. When reforming their inner managerial system and  leadership system, enterprises should pay attention to  protecting the interests and democratic rights of their staff  members and workers. They should attach importance to the  ideological and political work for their staff members and  workers to soothe people's feelings.    In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: Tianjin's tasks of this  year's reform and development are heavy and arduous. As long as  the people across the municipality unite as one to work hard and  in a down-to- earth manner, Tianjin will be able to surmount  numerous difficulties, accelerate reform, opening up, and the  modernization drive, regain its magnificent bearings, and score  brilliant achievements again.

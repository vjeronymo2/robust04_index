			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / 'Cautious consumers' bad news for shops Consumer confidence is improving slightly but high street shops will probably not see a bumper Christmas this year, according to consumer surveys released yesterday by Gallup and Barclaycard. The latest survey conducted by Gallup on behalf of the European Commission found that consumer confidence rose slightly this month, with 19 per cent of people surveyed saying that they expected their household finances to improve in the next 12 months, compared with 18 per cent last month. Meanwhile, 27 per cent said they expected their finances to deteriorate, a significant improvement from the pattern seen in spring, when more than 40 per cent of households expected a deterioration. The negative balance of eight between these two numbers was the second best result this year, up from September's 11 per cent. The last time a positive balance was recorded was in May 1993. The proportion of people indicating that they believe it is a good time to make a big purchase such as a washing machine, compared with those who do not, rose to 11 per cent last month. This was higher than the previous month's 4 per cent, but in line with levels seen since February. In spite of this improvement a survey by Barclaycard suggested yesterday that consumers remain cautious in the approach to Christmas. Consumers plan to spend an average of just Pounds 325 this Christmas - an increase of only 2 per cent on last year's figure of Pounds 318, or about in line with the annual inflation rate. More than half of consumers say they will finance Christmas from income, with 27 per cent planning to use their savings, and only 6 per cent intending to increase their level of credit card borrow-ing. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, Barclaycard's chief executive, said: 'Our experience . . . suggests consumers are actually more confident than they will admit.'</p>

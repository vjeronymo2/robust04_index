			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (28): Up to 30m may not exist - Census may spring surprise NIGERIANS are about to hear just how many of them there are. Prepare for a surprise, say government officials, who will soon release the first results of last November's national census. 'Africa's most populous nation' may well have far fewer than the 110m to 120m generally estimated - nearer to 90m, rumour has it. Nigerians may react with equanimity to this revelation. What they particularly wish to know is where they all live, for the 30 states' share of Federal government revenue is partly determined by population. 'People are aware that they are going to gain more from the central purse by falsifying the head count, and they do just that,' commented the weekly magazine West Africa. How many live where, however, may not become public information for many months, and the reception accorded those details will provide the most difficult test of the census. In the meantime, it seems, Nigerians will have to settle for a basic population count. That in itself is no mean achievement, given the controversies of the past. There have been 11 attempts at an acceptable national census since 1863 and on each occasion the exercise has ended in failure, the journal noted. The 1952 census, which put the total population at 33m, was believed to have been an underestimate because it was widely assumed the British were counting heads to increase revenues. In 1962, the results were not published because leaks led to political controversy. In the 1963 count the then Western and Eastern regions alleged that the Northern region had inflated its own figures to ensure the federal dominance of the Northern People's Congress. The north responded angrily: under-populated areas in the south had been overcounted to give the southern regions an unfair share of federal revenue, it alleged. Ten years later General Yakubu Gowon's military government had a go - and failed. Nigeria by then had been divided into 12 states, and the count for the six northern states - 51.4m  - hugely outnumbered the six southern states' 28.4m. It was decided that since the 1963 census had produced the least unacceptable results it should provide the base for subsequent population figures which have assumed a growth rate ranging from 2.5 to over 3 per cent. The man in the hot seat this time round has been Alhaji Shehu Musa, a former secretary to the Federal government regarded as a potential presidential candidate. His job as chairman of the National Population Commission has been easier than that of his predecessors. The government defused potential religious and ethnic tensions by omitting questions on these subjects from the questionnaire. It was nevertheless a monumental exercise involving  1/2 m staff during the three day exercise across 225,000 enumeration areas.</p>

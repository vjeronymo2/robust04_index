He said the supply of the boosters will continue, while the  technology will not be handed over. Shokhin pointed out that  India was buying missile technologies rather that cryogenic  boosters themselves.    The contract stipulated that Russia was to supply two  boosters each worth about $6 million to India. The first  booster was to be delivered in 1995. After the contract is  amended, the contract's value earlier estimated at $220 million  may be slashed by over 80%, according to the Russian Space  Agency.    The new terms will be formulated in a stricter accordance  with the requirements of the Missile Technology Control Regime.  Russia signed a memorandum on its intention to observe its  provisions in Washington on September 2 this year. The  memorandum demands the necessary amendments should be made to  the contracts running counter to the regime before January 1,  1994.</p>

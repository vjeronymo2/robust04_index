A Foreign  Ministry source said on 6 January that during a meeting with his  Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen, Hata would confirm the gravity  of security dialogue between Japan and China, and ask China to  disclose as much military information as possible because ASEAN  nations have expressed apprehensions over China's moves to  strengthen its military power. Specifically, Hata is  considering asking China to compile a "defense white paper" in  accordance with international standards, the source said.    In recent years, China has increased its annual defense  budget by two digits, has claimed rights over the Spratly  Islands, and has intensified its activities in the waters near  the islands.    Hata plans to tell the Chinese Government that Japan is  interested in how China's military power will change. At the  same time, he will ask China to use the "Japanese-Sino Security  Council" as a place to open its military power to the world.  The council held the first meeting of foreign ministerial  officials of both countries in Beijing on 20 December. It is  said that Hata plans to make those requests because he believes  the repeat of frank exchanges of views between the two countries  will lead to substantial multilateral security talks.</p>

Talking about his visit to Turkey, the minister of national  defense said: "Military diplomacy is going through a period of  extensive activities. I hope that close technological  cooperation will follow the visit to Turkey. This is a very  attractive partner. Within the past 10 years, Turkey has built a  modern arms industry from scratch. We hope to establish closer  cooperation with this state. An important element of the  Turkish visit was also the confirmation of what had been said by  President Demirel in Warsaw, that Turkey will continue to  support our integration with the European security structures.  This was emphasized on many occasions. Here we have a true  ally."    Referring to his visit to the United States and Canada, the  minister of national defense said: "Our main goal during this  trip will be to convince the United States to open up wider to  technological cooperation, and to open up wider to assisting in  the restructuring of our Army. Similar issues will be raised in  Canada."    President Lech Walesa has approved the program for the  visit.  He drew attention to the need to continue what was achieved by  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. "We have to do everything to  ensure that Poland is integrated into the Euro-Atlantic system,"  the president underscored.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Urbanised shanty town The shanty town of Jordanopolis, like hundreds of others in Sao Paulo city, sprang up on unoccupied ground 20 years ago and is now well entrenched. Its precarious brick houses, homes to 800 families, are supplied with electricity, water and - soon - sewers. Jordanopolis is part of Project Guarapiranga, named after a reservoir in the south of Sao Paulo city. Four years ago, the reservoir's water, which supplies 3m people, deteriorated rapidly. Chief culprits were the open sewers from shanty towns that have encircled part of the reservoir. The project, which is mainly financed by the World Bank and Sao Paulo's state government, aims to tackle the problem by installing proper sewers and building roads to allow better rubbish collection. But the project also shows how difficult it will be to clean up the Tiete, into which waste water from the shanty towns eventually flows. Installing infrastructure like sewers in the favelas is difficult and expensive. Their houses cluster together without streets, and they are often perched on hillsides and marginal ground. The government is neither willing, for social reasons, nor able, for financial reasons, to resettle inhabitants elsewhere. 'To show how complex it is, we're having to 'urbanise' these areas by installing small roads for access and sewers. Everything has to be discussed with the inhabitants, too,' says Ivan Carlos Maglio, the project's co-ordinator. The Dollars 262m project plans to install more than 300km of sewers, as well as developing more than 1,000 acres of parks and leisure areas. A planned rubbish collection system will daily collect 190 tonnes of waste which is currently washed into the reservoir. 'Pollution should stop once the project is finished. But it needs education as well to stop people throwing everything in the sewer system, which is a serious problem,' says Maglio.</p>

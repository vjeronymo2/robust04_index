			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 1, IRNA -- Minister of Information  Hojjat-ol-Eslam 'Ali Fallahiyan said here today that security  forces had identified and arrested the elements behind the  recent bombing in Tehran.    Speaking at a press conference, he said Iraqi intelligence  agents were directly involved in the bombing and two Iraqi  officers, Abdul-Amir 'Ali and Raad Mostafa Fattah have been  arrested who have admitted their terrorist actions.    He said the Iraqi regime has directly assigned its  intelligence officers to plant bombs in Iranian large cities  since last February after being disappointed with its internal  agents in Iran.    Hojjat-ol-Eslam Fallahiyan said that Iraqi intelligence  officers had carried 22 bombs, mostly magnetic into Iran, adding  that 14 bombs had been seized by police. He said the terrorists  exploded 4 bombs in the streets and investigations are underway  to detect the others. Evidences indicate that the terrorists  may have destroyed the other four bombs, he said.    Six internal elements nammed Shakour Rostami, Havas Azizi,  Ali Behruzi, Ahmad Asghari, Davoud Jaafar and Nejad Faissal who  were in contact with the Iraqi intelligence officers are now  under arrest and have confessed to their charges.    The information minister showed a video-tape to reporters  showing the confessions of the Iraqi intelligence officers and  their internal elements in Iran.    On Iraq's objectives behind the terrorist actions,  Fallahiyan  said the Iraqi regime and the counterrevolutionary grouplets  were trying to carry out explosions in Iran and attribute them  to internal issues and pretend that the people were against the  ruling system.    Asked about the Iranians living abroad, he said, "We welcome  the return of our fellow-countrymen, but there is no compulsion  in this regard."    The majority of those who live abroad have no special  problem  and travel freely, but, he said, those who have legal problems  should refer to the judiciary.    About Saeedi Sirjani (a writer), he said he had been  arrested  for addiction and drug smuggling, but further inve stigations  showed that he had cooperation with Savak (former regime's  secret police).    He has been a drug addict for a long time, so it is natural  that the addiction would lead him to some ethical weaknesses.    Saeedi Sirjani has had links with the western intelligence  services as well and the matter will be disclosed after  completion of the investigations, he said.    About the bugging of the Iranian embassy in London by the  intelligence service of the United Kingdom, he said the  information ministry had already received reports on the issue  which was announced after official confirmation.    He said all the dimensions of the bugging of the Iranian  embassy in London had not been disclosed yet due to security  reasons.    He regretted that the UK government regarded the blatant  violation of the international law in the embassy case as a  matter of normalcy.    Asked about Iran-Turkey security relations, and the  propaganda campaign of Turkish media on the alleged Iranian  interference in internal affairs of that country, he said  contacts between the officials of the two countries showed that  Iran has not intervened in their domestice affairs and will not  do so.</p>

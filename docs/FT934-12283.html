			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Company News: Improvement at Canadian textiles group DOMINION Textile, the Canadian-based integrated textile group, improved profits in the first quarter ended September 30. The group is also planning to expand globally in denim, interlinings and non-wovens, its three largest business sectors. Domtex is completing a USDollars 150m 10-year note issue which, together with a USDollars 200m standby credit, will bring its debt-equity ratio down to near its target of 40:60. Later it plans a US equity issue and a quotation on a US stock exchange. First-quarter net profit was CDollars 4.5m (USDollars 3.4m), or 8 cents a share, up from CDollars 3.6m, or 6 cents, on sales of CDollars 301m, compared with CDollars 295m. Industrial fabrics did well while interlinings declined slightly. European industrial non-wovens performed better and the Klopman workwear unit posted an 11 per cent sales gain, although margins tightened.</p>

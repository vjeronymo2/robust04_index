			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Thousands of IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  supporters have started through the streets of Empangeni in  Zululand, armed with traditional weapons. This is in  contravention of the emergency regulations. Peter Scott is on  the line from Empangeni with further details. Peter, can you  just start by giving us the present situation? Peter, are you  there? Can you please tell us what is the situation at present?    [Scott] At the moment thousands of IFP supporters are  marching down John Ross Highway on their way to the magisterial  building in the center of town. Marchers are mostly armed with  sticks, some with sharpened points, knobkieries, a few spears,  bullwhips, and axes. Now, earlier a senior police officer on  the scene, Major Margaret Kruger of the police legal department,  confirmed that permission was not granted for the marchers to  carry any weapons during the procession. Later a local IFP  leader, Mr. Robert Mkhize, spoke to the IFP supporters where  they were gathering to start marching, and told them that they  had to hand in some of the traditional weapons. However, most  of the marchers flouted this order, and they started marching a  short while ago.    [Announcer] And, Peter, can you tell us what is the mood of  the people?    [Scott] I wouldn't say the mood is very tense at the moment.  People are very noisy, and they're sort of clashing their  sticks, but I wouldn't say they're in a very bellicose mood.  It's not as if they're out to make trouble as such.    [Announcer] And how strong is the army and police presence?    [Scott] Well, the army and police presence is quite  substantial. There are quite a few members of the Internal  Stability Division. They've got Nyala riot vehicles. There are  some SADF [South African Defense Force] people as well. Air  force helicopters and police helicopters are circling overhead  and monitoring the situation.    [Announcer] And is it clear from watching the crowd that the  marshals monitoring the crowd are in control of what's going on?  Is their presence very obvious?    [Scott] They're actually very well marked. They've got  overcoats on with clearly marked IFP colors on them. Now,  earlier we were told not to speak to any of the supporters.  We've been told to only speak to Robert Mkhize and also to the  chairperson of the Inkatha Women's Brigade, Mrs. Faith Gasa, and  she had some very strong words about the TEC [Transitional  Executive Council]. She said that they have basically been  forced by the TEC to act in this way, bt she stressed that the  marchers are not out to make trouble, that they are actually  there to protest about the massacre in Johannesburg earlier this  month, and also in support of the king's demands for a sovereign  kingdom.    [Announcer] Right. Finally, what is the mood in the town,  Peter?    [Scott] So far most of the shops along John Ross Highway  have  actually closed their doors to business, in anticipation that  there might be trouble. It's understandable that people are  probably scared and would rather be safe than sorry. But  further on in town businesses are still open, but we're on our  way there to investigate what the situation is.    [Announcer] Peter Scott, thank you very much.</p>

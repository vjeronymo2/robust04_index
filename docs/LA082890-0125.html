			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> COUNTY TO CREATE NEW WETLANDS  </P> <P> What it takes Mother Nature hundreds of years to create with wind and rain,  Orange County parks employees will attempt to do in three years using  bulldozers and artificial irrigation.  </P> <P> Grading work that began this summer on the east side of William R. Mason  Regional Park and a temporary irrigation system scheduled for installation next  month are intended to help create 80 acres of artificial wetlands. They will be  across Culver Drive from the more manicured section of the park.  </P> <P> Besides creating a natural park for the public, the county is using the project  to determine if large artificial wetlands can be created to attract declining  species such as the California gnatcatcher, said Denton D. Turner, design  manager for the harbors, beaches and parks division of the county's  Environmental Management Agency.  </P> <P> The project also includes artificial wetlands planned for the Aliso/Wood  Canyons Regional Park in Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> The goal at Mason Park is to dig closer to the water table and create channels  for the natural runoff from neighboring streets to enlarge the natural 15-acre  wetlands now at the park, Turner said. Native wetland trees and shrubs will be  planted beginning in November.  </P> <P> The first phase of the project, which will cost about $400,000, will add about  30 acres of wetlands to the park.  </P> <P> After about three years, when the plants have had a chance to take root and  grow, the irrigation system will be removed and the plants will be left in  their natural state, Turner said.  </P> <P> The first test will be to see if the plants thrive without artificial  maintenance. "The second test will be, 'Do the critters like it?' " Turner  said.  </P> <P> The primary purpose of the wetlands projects is to create parks and new homes  for wildlife, he said. But if the plants thrive and animals take up residence,  the county might be able to use the new wetlands as a trade-off for wetlands  slated for development.  </P> <P> Federal law prohibits destruction of wetlands where alternatives exist. When  there are no feasible alternatives, federal agencies require builders to  restore wetlands affected by the new construction or improve wetlands elsewhere  to make up for the lost habitats.  </P> <P> Compensating for destroyed wetlands by restoring wetlands elsewhere, though, is  the Environmental Protection Agency's least preferred alternative.  </P> <P> "The (regulating) agencies are a little dubious," Turner said. "They don't want  to see the county or any developer use this as a cheap fix." TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

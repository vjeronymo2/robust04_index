			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Coles Myers halts decline COLES Myer, Australia's largest retail group, reported a 2 per cent increase in sales for the third quarter to April 28, to ADollars 3.47bn (USDollars 2.71bn). The rise was mostly due to improved turnover in New South Wales and Queensland. Mr Brian Quinn, group chief executive, said he believed the improvement suggested the recent decline in the company's performance, caused by the depressed economies in Australia and New Zealand, had 'been arrested'. He said that the Coles Myer group would continue its stringent cost-control programme. Sales in New Zealand, where Coles Myer acquired the Progressive chain of stores two years ago, improved 1.4 per cent, indicating continuing flat conditions.</p>

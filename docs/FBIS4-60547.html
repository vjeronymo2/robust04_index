			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay and Revital Brakha] </F>   [Excerpts] Thousands of people demonstrated yesterday at  dozens of locations throughout the country demanding that the  agreement with the PLO be suspended to protest "the  deteriorating security situation and the increase in terrorist  attacks." Until press time, it was reported that NRP [National  Religious Party] Knesset Member [MK] Sha'ul Yahalom and two  policemen had been injured.    Demonstrations were held, among other locations, at the  Qiryat Shemona junction, the Miron junction, Karmi'el, Yoqne'am,  Karkur, Rosh Ha'ayn, Haifa, the Golani junction, the Hadera  junction, near the prime minister's home in Tel Aviv, and near  the Prime Minister's Residence in Jerusalem.    Over 2,000 people took part in a violent demonstration near  Rabin's residence in Jerusalem. The demonstrators clashed with  policemen and attempted to storm the house. The police on its  own initiative closed off the road opposite Rabin's residence  and permitted the demonstrators to step off the sidewalk.  However, when the crowd subsequently tried to forcibly rush at  the house, they were repelled by dozens of policemen, some of  whom were on horseback.    Serious traffic jams were reported at around 2200 [1900 GMT]  after dozens of burning tires were thrown on King George street.  Tires and dumpsters were also set alight in the Ge'ula  neighborhood and Hashabat Square. [passage omitted]    Deputy Jerusalem Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir, who attended the  demonstration, said that at the next municipal council meeting,  he would propose awarding the title of friend of Jerusalem to  anyone who would assassinate 'Arafat. [passage omitted]    Hundreds of right-wing demonstrators yesterday participated  in a demonstration opposite the prime minister's home in Ramat  Aviv. At the demonstration, which was organized by the Eretz  Yisra'el Front, which includes all the right-wing parties, the  organizers claimed that the murder of two soldiers at the Erez  checkpoint on 20 May, proved that the peace was an illusion and  the army's operation in Lebanon yesterday was just a flashy  maneuver to justify the government's failure in the battle  against terrorism.

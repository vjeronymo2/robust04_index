			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Arab labor delegations participating in the  ninth conference of the International Federation of the Arab  Workers Trade Unions, being held in Tunis, have denounced the  allegations and lies uttered by the representative of the regime  imposed on Kuwait regarding the so-called Kuwaiti prisoners.    Replying to the representative of the al-Sabah regime, Fadil  Mahmud Gharib, head of the General Federation of the Iraqi  Workers Trade Unions, cited documents and exposed the falsehood  of these allegations. Gharib explained that these lies are  aimed at perpetuating the embargo being imposed on the Iraqi  people.    The Iraqi news agency correspondent in Tunis cited Gharib as  saying that the Iraqi people--who are prominent in Arab history,  thanks to their pan-Arab heroic deeds, and who have never failed  to support the fraternal Arab states and carry out a pan-Arab  role in confronting the hostile plans--will remain steadfast in  the face of all attempts aimed at destroying Iraq's capabilities  and preventing Iraq from carrying out its pan-Arab role.    Gharib's reply to the representative of the al-Sabah regime  received lots of applause and profound enthusiasm on the part of  all Arab labor delegations participating in the conference.</p>

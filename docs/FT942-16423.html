			<p>940411 FT  11 APR 94 / China dissidents feel lashes of a leadership nervous of change: Tony Walker explains the government's insecurity Wei Jingsheng, the pro-democracy activist at the centre of the dispute between a modernising China and the west, occupies a position in modern Chinese history that even he perhaps cannot quite appreciate, and certainly could not have imagined when he embarked on his lonely crusade almost two decades ago. China's apparent readiness to jeopardise access to its most important market, the US, over the actions of an individual is an indication of just how seriously the Chinese leadership views threats to its authority in this uncertain phase. Beijing's pursuit of Mr Wei, who is being interrogated for so-called 'new crimes', might seem oddly dysfunctional given the stakes involved; but his treatment is consistent with the government's general approach in this uneasy climate amid persistent reports of industrial and peasant unrest. The leadership knows it faces enormous political challenges in the next several years as it makes the transition to a new generation of leaders now that the ailing Mr Deng Xiaoping has virtually shuffled off the stage. Waiting for Mr Deng to die has become something of a national preoccupation, feeding leadership anxieties about a whole range of issues, including possible factional strife and social upheaval. Prominent figures in the dissident community are far from alone in predicting that Mr Deng's death will precipitate a convulsion, either within the leadership itself or in the streets. Mr Liu Xiaobo, the writer and philosopher accused by the authorities of being one of the 'black hands' behind the Tiananmen pro-democracy protests of 1989, echoes the views of many of his dissident colleagues when he says: 'As Deng Xiaoping approaches death people feel a palpitation in their hearts. Everybody feels that something big is going to happen. But no one is sure where it is going to start.' This may be merely wishful thinking on Mr Liu's part since a tiny, fragmented dissident movement is hardly in a position at present to organise national disturbances, but activists are more than capable of taking advantage of any hint of chaos that might arise from a weakening at the centre. Among nagging issues in the background is the unresolved question of responsibility for the Tiananmen massacre. Tackling this issue is simply taboo while Mr Deng is alive. The leadership's quarrel with Mr Wei is not that he heads anything approximating an organisation, but that he symbolises, more than any of his dissident colleagues, disaffection with the established order, and daringly he appears prepared to confront. He has also captured attention in the west, which is no small achievement for someone who speaks no English and who was hidden from view during a 14-year jail sentence from 1980 to 1993. His meeting in Beijing recently with Mr John Shattuck, the US assistant secretary of state for human rights, deeply angered the authorities and will have contributed to his re-arrest. Chinese officials described the encounter as an intolerable affront and muttered darkly about US envoys meeting 'criminals' - Mr Wei was still on six months' parole after his early release from jail last September. A western official in Beijing, who monitors the dissident community, says that while dissident numbers are 'very small', 'the thing that worries the government at the moment is that conditions are ripe for recruiting new people'. These concerns appear to be especially acute where the labour movement in concerned. The authorities showed little tolerance recently when labour activists petitioned them to be allowed to establish a non-government group known as the 'Association for the Protection of Labour Rights'. The organisers were summarily detained and their request dismissed. The last thing Beijing wants at this traumatic moment for state industries, with thousands of workers being laid off or placed on subsistence wages, is the emergence of an overtly political organisation like Poland's 'Solidarity'. The authorities also stamped on an attempt by a disparate group of activists to promote a 'Peace Charter' which called on the Communist party to respect human rights and introduce political reform. Qin Yongmin, the chief sponsor behind this attempt to spread democratic ideals, was sentenced earlier this year to two years' re-education-through-labour for 'disturbing public order and security'. Whether Wei Jingsheng will suffer a similar fate, or worse, is unclear. Whatever the authorities have in mind for him, however, his name will not disappear from the human rights debate, and nor are tensions between China and the west over such issues likely to recede as long as a nervous leadership feels under pressure to respond to almost every challenge to its authority.</p>

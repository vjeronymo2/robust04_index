			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Obscurity to ignominy in a decade: The rise and fall of buccaneering entrepreneur Raul Gardini MR Raul Gardini will be remembered as emblematic of an era in Italian family capitalism. From the mid-1980s, he built up the Ferruzzi group from a highly profitable, but limited, farm products and trading organisation into the country's second biggest private sector company. In less than a decade, the previously obscure Ferruzzi family, into which Mr Gardini married, became as familiar to Italians as the Agnellis, Pirellis and other leading families of private sector business. Mr Gardini, dubbed 'Sir Raul' or 'the pirate' by the Italian press for his swashbuckling business style, defied the financial establishment through a string of daring takeovers, culminating in the 1986 acquisition of the Montedison chemicals group. By daring to seize Montedison, which had see-sawed between private and public-sector control in the previous two decades, Mr Gardini cocked a snook at both politicians who had grown accustomed to using the chemicals sector as an important source of patronage, and Mediobanca, the powerful Milanese merchant bank and Montedison shareholder. Mr Gardini, 60, was born into a property-owning family from Ravenna on Italy's northern Adriatic coast. In spite of his middle class roots, he was a far cry from the normal members of the salotto buono - the good drawing room of northern Italian capitalism from which Mediobanca traditionally drew its support and which it liberally financed. Mr Gardini's courage and breadth of vision often allowed him to succeed in transactions from which more sober counterparts would have shied away. The Montedison coup was followed by string of deals which took Ferruzzi into new businesses ranging from pharmaceuticals to building materials and energy. The group also expanded abroad, making Mr Gardini's face as familiar to French, UK or US investors as that of Fiat's Mr Gianni Agnelli or Olivetti's Mr Carlo De Benedetti. Mr Gardini's rise was a reflection of the boom in Italy's equity markets in the mid-1980s, when share prices surged and the prestige of financial engineers rose high above their mechanical counterparts, on which so much of Italy's wealth depends. His success in mounting takeovers and asset stripping were partly helped by the absence of rules, which have since been passed, governing compulsory takeover bids and forbidding the sales of majority or large stakes in companies at a premium. Such business ethics did little to endear Mr Gardini to international investors when transplanted abroad. Ferruzzi aroused suspicions in the City of London for poor transparency and a cavalier approach in its attempted takeover of British Sugar. Mr Gardini's domineering business style, based on his forceful personality, was buttressed by his wife's stake in the Serafino Ferruzzi family holding company. After the founder died in a 1979 air crash and his son, Arturo, showed a clear preference for the sidelines, the field was virtually clear for Mr Gardini. Ferruzzi and Montedison became virtually a one man empire, with Mr Gardini largely unhindered by independent-minded managers or demanding outside shareholders, whose insight into the group was complicated by the group's complex 'cascade' structure. In some cases, that permitted decisiveness and fast decision-making which left visiting bankers breathless. But in others, the concentration of power led to excesses, such as Montedison's multi-million dollar challenge for the Americas Cup yacht race or the brief appointment of Mr Gardini's young son Ivan as chairman of Ferfin. In the end, Mr Gardini's ambition and the lack of control led to his downfall. Upset by the reluctance of other members of the Ferruzzi family to back his plans to buy out the state's stake in the Enimont chemicals joint venture, the final break with the Ferruzzis came when the family rebelled against his plan to reorganise the family holding company to guarantee the predominance of the Gardini branch. Mr Gardini negotiated a L505bn (Pounds 211m) pay-off for his wife's share in the family company, and used the funds as seed capital to set up a new business empire. His death removes one of Italy's most exciting, if mercurial businessmen, and eliminates one of the central players able to shed light on the tormented affairs of Ferruzzi and its affiliates at a crucial time in their history.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Repayments to banks higher than their lending THE LACK of significant recovery in the economy prior to the general election was underlined yesterday by figures indicating weak demand for credit last month. The Bank of England said companies and individuals repaid loans worth a net Pounds 500m to banks and building societies last month. The seasonally-adjusted figure for so-called M4 sterling lending marks the first time since records began in 1982 that repayments on such lending outstripped new loans. M4, or broad money, is cash plus bank and building society deposits. However, financial markets shrugged off the statistics, arguing that their relevance had been diminished by the Conservatives' victory in the general election. Many in the City believe that the election result sets the scene for an increase in business and consumer confidence that could aid a sustained revival. Private-sector economists had expected a small net increase in M4 lending last month of about Pounds 1.5bn. That had been on the back of cautious indications about an economic upturn in the first quarter. News of the weak demand for credit coincided with other figures pointing to sluggish growth in the money supply. Narrow money or M0, which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation and represents underlying demand pressures, rose 0.1 per cent during March to give a 2.2 per cent increase for the year. In the 12 months to February, M0 growth was also 2.2 per cent, while in the year to January it was a revised 2.1 per cent. M4 rose by 0.2 per cent during March. The growth for the 12 months to March was a weak 5.6 per cent, after 6 per cent in February and 6.3 per cent in January. The message behind the figures was supported by the British Bankers' Association, a trade body for Britain's nine biggest commercial banks, which said its members gained repayments from borrowers last month of Pounds 1.7bn. That came after a net increase in loans in February of Pounds 1.7bn. The association said there were no signs that the sharp decline in bank lending during the recession had ended.</p>

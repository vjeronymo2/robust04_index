			<p>BFN     [Text] Khartoum, 7 Apr (MENA)--Sudanese newspapers today  published conflicting reports on the Sudanese airliner that a  Sudanese national hijacked yesterday, Wednesday, and forced to  land at Luxor airport.    While AL-SUDAN AL-HADITH said the plane was bound for  al-Danaqilah and then Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, AL-INQADH AL-WATANI  said the plane was on a domestic flight.    AL-INQADH revealed that the hijacker Mahjub Husayn Muhammad,  who requested asylum in Egypt, was registered on the flight as a  passenger under a false name. He revealed his real name to the  Egyptian authorities, the paper said, adding that the person who  carried out the operation is called 'Adil Mahjub Muhammad Ahmad.    The paper explained that domestic flights are not subject to  the same passenger-list checks that international flights  usually undergo.    Meanwhile, all Sudanese media as well as statements made by  the Sudanese information and media minister and Sudan airways  totally disregarded the presence of Sudanese ministers on the  plane that returned to Khartoum last night; the hijacked plane  was carrying two ministers: Education Minister Ahmad Muhammad  Kapuche and Agriculture Minister Yusuf Adam [names and titles as  received].</p>

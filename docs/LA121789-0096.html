			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GOOD RURAL HEALTH CARE CALLED POSSIBLE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: A REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT TOWNS USE CREATIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS NURSE  PRACTITIONERS AND MODERN EMERGENCY SERVICES TO MAKE UP FOR SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS.  </P> <P> Rural advocates for years have urged more attention for the medical needs of  sparsely settled areas, the small towns and farms where a fourth of America's  people live.  </P> <P> A recent study done for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Assn. says  improved health care insurance would help as much as anything, ranking with  jobs, water and sewer systems.  </P> <P> The association, a lobbying force on Capitol Hill, is a major backer of  comprehensive rural development legislation.  </P> <P> Rural development is also the concern of a number of congressional leaders,  including Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Agriculture  Committee, who says: "We cannot have two Americas -- one a land of opportunity  and a second, rural America, left behind."  </P> <P> Leahy said rural areas, with an estimated 61 million people and 14,000 small  towns and cities, are in trouble because of higher unemployment and poverty  rates than in metropolitan areas.  </P> <P> The problems of rural health care seem obvious to the casual observer -- there  are simply not enough doctors and hospitals in the countryside. A sick or  injured person in the big city has a much better chance of getting quick  treatment than a farmer in the middle of a pasture in Kansas or Wyoming.  </P> <P> But some believe that there is a more promising side to this dark coin and that  there are solutions.  </P> <P> "Almost all rural hospitals are losing money as a result of dramatic declines  in use, changes in government funding and fewer local doctors," an Agriculture  Department report said. "But that does not mean that rural residents must forgo  local medical care."  </P> <P> Rural areas can have a strong base for local health care, given some creativity  and persistence, the report said. There are alternatives to hospitalization and  sometimes to doctors themselves.  </P> <P> "Most patients no longer need a bed in a hospital," the report said. "And  modern emergency care techniques can stabilize patients for transport to a more  distant hospital. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners can help ease  the workload of the local physicians."  </P> <P> The report, "Rural America and the Revolution in Health Care," was written by  Jeffrey C. Bauer, a former professor at the University of Colorado Medical  Center and now head of his own rural health consulting firm. Co-author Eileen  Weis, a registered nurse, is a strategic planner with the same firm, the Bauer  Group of Hillrose, Colo.  </P> <P> "Rural areas today have too few physicians," the report said. "Some areas have  none. Unlike their city-based colleagues, many rural physicians are the only  doctor in town, bearing all the burdens of being on call every evening and  every weekend."  </P> <P> Moreover, it said, disproportionately large numbers of government-insured or  uninsured patients live in rural areas, and that means lower income for  doctors.  </P> <P> Faced with career burnout and lower pay, many head for the cities and more  lucrative fields. Hospitals built 30 or 40 years ago have vacancies galore.  </P> <P> "Most small and rural hospitals today fill less than 30% of their beds; 80%  occupancy levels were common just 10 years ago," the report said. "However,  rural communities should not assume that their hospitals' problems will all be  solved if more doctors move into town or if hospital reimbursement rates are  equalized."  </P> <P> One of the basic alternatives has been the development of primary medical care  without putting patients in a hospital bed.  </P> <P> "Up-to-date primary care practitioners can meet 80% to 90% of all health care  needs without acute care hospital beds," the report said. "Technological  advances now enable primary care specialists to provide advanced diagnostic  capabilities in their offices or clinics."  </P> <P> Nurse practitioners and doctor assistants can perform many primary care  functions with varying degrees of supervision by physicians.  </P> <P> The report said emergency medical services provide the other key to the future  of rural health.  </P> <P> Because of recent scientific and technological advances, a modern emergency  system "can actually be better than a typical emergency room in a rural  hospital," the report said. With a trained crew working with a fully equipped  modern ambulance, most critically ill or injured patients can be stabilized at  the scene.  </P> <P> "Thus, saving a small, rural hospital to preserve emergency care is not  necessarily the best way to keep emergency care in rural areas," the report  said. "In many smaller towns, money spent toward emergency medical care is  better spent on upgraded" emergency medical services.  </P> <P> But talk of closing hospitals can strike nerves, as Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.)  demonstrated recently during a Veterans Affairs Committee hearing. Washington  policy makers are fundamentally oblivious to the needs of rural America, he  charged.  </P> <P> "They really don't understand the sense of space and distance" in rural areas,  Baucus said. The discussion at the time involved the possibility of closing  rural veterans hospitals in Montana, a move ruled out at the hearing by  Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski.  </P> <P> The National Rural Electric Cooperative Assn. says expanded medical insurance  coverage heads its list of ways to improve rural health care.  </P> <P> Bob Bergland, vice president and general manager of the association, said: "We  want to make sure that the needs of rural Americans are considered in the  current debate on medical insurance coverage and other health care problems."  </P> <P> Bergland, who was secretary of agriculture in the Jimmy Carter Administration,  said rural residents are less likely than city people to benefit from tax  incentives and other programs aimed at making health care more available and  affordable.  </P> <P> But he said: "Doctors and nurses will be the first to tell you that it's not  just their numbers that are important for good rural health care. We've got to  assure things like adequate water and sewer facilities, nutrition education and  preventive health care."  </P></p>

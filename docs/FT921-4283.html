			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Drexel Dollars 1.3bn payout plan cleared THE DREXEL Burnham Lambert saga drew to a close yesterday as claimants against the once high-flying, but now defunct, US investment bank gave their support to a Dollars 1.3bn 'global settlement plan' and a US judge approved it. The aim is to settle the hundreds of civil claims and lawsuits brought against the investment bank after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 1990. Under the scheme, Mr Michael Milken, former head of Drexel's junk bond department, would contribute another Dollars 500m, while some 200 of his former colleagues would provide Dollars 300m from their employee partnership interests. Added to Dollars 100m of insurance money, and the Dollars 400m which Mr Milken has already paid into a Securities and Exchange Commission disgorgement fund, this will create a Dollars 1.3bn pool. The money would be split between the claimants under court and SEC supervision. Yesterday's approvals came from two federal agencies, the Resolution Trust Company and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. They had brought multi-billion dollar suits against Drexel and Mr Milken on behalf of failed savings and loan associations, which had been Drexel customers. Last week the FDIC appeared to jeopardise the settlement when it said it could not approve such a plan without more information about the settling parties. However, in court yesterday, the agency's representative said the board had now approved the deal. Officials explained that additional provisions had been attached to the agreement providing for the release of some further information, and allowing the agency to withdraw under certain circumstances. The Manhattan court also heard that settling claimants included the California Insurance Commissioner, who had sued over the collapse of Executive Life, a large Californian life company which was a Drexel customer. Also included are the class-action suits on behalf of individual investors. The 200 former Drexel employees have yet to sign up on their portion of the deal, and the judge acknowledged that there was some disgruntlement over how their relative contributions should be calculated. However, employees who do not back the scheme and choose to continue litigation will lose the right to immunity from any Drexel-related suits in the future. Separately, a bankruptcy court judge was expected to approve the Drexel 'reorganisation' plan. This essentially winds up its affairs, leaving only a small business to manage the least liquid assets.</p>

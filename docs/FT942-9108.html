			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (8): Partners see growth potential - Unrest fails to dent Russia's attractions Undeterred by the political upheaval in Russia over the past 12 months, western power equipment suppliers have been forming a number of joint ventures to ensure they are positioned to exploit the country's long-term growth potential. Leaving aside the controversial issue of where the financing will come from to fund the virtual rebuilding of the Russian power sector, there is general agreement among suppliers on what needs to be done. First, the oldest Chernobyl-type nuclear power stations have to be closed down, and the newer reactors should be modernised. Secondly, new power stations have to be built quickly to replace the older nuclear stations - and for a country with the world's largest gas supplies that suggests quick-to-build gas-fired combined cycle plants. Thirdly, the existing gas-fired stations in Russia need to be repowered to make them more efficient - ending the wastefulness that has developed because supplies of gas are so plentiful. The joint ventures are aimed at addressing one or more of these needs but are also intended to recognise that, as Mr Fritz Gautschi, a senior executive in ABB's power generation business, puts it, 'Russian potential clients have little or no hard currency'. This means that, as far as possible, high-value added machinery has to be built in Russia rather than imported. Mr Gautschi sits on the board of two joint ventures which ABB has announced in the past few months in Russia. In September, the Swiss-Swedish group formed a joint venture with Saturn, a Russian company that produces aero-engines and other high-tech equipment. The venture, ABB Uniturbo, will supply power generation components and was thus a precursor of a second, bigger deal announced by ABB in January. In this deal, ABB teamed up with Nevsky Zavod, a big manufacturer of gas and steam turbines, to create St Petersburg-based ABB Nevsky, which will make the latest ABB designs of turbines, power plants and related equipment for the Russian market. The two ventures have begun with a total workforce of 1,800, and will work together, with Uniturbo supplying parts to Nevsky. Thus ABB is developing a network of interdependent plants which is analogous to the system operating across much of the modern western equipment industry. One of the challenges, however, is to develop the similarities with the west throughout the supplier base for the factories. Suppliers of strategic materials, which after the break-up of the Soviet Union may not even be in Russia, are having to be educated about supplier-customer relationships, says Mr Gautschi. Within the factories, though, ABB is on schedule with such things as introducing its processes and methods, reorganising layouts, and training employees. The aim, says Mr Gautschi, is to train local people as quickly as possible. Much as in the few other western companies with manufacturing joint ventures in Russia, the general manager of the ventures is Russian while his deputy is a non-Russian. ABB has also brought in outsiders as financial controllers and engineering experts. Mr Gautschi will not say how much ABB has spent on the ventures, but says it is a significant sum if all the investment in training, and management time, is included. He stresses, though, that the investment is not done out of charity. Depending on how the first year works out, ABB is looking for the ventures to start producing a positive payback after about two years. The ABB ventures are hoping to clinch their first orders in the next few weeks, but meanwhile Siemens of German has already delivered equipment from Interturbo, its St Petersburg-based venture with turbine manufacturer LMZ. Last month, Interturbo completed its second 150MW gas turbine, which like the first will be incorporated by Siemens into world market projects. Interturbo will also manufacture four additional gas turbines for the St Petersburg Northwest combined-cycle cogeneration power station and a further four units for the Aktyubinsk IPP combined-cycle plant in Kazakhstan. Last year,Siemens also announced two further power-related ventures in Russia. In August, it said it would co-operate with Kaluga-based KTZ, Russia's largest manufacturer of industrial turbines, in the production and marketing of industrial steam turbines and power plants. Three months later, Siemens announced it was establishing a Moscow-based joint venture, Interautomatika, to handle the engineering, sales and marketing of Siemens instrumentation and control equipment for fossil-fuelled power plants. Siemens sees the venture as a milestone towards playing an active role, as a partner in the Russian power supply industry, in the modernisation of the country's power plants. If the European suppliers have more solid evidence of activity from their joint ventures, their US rivals have also been active or are at least hoping to be so. Westinghouse last month announced two power-related business agreements which will significantly increase its presence in Russia. An agreement signed with Minatom, the Russian Ministry for Atomic Energy, will enable Westinghouse to begin establishing partnerships that will concentrate on modernisation and safety enhancement of operating nuclear power plants, and on completing plants that are under construction by applying current safety technology. As part of the deal, there will also be a joint venture for the design and manufacture of instrumentation and control systems and another that will provide nuclear fuel cycle services worldwide. In a second agreement with RAO Rossi, the world's largest utility, the US company will become involved in projects to improve power plant efficiency and reduce emissions. The two organisations will jointly pursue opportunities to modernise existing turbine generation, repower older stations with state-of-the art equipment, and develop new power projects. The companies will do engineering jointly, but will also have co-manufacturing initiatives with other leading Russian companies. General Electric, meanwhile, does not yet have any direct power-related joint ventures in Russia, although it was a signatory to a deal in 1991 between Anglo-French GEC Alsthom, with which it has technology links, and the St Petersburg-based Kirov Works. The venture is producing 25MW gas turbines for gas-pumping applications. But Mr Ronald Pressman, chief executive of GE Power Systems Europe, says Russia is 'pretty fertile ground for partnerships'. GE views itself both as a supplier of gas turbines to Russia and as a potential partner with a Russian steam turbine manufacturer to serve the combined cycle market. In time, GE wants to become a local player in Russia, he says, and would prefer to develop more of a 'greenfield' partnership with a smaller company rather than with an existing large organisation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry  disseminated a statement resolutely condemning the bloody event,  which took place in the town of Hebron when Palestinians were at  prayer. The statement by Ukraine's foreign policy department  expresses deep sympathy to the families of those who died and  the hope that the injured will recover. It emphasizes that any  terrorist actions, whatever their aim might be, and whoever they  are carried out by, are not justified.    Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry has appealed to the  Palestinian and Israeli sides with a call not to resort to  self-seeking emotions, and expressed the hope for a continuation  of the Arab-Israeli dialogue with the aim of achieving a  peaceful settlement in the Near East.</p>

			<p><P> January 9, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> FLYING DEATH TOLL TOPS '87 FIGURE  </P> <P> Accidents among U.S. commercial airlines decreased in 1988 but the year-end  crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Scotland sent the annual death toll well above  the previous year, the government said today.  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board issued figures showing that the rates  and total number of accidents dropped significantly from 1987 among major  airlines and commuter carriers -- with record lows for general domestic  aviation. Last month's 270 deaths in the crash of Flight 103 in Lockerbie,  Scotland, however, sent the annual fatality toll among major commercial  carriers up to 285 from the previous year's 231, according to the preliminary  statistics.  </P></p>

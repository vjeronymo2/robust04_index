			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GONDOLIERS DUMP TRASH AT CITY HALL  </P> <P> Tourists watched in amazement today as Venice's gondoliers dumped canal rubbish  in front of the city hall for the second time in 24 hours to protest the city's  squalid appearance.  </P> <P> On Sunday, 60 gondoliers toured the city in 30 boats collecting bottles, cans,  fast food containers and other urban rubbish from the canals.  </P> <P> Thousands of tourists in Venice for the Easter weekend watched and took photos  as the whole lot was dumped in front of the council's offices. "In recent  months, we've made numerous appeals to the authorities (to clean up the city),  but they've done nothing," said Antonio Scarpa, spokesman for the Gondoliers  for Venice group.  </P></p>

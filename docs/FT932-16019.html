			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Italy's bank chief hints at recovery MR Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy, yesterday threw his weight behind a gathering consensus that the Italian economy was beginning to show the first modest signs of recovery. The governor's comments, made during a public lecture, were hedged by caution. Nevertheless, they reflect the view held by Confindustria, the industrialists' association, that order books have begun to improve and the economy is benefiting from a surge in exports as a result of last September's devaluation. Mr Ciampi observed: 'The results in terms of prices, of labour costs and of foreign trade confirm the opportunity our economy has - and which it has begun to grasp.' The economy is scheduled to grow 0.5 per cent this year. But if the modest recovery becomes more sustained and interest rates move further downward, the growth rate could increase - despite the problems created by Italy's political crisis and corruption scandals. Mr Ciampi insisted the weakness of the lira, which has touched L1,000 against the D-Mark and depressed prices in the bond market, was the result of political uncertainties more than economic fundamentals. 'In recent days the bond market and the lira have been hit by uncertainties due to doubts about the political situation, not a worsening of domestic or international economic conditions.' The Bank of Italy has on several occasions maintained that the lira at its current parity of close to L1,000 to the D-Mark is under-valued. However, exporters have begun to take advantage of the historic opportunity presented by a devaluation of almost 30 per cent, accompanied by inflation running at an annualised 4.2 per cent. Export figures for February for non-EC countries showed a 25 per cent rise over the same period the previous year. The rise of non-EC exports, which account for 40 per cent of the total, combined with a decline in imports, ensured the trade deficit in the first two months of the year was L626bn (Pounds 260m) compared with L2,500bn a year ago. Because of the EC's new customs procedures introduced in January, Community trade figures are still not known. However, the level of Italian exports is understood to have begun to concern the Germans and French. At the same time a study prepared for the trade unions showed wages were lagging well behind inflation. In 1992 wages grew on average at 4.7 per cent against inflation of 5.4 per cent. In the public sector wages grew at only 2.2 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIA'S HAWKE ENDORSES U.S. POLICY ON CHINA  </P> <P> Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke endorsed U.S. policy toward China during  talks Tuesday with President Bush and said it would be counterproductive to  impose economic sanctions on the world's most populous nation.  </P> <P> "Our views are identical" on China, Hawke told reporters while posing for  pictures with Bush in the Oval Office.  </P> <P> "We completely, unequivocally abhor and condemn the barbarism, the murder, the  execution, the suppression of legitimate human aspirations," Hawke said.  </P> <P> Hawke, nearing the end of his four-day visit to Washington, praised Bush for  publicly deploring the Chinese government's decision to crush pro-democracy  demonstrations with force, while refraining from taking major economic moves to  punish Beijing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Would Be Counterproductive'  </P> <P> "We also agree that for the same reason that we want to ensure that those  interests in China have the opportunity of being advanced, that it would be  counterproductive to end the economic relationship," the prime minister said.  </P> <P> Bush has faced mounting pressures from members of Congress who want the United  States to take a harsher position on China.  </P></p>

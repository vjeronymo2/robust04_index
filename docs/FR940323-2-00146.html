			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> DGPS improves upon GPS signals by using a local reference receiver to correct errors in the standard GPS signals. An ``all in view'' GPS receiver is located at a site which has been geodetically surveyed. The receiver monitors all visible satellites and measures the pseudorange to each satellite. Since the satellite signal contains information on the precise satellite orbits and the reference receiver knows its position, the true range to each satellite can be calculated. By comparing the calculated true range and the measured pseudorange, a correction term can be determined for each satellite. These corrections are then broadcast to the user over the communications network, and can be received by the user with a DGPS receiver. The Coast Guard will be using selected marine radiobeacons to transmit the corrections to users. The corrections are then applied to the pseudorange measurements within the user's receiver, achieving a position accurate within 10 meters, with 95% probability. One advantage of DGPS is that it will provide radionavigation accuracy that is not possible with existing systems. It will also reduce the integrity check of satellites from hours to seconds, and will even allow for use of satellites considered unhealthy. By knowing its position, the reference station can detect immediately when a satellite may be sending erroneous data. DGPS accuracies cannot be achieved with either the GPS Standard Positioning Service, with Selective Availability on or off, or Precise Positioning Service. The Coast Guard will also implement an integrity monitoring system which will verify the accuracy of the corrections that it transmits on the selected radiobeacon. The Coast Guard's DGPS Service will be implemented for harbor and harbor approach areas of the continential U.S., Great Lakes, Puerto Rico, and most of Hawaii and Alaska by 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Information Availability <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Operational status and other information about GPS is available to worldwide users of GPS through the Coast Guard's GPS Information Center (GPSIC). The GPSIC sends GPS operational status information to civil users through Operational Advisory Broadcasts (OAB). These broadcasts contain the following general categories of GPS performance data: Current constellation status, Recent (past) outages, Scheduled (future) outages, and Almanac data. The OAB is disseminated or made available through the following media: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> GPSIC Computer Bulletin Board System (BBS) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GPSIC 24-Hour Status Recording <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WWV/WWVH worldwide high-frequency radio broadcasts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Coast Guard Marine Information Broadcasts (MIB) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DMAHTC Broadcast Warnings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DMAHTC Weekly Notice to Mariners <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DMA Navigation Information Network (NAVINFONET) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAVTEX Data Broadcast <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Through a duty watchstander and an electronic bulletin board service (BBS), both available 24 hours per day, GPSIC also makes the following information available: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Operational status of GPS as provided by DOD <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Precise GPS orbit data from the National Geodetic Survey <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Technical information on GPS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Operational status and information on other Coast Guard operated radionavigation systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Instructions on the access and use of GPSIC services <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Air Force Second Space Operations Squadron (2SOPS), which operates the GPS Master Control Station (MCS) in Colorado Springs, CO, provides the following GPS information for the GPSIC: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

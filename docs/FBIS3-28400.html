Han said at the closing ceremony of the annual  conference of Korean ambassadors and envoys, "there has been an  criticism that our policies on the North Korean nuclear problem  are vague and not consistent. But this is different from the  fact.    "There is no change in the government's position that it  solves the problem through dialogue."    It is important, however, he said, for the government to  take  flexible measures according to change of the situation. And in  the context, the government policies should maintain the  "dynamic consistency."    "But we cannot rule out the possibility that the government  may face an extreme situation where it should take decisive  measures on the North Korean nuclear problem," he said. "Even  in that case, the government will not give up the efforts to  solve the problem through dialogue."    Meanwhile, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong told  journalist Saturday that, even if sanctions are used to solve  the North Korean nuclear problem, the door to dialogue with  Seoul will always be open to Pyongyang.</p>

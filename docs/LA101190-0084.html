			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAXES / POLITICAL 'NEUTRON BOMB?';  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS IS SYMBOL OF NATIONAL REVOLT;  </P> <P> OPPONENTS SAY ROLLBACK INITIATIVE WILL 'KILL PEOPLE, BUT LEAVE THE REAL ESTATE  INTACT.' CITIZENS ARGUE THAT SPENDING IS OUT OF CONTROL.  </P> <P> Anti-tax crusader Barbara Anderson says she gave the Massachusetts Legislature  fair warning two years ago when, during the ill-fated presidential campaign of  Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, state lawmakers "faked two budgets in one night" in  their panic over the state's mounting fiscal woes.  </P> <P> "We knew there would be tax increases," said Anderson, executive director of  the 15,000-member Citizens for Limited Taxation. "We told them: 'If you're  going to do this, you're going to face it on the ballot in 1990. Don't do it!'  "  </P> <P> But the lawmakers paid her no mind, Anderson says. And now, true to her word,  they are facing a tax-slashing initiative on next month's ballot that -- if  approved, as some polls show likely -- will amount to the largest reduction in  state taxes ever in the nation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> What Measure Would Do  </P> <P> The measure, sponsored by Anderson's organization and known as "Question 3" for  its place on the ballot, would cut more than $1 billion out of this year's  $13.4-billion state budget and double that amount out of next year's spending  plan, according to official estimates.  </P> <P> Opponents of the measure say the impact on Massachusetts would be nothing short  of disastrous, throwing thousands of state workers off the payroll, slashing  vital human services from day care to elderly lunch programs, forcing the  shutdown of many schools and colleges, bringing a halt to critical state  construction projects and sending Massachusetts' already shaky credit rating  down the tubes.  </P> <P> A formidable array of individuals and groups representing government, business,  labor and religion have joined forces to defeat the proposal, viewing it as a  mindless, heartless and vindictive approach to curing the state's fiscal  crisis.  </P> <P> "Question 3 is a neutron bomb of a political weapon," Boston Globe columnist  David Nyhan wrote recently, reflecting a widespread sentiment among the  proposal's critics. "It will kill people, but leave the real estate intact."  </P> <P> But Anderson, who engineered passage in 1980 of a measure known as Proposition  2 1/2 that put stiff caps on local property tax increases, contends that  extreme times call for extreme measures. Left to their own devices, she argues,  state lawmakers would continue to fiddle while Massachusetts burns from bloated  state budgets, excessive taxation and fiscal irresponsibility.  </P> <P> "There is a strong silent majority of people who are with us and are just  waiting for Nov. 6," which is the date of the general election, Anderson said.  "They're going to vote 'yes' on Question 3 because they know there is no  alternative."  </P> <P> Massachusetts taxpayers are not the only ones up in arms over what they see as  out-of-control government spending. Louisiana voters earlier this month  approved a constitutional amendment that limits increases in state spending to  the prior three-year average increase in state personal income.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A National Pattern  </P> <P> In addition, at least eight other states, including California, are set to vote  on ballot measures during elections next month that would place restrictions on  tax and spending increases.  </P> <P> And in several other states without provisions for voter initiatives to curb  taxes, such as New Jersey, strong grass-roots movements are seeking  constitutional amendments that would grant the electorate such rights.  </P> <P> "People feel that the guys they elected are not paying attention to the store  and keep charging the taxpayers more so they can go off on any tangent they  want without developing (fiscal) priorities," said Janice Ballou, polling  director of Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics.  </P> <P> Still, the current anti-tax mood has far to go before it matches that of the  late '70s and early '80s, when limitation measures were approved in 16 states,  including California's celebrated Proposition 13, says Scott Mackey, a fiscal  policy specialist with the Denver-based National Conference of State  Legislatures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Outlook  </P> <P> Of all the anti-tax ballot measures this year, Massachusetts' Question 3 would  have the most far reaching consequences. It would repeal the $1.8-billion tax  increase Dukakis signed in July -- the largest in the state's history -- and  roll fees and charges back to their 1988 levels. It also would cut state income  tax rates for two years to repay taxpayers for a $740-million tax increase  enacted last year.  </P> <P> Opponents of the measure concede that, despite their broad-based support and  vastly superior financial resources, they face a tough battle in winning the  hearts and minds of Massachusetts voters.  </P> <P> "All the facts are with us, but all the emotion is with the other side," said  James Braude, head of the Campaign for Massachusetts' Future, a coalition  opposing the measure. "The issue for November is whether rationality will  prevail over anger."  </P> <P> </P> <P> TAX ISSUES ON NOVEMBER BALLOTS  </P> <P> State: California  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Constitutional  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Requires simple majority vote of the electorate to  raise general taxes locally and by statewide ballot initiative, and a  two-thirds vote to raise special (earmarked) taxes locally or by statewide  ballot initiative.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: Colorado  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Constitutional  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Limits property tax levies; requires voter approval  for state and local tax increases or debt issues; limits spending increases to  inflation and population growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: Massachusetts  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Statutory  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Repeals all tax and fee increases approved  legislatively or administratively since June, 1988; reduces personal income  taxes for two years to offset 1989 increase.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: Montana  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Constitutional  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Replaces all current personal and corporate income  taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, license charges and other user fees with  1% "transaction" tax.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: Nebraska  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Constitutional  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Limits state and local spending increases to 2%,  with four-fifths legislative vote needed to override limits on state spending  and majority vote to override limits on local spending.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: Nebraska  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Statutory  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Repeals 1990 tax increase for education finance  reform.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: Nevada  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Constitutional  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Prohibits state from imposing a personal income tax.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: Oregon  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Constitutional  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Limits property taxes for schools to 5% of valuation  and for general government to 1% of valuation; requires state to make up school  revenue lost due to property tax caps.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: South Dakota  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Constitutional  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Limits property tax revenue increases to 2% annually  for any taxing jurisdiction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> State: Utah  </P> <P> Type of Measure: Statutory  </P> <P> Description of initiative: Repeals state sales tax on food.  </P> <P> SOURCE: National Conference of State Legislatures  </P></p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Row over dockyard contract intensifies THE CHIEFS of two naval dockyards joined battle yesterday over the tactics used to win a government contract that would secure thousands of jobs. The privately managed yards at Devonport, Plymouth, and Rosyth, Fife, are competing for a Ministry of Defence contract to refit nuclear submarines. Devonport argued that the 'goalposts had been moved' when Rosyth submitted a late proposal for the contract on Thursday, after the government extended the final deadline. It further accused Rosyth of adopting a plan similar to its own and which Rosyth had previously said was inadequate. Mr Mike Leece, chief executive of Devonport Management Limited, said: 'What really galls is that it has taken us 28 months to develop our proposals. It's physically not possible for any company to do the same unless they have had access to our information.' Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Thorn, which manages Rosyth Royal Dockyards, denied that he had access to Devonport's proposals. He said Babcock had 'dusted off' old plans for the MoD. The two yards had initially submitted very different proposals: Rosyth that new docks should be built, and Devonport that the old ones could be upgraded. Mr Smith said the MoD had recently indicated that it wanted to see a proposal for upgraded docks from both dockyards. He said: 'We still believe new-build is better, but if they (the MoD) are prepared to live with an upgrade, then it can be done at Rosyth as well as it can at Devonport.' The upgrade would be much cheaper than building from scratch. The MoD announced last week that the decision between the two yards would not now be taken until the new year. The post-cold-war fleet was smaller, the MoD said, and there was not enough nuclear submarine refitting work for both yards. It said the extra time was needed to gather information from the companies, other ministries and about the local economies around the yards. Mr Smith acknowledged that wider issues had become involved in the contracts. 'It's a question of whether our communities gain. We are fighting on their behalf.'</p>

[passage omitted]    On behalf of the provincial science and technology  association, the provincial labor department, and the provincial  science and technology commission, Yin Yongzhang, chairman of  the provincial science and technology association, expressed  Lunar New Year greetings to the participants, saying: Last  year, the province proceeded with scientific and technological  work along the strategy of economic development, deepened  scientific and technological structural reform, and steadily  invigorated Qinghai by means of science and technology, thus  stimulating the province's economic construction. The province  unfolded the 3341 Scientific and Technological Experimental  Project, the Torch Program, the Spark Program, the Good Harvest  Program, and the Prairie Fire Program -- all of which directly  benefited economic construction, played a positive role in  popularizing the use of scientific and technological  achievements, and made significant contributions to the  province's scientific and technological development. Yin  Yongzhang sincerely thanked scientific and technological  personnel for their creative efforts and great contributions.    Provincial party Secretary Yin Kesheng also made a speech.  On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, he  expressed Lunar New Year greetings to scientific and  technological personnel throughout the province, saying:  Reviewing the past and looking to the future, we feel deeply  the importance of scientific and technological work. Scientific  and technological personnel in Qinghai have made great  contributions to economic construction and social development.  Our economy needs to be developed, and our science and  technology need to be invigorated. As Qinghai is economically  and culturally backward, the role of science and technology is  particularly important. To narrow the gap between  technologically advanced regions and ourselves, we must, in many  aspects, rely on advanced science and technology, develop and  expand the ranks of scientific and technological personnel, and  improve the quality of the entire laborers. In the new  situation of establishing the socialist market economic  structure, science and technology also face a test. [passage  omitted]</p>

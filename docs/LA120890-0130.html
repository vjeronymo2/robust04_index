			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SYRACUSE DOES WHAT IT MUST BUT NO MORE  </P> <P> The outcome was never in doubt, but No. 4 Syracuse couldn't turn its  opening-round game of the Carrier Classic into a rout at Syracuse, N.Y.  </P> <P> Syracuse sputtered to an 18-point first-half lead but failed to completely  shake Division II Alaska-Anchorage on the way to a 103-85 victory.  </P> <P> "It might have seemed like we were toying with them, but we don't toy with  anybody. They played a good game," said sophomore Conrad McRae, who joined  Billy Owens as Syracuse's top scorers with 16 points apiece.  </P> <P> "If we had kept our starting five in, it would have made a big difference,"  said Owens, who played the longest of any starter, 31 minutes.  </P> <P> "The second team got to play long minutes. You have to get other players in a  game like this, because they're not going to play in the close ones."  </P> <P> Scott McCorkle, a freshman from Capistrano Valley, was one of the beneficiaries  of the playing time, scoring 11 points. Syracuse finished with five players in  double figures, including McRae, a sophomore whose previous best outing was 12  points against North Carolina State. Freshman guard Adrian Autry had 15 on  four-for-eight three-point shooting.  </P> <P> Syracuse (6-0) meets North Carolina-Charlotte in tonight's championship game.  The 49ers overcame a 22-point first-half deficit to defeat Florida 94-92 in the  other opening-round game.  </P> <P> Syracuse appeared to be playing only as hard as they had to against the  Seawolves (4-4), whose tallest starter was 6 feet 7. Syracuse led just 7-6  after four minutes and was ahead, 24-18, after Mark Gisseman made two free  throws with 7:57 left in the half.  </P> <P> Then Autry came alive from beyond the three-point line. His third three-pointer  in a three-minute stretch gave Syracuse a 39-23 cushion with 4:06 to play.  </P> <P> Syracuse has never lost an opening-round game in the tournament it has played  host to for 14 years.  </P></p>

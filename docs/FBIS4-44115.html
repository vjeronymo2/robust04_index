			<p>BFN     [Text] Magdeburg (DDP/ADN) -- Lothar Bisky, leader of the  Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], described his party's  performance in the Saxony Anhalt state elections as another step  by the PDS in the direction of the Bundestag. Commenting on the  most recent computer predictions, which show the Socialist Unity  Party's successor party as the third-strongest party with 18  percent of the vote, Bisky told journalists that Saxony Anhalt  shows that "people in the east want us." Despite really massive  threats in recent weeks, the voters did not allow themselves to  be confused, he said, adding that this is a good thing and gives  him confidence for the federal elections. The PDS is aiming for  at least three first-past-the-post seats, and thus entry into  the federal parliament, Bisky said.</p>

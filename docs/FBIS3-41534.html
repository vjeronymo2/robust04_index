			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the ``Channel Africa Report'' program] </F>   [Text] [words indistinct] Swaziland's head game warden, Ted  Reilly, for help. Tom Holloway has the story:    The South African Police investigations concern flocks of  ostriches from South Africa which (?smugglers) are swopping with  ostrich flocks in Namibia, but illegally exporting to Swaziland  and then reexporting to lucrative markets overseas.    Mr. Reilly explained that as South Africa has the largest  population of the most productive ostriches left in Africa, it  has banned the export of its ostriches which are most wanted  overseas, in order to conserve and build up South Africa's  ostrich population. The fact that Namibia's ostrich industry has  been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting  and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the  birds) by South Africa, have increased the value and demand for  ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and  racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry.    Swaziland, however, said Mr. Reilly, does not want to be  used  in a racket which could damage its own ostrich industry, as well  as the protected ostrich industry of its neighbor, South Africa.  He said he had therefore agreed to assist the South African  Police in their investigations concerning ostrich flocks in  Namibia and a certain ostrich farm in Swaziland, currently  engaged in exporting ostriches to overseas markets.</p>

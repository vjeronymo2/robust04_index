			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEPHEW HELD IN SLAYING OVER $40  </P> <P> A squabble over a $40 debt escalated into a fight that left an Antelope Valley  man dead and the victim's nephew in custody on suspicion of murder, authorities  said Sunday.  </P> <P> Authorities said James H. Grissom, 24, shot and killed his uncle, Donnie Ray  McKinley, 32, after the two argued and fought at Grissom's house in the 10100  block of East Avenue S-14 in Lancaster late Saturday night.  </P> <P> Grissom was being held without bail at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department substation in Lancaster.  </P> <P> Deputy Bill Linnemeyer said the two men were arguing about a debt that  McKinley, a resident of Llano, claimed Grissom owed him. The two scuffled and  Grissom grabbed a 12-gauge shotgun and shot his uncle once in the chest,  according to Linnemeyer.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies, answering a 911 call from a relative at the house, found  McKinley lying in a hallway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene of the  shooting.  </P></p>

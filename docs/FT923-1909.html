			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Commander George Churchill-Coleman to be replaced by Commander David Tucker COMMANDER George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch for seven years, is to be replaced by Commander David Tucker, the Metropolitan Police commissioner said yesterday. Sir Peter Imbert said the move was one of a number involving senior officers in the Metropolitan Police. Mr Tucker, at present head of the force's criminal intelligence branch, takes over from Mr Churchill-Coleman against a background of reports of the government's impatience with the anti-terrorist squad's failure to prevent IRA attacks on the mainland. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, recently said MI5 was to take over the primary responsibility for gathering intelligence about IRA terrorism on mainland Britain. Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, which deals with the investigation of IRA incidents and the subsequent preparation of evidence, was unaffected operationally by the move.</p>

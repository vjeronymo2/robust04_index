			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bai Yingzi (4101 5391 1217), the State Economic </F> and Trade Commission's Enterprise Corporation: "100  Pilot-Project Enterprises Engage in Key Endeavor To Set Up a  Modern Enterprise System"]    [Text] A modern enterprise system is one that is suited to  the needs of our socialist market economy, based on perfecting  our enterprise incorporation system, characterized by a system  of limited liability, and uses the main form of incorporated  enterprises. The "CPC Central Committee Resolution on Certain  Issues Involved in Establishing a Socialist Market Economy"  passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee points out that: "A modern enterprise system dominated  by public ownership is the grounds for our socialist market  economy." "As establishing a modern enterprise system is a  necessary requirement for developing socialized large-scale  production and a market economy, it is China's state-enterprise  reform direction." To implement this "Resolution" of the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the State  Council has decided to choose 100 state enterprises as pilot  units for practicing a modern enterprise system, charging the  pertinent departments, such as the State Economic and Trade  Commission and the State System Reform Commission, with the job  of drawing up specific plans and organizing their implementation.  <H5>  I. Establishing a Modern Enterprise System Was Our </H5> Inevitable Option for State-Enterprise Reform    Ever since China began to reform and open up,  state-enterprise reform has held the central position in  national economic reform, remaining our whole economic-reform  priority and difficulty. This reform has adopted measures, such  as profit commissions, conversion from profits to taxes in two  steps, and the contract system, making a certain amount of  progress in expanding enterprise decisionmaking power, and  increasing enterprise operating vitality to a certain extent.  And the putting into effect of the "Enterprise Law" and the  "Forces-Conversion Regulations" has further promoted the  implementation of enterprise decisionmaking power, laying the  grounds for enterprise market access. But state-enterprise  reform measures are still essentially the outcome of the  authority-devolution and profit-concession ideology, not yet  having involved an upgrading of our traditional enterprise  system under our planned economic system per se, with  longstanding state-enterprise problems, such as no separation  between government administration and business management,  unclear property rights, no enterprise autonomy, and unsound  self-restraint forces, never having been essentially solved,  leaving state-enterprise vitality obviously still relatively  inadequate, enterprise activities hard to standardize, and  economic efficiency less than ideal. The facts prove that  further intensification of reform will mean resolving deeper  conflicts, by adjusting the policy of mainly devolving authority  and conceding profits to the creation of an enterprise system  characterized mostly by clear property-rights relations, and  through exploring effective ways to combine our state economy  with a market economy, to find new ways for running state  enterprises better.    A modern enterprise system using the main form of company  incorporation has four obvious features: 1. Property-rights  relations are clear, effectively achieving the separation of  investor's ownership rights from enterprise corporation property  rights. 2. The relations between rights and liabilities are  clear, with enterprises having corporate assets, giving them the  right of independent decisionmaking, while reinforcing their  liabilities for their own profits and losses and for preserving  and multiplying the capital put up by investors. 3. The  establishment and operation of corporate ruling bodies, such as  shareholder meetings, boards of directors, executive  departments, and boards of supervisors, forms balance and  restraint forces to regulate the relations among owners,  corporate delegates, operators, and employee collectives. 4. It  contributes to fundraising, creating a good form for expanding  production scale and achieving capital socialization. So  reorganizing state enterprises into modern incorporated  companies paves the way for cutting the umbilical cord between  government administration and business management, rationalizing  state-assets property relations, and genuinely converting the  operating forces of state enterprises.  <H5>  II. The Planning and Methodology Involved in Choosing 100 </H5> State Enterprises as Pilot Units for a Modern Enterprise System    The "Resolution" points out that: "As the establishment of a  modern enterprise system will be a difficult and complex task,  we will need to accumulate experience, create conditions, and  proceed gradually." "Having state enterprises practice a  corporate system will be a valuable exploration in the  establishment of a modern enterprise system." The enterprise  practice of a corporate system will be not simply a change of  name, but rather an emphasis on converting forces, "which will  proceed gradually through pilot units, with absolutely no  formalism or precipitate action." To ensure that the pilot  units proceed effectively, the pertinent departments, such as  the State Economic and Trade Commission and the State System  Reform Commission, have drawn up detailed plans and methods for  the 100 pilot enterprises.  <H5>  1. The Pilot-Unit Goals </H5>   The goals to be reached through pilot units are: To search  for effective ways to combine public ownership with a market  economy, spurring enterprises to convert their operating forces,  improving economic efficiency, and further freeing up and  developing the productive forces; to explore ways to separate  administrative and business functions, enabling enterprises to  thoroughly break free from their status as subsidiaries to  government administrative bodies, with the government not  directly involved in enterprise production and operation  activities, so that enterprises can truely gain access to  markets and make their own operating decisions based on market  demand; to accumulate experience for rationalizing property  rights relations, establishing enterprise corporate property  rights, enabling enterprises to become genuine corporate  entities enjoying civil rights and charged with civil  liabilities, and consolidating the capabilities of civil rights  and actions, to conscientiously achieve liability for profits  and losses; to perfect the leadership and organizational  management systems within enterprises, advancing in the  direction of standardization and more scientific, to evolve  clear rights and liabilities, unity and cooperation, and mututal  restraint forces within enterprises.  <H5>  2. The Pilot-Enterprise Selection </H5>   The selection of pilot enterprises was based on the  following  principles and terms: 1. As to enterprise size, it was mostly  large and medium-size state enterprises, focused particularly on  aging enterprises in urgent need of technological upgrading; 2.  As to enterprise qualifications, it included the best, the  intermediate, and the worst, mostly enterprises that better  implemented the "Forces-Conversion Regulations," had leading  bodies of higher quality, and had better economic efficiency,  along with an appropriate selection of a few losing enterprises  in line with state industrial policy; 3. As to industrial  distribution, it was mostly industrial, commercial, and trade  enterprises, with an appropriate selection of enterprises in  other industries, such as transportation, construction, and  high-tech; 4. As to regional distribution, it was mostly  enterprises in regions and cities where market forces had  developed faster and external conditions were better, with an  appropriate selection of enterprises from other regions; 5. As  to form of enterprise organization, it was mainly enterprises  that had not conducted corporate reorganization, along with the  selection of a few enterprises that were already corporations  for standardization.  <H5>  3. The Key Substance of Enterprise Reorganization to </H5> Corporations  <H5>  A. Perfecting the Enterprise Incorporation System </H5>   The pilot enterprises had to first act in accordance with  the  relevant state provisions, by inventorying their assets and  funds, delimiting their property rights, liquidating their  bonded debts, evaluating their assets, verifying their  enterprise corporate assets possession, and checking their  capital funds.    Capital contributors exercise assets ownership, enjoying  legal shareholding rights in line with the percentage of shares  held, such as asset income, and major decisionmaking and  selection management, having limited liability to the enterprise  based on capital contributed. Capital contributors are not  directly involved in specific enterprise operations, being  unable to directly budget corporate assets or withdraw assets or  shares, but able to sell in accordance with law.    Enterprises hold corporate property rights, independently  enjoying civil rights and accepting civil responsibilities for  all corporate assets, with legally independent decisionmaking  power and liability for profits and losses, and charged with the  liability to capital contributors for preserving and multiplying  assets (capital). As independent corporate entities and market  competitors, enterprises no longer have administrative  subsidiary relations with government organs, no longer being  ranked indiscriminately.  <H5>  B. Determining Enterprise's State-Assets Investors </H5>   In line with the principle of separating the government's  socio-economic management function from its state-assets  ownership function, the state-authorized investment organ or  state-authorized department is the state-assets investor,  legally exercizing stock-rights management of state assets in  enterprises. As to enterprises in which it is currently hard to  determine the state-assets investor, the government can  authorize a certain department to act as state-assets investor,  to exercise state stock rights. The organs responsible for  state-assets management in state-authorized investment organs or  state-authorized departments do not perform any government  administrative functions for enterprises in which they hold  shares.  <H5>  C. Setting the Form of Enterprise Corporate Organization </H5>   In line with the principle of graded guidance, enterprises  that produce certain special products or those in designated  industries should be reorganized as wholly state-owned  corporations; most enterprises should be reorganized as limited  liability companies; qualified ones can be reorganized as  limited-liability companies, with only a few to be listed; while  national industrial head offices can be reorganized as state  holding companies, they should not generally operate as one  company to monopolize a whole industry; enterprise groups are  reorganized according to their parent-company systems.    Reorganizing state enterprises into limited-liability  companies in which multiple shareholders hold stocks is the  focus of the corporate reorganization. This can be achieved  through ways, such as converting creditor rights to stock  rights, attracting foreign-investment shareholders, investment  in shareholding among enterprises, and absorbing some  institutional and fund investment into shareholding. Qualified  enterprises can experiment with standardized employee  shareholding.  <H5>  D. Establishing a Scientific and Standardized Corporate </H5> Administrative Structure    Based on the principles of separation but mutual restraint  among the rights, operating, and oversight structures and  capability and efficiency, we have formed a corporate  administrative structure composed of shareholder meetings,  boards of directors, boards of supervisors, and managers,  ensuring clear rights and responsibilities, with each performing  their own functions, to effectively exercise decisionmaking,  oversight, and executive authority.    The shareholder meeting is the company's highest organ of  authority. State-authorized investment organs or departments and  other capital contributors select delegates to take part in  shareholder meetings and exercise authority according to law.    The board of directors is the company's operating-decision  body. Boards of directors are elected by shareholder meetings,  with shareholders recommending candidates, which become members  of boards of directors acccording to legal procedures, to be  liable to all shareholders. The board chairman is the company's  legal representative.    The manager is hired or fired by the board of directors,  with  no direct hiring or firing by government administrative organs  or shareholder meetings. Managers are responsible to boards of  directors, entrusted by company charters and boards of directors  with all responsibility for the company's regular production and  operating management.    The board of supervisors is the company's oversight agency,  responsible to the shareholders convention. Boards of  supervisors are made up of shareholder representatives and a  suitable percentage of company-employee delegates, produced  through democratic elections by company employees. Board,  manager, and financial officers may not serve concurrently on  boards of supervisors.</p>

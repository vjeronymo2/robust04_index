			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> DAMAGE AWARD VOIDED IN BLOOD-TEST CASE  </P> <P> Newport Beach police acted reasonably in allegedly grabbing a drunk-driving  suspect and holding him so a nurse could draw his blood, a federal appeals  court ruled Wednesday in overturning a $15,500 damage award.  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed a federal court  jury's decision that the officers had violated the constitutional rights of  Timothy Hammer during a blood test after his arrest in June, 1985.  </P> <P> "The 'force' used . . . was nothing more than the application of physical  restraint required to conduct the blood extraction in a safe and efficient  manner," Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall held in the 3-0 ruling.  </P> <P> Hammer's lawyer, Stephen Yagman, said the court had usurped the jury's role and  "decided to retry the case."  </P> <P> Hammer was stopped for speeding by Officer Armando Zatarain and failed roadside  sobriety tests, the court said. Hammer refused to take a blood, breath or urine  test to determine his blood-alcohol level. At a Newport Beach hospital, Hammer  said Zatarain grabbed him and handcuffed him to a chair while a nurse swabbed  his arm. When he flinched from the needle, he said that both he and the officer  fell to the floor. He added that Zatarain held him down in the chair while the  blood was taken. Hammer later pleaded no contest to drunk driving.  </P> <P> The officer denied touching Hammer. But a jury found that Hammer's rights had  been violated and awarded $4,000 in compensation, $1,500 in punitive damages  against Zatarain, and $10,000 in punitive damages against Charles Gross, who  was Newport Beach police chief at the time of the incident.  </P> <P> The appeals court ruled that the judge should have thrown the damages out  because Zatarain did not use unreasonable force.  </P></p>

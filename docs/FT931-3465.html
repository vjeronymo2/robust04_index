			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Watching the whirlwind: The battle for a car executive A bizarre tug of war between two of the world's leading automobile groups for the services of an idiosyncratic Spaniard who calls his staff 'warriors' appeared to have ended yesterday in victory for Germany's Volkswagen and defeat for General Motors of the US. GM announced in Detroit yesterday afternoon that 52-year-old Mr J Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, its colourful head of worldwide purchasing, had definitely quit - apparently to take up a contract of employment with Volkswagen - after five days of wavering between the two companies. However, a bemused Mr Jack Smith, GM's chief executive, told a news conference, scheduled to announce that Mr Lopez was staying in Detroit, that 'it is not clear to me what his intentions are, or where he is at the present time.' Volkswagen had spent weeks carefully wooing Mr Lopez, but GM fought a furious last ditch campaign to persuade him to stay, including an offer of promotion to executive vice president of GM and the presidency of its North American automotive operations. But, despite the promotion and entreaties from tearful members of his purchasing team, Mr Lopez decided to leave. Whatever the factors prompting the departure, such an intense battle over a man who just a year ago was unknown outside the automobile manufacturing world illustrates how VW and GM's North American operations share some serious problems in common, notably bloated cost structures. Mr Lopez, who was head of parts purchasing for GM Europe, based in Russelsheim, West Germany, between 1988 and 1992, was a key member of the team which turned GM Europe from losses into one of the world's most profitable vehicle businesses - and a stark contrast to the company's core North American operations, which have lost Dollars 12bn over the past two years. He radically altered GM's relations with its European suppliers and shifted a large quantity of work from high cost German parts companies to cheaper manufacturers in other parts of the region. GM ended up with one of the lowest cost bases of any European assembler. In May last year Mr Smith, a former head of GM Europe, summoned Mr Lopez to Detroit to do the same in North America as part of a belated restructuring which also involves the closure of 21 plants and loss of at least 75,000 jobs over the next few years. Mr Lopez set about the job with gusto. He infuriated some of GM's outside suppliers by insisting that they slash their prices by 20 per cent or more. He initiated a system where hit-squads, so-called Picos teams, went into parts factories inside and outside GM, looking for ways to improve production methods. Critics argued that his cost-cutting demands could have endangered the quality of some GM parts, or discouraged suppliers from carrying out research and development with the company. But Mr Lopez and his supporters pointed out that he had been offering much longer-term contracts to those parts companies which could meet GM's quality, service and price specifications. Whatever the truth, his campaign saved GM hundreds of millions of dollars and his presence in Detroit was one of the most powerful catalysts for change inside the slow-moving, bureaucratic company, sending a powerful signal to employees and suppliers alike that it was deadly serious about its restructuring. With an engaging smile, and in broken but passionate English, he repeatedly warned the American motor industry that western industrial society risked defeat at the hands of the Japanese. 'We must transform the Western ability to create intelligent excuses into positive creativity,' he declared in a speech earlier this month, taking a swipe at suppliers who complained he was making impossible demands of them. His personal idiosyncrasies have added to the impression of fundamental change. For example, one of his first actions on arrival in Detroit was to issue staff with a booklet describing his preferred 'warrior diet,' which eschewed 'poisonous' sugar and potatoes and encouraged the consumption of only fruit for breakfast. However, the Lopez revolution is a long way from completion - he was planning more than 1,000 Picos workshops in suppliers' plants this year, and more than 1,300 in GM ones - and his departure for Volkswagen after only 10 months in the job will almost certainly slow the momentum of the company's reforms. Volkswagen, for its part, is in urgent need of fundamental reform and Mr Ferdinand Piech, chief executive since the beginning of the year, is expected to announce Mr Lopez's appointment as part of a radical upheaval of senior personnel to be disclosed after today's supervisory board meeting. Mr Piech already has two former, but more junior, GM managers on his staff at VW's Audi subsidiary. Mr Erich Schmitt, a one-time member of Mr Lopez's cost-cutting team, was recently appointed director in charge of buying, finance and organisation. Mr Jurgen Gebhardt, Audi's new production director, was poached from Adam Opel, GM's German subsidiary, where he was plant manager at the low-cost showpiece works in Eisenach, eastern Germany. Opel has dented VW's self-esteem by stealing market leadership in the former GDR - even though the VW brand was recognised by more than 60 per cent of former east Germans before reunification, compared to less than 30 per cent for Opel. VW is thought to have made an operating loss of DM1bn in its core VW division last year and is woefully inefficient compared to other European and Japanese volume manufacturing competitors. While its rivals began rationalising more than a year ago, VW is only now taking the hard decisions which will enable the group to weather what Mr Piech last week termed the worst downturn in the German motor industry since 1945. VW needs to drastically reduce its cost structures over the next 12 to 18 months. In part this could be achieved by reducing personnel - hard enough in Germany under any circumstances, even harder at VW, where the supervisory board is (unusually for Germany) dominated by union representatives and where 20 per cent of the shares are owned by state of Lower Saxony, currently governed by a Social Democratic/Green coalition. VW has also begun to realise that it needs to reform its relationship with its suppliers. Audi's Mr Schmitt recently said the group had set the goal of reducing the prices of components purchased from outside suppliers by 25 to 30 per cent over the next four to five years. Mr Lopez could, therefore be the change agent VW needs - although his mercurial, Hamlet-like behaviour over the past five days might make Mr Piech wonder just what kind of one-man whirlwind he is getting.</p>

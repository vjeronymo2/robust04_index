During his visit he met with His  Majesty King Husayn and several senior Jordanian officials.  Details are in the following report:    In a press statement prior to his departure, the Omani  minister said that he was honored to have been received by His  Majesty King Husayn. He added that he relayed an oral message  from His Majesty Sultan Qabus to his majesty the king on issues  of common interest and current Arab issues. He went on to say  that he listened to a detailed explanation from His Majesty King  Husayn on various pan-Arab issues, as well as Jordan's prominent  role in aiding the peace process. The Omani minister continued:  The remarks that I have heard from His Majesty King Husayn  regarding the Jordanian perspective toward the future of this  region, as well his eagerness to promote Arab interests within  the context of peace were heartening. He noted that he met this  morning with Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for  foreign affairs. This was a continuation of the talks I held  with his majesty the king yesterday. Both sides agreed to  identify a mechanism for coordination on various political  issues that concern the two fraternal countries, he said. He  noted that a joint committee has been formed to follow up on all  bilateral trade and economic issues. He hoped that the desire of  His Majesty King Husayn and His Majesty Sultan Qabus to seize  all possible opportunities to promote bilateral ties will be  realized.    In reply to a question on the efforts made by the Sultanate  of Oman to achieve inter-Arab reconciliation, the minister said:  Just like all fraternal Arabs, we look forward to see the Arabs  identify a common ground for inter-Arab action and Arab  solidarity. I believe that the circumstances now are more  opportune for achieving this goal than they were in the past.  He added: We support and back the efforts and endeavors made  by the Arab League secretary general to achieve something along  the road of joint Arab action and Arab solidarity.    When asked about the United Arab Emirates [UAE]-Iran dispute  on the three islands, Bin-'Alawi said: I can say that the  UAE-Iranian dispute has continued to be discussed by the two  countries in the hope of reaching a peaceful settlement. As for  the UAE brothers, they have consistently said that they want to  see this dispute resolved peacefully within the context of  legitimate rights. I believe that Iran is demonstrating a  favorable response in this regard. I hope that future  developments will yield a solution to this dispute.    On the Omani minister's visit, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan,  minister of state for foreign affairs, said that His Majesty  King Husayn has met with the guest minister. The meeting was  cordial and fraternal. The talks focused on issues of common  interest, including fraternal bilateral ties, the peace process,  as well as the ways and means of fostering these issues.    Al-Hasan added: This morning, the talks were resumed. They  focused on the means of promoting and enhancing bilateral  economic and trade ties within the context of the Joint  Jordanian-Omani Committee. We agreed on the need to continue  these consultations and this coordination in the interest of the  Arab nation.    The guest minister was seen off by the minister of state for  foreign affairs, the Foreign Ministry's secretary general, the  Omani ambassador in Amman, and several senior officials.</p>

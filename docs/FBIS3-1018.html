The meeting is being chaired by  President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The Council  of Ministers was briefed on the peace process and political and  military situation. The legal decree establishing the Planning  and Economic Coordination Ministry, as well as the decree that  alters the function and composition of the Council of Ministers  Standing Commission were assessed. Other points discussed were  the decree drafts and the respective salary tables of the  adjustment of salaries of civil servants and parallel entities,  as well as salary adjustment of the personnel from the military  administration organs. Council of Ministers Secretary Carlos  Feijo had this to say at the end of the meeting.    [Begin Feijo recording] A session of the Council of  Ministers  which consisted essentially of three parts has just ended. In  the first part the council assessed the military situation and  the peace process whose negotiations are underway in Lusaka. We  assessed the negotiations. In the second part we assessed a  draft document creating the Ministry of Planning and Economic  Coordination as an organ which will be charged with drafting  medium and long term policies, and will coordinate the  implementation of the socioeconomic plan, and will necessarily  be related to the Finance Ministry and the Central Bank with a  view to considering the plan as an indicative element, and not  as an imperative one, as has been the case in our planning law.  The third part dealt with the approval of the government's  program in which it is stipulated that in March there would be  salary increases, and this is what was done. The salary  adjustment of the civil servants and personnel from the military  administration organs, as well as internal order was approved.  [end recording]</p>

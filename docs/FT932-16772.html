			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bigger bills for some but most will pay less - The Council Tax / Scheherazade Daneshkhu explains the ins and outs of the new levy THE UNPOPULAR community charge, or poll tax, was replaced by the new council tax this week and millions of people should now know how much they will have to pay for the year. The council tax is based on property values, unlike the community charge which was people-based. Most households will pay less under the council tax: the average bill will be down by just over 6 per cent in England and Scotland and 0.5 per cent in Wales, according to a survey by Public Finance and Accountancy, the journal of the Institute of Public Finance. But some will pay more, especially those with homes at the higher end of the market. The survey showed the average bill for a dwelling in the south-east has risen by 3 per cent while those in greater London go up by 17 per cent. The transitional reduction scheme In some areas of London, household bills will have increased from Pounds 300 under the poll tax to Pounds 1,200. For those hit hardest, the government has made Pounds 340m available through a transitional reduction scheme (TRS). This is applied automatically to those eligible and will be deducted from their total bill. For those who have to pay more tax, the increase will be limited to a maximum depending on their valuation band. The maximums vary from Pounds 91 a year for homes in band A to Pounds 182 for those in band H in England and Scotland, although the bands differ in each country. The TRS was felt not to be needed in Wales. The amount of the 'initial increase' determines homeowners' eligibility for the scheme. The initial increase is the difference between the poll tax for 1992/93, based on the number of people in the house at the end of March 1993, and the council tax for the property after taking into account any reductions for either tax. The relief given will be the amount by which the initial increase for the property exceeds the maximum amount for its valuation band. Take a couple who paid Pounds 200 each in poll tax and are in band E for the new council tax. They find that their council tax bill is Pounds 600, so the 'initial increase' is Pounds 200 (the new Pounds 600 charge minus the Pounds 400 paid in poll tax). But the maximum amount of increase set for band E is Pounds 143 a year. The transitional reduction will, therefore, be Pounds 57: the difference between the 'initial increase' (Pounds 200) and the maximum increase for the band (Pounds 143). This amount is deducted from the council tax so that the couple's council tax bill for the year will be Pounds 543 instead of Pounds 600. The situation is complicated because the figure which the government assumes for the council tax is based on its estimate of how much the local authority needs to raise - and also assumes a 98 per cent collection rate. If your local authority has decided it needs to raise more than the government estimate, or expects its collection rate to be lower than 98 per cent, your actual council tax bill could be higher than the figure used by the government on which to base transitional relief. Take the previous example again, but assume the couple's council tax bill is Pounds 630. If the Pounds 30 difference is due to the local authority assuming a different collection rate from the government, or is due to what the government regards as excessive spending, transitional reduction will be based on Pounds 630 minus Pounds 30. So, the couple would end up paying Pounds 573. in council tax. If you think your transitional reduction has been calculated wrongly, you should write first to your local authority, which will send you details of how the calculation was made. If you remain unhappy and wish to appeal, write again to the council and, if you disagree with the outcome, to its local review board. The government says the TRS will last at least two years and that arrangements for the financial year after that will be announced in due course. Valuation band Another group of people who may be unhappy with the council tax are those who disagree with their valuation band. The value of homes is based on what the property would have fetched on April 1 1991 but, at the same time, the government says the figures should not be regarded as precise. Colin Farrington, director of the Institute of Revenue, Rating and Valuation, says: 'The idea was to establish relative values for property based on a rough and ready evaluation for distributing the tax. People should feel they are paying a relatively fair burden of tax compared to other people. It was assumed that the council tax would be introduced at a time of rising house prices and that people would regard the bandings as academic. 'But house prices have not followed their usual cycle. Now, some people who are in a low band fear this means they will not be able to sell their house for the amount they paid for it, while others think their property has been over-valued.' The government has said it will not regard the fall in the property market as a ground for appeal against the valuation banding. But if your property obviously has been put in a wrong band, you have until November 1 to appeal by writing to the listing officer at the local office of the Valuation Office Agency. If your appeal is about discounts and personal liability, write to your local council. You can then appeal to a valuation tribunal if you disagree with the outcome. There are a number of free pamphlets on the council tax. These include: Valuation and Banding; How to Appeal; Liability, Discounts and Exemptions; the Transitional Reduction Scheme; and a Guide to the New Tax for Local Government. These are available from Council Tax Publicity Material, PO Box 506, London SE99 7UY. Pamphlets on the council tax in Scotland can be obtained from Citizens Advice Bureaux and regional or island councils.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TRANSITIONAL REDUCTION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Band          England                 Scotland           Maximum amount                                                             per year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A       up to pounds40,000      up to pounds27,000          pounds91 B         pounds40-52,000         pounds27-35,000          pounds104 C         pounds52-68,000         pounds35-45,000          pounds117 D         pounds68-88,000         pounds45-58,000          pounds130 E        pounds88-120,000         pounds58-80,000          pounds143 F        pounds120-160,000       pounds80-106,000          pounds156 G        pounds160-320,000      pounds106-212,000          pounds169 H       over pounds320,000     over pounds212,000          pounds182  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Department of the Environment  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

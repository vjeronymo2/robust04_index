In a telephone conversation with AL-DUSTUR, Dr.  al-Mu'ashshir  explained that U.S. President Bill Clinton had promised His  Majesty King Husayn to seriously study the possibility of  reducing Jordan's debts to the United States and that this issue  would be followed up through various key channels.    Dr. al-Mu'ashshir said that this is one way to indirectly  help Jordan, especially since the U.S. foreign aid is being  reconsidered and even reduced, and this would therefore be the  best way to help Jordan.    He added that the U.S. Administration has welcomed the idea  of replacing sea searches by an international on-land inspection  of the goods bound for Jordan through the Gulf of Aqaba. He  noted that sea searches increase freight charges and reduce  cargo sizes because of the need to leave space inside ships to  carry out inspections.    Dr. al-Mu'ashshir explained that UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali has shown clear interest in the proposals made by  Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-al-Salam al-Majali when they met last  week. Those proposals call for easing Jordan's burdens resulting  from the blockade imposed on the Port of al-'Aqabah,  facilitating the processing of Jordan's [import] applications  and treating them like those of other countries harmed by the  blockade imposed on Iraq, and reducing the excessive  bureaucratic measures imposed on Jordan.    He said that the response of the British Lloyds Company to  the proposal for on-land inspections rather than sea searches  has encouraged the U.S. Administration to accept such a  compromise in order to ease Jordan's burdens resulting from the  blockade on the Port of al-'Aqabah. He said this response has  left a good and satisfactory impression among Americans.    Dr. al-Mu'ashshir stressed Jordan's concern for unanimous  Arab decisions, especially over the lifting of the Arab boycott  of Israel. He said the boycott issue depends on the Arab  League, which has the final say in this regard. He said,  however, that the secondary and third degree boycott can be  studied and ways can be worked out to deal with this matter.</p>

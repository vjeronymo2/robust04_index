			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDING CUTS THREATEN AGENCIES THAT TEACH ENGLISH TO IMMIGRANTS  </P> <P> Several community agencies that offer English classes to federal amnesty  applicants have begun laying off teachers and some say they may be forced to  close their doors altogether because of recently announced funding cutbacks by  the state Department of Education.  </P> <P> Many community organizations and public schools across the state involved in  the program began receiving notices two weeks ago announcing cutbacks in  previously approved funding, state education officials said Monday. The  officials blamed the cutbacks on insufficient funding from the governor's  office.  </P> <P> Linda Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of  Los Angeles, said the notices have created havoc in the program, aimed at  helping immigrants learn enough English and civics to qualify for the second  phase of the federal amnesty program.  </P> <P> "It's anarchy out there," said Mitchell, referring to the state's handling of  the amnesty education program. "Our fear is that applicants will get  discouraged and just give up."  </P> <P> Juan Gutierrez, director of One-Stop Immigration in East Los Angeles, which has  about 6,000 immigrants enrolled in its English classes, said that "a lot of  agencies are getting ready to close down because they have not received the  money they were promised."  </P> <P> The community agencies have been caught in the middle of a political standoff  between State Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig and Gov. George Deukmejian  over the release of an additional $50 million for the amnesty education  program, according to various service providers.  </P> <P> The Deukmejian Administration argues that the education department is  overspending by paying for more than the minimum 40 hours of classroom  instruction required of amnesty applicants by the federal Immigration and  Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> Honig, on the other hand, maintains that the governor scrimped on the education  program when he allocated only $354 million for it out of the state's  $1.8-billion share of federal funds for immigration programs. And state  education officials also blame the funding shortfall on a higher than  anticipated demand for the classes.  </P> <P> But Mitchell and other community group representatives argue that the  department shares some of the blame. Mitchell charged that the department has  mismanaged the program from the start, "changing formulas for reimbursement  mid-stream, not offering solid contracts with community agencies or statewide  coordination to make sure enough classes are offered throughout the state."  </P> <P> She added that the immigrants rights coalition plans to ask Honig to rescind  the letters sent out over the past two weeks. The group also plans to ask the  department for "a full accounting" of the money spent by various community  groups and the number of students they are serving. She said that such  accounting has been lacking and has led to inconsistencies in funding.  </P> <P> Gutierrez said that even if more money is released by the state, community  agencies may not be willing to continue their programs next year, the third in  the five-year education program.  </P> <P> "People have become skeptical of Department of Education promises," he said.  His organization, for instance, was notified that it would receive only  $900,000 of the original $2.5 million it was promised, he said.  </P> <P> The state has also been slow in paying the organizations, he said. His  organization has had to borrow money to keep its program in operation, and it  started notifying its teachers this week that they may have to wait until the  state reimbursement comes through to get paid, he said.  </P> <P> "And we're doing better than most agencies," he added.  </P> <P> The Labor Immigrant Assistance Program, sponsored by the AFL-CIO labor union,  began cutting back on teachers and doubling up its classes last week, said  program director Teresa Sanchez. She expressed concern that some students may  drop out as schedules are changed to consolidate the classes.  </P></p>

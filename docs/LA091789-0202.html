			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SRI LANKA GUNMEN MASSACRE 82 CIVILIANS IN VILLAGE RAMPAGES  </P> <P> Gunmen rampaged through three villages in central Sri Lanka, burning and  shooting to death at least 82 Sinhalese civilians in repeated night raids,  residents and military officials said Saturday.  </P> <P> An army officer said the killers are believed to be pro-government vigilantes  seeking vengeance for the deaths of 15 soldiers' relatives killed by radicals  of the Sinhalese People's Liberation Front. The gunmen wore military-style  uniforms, he said.  </P> <P> They started the massacre Thursday in Menikhinna village, about 55 miles  northeast of Colombo, the capital, according to military officials who spoke on  condition of anonymity. At least 50 houses in the village were torched Thursday  and Friday night, said the officials.  </P> <P> Searchers had found 52 bodies there as of Saturday, some with gunshot wounds  and others burned, they said.  </P> <P> The raiders also attacked neighboring Kundasala and Aranagala villages and  killed 30 people, they said.  </P> <P> The villagers were unarmed, according to the officials.  </P> <P> Residents in Kandy, a few miles from Menikhinna, said at least 100 bodies have  been found in the three villages, and at least 50 more people may have been  killed and their bodies thrown into a nearby river.  </P> <P> Menikhinna is believed to be a stronghold of the People's Liberation Front, an  ultranationalist guerrilla group trying to overthrow the government.  </P> <P> By official count, at least 5,000 people have died in the two-year-old  Sinhalese revolt. The radicals began fighting to protest government concessions  to minority Tamils fighting another war for an independent homeland in  northeastern Sri Lanka. Sinhalese radicals also resent the deployment of Indian  peacekeeping soldiers supervising a peace accord with the Tamils.  </P> <P> Tamils make up 18% of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and charge they are  discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the government and  military.  </P></p>

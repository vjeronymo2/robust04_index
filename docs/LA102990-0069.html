			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON MEDICINE;  </P> <P> NO 'HAPPY BIRTHDAYS' FOR MEDICARE AT 25  </P> <P> Washington's grueling budget strife allows little time for ceremonial  observations, especially when the celebrant is the focus of some of the  capital's nastiest money battles. But it should not go unnoted that this year  is the silver anniversary of Medicare, a benevolently intended assist for the  elderly that has become a runaway monster in politics and medical economics. No  one is singing "Happy Birthday."  </P> <P> The trouble with Medicare is that it is primarily a tax-supported system in a  free-enterprise health-care market. And the market has demonstrated boundless  ingenuity in selling services, necessary and otherwise, despite a great array  of restraints on hospital and doctor bills.  </P> <P> In 1980, Medicare cost $35 billion. Last year, it was $107 billion. The  estimate for 1995 is $180 billion, but past estimates have often been overrun.  The producers of new medical technologies are endlessly inventive. The Medicare  population, now 30 million over 65, plus 3.5 million disabled, keeps growing,  as do the medical expectations of the American people. It's a rare year in  which Medicare spending does not substantially outpace the inflation rate.  </P> <P> Every attempt to restrain spending or to raise cost-sharing by the elderly  provokes threats of political retribution that few officeholders are willing to  face. Congress turned and ran last year when Medicare recipients rose up in a  fit of irrational pique against a generous catastrophic-care measure that  required cost-sharing by upper-income beneficiaries. The provision was  canceled, leaving the elderly to savor a spectacular political victory, and  back where they were with limited coverage for costly illnesses.  </P> <P> Exasperation with Medicare politics is strong on Capitol Hill, though few  legislators show it openly. The latest episode, however, brought a public  outburst from Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader. Noting that the  higher Medicare fees in the rejected legislation were keyed to income, Dole  exclaimed: "Somebody mentions the word Medicare, it is like crying 'Fire!' in a  crowded theater, and we did not do anything in Medicare that touched poor  people. Why should the taxpayer pay the Medicare premiums of millionaires in  America?"  </P> <P> The paradox of Medicare is that it is both expensive and inadequate. It pays  only about half the health-care costs of the elderly, leaving the balance to  their own resources or various skimpy public assistance programs. Though  Medicare has the appearance of a mini-national health insurance program for the  elderly and disabled, it merely helps with rather than covers health-care  costs.  </P> <P> Various new measures are in the works to hold down Medicare spending, including  annual caps on hospital expenditures and a revision of doctors' fees that will  favor primary and preventive care. But the basic problem with Medicare is that  it is embedded in the American health-care system, and that system tends to be  extravagant when it sniffs the possibility of reimbursement. In response to  Medicare's money-saving moves, the health industry has proven itself to be  endlessly ingenious in providing services that it insists are essential for the  well-being of patients.  </P> <P> One example is in treatment for fatal kidney disease, which is reimbursed under  Medicare. A recent report by the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes  legislation for Medicare, notes that the number of patients has for no apparent  reason risen far above the number forecast. An unexpected part of the growth is  in patients over 75 years of age, which the report says "reflects a shift in  physician practice patterns." It adds that in the past, such patients would not  have been accepted for treatment. The reason for accepting them now is not  medically clear, the committee suggested, leaving the implication that perhaps  economic factors are at work.  </P> <P> When the political dust settles from the latest budget battles, bruises will be  visible on many federal programs. Medicare will at worst show a few scratches.  At age 25, it is an entrenched power on the American political landscape, and  sure to become even more powerful through demographics and legislative  timidity.  </P> <P> Washington isn't singing "Happy Birthday."  </P></p>

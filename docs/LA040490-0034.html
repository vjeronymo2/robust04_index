			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SUPERVISORS REJECT AMMUNITION SALE CURB  </P> <P> A proposed ban on the sale of ammunition in unincorporated territory the week  before New Year's Eve and July 4 was rejected Tuesday by a 3-2 vote of the Los  Angeles County Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> The ordinance was proposed by Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and supported by Police  Chief Daryl F. Gates and Sheriff Sherman Block in an effort to deter holiday  revelers from firing guns into the air.  </P> <P> But the board's three-man conservative majority opposed the measure, claiming  that it would be difficult to enforce. Hahn's liberal colleague Ed Edelman  supported the ordinance. A similar ordinance is under consideration by the Los  Angeles City Council.  </P></p>

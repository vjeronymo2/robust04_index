			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LURID CONFESSIONS  </P> <P> One fine morning they move in for the pinch  </P> <P> &amp; snap on the cuffs -- just like that.  </P> <P> Turns out they've known all about you for years,  </P> <P> have a file the length of a paddy-wagon  </P> <P> with everything -- tapes, prints, film . . .  </P> <P> the whole shmear.  </P> <P> Don't ask me how but  </P> <P> they've managed to plug a mike into one of your molars  </P> <P> and know every felonious move &amp; transgression  </P> <P> back to the very beginning, with ektachromes  </P> <P> of your least indiscretion &amp; peccadillo.  </P> <P> Needless to say, you are thrilled,  </P> <P> tho sitting there in the docket  </P> <P> you bogart it, tough as an old tooth --  </P> <P> your jaw set, your sleeves rolled  </P> <P> &amp; three days of stubble. . . . Only,  </P> <P> when they play it back it looks different:  </P> <P> a life common &amp; loathsome as gum stuck to a chair.  </P> <P> Tedious hours of you picking your nose,  </P> <P> scratching, eating, clipping your toenails. . .  </P> <P> Alone, you look stupid; in public, your rapier  </P> <P> wit is slimy &amp; limp as an old bandaid.  </P> <P> They have thousands of pictures of people around you  </P> <P> stifling yawns. As for sex -- a bit  </P> <P> of pathetic groping among the unlovely &amp; luckless:  </P> <P> a dance with everyone making steamy love in the dark  </P> <P> &amp; you alone in a corner eating a pretzel.  </P> <P> You leap to your feet protesting  </P> <P> that's not how it was, they have it all wrong.  </P> <P> But nobody hears you. The bailiff  </P> <P> is snoring, the judge is cleaning his teeth,  </P> <P> the jurors are all wearing glasses with eyes painted open.  </P> <P> The flies have folded their wings and stopped buzzing.  </P> <P> In the end, after huge doses of coffee,  </P> <P> the jury is polled. One after another  </P> <P> they manage to rise to their feet  </P> <P> like narcoleptics in August, sealing your fate:  </P> <P> Innocent. . .innocent. . .innocent. . . . Right down the line.  </P> <P> You are carried out screaming.  </P></p>

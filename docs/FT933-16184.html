			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on Tokyo AFTER last week's bout of European rate cuts, the markets will shift their focus to Tokyo, where the leaders of the seven largest industrialised nations meet to discuss Gatt and the prospects for boosting world growth, writes Rachel Johnson. Currency co-operation, however, is to be off the agenda, as the G7 has committed itself to seek - yet again at its annual economic summit - to salvage the seven-year attempt to reach a breakthrough in world trade talks. While a Gatt agreement would clearly be the best boost to world growth and employment to which the leaders could aspire, hopes for an agreement have faded, along with the political popularity of the main players in the UK, France, Germany and the US. In addition to the recessionary conditions in the G7 countries, the political vacuum in Japan is also regarded as an obstacle to a summit success. Attention will still be paid to the week's regular economic figures. In the UK, an inquest on the economy will be opened today, as the Treasury's independent forecasters release their second report; and the credit business data are set to show a slight slowdown in the rate of bank lending, in spite of a rise in the annual growth rate of both M0 and M4 in May and June. Elsewhere, the Bundesbank's activities will provide a focus for speculation about how much which other European Exchange Rate Mechanism countries can cut their rates even when Germany holds back. Last Friday, France cut its intervention rate by 0.25 of a point to 6.75 per cent; traders figure that since the Bundesbank cut by  1/2 point to 6.75 per cent, France could manage another  1/4 point reduction. Hopes for an early cut in UK interest rates, however, remain elusive.</p>

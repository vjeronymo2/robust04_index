			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Tiphook loses 57p as 23% rise fails to impress SHARES in Tiphook, the freight container and trailer leasing group, fell 57p to 330p yesterday, despite a proposed 25 per cent dividend increase, after the results were below market expectations. Pre-tax profits increased 23 per cent to Pounds 86.4m (Pounds 70.4m) in the year to April 30. Analysts had expected nearer to Pounds 100m and cut forecasts for this year by about Pounds 10m to Pounds 95m. Mr Robert Montague, executive chairman, said the company weathered recession in the UK and other large markets well. Turnover increased 6.4 per cent to Pounds 322.4m, helped by a larger fleet and 11 per cent rental rate increases for trailers. Containers lifted profits before exceptionals to Pounds 85.3m (Pounds 70.9m). The container fleet, the second largest in the world, saw utilisation rates hold steady at 88 per cent. The fleet was expanded 18 per cent to 510,000 twenty foot equivalent units. The trailer division reported unchanged profits before exceptionals of Pounds 5.7m, despite a 6 per cent increase in turnover. There was a Pounds 2m charge against operating profits for rationalising the company's European network. Tiphook's rail wagon division turned from a Pounds 500,000 loss to a Pounds 200,000 profit, although utilisation remained under 70 per cent. There were exceptional costs of Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 5.7m) on disposals and expenses for listing the shares in New York and Hong Kong. Last year's extraordinary items were restated as exceptionals resulting in a re-adjustment of last year's pre-tax profits from Pounds 76.1m to Pounds 70.4m. Interest costs fell to Pounds 41.3m (Pounds 57.3m). Last year's Pounds 150m preference share issue, used to pay off borrowings, led to a preference dividend payment of Pounds 12.3m. Capital expenditure increased to Pounds 226.6m (Pounds 198.6m) with net borrowings rising to Pounds 832m (Pounds 735m). Depreciation increased 17.9 per cent to Pounds 64.6m. Debt to equity stood at 2.8 times (2.9), reflecting an increase in shareholders funds to Pounds 296m (Pounds 251m). Mr Rodger Braidwood, group finance director, said capital expenditure this year would fall to Pounds 80m and net borrowings would be reduced for the first time in the company's history. The tax charge doubled to Pounds 10.6m, due to increased advance corporation tax. Tiphook pays no corporation tax due to capital allowances. Earnings per share fell to 57.1p (59.9p). A final dividend of 12.9p is proposed, raising the total to 17.3p (13.8p). See Lex</p>

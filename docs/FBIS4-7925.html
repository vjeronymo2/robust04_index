			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 6 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today  voted to reject two proposals concerning the administrative  redivision of the country, calling them "simply unacceptable."    At a press conference after the government session, Prime  Minister Vaclav Klaus said the government had rejected a  constitutional bill submitted by the Czech-Moravian Centrist  Party (CMSS) "for being an attempt to split the Czech Republic  into two parts," a Czech and a Moravian-Silesian part. The  capital, Prague, would constitute its own division.    "The government already rejected this idea in its statement  of principles last October," Klaus said, adding that the bill  conflicted with the government's already prepared bill.    The second bill, a law on the budget and economic management  of higher local administrative units, represented an "isolated,  unsystematic approach in which the law on the economic  management of these units would be passed before the units and  their competence were defined," Klaus said.</p>

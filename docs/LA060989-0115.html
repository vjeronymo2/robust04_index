			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMAN POLICE DETAIN 120 PROTESTERS  </P> <P> Security police detained about 120 people as they left a Protestant church  after protesting the results of East Germany's local elections, church  officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Uniformed and plainclothes officers dragged the civil rights activists to three  waiting buses and drove them away Wednesday night, the church aides and  witnesses said.  </P> <P> Police told church leaders those detained will be freed once their names have  been taken but it was not immediately clear whether this had happened.  </P> <P> About 300 civil rights activists attended the protest meeting in East Berlin's  Sophia Church, where they alleged there had been widespread fraud during last  month's elections.  </P> <P> According to official results, only 1.15% of the electorate voted against  Communist Party-approved candidates in the May 7 elections. Activists say the  figure was much higher.  </P></p>

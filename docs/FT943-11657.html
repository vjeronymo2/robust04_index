			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: 'Unacceptable' terms for entering Gatt anger China China said yesterday it was prepared to continue negotiations on terms of entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but made clear that certain demands, especially by the US, were 'unacceptable'. Speaking to an informal session of the Gatt working party on Chinese membership, Mr Long Yongtu, Beijing's chief Gatt negotiator, said progress since the last meeting a month ago had been 'disappointing'. Nevertheless, China would continue to participate in negotiations on its accession protocol 'with a flexible and constructive attitude'. Perhaps significantly, Mr Long did not mention China's aspiration to become a Gatt member this year so as to join its successor, the World Trade Organisation, as a founding member. This timetable is looking increasingly ambitious but not yet impossible. Mr Long's remarks represent a considerable softening of tone from the angry blasts out of Beijing in recent days. Chinese officials have accused the US of blocking its membership bid and have threatened to call off the eight-year talks if Washington does not back down from demanding China join Gatt as a developed country. China this week circulated a paper outlining what it considered should be in the accession protocol, a move which western trade diplomats took as a clear sign of Beijing's continued readiness to negotiate. However, they said there was a very wide gap between China's 'minimalist' version and the 'maximalist' terms included in a paper compiled by Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, the Swiss chairman of the working party. In the most detailed statement of Beijing's position so far, Mr Long said China was prepared to take on its full obligations as a member of Gatt and the WTO. It was not seeking special privileges but insisted on its entitlement to full membership rights, including those accorded to developing country members. Presenting a 10-point list of 'non-negotiable' demands in the Girard paper, Mr Long said Gatt members were trying to prevent China having recourse to Gatt's balance of payments provisions and dispute settlement procedures. And he warned that denial of developing country status in agriculture could trigger 'social unrest' among China's 800m farmers.</p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Sparks with a tough at the top - Paul Gallagher, new EETPU general secretary WHEN Mr Frank Chapple left the general secretary's job at the EETPU electricians' union after a controversial tenure, he predicted that his successor would carry on the tradition. 'If you think I'm rightwing, wait until you see Eric Hammond.' Eight years later Mr Hammond says the same about Mr Paul Gallagher, who takes over from him next week. The view is expressed only half-seriously, with the broad grin that accompanies many of Mr Hammond's pronouncements. Political differences between right and left in unions have become less pronounced since the Labour party's move to the political centre. Nonetheless many believe the type of trade unionism symbolised by the EETPU remains a threat to traditional union values. Mr Gallagher's stewardship of the union will have effects far wider than the 360,000 EETPU members. The union and the AEU engineers will today announce the outcome of a merger ballot. If the result is positive they will unite to form Britain's second-largest union, with 1m members. Mr Gallagher, 47, will be in a strong position to become general secretary after the new union draws up a constitution. In any event, he will have a strong influence on employees' relations with their employers and on whether trade unions can present a more united front than in recent years. The EETPU was expelled from the Trades Union Congress in 1988 after a series of rows culminating in its refusal to accept a congress instruction to withdraw from two single-union deals. If there is a 'yes' vote today, the AEU-EETPU will talk with the TUC about affiliation. What kind of man will the TUC - and the employers he will deal with  - find? The son of a dustcart driver and a home help, Mr Gallagher left school at 15 and qualified as an electrician four years later. In the meantime he joined and left the Communist party. That had a significant effect and he became a firm opponent of the political creed he once believed in. 'When I first joined the EETPU I would sort of stand up in the branch and advocate we hang Frank Chapple and fight for Utopia. And then I learnt some sense. I became alarmed at the way I perceived the trade union movement being used by leftwing and Communist elements and decided that communism would be bad for the UK.' In the EETPU Mr Gallagher found the right home. Following ballot-rigging scandals in the late 1950s it had banned Communists from holding posts and was firmly in the control of the right. Mr Gallagher had carte blanche to harry his political opponents. In a typical example, at a TUC conference in 1983 he accused Mr Arthur Scargill of being a 'boot-licker' and 'contemptible' after the miners' leader made a trip to Moscow. Mr Gallagher's abusive verbal style, as much as his politics, has earned him the suspicion, and sometimes contempt, of opponents, some of whom believe it to be the product of shyness. He is a constant smoker and sometimes appears nervous. One union general secretary says: 'He is a thug. He bawls and he shouts. He is liable to blow up at any time. Someone has told him that it is clever to be nasty.' Supporters say his abrasive exterior belies his compassion. A colleague says: 'When you gain his confidence he backs you to the hilt. He worries about the welfare of people he works with and that helps explain why he has built up a loyal feeling within the EETPU. But whereas Eric Hammond is laconic and controlled, Paul can sometimes speak without thinking first and his sarcasm can be quite hurtful.' The verbal pugilism stems in part from his background in the union. His rise in the EETPU began when at 22 he became an officer in the Manchester branch, dealing with electrical contracting. Mr Ian Brown, a former colleague who left the union after its expulsion from the TUC, says: 'Contracting is a rough, tough environment. Work in contracting is often casual and that leads to casual attitudes. You do not get any respect unless you operate like Gallagher. He is no different from many other people in the industry.' He is well respected in the industry. Mr Harry Simpson, director of the Electrical Contractors Association, says Mr Gallagher represents members well. 'The EETPU are most effective bargainers and Paul Gallagher is in that mould. They do their homework and they can quite often win a better deal than would other, less well-trained and well-prepared unions.' Mr Simpson praises Mr Gallagher for his role, as president of the union since 1986, in setting up three ECA-EETPU joint companies to provide temporary labour for the industry, and pensions and training for workers. It is this type of partnership with employers that has earned the distrust of other unions. In party terms Mr Gallagher is not far removed from many other trade unionists. 'I find myself on most counts now sitting very comfortably with the policies of the Labour party,' he says. What irked the left most about the EETPU in the 1980s was its challenge to traditional ideas of what a union should do. Some found its flaunting of offers of financial and other services to members to be a distraction from the main business of a union. Most were alarmed when it accepted government money for leadership elections. Only the AEU opposed its expulsion from the TUC. The differences are less stark now. Other unions have moved towards the EETPU way of thinking on service provision. Most take part in 'beauty contests' for single-union deals. The main difference is in the leadership. In the controversies of the 1980s the EETPU was led by a supremely confident man. Mr Hammond revelled in the intellectual challenge of taking on his opponents. Mr Gallagher, sharp-witted but not an original thinker, would be less comfortable if faced with the kind of animosity directed at Mr Hammond. Most colleagues believe he wants to find a way back into the trade union mainstream. One colleague says: 'He is much more a man of the movement than Eric.' Mr John Aitkin, leader of the Electrical Plumbing and Industries Union, an EETPU breakaway, is sceptical. 'The view is that Gallagher will be more pliable than Hammond. But then they said that about Hammond when he took over from Chapple, and look what happened with him.'</p>

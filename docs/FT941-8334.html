			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Kozyrev warns east Europe about Nato While Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy prime minister and Moscow's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, brokers agreements in Sarajevo, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, travels around eastern Europe. Fresh from long talks with Greek officials, who continue to prevent oil deliveries reaching neighbouring Macedonia, Mr Kozyrev yesterday met Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, travels to Budapest today, and arrives in Warsaw tomorrow. The agenda is clear. The Russians want to explain Moscow's role in Bosnia-Hercegovina. But they also want to tell Prague, Budapest and Warsaw that Nato's Partnership for Peace could be jeopardised if Nato launches air strikes on Sarajevo. The Partnership for Peace envisages closer military co-operation, but no eventual membership or any kind of security guarantee for the countries of eastern Europe Against this background of growing Russian involvement in the Bosnian crisis, military strategists believe that if the US does not play a role in reaching a negotiated political settlement, a new balance of power will emerge in Europe with Russia playing a more dominant role at the expense of the east Europeans. Czech President Vaclav Havel has repeatedly said the Bosnian war has exposed Europe's inability to deal with the post-cold war era: the western response may encourage future nationalists and populists in eastern Europe capable of exploiting divisions among European capitals. 'Kozyrev will be told what the Czechs think,' a senior military strategist said. 'Mr Klaus, who has no illusions about the European Union, will tell Moscow that Prague will deal with Russia, but on its own terms.' In Budapest, diplomats are very disappointed with Nato's stance on Bosnia. 'We allowed them to fly Awacs over our territory. Then they simply gave the impression they expected us to allow them to fly Awacs over Hungary for the air strikes without any kind of proper consultation. We refused,' a Hungarian diplomat said. 'Yet when we ask for a decent Partnership for Peace, the door is only half opened.' Moscow may be grateful for Hungary's refusal. But Budapest had its own motives: the fate of the 450,000-strong ethnic Hungarian minority in Serbia. 'We would be pleased if Kozyrev could exert pressure on Serbia to recognise the rights of the minority and ensure their safety,' the diplomat said. 'But it should be the west which should shore up our democratic structures, while Russia would probably want something in return if it helped us.' That might involve Hungary's easing sanctions on Serbia, which Budapest would be loath to concede. Mr Kozyrev's trip to Warsaw will be even more delicate. The Poles have not forgotten how President Boris Yeltsin last year said he opposed Poland asking for Nato membership. 'Sometimes you think that Moscow does not realise that we are an independent sovereign country,' a Polish Foreign Ministry official said then. Yet the Russian leadership, with Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, head of the far-right Russian Liberal Democratic party, in the background, realise that the longer the west fails to live up to its promises and commitments for the countries of eastern Europe, the greater the chance for feeding anti-western sentiments within eastern Europe itself. 'We are extremely fortunate eastern Europe is stable, little thanks to us,' a UK military expert said. 'The Bosnian crisis has shown eastern Europe the weaknesses of western governments. They worry that if Washington does not pull its weight in Bosnia, Russia could fill that vacuum, return to haunt eastern Europe, and even turn the region into a cordon sanitaire. Remember, Russia still has an imperial itch.'</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CHEATING' DRUG DEALER GETS LIGHTER SENTENCE  </P> <P> A convicted cocaine dealer apparently cheated undercover police officers in a  drug deal, and ended up with a lighter prison sentence.  </P> <P> Ramon Leon of Grand Rapids would have faced a mandatory 20 years in prison if  he had sold eight ounces of cocaine to the policemen. But the officers later  discovered they had bought only 7.8 ounces. Leon, 28, was sentenced Thursday to  13 to 20 years in prison.  </P> <P> "He shorted us," Kent County Assistant Prosecutor Ellwyn Bloemers said. "That's  not unusual to have that happen to us. When we buy two ounces, it should be 56  grams, but we come back with 49 frequently. He's very slick; he's very  polished."  </P></p>

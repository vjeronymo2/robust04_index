			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Billy Paddock] </F>   [Text] A confidential Freedom Alliance strategy document  proposes that in the event of the alliance boycotting the  elections, it should prepare immediately for secession and  create conditions making free and fair elections impossible.  However, this should be kept secret for as long as possible to  force acceptance of the alliance's constitutional proposals and  motivate foreign financial support.    The document was drawn up at a meeting of the alliance's  executive committee in Richards Bay on January 10. Alliance  Chairman Rowan Cronje confirmed the document was authentic, but  said it contained only scenarios which had never been adopted by  alliance leaders. The January 10 meeting was called  specifically to discuss the formation of an electoral alliance,  as opposed to a mere negotiating alliance. It was decided  against because "the differences in member organisations'  policies are too great."    The executive considered three options -- participation,  non-  participation and doing nothing. The third option was shelved.  The participation option was split into suboption: winning the  election; preventing the ANC [African National Congress] getting  a two-thirds majority; and "disrupting the election". All were  possible, whether the interim constitution remained in place or  was amended to suit the alliance.    The second option was to "abstain from participation in the  election and secede from the RSA [Republic of South Africa] or  create conditions under which it would be impossible to have a  free and fair election."    It concluded that if members participated in the election  individually, rather than as an alliance, "no member would  obtain sufficient votes (20 percent) to elect a deputy president  or to have a position of power through the number of members  elected to the Cabinet, constitutional assembly and other organs  of government at regional and/or national level".    Support from the Press and international community would be  limited; and the alliance's supporters would either vote for the  NP [National Party], to prevent the ANC getting a two-thirds  majority, or for the ANC, to be on the winning side. It also  warned that participation implied the alliance would have to  "accept the results of the election and give credibility to the  multiparty process."    The option of participating with the aim of disrupting the  election would depend on the legal implications. However, it  would also have "more freedom of movement for actions aimed at  resistance. (This option does require further investigation."    The document states that should the alliance not  participate,  but take the option of disruption, "the full power of the  government, the ANC and the TEC will be directed against it".  The situation regarding the security forces and their attitude  to the alliance could also influence the decision.    Secession becomes an option only if the country becomes  ungovernable and the alliance will have to secure its own  position in a situation similar to Angola and Mozambique, the  document says. Alternatively it is an option if the alliance  becomes a force feared by government and the ANC, who believe it  cannot be subjugated by military force. This would make a  peaceful secession possible.    Factors against an electoral alliance which could contain  the  ANC majority, or even win the election, included the "political  cost for the Inkatha Freedom Party of being associated with the  Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front], the CP  [Conservative Party] and the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement]" and Bophuthatswanan independence would have to be  sacrificed.</p>

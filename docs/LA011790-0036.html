			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $1 MILLION IN SEIZED DRUG ASSETS GIVEN TO  SCHOOLS  </P> <P> A $1-million check derived from assets seized from drug dealers was presented  Tuesday by Assemblyman Richard Katz to school officials to fund 14 elementary  and junior high school gang and drug intervention programs.  </P> <P> The pilot programs will be financed by the state Gang Risk Intervention Pilot  Program created by legislation authored last year by Katz (D-Panorama City).  </P> <P> "What makes the GRIPP program precedent-setting is the source for funding --  the GRIPP program is 100% funded with the seized illegal assets of drug  dealers," said Katz, who handed the check to county Office of Education  officials at a ceremony at Audubon Junior High School in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The program was the brainchild of George McKenna, who as principal of  Washington Prepatory High School, received national attention for successfully  implementing a similar program at his own school.  </P></p>

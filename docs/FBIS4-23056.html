Lomonosov; UDC541.63+547.898]    [Abstract] Trans-cyclohexanocrown esters are macrocyclic  ligands having complex-forming properties which can be regulated  by introducing variously orientated substituents at the  cyclohexane fragment of the molecule. The possibility of such  regulating is due to the change in relative stability of the two  conformers (A and B) during a change in conformational energy of  an alkyl substituent (R) in the molecule. The macrocycle in  conformer B is much more susceptible to formation of complexes  with cations than the extended macrocycle in conformer A. This  has been confirmed experimentally: the addition of inorganic  salts to solutions of the trans-cyclohexanocrown esters in  CD[.sub]3[/]OD and (CD[.sub]3[/])[.sub]2[/]CO results  in an equilibrium shift in conformer IB. The regulating role of  substituent R consists of destabilizing the IB-cation complex,  which becomes intensified with an increase in conformational  energy of the substituent. In the present work the  trans-cyclohexanodithiocrown ester homologous series was  synthesized from corresponding trans-1,2-cyclohexanodiols. The  ratio of conformers to one another was determined by PMR from  the synthesis products. It was demonstrated that the position of  conformational equilibrium is determined by the size and  structure of the macrocycle and by the volume of the substituent  in the alicyclic fragment.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The role of R&hyph;25 and R&hyph;26 is in the assessment of radiological releases to Containment. In this function it is important that one of the instruments, being high range, respond to a radiological release. Indications from the devices are not used in a quantitative manner. Rather they are used for qualitative purposes. Due to redundancy and past test history, continued operability is expected. In addition, the instruments serve no function in preventing accident initiation or accident mitigation. Therefore, it is concluded that an extended operating cycle for these monitors would not result in the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the qualitative function served by these two instruments as well as their redundancy and acceptable past test history, no significant reduction in the margin of safety due to an extended operating cycle is expected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Safety Injection System Electrical Loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazard consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The test procedure under consideration is one of the more complicated surveillance procedures accomplished at a refueling interval. Considering the vast number of components that are tested it is highly improbable that some deficiencies will not occur. When such problems are encountered it is important to note whether the failure is time dependent and, in addition, whether the corrective maintenance implemented prevents recurrences in the future. In consideration of the evaluation of past test observations it is important to note that the problems which occurred were not time dependent and that maintenance practices have been effective in precluding future failures of the same type. Equally important is whether the emergency power system would have performed its intended safety function if the situation was not a test but represented an actual demand upon the system. Test acceptance criteria are always more stringent than required by accident scenarios to provide margin. As discussed above the two most significant findings were a failure of a CCW [Component Cooling Water] pump to strip from the bus during the 1989 test and a relay which did not function within its timing sequence. In the first instance, the diesel generator was not overloaded. In the second instance, the relay did function albeit not within the allotted time. In both cases, safety functions would have been performed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, it is concluded that an extended period between surveillances will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The deficiencies noted in the test data taken during the last several refueling outage surveillances were not substantial in number and would not have impacted the capability of the Safety Injection System and its emergency power supply to perform its intended safety function. The effectiveness of maintenance practices, both preventive and corrective, has been proven in that deficiencies noted in one test are not repeated in subsequent tests. The last refueling surveillance test was completely successful where no new test failures were noted. Because past test deficiencies do not appear to be time dependent, extending the surveillance interval by 7.5 months is not expected to create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because previous tests indicate that the engineered safety features power supply would have performed its safety function if called upon over the past several years, it is concluded that extending the operating cycle by several months will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Safety Injection System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed change does not involve a significant hazard consideration since:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. There is no significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The central safety objective in reactor design and operation is the control of reactor fission products from the fuel. Four methods are used to ensure this objective. Two of these methods are: (1) Retention of fission products in the reactor coolant for whatever leakage occurs; and (2) retention of fission products by the containment for operational and accidental releases beyond the reactor coolant boundary. The engineered safety features are the provisions in the plant that embody these two methods to prevent the occurrence or to ameliorate the effects of serious accidents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The engineered safety features systems are the containment system, the safety injection system, the containment spray system, the containment air recirculation cooling and filtration system, the isolation valve seal-water system, and the containment penetration and weld channel pressurization system. Each engineered safety feature provides sufficient performance capability to accommodate any single failure of an active component and still function in a manner to avoid undue risk to the health and safety of the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comprehensive program of plant testing is formulated for all equipment, systems, and system control vital to the functioning of engineered safety features. The program consists, in part, of integrated tests of the systems as a whole and periodic tests of the actuation circuitry and mechanical components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An assessment has been performed of the test results from the last five refueling outages, covering a period in excess of seven years. In reviewing the test results particular attention was directed towards those test anomalies which directly impacted test acceptance criteria and, thus, influence the capability of the safety injection system to perform its intended safety function. Although in each test a problem area was identified, the number of such events were minimal. Furthermore, after corrective action these events were not repeated in subsequent system tests. In all instances the problems were not identified to be time dependent. Furthermore, the consequence from a system safety function perspective was minimal. Thus, it is concluded that extending the surveillance interval by several months will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed has not been created.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of problem areas in each test have been few and of minimal to nonexistent safety significance. In 1986, a valve failure occurred which would have been detected by alternate means during an extended operating cycle. In another instance, lack of valve movement could not be repeated in a second test, leading to the conclusion that the valve malfunction was not induced by the system but was the result of the test process. In the last problem area, manual SI initiation, no credit is taken within the FSAR [Final Safety Analysis Report] accident analysis for this function. In 1989, a series of containment isolation valves failed to stroke as required. In three instances the valves failed closed, which is the correct position. In the other instances, either the redundant valve did stroke to the correct position or the valve was located in a closed system. In all these events there was minimal impact upon safety. More importantly, after corrective action, these failures were not repeated in the 1991 or 1993 tests. In 1991, one breaker failed to perform within specifications and thus was considered defective. In 1993 there were no major equipment malfunctions, although one containment isolation valve failed to perform as required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, although there have been anomalies in all of the tests evaluated, none were deemed serious enough to impact the safety function of the safety injection system or to be considered as having a negative affect upon an increased interval of several months between surveillances. Therefore, it has been concluded that an increased operating cycle will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. There has been no reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The results of the previous five cycles of test data have been evaluated. None of the anomalies observed were sufficiently serious to impact the performance of the Safety Injection System or to weigh against an extended operating cycle. As there are no other changes to the safety analysis parameters which are impacted by an extended interval between surveillances, it is concluded that this change will not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Reactor Coolant System Sub-Cooling Margin Monitor:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Reduced fiscal deficit sought: Pakistani Budget THE Pakistani government will unveil its annual budget tomorrow amid widespread expectations of measures to narrow a PR72bn (Pounds 1.61bn) budgetary deficit. These are expected to include cost-cutting efforts as well as possible tax rises. The deficit, estimated at 6.1 per cent of gross domestic product, has broken an earlier target ceiling of 4.8 per cent. It is regarded as a big pressure on the economy at a time when Pakistan is trying to encourage large-scale privatisation and deregulation. At the same time, though, the government yesterday claimed the growth rate for 1991-92 had risen to 6.4 per cent from 5.6 per cent a year earlier. According to Pakistan's official economic survey, announced before the budget, the manufacturing sector registered the largest growth rate of 7.7 per cent followed by 6.4 per cent in farming. The government is also expected to take credit for a 25 per cent increase in fresh private investment and a 13 per cent increase in exports. Inflation is down to 9.5 per cent from 12.5 per cent a year ago, the government says. Foreign exchange reserves stand at some Dollars 650m (Pounds 362m), up from Dollars 300m a year ago. However, failure to meet the earlier deficit target is attributed to an adverse international economic situation and lower than expected response in the privatisation programme which is eventually expected to raise up to PR250m. According to the economic survey, the current account deficit during 1991-92 is likely to end up higher than the Dollars 2.2bn last year. This has occurred because of a failure to meet an export growth target of 20 per cent, and a rise in imports of 10.5 per cent compared with an earlier projection of 2.5 per cent. A drop in international cotton prices and yarn has also affected export earnings. Remittances from overseas Pakistani workers have also fallen. But the current account deficit is expected to be made up in part by deposits in foreign currency accounts at Pakistani banks, allowed last year under government liberalisation measures. Under the privatisation programme, the government has partly sold 50 public sector factories with transfer of management to private owners, compared with an earlier target of 100. The programme has raised PR10bn through these partial sales while another PR15bn is expected to be raised through future sale of more shares in these factories. Among other economic constraints, the government is unlikely to cut the large defence budget, expected to stand at PR76.9bn. Some of Pakistan's foreign aid donors have expressed concern over defence expenditures, regarding this as an area where cuts would reduce the deficit. But resistance from the politically influential army together with continued tensions with India over Kashmir and instability in Afghanistan have prevented such reductions, officials say. Another PR79bn is expected to go towards debt servicing, where Pakistan's total external and internal debt stands at approximately PR900bn. Last week Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister, said the country has accumulated a large debt burden, making it the biggest obstacle in the way of balancing the budget.</p>

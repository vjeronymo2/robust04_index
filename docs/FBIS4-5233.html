			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The ruling parties will not  agree on naming Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as a new prime  minister, the head of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), said  Friday.    DSP Chairman Ouchi Keigo said, "the cabinet should not be  formed upon the initiative" of Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichiro  Ichikawa, major strategists in the coalition.    Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party]  led by Hata and Ichikawa is secretary general of Komeito, a  Buddhist-backed party in the coalition.    Ouchi said placing Hata as successor to Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his intention to resign, will  stem objection within the coalition as such a decision would be  made upon Shinseito's leadership.</p>

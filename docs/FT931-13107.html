			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch shuts Japan offices MERRILL LYNCH Japan, the local subsidiary of the US securities house, is to close three of its six branches, ending its drive to establish a strong presence in the Japanese securities' retail market. The US broker, which plans to shift retail resources to its institutional business, has suffered along with Japanese brokers from the sharp fall in trading volume and prices on the Tokyo exchange over the past three years. Merrill Lynch's move to close branches in Kyoto, Kobe and Yokohama is part of a restructuring of Japanese operations by foreign brokerages. Last month, County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster Bank, gave up membership on the Tokyo exchange. Individual investors have been net sellers for the past two years in Japan, while non-financial companies have left the market in large numbers, draining the pool of potential customers which Merrill Lynch had hoped to tap. 'This is the end of the retail experiment by foreign houses in Japan,' a UK broker said. 'You can see why Merrill would go for the retail market here because it is strong in the US retail market, but it has not worked.' In addition to operations in the three largest Japanese cities, Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, the US broker opened the Yokohama branch in 1988, the Kyoto branch in 1989, and the Kobe branch in 1991, by which time the Tokyo market was well into its descent. Merrill Lynch said the changes in Japan were part of an international strategy to focus on institutional-type investors and profit from their interest in the derivatives and yen-debt markets. 'We are still deciding when the branches will be closed. We had been hoping for more business from small and mid-sized companies and wealthy individuals, but we will be shifting resources more to institutional business,' Merrill Lynch said.</p>

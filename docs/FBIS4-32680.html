			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>   [Text] New York, June 25 (TANJUG) -- Ousted from Bosnia by  the ruling of the 1878 Berlin Congress after centuries of  occupation, Turkey is now being sent back by the U.N.  secretary-general. The former occupier is returning 116 years  later under the guise of a "peacekeeper." Apparently aware of  the paradox, Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has long  opposed the idea of including Turkey in the U.N. Protection  Force (UNPROFOR) in the breakaway Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, seeing this as being sharply at odds with  the proclaimed principle that neighbouring countries and former  occupiers could not serve as peacekeepers in the Balkan crisis.    Eventually, because of a poor response from the other  nations  to an appeal to donate troops to UNPROFOR, the principle has  gone the way of many another and was trampled underfoot by  Butrus-Ghali's "yes" to the Turks. However, Turkey's historical  occupation of Bosnia and return, this time under the wing of the  United Nations, is not the only paradox which has made the  peacekeeping force a mockery.    Turkey has a notoriously smudged record in international  relations, which the West is inclined to turn a blind eye to  because of the country's strategic importance to NATO. One has  only to remember Turkey's presence in Cyprus, where its forces  have held one-half of the island under occupation for twenty  years. One might think that Turkey has spent the past twenty  years under sanctions for the occupation. Not so. Turks remain  in Cyprus, the United Nations wastes billions of dollars on  maintaining a peacekeeping force there, but there is no mention  of sanctions from any quarter.    Sanctions seem to be reserved for the likes of Serbs,  Haitians, Iraqis and, possibly, North Koreans. Nobody is even  trying to answer the question whether a country can be an  occupier of a neighbour and still serve as a peacekeeper in  another country, which it held under subjugation for centuries,  at that.    U.N. press spokesmen have recently been stunned by the  provocative question whether Serb peacekeeping troops might be  sent to Cyprus. The question seemed absurd and provoked gales  of mirth from the assembled reporters. Nobody laughed about the  deployment of Turks in Bosnia- Herzegovina. And indeed, this is  no laughing matter.    The Western media raised hue and cry in February when 300  Russian troops were to be deployed in Sarajevo. However, the  world is taking in its stride the deployment of 1,500 Turks, in  addition to the Malaysians, Jordanians and Egyptians already in  Bosnia and the announced arrival of Bangladeshis and Pakistanis.  The hypocrisy of the international community knows no bounds.    Another important and unanswered question emerges, viz. can  a  country enforce law and order in another state, while being  unable to keep its own house in order. Turkey is notorious for  its violation of human rights, and ranks fifth in the world for  the number of journalists in prison. The world has forgotten the  first big genocide of the 20th century, which was perpetrated by  Turks killing more than a million Armenians. Similarly, the  Western media today have deliberately forgotten the genocide  perpetrated by the Nazis against the Serbs in World War Two.    This, then, is the picture of the state which is returning  to  Bosnia-Herzegovina as a "peacekeeper." All this should be  reason enough for the powers that be on the east river to take a  closer look at the moral criteria to be applied to would-be  peacekeepers. There is no sign, however, that anybody is likely  to give the matter a thought.    According to the latest information, the 1,500 Turkish  troops  and experts will be deployed along the lines of separation  between Moslems and Croats in the areas of Zenica and Kakanj in  central Bosnia. But, can one really believe that this will be  so, after so many principles have been trampled on. According to  a statement submitted by the Turkish mission to the United  Nations, the Turkish troops are bringing to Bosnia 393 vehicles,  including 70 trucks and 33 armoured cars. The statement was  withdrawn before it could be seen by most of the reporters,  leaving behind a massive speculation about 200 vehicles which  are mentioned en masse, but not separately described.    It is a generally recognised fact that Turkey has been  smuggling arms to the Moslems in Bosnia. So now it would appear  that it is helping their brothers in Allah with one hand, while  tipping its blue helmet with the other. When to this is added  the ease with which international institutions and the Western  media are ignoring the latest Moslem offensive in Bosnia, it is  not clear whether the world wants peace or war in Bosnia. Or is  it.</p>

Kuleshov; UDC 621.865.14] </F>   [Text] In today's field of robotic systems, the outlook is  good for developing the facilities and methods of adaptive  control which make it possible to expand the functional  capabilities of industrial robots (PR)[.sup][1][/].    One of the promising robotic information facilities  characterizing the parameters of the perturbing factors are  sensor systems which are used for sensing computer-aided and  robotized special-purpose facilities for loading and unloading  explosive substances and munitions, charging systems, etc. In  order to move the manipulated entities with a specific force and  spatial orientation, it is necessary to measure the force vector  and torque vector operating between the gripper and the gripped  entity with the help of a force/torque sensor of the sensory  system.    By equipping a robotic facility with a sensory system, one  can plot the force control loop and utilize the principles of  positional-force control which expands the functional  capabilities of the robotic systems.    Traditional force measurement methods involve determining  force through elastic deformation[.sup][2][/]. This principle  underlines the operation of an overwhelming majority of  facilities used for this purpose.    It is expedient to employ sensory grippers in addressing the  issues of force measurement in industrial robots specialized in  precision operations.    In known sensory industrial robot systems, the sensing  (force  measurement) function is performed by a resistance strain gauge  matched with an elastic element. These devices contain the  following components: a modulator-demodulator (MDM) amplifier, a  direct current amplifier with a low-pass filter, a regulated  power supply source, an analog-to-digital converter (ATsP), and  an interface with a communication line[.sup][3][/].    Yet these devices have a number of shortcomings: the  complexity of structural implementation which does not make it  possible to integrate the industrial robot's analog-to-digital  converter and the data transmission device in the gripper and  the placement of a preamplifier inside the industrial robot  sensor. Data on the force in the gripper picked up from the  resistance strain gauges is transmitted in the form of voltage  or current to a remote analog-to-digital converter which  performs the functions of converting the analog signal into a  digital form and processing data on a computer.    Such devices are characterized by one significant  shortcoming  of analog technology--their low noise immunity and accuracy.    The gripper sensing device is executed as a fluidic  instrument element located on the housing between the jaws while  the output channel of this element is connected to elastic  chambers through a comparison element whereby each chamber is  linked to one of the fluidic elements. The chambers, in turn,  are connected to the power supply through a regulator. Yet even  this device has many drawbacks; a large number of pneumatic  channels with local drag; and partial sensing (at the part and  chamber gripping location).   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-17A>           Fig. 1. Gripper </FIG>       The industrial robot sensory gripper (Fig. 1) contains  housing 1 with jaws 2, elastic elements 3 with resistance strain  gauges 4, and interface module 5 with an n-channel line.    A total of n resistance-to-time-interval converters whose  inputs are connected to strain gauge resistance whereby the  outputs of the resistance-to-time-interval converters are linked  to an interface with an n-channel communication line is added to  the gripper which contains jaws, elastic elements closely tied  to the jaws, resistance strain gauges attached to elastic  elements, and interfaces with the n-channel communication line.    The addition of n converters whose inputs are connected to  resistors makes it possible to increase the fullness of the  information content value and noise immunity in transmitting  data on the value of the forces and torques developing in the  gripper and structurally to integrate in the gripper the  analog-to-digital converter and the data transmission device by  increasing the gauge factor of the strain gauge and current  coupling between data transmitting and receiving devices. It was  possible to simplify the design and increase the gripper  reliability due to the fact that the sensory device is executed  as elastic elements with resistance strain gauges attached to  them and an interface module with an n-channel communication  line and n resistance-to-time-interval converters whose inputs  are connected to the outputs of resistance strain gauges whereby  the converter outputs are connected to the n-channel  communication line of the module.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-17B>           Fig. 2. Expansion of Force and Torque </FIG>       A rectangular system of coordinates which demonstrates the  expansion of the vector of force and torque applied to the  gripper jaw is shown in Fig. 2.    Any unit force or torque applied to the gripper may be  represented as follows with respect to any point on the jaw  extremity:   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-17C>           Equation </FIG>    F = (F[.sup]x[/], F[.sub]y[/],  F[.sup]z[/], M[.sub]x[/], M[.sub]y[/], M[.sub]z[/]).    During the gripper operation, the external force and moment  may be applied to the jaws in any direction. Elastic element 3  (see Fig. 1) is sensitive in the bending direction and is stable  in all other directions, so that the resistance of each other  resistance strain gauges changes insignificantly.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-17D>           Fig. 3. Block Diagram of the </FIG>       A block diagram of stress conversion from the force and  moment components executed with the help of the gripper is shown  in Fig. 3, while a circuit diagram of one of the conversion and  data transmission channels from one of the force or moment  components is shown in Fig. 4 where 1 is the  resistance-to-time-interval converter, 2 is the resistance  strain gauge, 3 is a capacitor, 4 is a univibrator, 5 is the  converter input, and 6 is the interface circuit with the  communication line.    The resistance strain gauge is an integral part of the  resistance-to-time-interval converter. It is a primary  conversion element which transform a mechanical quantity into an  electric signal in the form of resistance R[.sup]FM[/].   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-18A>           Fig. 4. Circuit Diagram of the Data </FIG>       Semiconductor KDT-2B silicon resistance strain gauges which  meet the specifications of AO.336235 TU and have a 220 O  resistance and a length of 2 or 7 mm are used as primary  transducers. The resistance strain gauges are glued to the  measuring surface of the elastic element with a VL-931 lacquer  (GOST 10402-75). Slices of the FDM-1 material with a 0.2-mm  thickness (TU 16-503.084-71) are glued to the measuring spots of  the elastic element. The terminal wires are glued to the slices  in order to protect the resistance strain gauge from possible  ruptures. The resistance strain gauges, soldering spots, and the  wires are covered with the VL-931 lacquer (GOST 10462-75).    Together with resistance strain gauge 2, capacitor 3 with a  capacitance of C forms a controlled RC-circuit with a time  constant of _t_ = R[.sup]FM[/]C. The time constant value _t_  determines the length of the T-pulse generated by the  univibrator.    The device operates in the following fashion. A force is  applied to the jaws in any direction when the part is being  gripped. In this case, the elastic element is deformed under the  effect of this force. The stresses developing in it are picked  up by resistance strain gauges whose resistance is proportionate  to the elastic element tension at the place of its installation.  After converting the mechanical quantity into electric in the  form of resistance R[.sup]FM[/], the capacitor in the  interface module of resistance strain gauge 2 converts  resistance to the time constant _t_ which determines the  duration of the T-pulse generated by univibrator 4.    The duration of the voltage pulse at the univibrator output  as well as the current pulse in the communication line contain  data on the force or moment which are expressed by the following  formula:   <FIG ID=JPRS-UST-006C-18B>           Equation </FIG>    T = K_t_ = KR[.sup]FM[/]C = KC(A + BF),    where K is the conversion ratio of univibrator 4 and A and B  are the coefficients determined by the physical parameters of  resistance strain gauge 2.    The current magnitude in the communication line is important  only for the data transmission noise immunity indicators and  does not affect the contents of this information.    Compared to the sensors described in [2,3] which perform the  force measurement function, the proposed device has the  following advantages. Foil-type resistance strain gauges are  used as primary transducers which greatly limits the maximum  attainable output signal magnitude (the gauge factor of the  foil-resistance strain gauges is K = (_D_ R/R)/(_D_ 1/1)=2-3  whereas the same figure for semiconductor devices is K =  100-200).    The advantages of the force/torque systems described in [3]  are realized provided that high-quality amplifiers are used.    Furthermore, the output voltage after primary conversion is  very low, so its transmission and processing may be very  complicated in the presence of electromagnetic interference.  This factor often calls for placing a preamplifier inside the  sensor.    Due to the use of semiconductor resistance as primary  transducers in the aforementioned device, the output signal  level is measured in units of volts (1-5 V) whereby it is not  necessary to use amplifiers or preamplifiers.    The semiconductor resistance strain gauges' high sensitivity  and the use of resistance-to-time-interval converters ensure  small overall dimensions of the sensor and electronic module  structure. This, in turn, makes it possible to install them  directly on the gripper jaws or integrate them as a single  device with the jaws.    Given a pulse data representation and transmission in a  pulse  form, the noise immunity indicators, compared to those of  continuous representation, are much higher.    The current feedback between the data transmission and  reception devices also ensures a more stable noise immunity  compared to voltage feedback since based on experimental data,  the current feedback even after attaining a 100-200 mA current  becomes a source of noise (in this case, the output signal  values reach 3-20 mA).    An increase in noise immunity is the determining factor of  reliable industrial robot performance under extreme operating  conditions; moreover, data transmission accuracy increases too.

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Eastern Europe asks Nato for more Four former Warsaw Pact countries yesterday reluctantly accepted a US-inspired Nato plan offering them closer links with the alliance, but demanded assurances that it would eventually lead to full membership. The 'Partnership for Peace' project, due to be endorsed by Nato leaders at a summit in Brussels next week, has disappointed the east European countries and Lithuania because it falls short of offering the explicit security guarantees which go with full membership. A statement issued yesterday in Warsaw by the defence chiefs of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia made clear that the four countries, while accepting the Nato offer for the moment, were keeping up pressure for a firm alliance commitment to full membership in the future. The four ministers, whose countries are collectively known as the Visegrad group, have sought membership of Nato for fear of being isolated while new threats were developing to their security from an increasingly unstable Russia, currently in the grip of resurgent nationalism. Russia, however, has warned Nato not to give full membership to its four former allies, which would expand the alliance eastwards to Russia's own frontiers and infuriate the country's military leaders. This warning has been taken on board by US President Bill Clinton and other western leaders, who are particularly anxious to avoid strengthening the position of extreme Russian nationalists like Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky and undermining President Boris Yeltsin's reform programme. In Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, went on record with a statement that the Nato plan should be open to all eastern European countries, without discrimination. 'We welcome the anticipation of Russia's membership in Partnership for Peace,' he said yesterday. Germany, the strongest western advocate of east European membership of Nato, said it could go no further than it had already done to help the eastern European countries' ambitions. 'What these countries want - to be sure that nobody can attack them without Nato intervening - is something they cannot get, at least not in the initial phase,' Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said in Bonn. George Graham writes from Washington: US officials said yesterday they expected next week's Nato meeting to reaffirm its threat to launch air strikes against Serbian forces in Bosnia if the 'strangulation' of Sarajevo and other Bosnian cities continued. Although conditions had improved after Nato first issued the threat last August, they had again deteriorated in recent weeks, one senior administration official said, and the US was now 'deeply concerned' about the situation in Sarajevo. But the US is anxious Bosnia should not dominate the Nato meeting. US and British diplomats have told Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to stop Bosnian Serbs from continuous bombardment of Sarajevo and to concentrate on negotiations, Reuter reports from the UN. Britain's UN ambassador, Sir David Hannay, told reporters that envoys from both embassies in Belgrade made a demarche to tell Mr Milosevic the 'bombing was deadly unproductive'. Diplomatic sources said Mr Milosevic said he would do his best.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Milviana Jerez from the "National Newscast;" </F> passages within quotation marks are recorded]    [Text] Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger  categorically denied any misuse of funds in his ministry, adding  that an audit conducted by an international firm from 1991 to  the present confirmed that everything is aboveboard.    Kruger also confirmed the resignation of Deputy Foreign  Trade  Minister Alfonso Deshon.    [Kruger] "I categorically and completely reject those  reports. There has been no misuse of funds in this ministry.  You must understand that the Foreign Cooperation Ministry is  the ministry that works to obtain foreign cooperation."    Kruger added that an international auditing firm confirmed  that there has been no misuse of funds in his ministry.    [Kruger] "For two consecutive years, an international  auditing firm presented an independent report to the  international community on the state of foreign cooperation.  The international community has found the system to be  appropriate and has been satisfied with the reports."    Kruger said Comptroller General Arturo Harding visited him  this morning.    [Kruger] "We are open. If the Comptroller General wants to  visit our office, he is perfectly welcome. We will show him all  the work we have done, all the audits. We are not trying to  hide anything. On the contrary, all of you, many of you, know  me and know the work I have done and the honesty with which we  handle this office."    Kruger said he regrets such reports, which only hinder  international cooperation.    [Kruger] "Our objective is not to file suits. I believe the  problem of democracy is a problem of all Nicaraguans and that we  should exercise our right to inform responsibly."    The Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden give Nicaragua $67  million in cooperation aid per year.</p>

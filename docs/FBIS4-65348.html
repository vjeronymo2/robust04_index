			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt by </F> Dietmar Seher; place and date not given: "Debts Not To Be Paid  With MiGs"]    [Text] [Seher] You have achieved an agreement with the  Russian delegation on the delivery of railroad passenger cars by  Deutsche Waggonbau AG [DWA]. How do you assess this achievement?    [Rexrodt] As a breakthrough and a success. The Russians  have promised that orders at a value of 500 million German marks  [DM] will go to [DWA in] Ammendorf this year. This means that  the jobs there will be secure. Good prospects are established  because this makes it possible to bridge the time until 1996.  Afterwards, it is to be expected that Western orders will take  up more capacities in the factory.    [Seher] What will happen in 1995? Your agreement says that  orders are then to be issued at a lower level. At what level?    [Rexrodt] The orders for 1995 must still be negotiated. For  1996 it has been agreed that we will enter close cooperation  with DWA in Russia itself. This means that wagons will be built  there and know-how will be transferred.    [Seher] Thus, the 2,000 employees may stay for the time  being.    [Rexrodt] Detailed decisions about the number of employees  will have to be made by the company management. But the  imminent disaster has been averted.    [Seher] Will there be Hermes guarantees to secure the  orders?    [Rexrodt] Yes, full guarantees.    [Seher] German companies have explained that their  investments are taxed too highly in Russia. Did this play a  role in the negotiations?    [Rexrodt] Not now. But it was a subject during my visit to  Russia three weeks ago and of the talks that I held at the  West-East conference in Warsaw. The issue is not just taxes but  much more -- customs duties, methods of administration, the  functioning of the banking systems. All this runs under the  heading of investment conditions. They must be improved and  made predictable. Indeed, there has been taxation on  investments in Russia. It has been indicated to us that this  will be abolished very soon, that everything was a  misunderstanding.    [Seher] During their visit to Germany, the Russian  delegation complained about an insufficient opening up of the  markets of the European Union [EU] and the West to Russian  products. Are these complaints justified?    [Rexrodt] No, I think they are not justified. As of next  year the European Union will have completely open markets for  Russia -- except for some steel products and some textile  products and, of course, the agricultural sector.    [Seher] It is said that Moscow has offered to pay its debt  with goods, such as with Russian nuclear power plants and MiG-29  planes. Is this correct?    [Rexrodt] I have never been told about nuclear power plants.  But MiG-29 planes? Yes, indeed. This was said. We have  rejected this. It does not fit in with our military and  research policy considerations.</p>

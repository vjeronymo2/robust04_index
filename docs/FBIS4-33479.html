			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] The foreign ministers of the Arab member countries  of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] finally ended  their two days of talks in Saudi Arabia with a statement that  gave a seal of approval and legality to dismemberment of the  Republic of Yemen through implicit recognition of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen.    This is the first foreign reaction in support of Yemen's  dismemberment, because even though the southern leaders of Yemen  announced their independence at the start of the civil war, no  foreign country has yet recognized Yemen's dismemberment or  questioned its unity.    The stand taken by the GCC foreign ministers in the implicit  recognition of Yemen's dismemberment is dangerous, the  continuation of which could have disastrous consequences for  Yemen as well for as the Arab and Islamic worlds. Among the six  Arab countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, only  Qatar voted against this decision, and took a unity-seeking  stand on the developments in Yemen.    In their two days of talks the GCC foreign ministers not  only  failed to take a step toward solving the crisis of civil war in  Yemen but worked toward continuing it. Political experts  believe that the stand does not reflect the policies of the GCC  countries than but rather the dangerous game that [Saudi] Arabia  is pursuing under cover of the GCC.    Over and above the negative stand taken on the domestic  crisis in Yemen, the rulers of Riyadh seek to push Yemen into an  endless crisis and thus forever forget the issue of the three  oil-rich provinces that have been occupied by [Saudi] Arabia for  decades.    The three provinces were occupied by Saudi Arabia in the  1930's and were supposed to be returned to Yemen after 30 years,  in the 1960's. But due to the civil war at that time in Yemen,  Saudi Arabia managed to delay the deadline for another 30 years.    Recently, with Yemen's insistence on the return of the three  provinces, Riyadh again sought to intensify civil war and to  delay the deadline for the return of Yemen's occupied  territories. Political experts therefore believe that the result  of the GCC foreign ministers meeting in Saudi Arabia was merely  a political pretext for Saudi Arabian diplomacy. Riyadh's  policy of causing civil war in Yemen follows the failure of  repeated attempts by Saudi Arabian leaders to weaken united  Yemen through transferring political, economic, and security  crises into that country.    Parallel to Riyadh's efforts to perpetuate Yemen's domestic  crisis by recognizing the Aden government in the south, Saudi  Arabia also seeks to create and magnify a pseudo-crisis in the  region, hoping thus to divert public opinion in the region's  nations from their own policies of discord.    The plan, or to be more precise, the creation of a so-called  issue of the three islands and efforts to create differences  between Iran and the United Arab Emirates is also within this  context. But this weapon is now increasingly losing its  effectiveness with the gradual publication of legal and historic  documents by official international sources regarding the  sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran over the islands.</p>

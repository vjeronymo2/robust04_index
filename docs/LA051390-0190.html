			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: WHEN LUCY GOT TOP MARX  </P> <P> Star-struck Lucy meets Rock Hudson, Cornel Wilde and Bob Hope this week, but  it's her encounter with Harpo Marx that leaves her speechless, in a classic  scene on "I Love Lucy" (Friday at 9:30 a.m. on KTTV).  </P> <P> Lucy gets herself into a jam-but then when doesn't she?-by bragging to her  friends that while the Ricardos and Mertzes are in Hollywood, they've been  palling around with the stars.  </P> <P> When one of those friends comes to town, forcing her to put up or shut up, Lucy  comes up with one of her craziest ideas ever-impersonating such actors as Gary  Cooper, Jimmy Durante and Clark Gable. And for once, her stunt works. But just  as she's ready to go on as Harpo Marx, the real Harpo shows up. After he plays  "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" on his signature instrument, he and Lucy team up  to do the now-famous mirror routine.  </P> <P> Also during the Ricardo's Hollywood visit, Lucy also gets mixed up with Cornel  Wilde (Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.), and Rock Hudson shows up on a Palm Springs  getaway (Thursday at 9:30 a.m. on KTTV).  </P> <P> On a much later episode, when the Ricardos and Mertzes are back home in New  York, Lucy meets up with Bob Hope (Tuesday at 11 p.m. on KTTV).  </P></p>

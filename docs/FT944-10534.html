			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Audit costs 'lower in efficient companies' Companies with a high economic and managerial performance pay lower audit fees, says a report published today and based on analysis of nearly 700 sets of accounts. The annual report, by JDH Consultants, finds that in many cases companies with a low performance have been charged 50 per cent to 100 per cent more for an audit. The University of Glasgow's accounting and finance department is studying the results. Professor Neil Garrod said: 'This research is extremely well founded.' Two reasons had been put forward for the relationship. The first suggested that high-performing companies got value for money. 'It may be that the best managers are the best negotiators,' he said. Mr Dennis Henry, managing director of JDH Consultants, said: 'The other obvious possibility is that the high-performing companies have accounts which are more easily audited. If this is the case then another question must be posed: 'Is there a connection between accounts which are easily audited and company performance?' This could fit in with what appears to be the case, that it takes 50 per cent to 100 per cent longer to audit accounts of the less well-performing companies.' Prof Garrod is interested in the possibility that good internal audit practices have a clear impact on performance and keeping down audit fees. Performance criteria were used by the consultants and matched against audit fees to find a correlation. The criteria included return on assets, profit margin and the value added by employees. Another result of the analysis is that in those cases where the auditor changed the fees charged had been reduced by an average 28.25 per cent. This helps explain the increasing tendency for audits to be put out to tender. In general, fees charged on accounts before October 6 this year rose 0.58 per cent - with audit fees rising 2.25 per cent while non-audit fees fell 1.77 per cent. This again illustrates a highly competitive sector. The JDH analysis found, as it has done in recent years, a correlation between the size of companies and audit fee charged and the sector and the fee charged - but with big variations. Some companies of the same size, in the same sector, were paying 10 times as much for audit. Mr Henry said: 'Whilst I might accept a ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 as being reasonable, 10:1 takes a bit of understanding.' On fees for companies of different size he added: 'The small guys pay more and the big boys pay less. It takes a lot of big increases to the small ones to make up for some reductions to the big ones. The big auditors have the smaller companies over a barrel.'</p>

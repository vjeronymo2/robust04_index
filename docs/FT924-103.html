			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / German minister faces call to resign MR Jurgen Mollemann, German economics minister and vice-chancellor, is cutting short a holiday this week to return and face demands for his resignation, or at least for a proper explanation, over the use of his signature to promote a product manufactured by a family relation. Chancellor Helmut Kohl lent his weight yesterday to a growing clamour calling for clarification by the normally loquacious Mr Mollemann, demanding that he explain what had happened 'immediately and comprehensively'. The affair is a further embarrassing sign of disarray in the Bonn coalition government, and it could destroy the chances of Mr Mollemann taking over next year as the next leader of his Free Democratic party, junior partner in the coalition headed by Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats. Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the retiring party leader, has called an emergency meeting of its national executive for next Monday, to hear the economics minister's version of events. On Tuesday, the economics committee of the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, has been summoned for its own extraordinary hearing into the so-called 'letter-head affair', at which Mr Mollemann is expected to give evidence. The opposition Social Democrats, who oppose his free market policies, are calling for his resignation. It all amounts to the most serious challenge to the minister's position in recent years, only months before he was due to present himself as the natural successor to Mr Lambsdorff, when the latter retires in mid-year. The whole affair concerns the use of ministerial notepaper, from Mr Mollemann's personal office, to promote a safety device for supermarket trolleys, manufactured by a cousin of his wife, Carola.</p>

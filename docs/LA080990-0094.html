			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH REJECTS APPEASEMENT AS 1ST U.S. FORCES LAND IN ARABIA;  </P> <P> DEPLOYMENT: THE INITIAL MOVE OF 4,000 TROOPS IS CALLED STRICTLY DEFENSIVE, TO  THWART ANY IRAQ ATTACK. THE POSSIBILITY OF LONG-TERM INVOLVEMENT IS NOT RULED  OUT.  </P> <P> President Bush said Wednesday that he sent U.S. fighting forces to Saudi Arabia  because "America will stand by her friends," as combat aircraft and the first  of what officials have said could be tens of thousands of troops took up  defensive positions in the desert.  </P> <P> "We must resist aggression or it will destroy our freedoms. Appeasement does  not work," the President declared in a somber, early-morning speech to the  nation just hours after the first elite U.S. Army commando units arrived in the  Middle East kingdom to fend off a possible attack by Iraq.  </P> <P> "A line has been drawn in the sand. The United States has taken a firm  position," Bush said later.  </P> <P> While declining to provide details of the size of the force they may eventually  deploy, senior Pentagon officials sought to assure the nation they are  dispatching sufficient troops, backed by some of the nation's most lethal  weapons, to thwart any offensive by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> "We will put in adequate forces for the mission," Gen. Colin L. Powell,  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. The initial deployment was  expected to be 4,000 troops, although officials have said the number ultimately  could reach 90,000.  </P> <P> The mission is to protect Saudi Arabia and U.S. oil interests from the  powerful, battle-hardened Iraqi military units massed to the north on Saudi  Arabia's border with Iraqi-overrun Kuwait.  </P> <P> The Iraqis, Powell said, "are not invincible, and they are not 10 feet tall."  But he expressed concern that Iraq might resort to the use of dreaded chemical  weapons. One U.S. official said satellite photographs taken Tuesday showed  equipment that could contain chemical weapons being loaded on Iraqi aircraft.  Powell said such a threat has been taken into account.  </P> <P> Bush said that the use of chemical weapons "would be intolerable, and . . . it  would be dealt with very, very severely."  </P> <P> Neither Bush nor Defense Secretary Dick Cheney would estimate how long the U.S.  forces would be stationed in the tense region. As the first soldiers took up  positions at Saudi air bases, however, one U.S. official noted: "There is a  possibility of a long-term involvement."  </P> <P> The sudden airlift of troops under cover of darkness and the rush of U.S. Air  Force F-15 Eagles from bases in the eastern United States and Europe came six  days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. That lightning-like operation led U.S.  officials, and leaders throughout the Middle East, to express deep alarm that  Hussein would not stop at the Kuwaiti border in his quest to gain control of  the wealth produced by some of the world's richest oil fields.  </P> <P> The President's action, announced in a nationally broadcast speech from the  Oval Office, drew expressions of support from senior Democrats and Republicans  in Congress. They agreed that the threat of Iraqi control of world oil supplies  justifies the commitment of U.S. troops and military hardware.  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) praised Bush for having "skillfully worked  with other nations to isolate Iraq and apply maximum diplomatic and economic  pressure to reverse Iraq's illegal seizure of Kuwait."  </P> <P> "I think that the President can count upon our support in this action," said  Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania, the House of Representatives'  third-ranking Democrat.  </P> <P> With Kuwait apparently sealed off to the West by more than 100,000 occupying  Iraqi troops, military activities there remained to some degree a matter of  uncertainty.  </P> <P> "There's no sign of activity yet," said a U.S. official on an interagency task  force monitoring developments in Kuwait. "We're a bit surprised. Every day that  they don't react, we're closer to home."  </P> <P> With U.S. troops taking up defensive positions at key posts in Saudi Arabia,  said one Pentagon source, an attack could come "now -- in the next day or two  -- or never."  </P> <P> U.S. intelligence sources reported that additional Iraqi troops and weapons  were being moved toward that nation's border with Kuwait. But they said there  did not appear to be a major buildup of forces inside Kuwait.  </P> <P> In Baghdad, Hussein declared that Iraq had annexed Kuwait and called for Arab  unity in the face of outside threats.  </P> <P> The Arab League planned to hold a summit today in Cairo, as U.S. officials  continued to work behind the scenes to line up support among nations both in  the region -- where Hussein is alternately feared and viewed as an Arab brother  -- and throughout the rest of the world for a multinational display of military  resolve.  </P> <P> The commitment of Egyptian troops, much favored by the United States, as well  as units from Morocco, remained uncertain. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak  denied reports in the United States that his country had agreed to send troops  to join the multinational force. He said the Arabs should deal with the  situation themselves rather than have "a solution forced on us by foreign  powers."  </P> <P> But a ranking Egyptian official indicated that the summit meeting in Cairo  would provide a display of Arab unity that would allow Egypt to dispatch troops  to Saudi Arabia with sufficient political support from other Arab nations.  </P> <P> On Capitol Hill, Rep. Ike Skelton (D-Mo.), who attended a congressional  briefing by Defense Secretary Cheney, said troops from other countries would be  joining the U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Skelton said he did not know which nations would be part of the multinational  force, but that he assumed several would be Arab countries. "Saudi Arabia will  make the announcement," he added.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U.S. Army units, along with Air Force fighters and three U.S. Navy  aircraft carrier battle groups, moved into position to take up the brunt of the  Middle East duties.  </P> <P> With the 82nd Airborne Division's "ready brigade" digging in after a 16-hour  flight from North Carolina, several more U.S. units remained prepared for rapid  deployment. The 101st Airborne Assault Division, equipped with hundreds of  attack helicopters, was ready for deployment from Ft. Campbell, Ky., and the  24th Infantry Mechanized Division, based at Ft. Stewart, Ga., remained on alert  for rapid departure, Pentagon officials said.  </P> <P> In addition, warplanes throughout the United States and Europe, including F-16s  and F-111 fighter-bombers, were being prepared for deployment to Saudi air  bases. And B-52 bomber units based in the United States were maintained on  alert status for the long flights to the region. "One of our functions is going  to be using aircraft to kill tanks," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) after a  military briefing.  </P> <P> The Air Force readied several C-5A airlift aircraft, the behemoth of the  service's transport fleet, for the bulky equipment operated by the 24th and the  101st Divisions. The planes could ferry hundreds of the Army's heaviest tanks  and helicopters to the region in less than a day, Pentagon officials said.  </P> <P> Navy sources said hospital ships were steaming toward the Persian Gulf from the  Pacific Ocean. The aircraft carrier Eisenhower and its escorts of cruisers and  destroyers were in the Red Sea, to the west of Saudi Arabia, and the carrier  Independence and its battle group were in the Arabian Sea, just beyond the  Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. In addition, the carrier Saratoga and  the battleship Wisconsin were headed across the Atlantic toward the  Mediterranean Sea.  </P> <P> In Moscow, Bush's decision won the tacit approval of Soviet leaders, but they  shied away from any hint that their armed forces might join a possible blockade  to enforce the international economic and military embargo on Iraq approved  Monday by the U.N. Security Council.  </P> <P> "Our navy is simply not equipped for this sort of operation," said an official  of the Soviet Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee. "However, I  have no doubt that many of our captains, just like in America, are wringing  their hands with eagerness to get involved."  </P> <P> Still, a U.S. diplomat reported that an "enormous number of contacts" were  being made between American and Soviet colleagues to find ways to pressure Iraq  to withdraw from Kuwait -- a reflection of superpower cooperation that has  amazed some Washington officials as they seek an end to the first international  crisis of the post-Cold War era.  </P> <P> "No one is raising the specter of World War III," said one official involved in  monitoring the crisis.  </P> <P> The massive military movements toward the troubled region, with the support of  Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations, represented a breakthrough for U.S.  efforts to establish closer and more open ties there despite four decades of  American support for Israel.  </P> <P> Saudi acceptance of the U.S. role appeared to have been driven by its fear of  Iraq and eased by a U.S. agreement to make an emergency sale of 15 F-15 jets to  the Saudis. In the mid-1980s, Saudi Arabia purchased 12 of the sophisticated  fighters but stationed them in the United States on a standby basis to replace  planes as needed from an earlier purchase.  </P> <P> Under the Emergency Arms Sales Act, the White House may bypass Congress in  order to rush arms to allies.  </P> <P> One source, well informed on affairs in Saudi Arabia, said King Fahd had not  yet asked for any further arms. But it was believed that he would soon seek  additional weaponry, most likely 40 to 48 F-15s. Such aircraft were denied to  Saudi Arabia in 1985 when the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee raised  objections.  </P> <P> At a midday news conference, Bush sought to lessen tensions caused by the  detainment of 39 Americans in a Baghdad hotel.  </P> <P> But, he said, "I consider the protection of American life fundamental to my job  and responsibilities."  </P> <P> The State Department said it has compiled an incomplete list of 1,468 Americans  in Kuwait or Iraq who have been prevented from leaving despite sharp official  protests by U.S. diplomats.  </P> <P> Some Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq have managed to sneak over the  borders, and U.S. diplomats in Baghdad have been allowed to visit with the  Americans held in the hotel. They reported that the captives are in "good  spirits."  </P> <P> The President's deployment of troops left some family members in this country  angry, as the tension appeared to escalate and with it the increased risk that  Hussein could use the Americans as hostages.  </P> <P> After nearly a week in which the nation saw relatively little of the President  -- save for brief comments to reporters as the frustration of the crisis grew  -- Bush twice presented his case for the deployment during a space of three  hours, first in a nationwide speech and then in a news conference.  </P> <P> Speaking from his desk in the Oval Office at 6 a.m. PDT, Bush disclosed the  deployment of the 82nd Airborne Division units and the fighter jets, "to assist  the Saudi Arabian government in the defense of its homeland."  </P> <P> He said the United States seeks "the immediate, unconditional and complete  withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait," and restoration of the Kuwaiti  government that was replaced by a "puppet regime" when Iraq invaded.  </P> <P> "The stakes are high," he said, because the United States depends on imported  oil for half of its oil supplies. Iraqi control over Kuwait, and the threat to  Saudi Arabia -- both major oil producers -- could jeopardize America's economic  independence, the President said.  </P> <P> Referring to Nazi Germany's takeover of Europe 50 years ago, Bush said: "As was  the case in the 1930s, we see in Saddam Hussein an aggressive dictator  threatening his neighbors."  </P> <P> Discounting the Iraqi president's pledges first not to invade Kuwait and then  to withdraw, Bush said, "His promises mean nothing."  </P> <P> "This is not an American problem or a European problem or a Middle East  problem," the President said. "It is the world's problem."  </P> <P> He continued: "Iraq may not stop using force to advance its ambitions. Iraq has  massed an enormous war machine on the Saudi border, capable of initiating  hostilities with little or no additional preparation. Given the Iraqi  government's history of aggression against its own citizens as well as its  neighbors, to assume Iraq will not attack again would be unwise and  unrealistic."  </P> <P> Washington Bureau Chief Jack Nelson and staff writers William J. Eaton, Karen  Tumulty and Robin Wright contributed to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WORLD MILITARY REACTION  </P> <P>  The world at large has agreed to enforce economic sanctions against Iraq; many  nations also froze assets of Iraq and Kuwait. Others, including United States,  have gone further. Here's a military roundup:  </P> <P> UNITED STATES: Sends combat aircraft and troops to region.  </P> <P> SAUDI ARABIA: Will allow U.S. troops and warplanes to be deployed from its  land.  </P> <P> TURKEY: Expects U.S. request to use Turkish air bases as potential staging  areas. Has stopped allowing Iraqi oil to be loaded on tankers.  </P> <P> EGYPT: President Mubarak will host Arab summit today. "We are not preparing  troops and there is no talk about this," he says. "But if we are asked to  participate with Arab troops, I do not think Egypt would refuse."  </P> <P> BRITAIN: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is only world leader to offer ships  and planes for the force. Destroyer is already in Persian Gulf. Other members  of 16-nation NATO military alliance and 12-nation European Community hold back  on military commitments, for now.  </P> <P> ITALY: Agrees to let bases be used to help facilitate transport of troops and  equipment and for logistic support.  </P> <P> SPAIN: Will allow United States to use four jointly operated military bases to  support U.S. troops.  </P> <P> WEST GERMANY: Signals readiness to allow the U.S. military to use American  facilities in West Germany as a "basis for operations" for soldiers headed to  Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> GREECE: Gives permission for nine U.S. support planes to pass through Greek  airspace en route to Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> FRANCE: Has two ships in Gulf of Oman and frigate with Exocet missiles en  route.  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: Has offered no immediate military support.

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Demand for Latin American debt intensifies THERE is little sign of slowing in the Latin American debt market, with new borrowers queueing to tap international investors for funds and bankers introducing new structures to investors thirsty for high-yielding investments. Last week, Uruguay became the latest Latin American sovereign borrower to tap the international bond market, following Mexico, Venezuela and Argentina. It raised Dollars 100m over three years in a deal lead-managed by JP Morgan. Next in line is probably Columbia. Bankers said yesterday the country was also hoping to raise Dollars 100m, and was in talks with new issue firms. Most expected a bond issue of between three-years and five-years maturity, priced to yield between 2.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent more than US Treasury bonds. Uruguay's issue was priced at the bottom end of this range. However, while Latin American countries are still obliged to pay substantially more than most European or US corporations, the cost of funds has fallen sharply since the market re-opened to them in late 1990. For example, Nafinsa, the Mexican state financing agency, borrowed at a yield spread of 350 basis points over Treasuries in 1990, but today would pay closer to 220 basis points. At the same time, dollar interest rates have fallen sharply. As yield spreads on straight Latin American bonds have fallen, bankers are designing new structures offering investors higher-yielding, but potentially more risky, investments. For example, Credit Suisse First Boston yesterday launched a Dollars 75m two-year bond issue backed by a holding of Venezuelan debt conversion bonds, securities issued as part of the country's Brady debt restructuring agreement with commercial bank creditors. Although similar private placements have taken place, the deal is the first public Eurobond issue collateralised on Latin American debt. The deal offers a high return, with a yield spread of 370 basis points over US Treasury bonds. Bankers said yesterday a new two-year Eurobond issue by Venezuela would offer a yield spread of perhaps 200 basis points. However the high return reflects a higher risk. The cash to repay bondholders in 1994 will be raised from the sale of the underlying Venezuela bonds in the secondary market. If the secondary market price of the conversion bonds falls substantially, the sale might not generate enough funds to repay holders of the new bonds in full. Warrants on bonds have also been offered to investors keen for leveraged exposure to Latin American credit risk. Last week, Paribas Capital Markets launched an issue of warrants offering investors the right to buy Brazilian 'multi-year deposit facility agreement' (MYDFA) bonds - instruments based on Brazil's commercial bank debt and already traded between financial institutions. Again, while the potential rewards of leveraged exposure to Brazilian credit risk are great, so are the risks. Yesterday, the secondary market price of Brazilian MYDFA bonds sank from a shade over 40 per cent of face value to 37 1/2 per cent, following accusations of corruption levelled against President Fernando Collor. The Paribas warrants offer the right to buy the bonds at 40 per cent. Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state oil company, will hold off for a couple of months on placing more bonds on the international markets, AP-DJ reports. The move is being made because demand for bonds has dropped sharply, thanks to the continuing appearance of political instability in the country following a failed February coup attempt. PDVSA is in the middle of a five-year, Dollars 48bn investment plan.</p>

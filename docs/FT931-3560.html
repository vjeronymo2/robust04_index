			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Amnesty plan for Salvadoran abuses EL SALVADOR'S President Alfredo Cristiani has proposed an amnesty for active and former high-ranking military officers blamed by a United Nations report for some of the worst atrocities of the country's 10-year civil war. The report, released yesterday, cites 'substantial proof' that General Rene Emilio Ponce, who resigned as defence minister on Friday, and four other military officers ordered the killing of six Jesuit priests in 1989. It says the late Mr Roberto D'Aubuisson, extreme right-wing leader of the Arena party, ordered the murder of Archbishop Oscar Romero in 1980. The US-trained Atlacatl battalion was held responsible for the massacre of a thousand civilians at El Mozote in 1981. The murders, assassinations and other human rights abuses were committed during a civil year that pitted the US-backed army and civilian government against left-wing guerrillas. The US gave the army and government around Dollars 6bn in aid during the 1980s, despite accusations by human rights observers that the Salvadoran military was guilty of the crimes now described in the report. The two sides reached a peace agreement last year, with the Salvadoran government agreeing to give the rebels land, purge the military, and reform the police and judiciary, and set up a commission to investigate the worst acts of violence. The UN report was written by Mr Belisario Betancur, former Colombian president, Mr Reynald Figueredo, former Venezuelan foreign minister, and US jurist Mr Thomas Burgenthal. They also accuse leaders of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of killing and kidnapping civilians, mayors of cities under government control, dissidents in the rebel movement, judges and US military personnel. The commission urged that those named in the report be barred from public office for 10 years, and be prohibited from ever holding military or security responsibility. It called for a special investigation into the death squads that killed tens of thousands of Salvadorans in the 1980s, believing that they continue to be a 'potential menace'. According to the commission Gen Ponce, Gen Juan Orlando Zepeda, deputy defence minister, and Gen Juan Rafael Bustillo, former air force commander, met on the eve of the murder of the six Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter and ordered Colonel Guillermo Benavides to have them killed 'without any witnesses'. Col Benavides was convicted of the Jesuits' murder, and is serving a 30-year prison sentence. At a ceremony in New York to release the report, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, appeared to offer some support to Mr Cristiani's amnesty proposal. Observing that the country had made great strides, but that peace-building was far from over, Mr Boutros Ghali said Mr Cristiani deserved the international community's encouragements in his efforts.</p>

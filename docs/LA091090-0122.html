			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> N.Y. POST OPENS BOOKS TO UNIONS  </P> <P> Leaders of the New York Post's nine labor unions were briefed today on the  financial records of the newspaper before beginning round-the-clock  negotiations to save the paper from closure next Saturday.  </P> <P> Post management opened its financial records to the accounting firm of Peat  Marwick over the weekend so the unions could verify publisher Peter Kalikow's  claim that he is losing $27 million a year on the paper.  </P> <P> Kalikow has said he expects the unions to make concessions totaling $17 million  to $20 million so he can continue to publish the 189-year-old Post, the  nation's oldest continuously published daily newspaper.  </P></p>

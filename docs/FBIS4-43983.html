			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Has Units Ready for UN </F> Duties"]    [Text] New York, 22 June -- The Netherlands has offered  units from all sections of its Armed Forces to the United  Nations. These units could carry out duties anywhere in the  world with a one to four weeks' notice.    Defense Minister Ter Beek announced this yesterday at the UN  headquarters after long talks with Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    A total of 3,500 military are involved in these forces,  which  include two frigates, two minesweepers and a support ship, a  battalion of marines, and a Navy PC3 Orion reconnaissance  aircraft. The Land Forces involved include an infantry battalion  with armored vehicles, a command unit, and an engineering  company for mine clearance and road repair. The Air Force would  be able to supply a squadron of 18 F-16 fighter aircraft and two  F-27 transport planes. Fifty military policemen could be  deployed for police tasks.    Ter Beek said the units would fit in a UN organizational  system enabling the secretary general to know at a glance what  troops were available in the world, how long it would take for  them to arrive, their specialities, and equipment. The  Netherlands is the 18th country to follow Butrus-Ghali's call  for a pool of military personnel for peacekeeping duties.    Ter Beek explained that the units could only be deployed if  the Netherlands' Cabinet gave its approval to the UN mission and  after the Netherlands' Parliament had been consulted. In  addition to these units on standby for UN tasks, the Netherlands  would also supply other troops and material for implementing UN  peacekeeping duties at any time.    During his talks with Butrus-Ghali, Ter Beek repeated that  the Netherlands did not want to send any troops to Rwanda. Ter  Beek said that Butrus-Ghali showed understanding for the  Netherlands' position that Netherlands soldiers looked too much  like the Belgians, the former colonial power, and therefore  would run extra risks. But the Netherlands would supply a  transport plane to fly freight and military personnel for air  traffic control into Rwanda's neighboring countries.    Butrus-Ghali praised the Netherlands' military efforts in  Bosnia and Croatia. He was happy with the cabinet's intention  to relieve the troops in Bosnia on 1 July with the 12th  Battalion of the Airborne Brigade. "A purple coalition will not  change this," Ter Beek said.    During the talks the secretary general declared that he was  having great difficulty in carrying out UN peacekeeping duties.  Sometimes there are not enough soldiers, often they have  inadequate equipment, and if they are offered equipment from  another member state then they first have to be trained in its  use. This way precious months can be lost and the United  Nations is unable to implement the peacekeeping decisions made  by the Security Council.    He said he was very happy with the Netherlands' initiative  to  make a number of units permanently available. "If that could be  done on a wider scale, Butrus-Ghali could decide quicker which  soldiers were to be sent out, because finally he knows what he  has in store," Ter Beek added.</p>

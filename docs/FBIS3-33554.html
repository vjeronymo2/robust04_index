			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Just a few minutes ago, retired Lieutenant Colonel  Francisco Arias Cardenas met with President Rafael Caldera.  Coming out of the meeting, Arias Cardenas said the meeting is  the first step toward pacification. He also reiterated his  commitment to those companions who in jail.    [Begin Arias Cardenas recording] Basically, the reason for  my  being here today, at Miraflores Palace, accompanied by Captain  Luis Valderrama and members of my family, is for an initial  rapprochement with President Rafael Caldera. In all sincerity, I  believe we are living in a somewhat new atmosphere which favors  change and brings hope. I feel the changes -- or the beginning  of the changes that started 4 February and 27 November 1992 --  are become stronger; one indication of this is that we have a  new government which the Venezuelan people elected on 5 December  1983. [as heard] Our conversation mainly covered the political  prisoners and the pacification process promoted by the president  of the Republic. [end recording]    Last night after the dismissal of his case and the case of  nine other officers who participated in the first coup attempt  of 1992, retired Lt. Col. Arias Cardenas said that to accept  pardon does not mean he regrets his past actions. Arias Cardenas  held an impromptu news conference on Los Proceres Avenue, during  which he clarified that those who have been released are not  abandoning those who are in prison. He feels it is just a matter  of using different methods of struggle, adding that each  individual's stand is respected.    [Begin Arias Cardenas recording] One cannot think that the  person who is in jail or who has been released is courageous or  cowardly. There are different ways of confronting the truth,  which we must do at this time, as a responsibility because of  the trust all Venezuelans have. [sentence as heard] In the first  place, I firmly declare that I am in complete solidarity with  the companions who remain in prison and with their proposals.  [end recording]    Arias Cardenas, who is considered the ideologist of the 4  February 1992 coup attempt, pointed out that he is not ruling  out participating in political activities if the circumstances  so determine it. He explained that he requested his retirement 6  months ago precisely to engage in politics.</p>

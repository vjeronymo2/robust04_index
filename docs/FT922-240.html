			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Observer: Sour note The stock market has become tired of ambitious British media companies, such as Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, WPP and Shandwick, which made too many acquisitions and issued too much paper. So it is bound to be a mite suspicious about the surprise departure of Aegis's well-paid chairman Peter Scott, and David Reich, a key lieutenant. Certainly, the reason given for the departures - they did not want to move to Paris - does not sound terribly convincing. At 44 Scott is at an age when most executives are just getting into their stride and not retiring. British shareholders will be left with a company which is run by an elderly Frenchman based in Paris and is facing increasing competitive pressures. It is not the basis on which most of them made their investment. Perhaps Mr Scott can be persuaded to rethink his hasty decision?</p>

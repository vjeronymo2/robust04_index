			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Patron for Peace?"] </F>   [Text] The call from Moscow made the chancellor proud:  Boris Yeltsin wanted to discuss NATO's ultimatum for Sarajevo  first with Helmut Kohl and only afterwards with U.S. President  Bill Clinton and the other Western heads of state.    For days, the NATO partners had futilely tried to contact  Moscow. Now the Russians wanted to talk to the Germans.    Unfortunately, Chancellor Kohl was unable to talk to his  friend and fellow sauna-goer; he was busy otherwise, he was  traveling around eastern Germany. Altruistically, the  politicians in Bonn passed the telephone partner from Moscow on  to the White House in Washington.    Yeltsin's respect inflated Bonn's ego considerably. The fact  that NATO's threat of bombing the Serbs had an effect "is  primarily also due to my influence," the chancellor praised  himself. And this influence will grow if he has something to  say about it. As soon as peace is established in the war in  Yugoslavia, the Germans want to help with reconstructing the  tortured country.    The times when Germany was just permitted to be an economic  giant are over. As budding peacemakers, Helmut Kohl and his  Free Democratic Party Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel ("Germany  need not hide its light under a bushel") are hoping for the  glamour of the political stage.    The Bonn politicians last week praised their Bosnian  conference of important diplomats in the former capital as a  particular highlight of their new foreign policy. Since the  signing of the treaties on German unification, Foreign Ministry  officials enthused, interest in Germany had never been as great:  34 television teams aimed their spotlights on the German  presenters of "good mediating services" (Kinkel) in the bloody  Bosnian conflict.    The idea of the international conference in Bonn had  developed during telephone conversations that Kinkel held the  week before last during a meeting with his Russian colleague  Andrey Kozyrev in Athens. From there, the German foreign  minister first startled his U.S. colleague Warren Christopher by  passing on -- "By the way, colleague Kozyrev is standing right  beside me" -- the telephone receiver. Later on, the two foreign  ministers established contact with London's Foreign Secretary  Douglas Hurd.    A new axis?    Of course not. Bonn did not become the site of the talks on  Bosnia at Kinkel's instigation. Others did not want to be the  host -- out of fear by those in power that they might throw  themselves open to ridicule with another fruitless discussion.    Some countries were not supposed to be the hosts either:  Greece, which is currently holding the presidency of the  European Union [EU], has disqualified itself in the view of the  other Europeans because of its unilateral embargo against  Macedonia. The Americans did not want to go to Brussels  because, as a Bonn diplomat said, they did "not" want to go "to  a European event."    The British, whose Lord Owen has earned more criticism than  praise as EU mediator in Bosnia, refused. They pushed the  Germans forward.    "Everyone knew," some of Kinkel's helpers described the risk  after the talks, "that this could be a complete failure."    However, since the parties to the war were not invited,  there  was no quarrel but results -- some that were to increase  Germany's praise of itself, others that indicated a surprising  development in civil-war-torn Bosnia.    Since the NATO ultimatum against the Serbia besiegers of  Sarajevo, since the Russian readiness to send soldiers for the  UN troops there, and since the conference on the Rhine Russians  and Americans are sitting "in the same boat with us," according  to Bonn's analysis. The Bosnian initiative, which Foreign  Minister Kinkel and his Paris counterpart Alain Juppe started  last year is now generally used as a basis for the further  search for peace.    With the "momentum" (Kinkel) of the NATO ultimatum  supporting  them, those participating in the round of talks in Godesberg are  now supposed to divide the work and push the warring parties in  Bosnia toward compromises: Together with the Americans, the  Germans first want to address Croats and Bosnian Muslims,  because they have great "affinity" (Kinkel) with them.    As soon as a separate treaty has been agreed on, the  Russians  "will put a curb on the Serbs," according to the distribution of  roles in the chancellor's office. A cease-fire between Bosnian  Croats and the government troops came into force last Friday [25  February] at noon.    Finished concepts are in the drawers in Bonn: Bosnia is to  remain -- for the time being -- in existence as state but only  in "loose confederation." The regions of the Croats and Serbs  could "lean" toward Croatia and Serbs -- up to an "economic  union." The Serbs are even supposed to be given the opportunity  of leaving the confederation by means of a referendum if they  want to be ruled by Belgrade.    "The biggest and most important initiative of German foreign  policy for many years" (Kinkel) has, however, a glitch. At the  end, there is the recognition of Serbian conquests, of "ethnic  cleansing," and a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which was  considered totally unacceptable in the West last summer.    A new language is now being used in Bonn: This plan does not  accept a "forcible change of borders."    "The time of threats" is over now, it is said. Now it is  important to crate "incentives" for concluding peace.    The most important obstacle so far: The Muslim government in  Sarajevo has refused for months to agree to a division of the  country -- as European peace searchers Lord Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg have suggested several times. The United States is  now going to use its influence on the Bosnians so that the  Izetbegovic government gives in.    Kinkel gives the incentive of "bringing" Bosnia and Croatia  quickly "close" to the European Union and to provide help for  reconstructing the areas that have been destroyed by the civil  war. Kohl's adviser want to bait the regime in Belgrade with  prospects of a gradual abolition of the economic sanctions.    Sarajevo, where Serbian troops are just leaving, is to be  placed under UN administration for the time being. Mostar,  which is besieged by the Croats, is to get a German  administrator on behalf of the European Union, according to some  ideas that sound rather bold.    The "emergency mayor" in Mostar is to be supported by German  policemen and administrators. Bundeswehr paramedics could  operate the hospital. Bundeswehr engineers from Germany could  repair bridges and roads, just as they did in their humanitarian  mission in Somalia.    Civilian experts from the FRG are to reestablish electricity  supplies and repair water pipes and sewage pipes. "We need a  lot of personnel," one of Kinkel's helpers says, "but we have  enormous difficulties finding people who want to go there."    Even in Tuzla Germans are supposed to march in as soon as  the  Serbs finally put a stop to firing a the airport. As a  precaution, the Foreign Ministry cautiously asked the Defense  Ministry whether soldiers who are on leave or have recently been  discharged would be available for operating the airport.    Defense Minister Volker Ruehe is still resisting. He is  sticking to the chancellor's previous statement that a mission  by German soldiers in the former Yugoslavia is out of the  question.    Ruehe's resistance will probably crumble if the "vision" of  his boss Kohl is fulfilled: The chancellor dreams of sealing a  peace agreement at a summit with the Americans, French, British,  and Russians -- as President Yeltsin has already publicly  demanded.    The Germans have already taken over "patronage" for a peace  agreement -- at least that is what the diplomats on the Rhine  claim. At the summit, they then want to rise to the first ranks  of international politics in front of everyone's eyes. There  Germany is to "practically guarantee" peace as one of the "big  powers" -- that is Kohl's desire.    The precondition: The civil war parties must agree.    There have been so many cease-fire agreements in the former  Yugoslavia so far that even experts have lost count. Another  one came into force last week.</p>

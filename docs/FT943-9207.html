			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / US sets Bosnian Serbs deadline on peace plan: Clinton threatens to seek lifting of arms embargo President Bill Clinton yesterday set a deadline of October 15 for Bosnian Serb acceptance of an international peace plan or the US would urge the United Nations Security Council to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. The proposal won swift support from France. As well as putting extra pressure on the Bosnian Serbs the US administration's purpose appeared to be aimed at heading off congressional moves to force the president into a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo. But in this it failed. Shortly after the announcement, the Senate approved the Clinton-backed proposal 56-44. But it also approved 58-42 a separate proposal for Congress to order the president to lift US participation in the embargo on November 15, if there was no peace agreement by then. In Paris, Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, said France was backing Mr Clinton's deadline. If the Serbs had not accepted the peace plan by then, France would lift the arms embargo, but he warned such a move would not be good for the people, for UN forces or for peace. The situation of UN peacekeepers must be clearly defined before the embargo could be lifted so they were 'not exposed to a generalised war'. Mr Clinton wrote to Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the armed services committee: 'If by October 15 the Bosnian Serbs have not accepted the Contact Group's proposal of July 6, 1994, it would be my intention to introduce formally and support a resolution at the UN Security Council to terminate the arms embargo.' The Bosnian Serbs have refused to accept a peace map drawn up by the so-called Contact Group, consisting of the US, the UK, France, Germany and Russia, which has led the negotiations. The map roughly divides Bosnia-Hercegovina into equal shares between the Serbs and a Croat-Moslem federation. Meanwhile, Russia yesterday called for the lifting of the economic embargo on Serbia, which has cut links with the Bosnian Serbs. The foreign ministry said the sanctions are now 'illogical and counterproductive', as Serbia appears to have kept its word on the blockade. The president's letter to Senator Nunn states US concerns about the impact of unilateral action to lift the embargo, according to extracts made available to the Washington Post. It states that US relations with its allies would be 'seriously strained', co-operation with Russia put in jeopardy and the likelihood of US military involvement 'increased, not decreased'. The Bosnian army, which would profit most from access to western heavy weapons, yesterday continued to make advances against Bosnian Serb troops. In Sarajevo, UN efforts to feed the city blockaded by Bosnian Serbs suffered another blow when gunfire hit cargo aircraft, forcing the suspension of the relief airlift. In the city, sniper fire killed an 11-year-old girl.</p>

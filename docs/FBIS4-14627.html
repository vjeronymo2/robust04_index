			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1700 GMT on 2 April carries the  "Novosti" newscast presented by Sergey Medvedev.    Over video clips of past CIS summit meetings and President  Nazarbayev's visit to Russia, Medvedev says President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's three-day official visit, "did yield one surprise,  namely the suggestion to set up in place of the CIS, which is  not working, a new state association with a single parliament, a  council of defense ministers, common borders, and a  supranational currency. Evidently understanding that the ground  had not been prepared for any discussion of these topics in  Russia and its sovereign neighbors, Nazarbayev described his  initiative as not a formal proposal, but just an idea. This is  why it was aired not at the official negotiations in the  Kremlin, but on the second day of his visit, at a meeting with  the intelligentsia in Moscow State University -- though  doubtless Kazakhstan's leader could not but have shared his new  ideas with Boris Yeltsin during the talks. It is interesting  why Nazarbayev decided, without mentioning the Russian  president's reaction, to appeal to public opinion.    "The idea has been voiced, and it is giving rise to more  questions than answers. The Russian Foreign Ministry, for  instance, is unclear what would happen if a Eurasian Union were  set up in place of the CIS, which has just obtained the status  of observer at the United Nations."    Medvedev points out the principles underlying the European  Union cannot simply be transferred to a Eurasian version, and  the right of veto, which it is suggested each sovereign member  state would have, is unlikely to meet with acceptance. Given  the level of the current disagreements in the CIS, such a right  could paralyze any new collective body, and it would hardly be  possible to reach agreement on anything.    Surveying the reactions to the new proposal for a Eurasian  Union in CIS capitals, Medvedev switches to an interview with  President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine. The idea, President  Kravchuk said, was discussed when the CIS was set up, and is  still being developed within the context of the CIS. "But,"  Kravchuk says, "I do not think we should disband the CIS today.  I believe that if the task of setting up a Eurasian Union is  set, the CIS should prepare the conditions for this." "All this  must be studied very attentively" and properly prepared,  President Kravchuk says.    Over a photograph of President Akayev, Medvedev says,  "President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan was one of the few to give  immediate support to the idea of setting up a Eurasian Union.  He regards it as promising."    Myacheslaw Gryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus,  interviewed in the Soviet chamber, said: "I am familiar with the  proposals put forward by President Nursultan Nazarbayev. We  find them politically interesting, to a certain degree, and  without doubt merit attention, a great deal of attention. But  in this respect I see that we must, first of all, resolve issues  of economic cooperation, of economic integration between our  state, the Republic of Belarus, and the member states of the  CIS, first and foremost with the Russian Federation. This could  be the second stage, because today, as far as I surmise, we are  not yet ready to settle this question."    "President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan believes that the  CIS's potential is far from exhausted, and it is better to  expend one's efforts on making the existing union work than on  creating a new one," Medvedev concludes.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPERA REVIEW;  </P> <P> A 'FALSTAFF' REVIVAL WITH COMPROMISES IN SAN FRANCISCO  </P> <P> Some operas virtually play themselves. Give "La Boheme" or "La Traviata" even  the most base of basic goods, and it is hard to fail.  </P> <P> Other operas are more delicate. They require special, loving, enlightened care.  One can't just stir and serve Verdi's "Falstaff," for instance.  </P> <P> Wednesday night, the San Francisco Opera tried to do just that. The management  called up some pretty sets from the warehouse, dusted off the motley costumes  and assembled an almost-reasonable cast. So far so mediocre.  </P> <P> Nobody did anything bad. But hardly anyone did anything good enough.  </P> <P> The troubles began at the top. Verdi's miraculously witty, complex and poignant  valedictory requires a great conductor, a brilliant director and a formidable  singing-actor in the title role. Terence McEwen, who selected the personnel for  this endeavor before handing over the company to Lotfi Mansouri, settled for  compromises.  </P> <P> To represent the composer in the pit, McEwen turned to Kazimierz Kord. He is a  fine musician, a solid technician, a thoughtful stylist in the right challenge.  "Falstaff," unfortunately, demands a Toscanini, a Bernstein or a Giulini.  </P> <P> Kord kept things moving decently, if a bit ponderously. He got the orchestra to  play well, and he accompanied the singers deftly. Ultimately, he gave us prose  when we needed poetry.  </P> <P> The production was originally staged and designed in 1985 by Jean-Pierre  Ponnelle. As such, it was a fussy enlargement of a pictorial scheme first  envisioned for the tiny stage in Glyndebourne in 1976.  </P> <P> The scheme -- cold, contrived and cutesy -- wasn't particularly effective then.  It really looks drab and mechanical now.  </P> <P> Since Ponnelle's untimely death in the summer of 1988, his productions have  been entrusted to ex-assistants, who assume the unhappy, inflexible task of  enforcing old laws even where they no longer make sense. In this instance, Vera  Lucia Calabria held the book and functioned as faithful traffic cop.  </P> <P> She can't be blamed for the general absence of spontaneity. Even if she wanted  to, she probably could not have refocused the action (a cackling page boy dares  interrupt "Quand'ero paggio") or elevate the taste (a sloppy servant actually  splashes the contents of two chamber-pots all over Mistress Ford's living  room).  </P> <P> Some of Verdi's -- or Shakespeare's -- spark still might have been salvaged by  a persuasive protagonist. No such luck.  </P> <P> As the fat knight, Thomas Stewart is neither fat nor knightly. He is tall and  imposing (several Don Giovannis within memory boasted bigger paunches). One  cannot fathom why he waddles. He is also crusty and amiable, but never very  funny, never much of an amorous or social threat, never an eloquent exponent of  dignity in decay.  </P> <P> At this stage in his distinguished career, moreover, Stewart tends to merely  approximate the vocal line. He never did command a big, juicy Verdi baritone  (Wagner was his mezzo-forte). Now, at 63, his resources force him to meet most  legato challenges with parlando evasions.  </P> <P> Three of the merry wives turned out to be holdovers from Ponnelle's original  cast. Pilar Lorengar returned bright and matronly as Alice Ford. Marilyn Horne  -- much slenderized in body, somewhat slenderized in voice -- mustered a  restrained Mistress Quickly. That must be an oxymoron. Ruth Ann Swenson again  floated rapturous pianissimo tones in the love music of Nannetta.  </P> <P> Best among the newcomers in the ensemble was Michel Senechal, a sweetly  crotchety Caius. Kathryn Cowdrick held her own spunkily as Meg Page, a role she  had undertaken in the student-matinees three years ago.  </P> <P> John David De Haan suggested the boyish ardor of Fenton agreeably, though his  lyric tenor tended to evaporate in the wide open spaces. J. Patrick Raftery's  recently resplendent baritone betrayed alarming signs of decline in the gutsy  music of Ford. Joseph Frank and David Pittsinger contributed dull caricatures  as Bardolfo and Pistola.  </P> <P> In 1985, Ponnelle vetoed the distracting crutch of supertitles. This time,  however, the translated lines were flashed across the proscenium, inspiring the  non-capacity audience to laugh before the funny lines were uttered.  </P> <P> All the world's a jest, indeed.  </P></p>

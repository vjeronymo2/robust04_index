			<p>BFN     [Text] Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana, who is in  Brazil attending the meeting of the European Union and the Rio  Group, has now given a first assessment of the latest NATO  ultimatum. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes:    [Fernandez Cespedes] For Javier Solana, this ultimatum from  the Atlantic alliance is the one that was expected following the  international community's frustrating experience in Gorazde in  recent days and after the repeated cease-fire violations by the  Bosnian Serbs.    [Begin Solana recording] I think that we have -- I don't  think that we have, I am certain that we have -- the obligation  to send a clear message to the parties in conflict, basically to  the Serbs, that the zones that have been declared safe and  defensible by the UN will be defended. A decision will not be  the only one or the last one. I think that in the coming hours  there will certainly be further resolutions, which will take  measures in relation to other enclaves, other zones protected by  the UN, so that a situation like the one that has occurred in  Gorazde cannot be repeated. [end recording]    [Fernandez Cespedes] Although the same conceptual approach  exists among the member countries of the Atlantic alliance,  Minister Solana believes this further resolution may be delayed  a little longer because of the difficulties of a technical  nature, which have to be overcome. Although he has not been  able to contact his Russian opposite number, Javier Solana is  convinced that, if NATO carries out the strikes to defend  Gorazde, the complaints of the Russian Government will not be  repeated on this occasion:    [Begin Solana recording] My impression is that the Russian  political and military leaders agree with this approach. What  they must do is the same thing that they did in the case of  Sarajevo: try to get the Serbs...[pauses] Pressure them to  comply so that this resolution does not have to be implemented.  But if they do not comply, without any doubt whatsover, it will  be implemented. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK HISTORY BEGINS AT HOME  </P> <P> I have always been curious about black history. Curious about the people who  moved in life while I was yet a whisper in the womb. But that curiosity, that  quest for knowledge about the black people before me, extended beyond the  general knowledge of great black figures like Frederick Douglass, Harriet  Tubman, Martin Luther King and other historical figures who symbolized the  struggle of blacks in America.  </P> <P> My curiosity went inward toward the story of my own personal black history --  the history of those in my family.  </P> <P> Like most black Americans, my knowledge of the family lineage was limited to  the 100 years this side of the Emancipation, and this, too, was limited. From  my parents' stories I could go back as far as Mississippi, their home state.  From these same stories I had a clear picture of what life was like in  Mississippi in the 1930s and 1940s for blacks in general, and my family in  particular. I knew, too, that Mississippi historically has been one of the  poorest states in the Union, and one whose name was synonymous with violent  racism.  </P> <P> My parents left Mississippi and headed north to Illinois after they were  married. Their brothers and sisters also left. I was born and raised in the  North, with my knowledge of Mississippi limited to periodic visits to my  maternal and paternal grandparents who remained as the sole roots to the family  tree that had branched out across the country. They were my oldest living  relatives, and as I grew older I wanted to know about their life and the lives  of those before them as far back as they could remember. I wanted to know what  thoughts, what passions, what events had come together in molding my family  into the people we have become, and the people we shall become.  </P> <P> Six years ago I traveled to Mississippi in pursuit of my family's black  history. Much of my time was spent with my maternal grandfather -- a  tobacco-chewing, tough but witty man who didn'tmind my tape recorder playing  everywhere we went. He took me around the small Mississippi delta town in which  he lived, and we walked and we talked about his life and the family and the  things he thought and felt. He talked about the long years of the Great  Depression when times were tough for everyone but particularly for a black man  in the state of Mississippi. He told me about the struggle to keep the family  together, about his trip to Vicksburg to find work, about the callousness and  the warmth of human beings -- and about his unyielding faith.  </P> <P> My grandfather died two months ago. Today, in the center of Black History  Month, my sorrow at his passing has been tempered by the gift he granted six  years ago: the gift of his voice on tape telling, in his own words, his life  and the life of our family.  </P> <P> I hear his voice and feel the gravel beneath our feet as we walked along the  dirt road atop the levee, and touch the bittersweet beauty of the cotton puffed  and white in the September sun, and watch the ripples in the water of the  mighty Mississippi.  </P> <P> I am thankful for my curiosity. I listen to the tapes. I hear his voice. I know  I have something special. It is a gift that transcends his lifetime and will  transcend mine.  </P> <P> As we celebrate this month, it is important not only that black Americans learn  about the history that we have in common as a group but also that we learn  about the unsung heroes in our own families who struggled through life in the  best way they knew to make life a little better for the present generation.  </P> <P> Black history begins at home. The strength of any celebration of black history  is to be felt in knowing the personal history of our family members who came  before us. It is the knowledge of the stony roads they trod, their victories  and defeats, their life of living that forms the cornerstone to a strong  foundation for black Americans as individuals and as a group.  </P></p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tangible to the opposition Sir, Gerry Boon (Accountancy: 'No room for own goals in financing soccer's future', September 30) suggests that football clubs might enter players on their balance sheets as intangible assets. Players certainly meet the definition of an asset and should be capitalised (not to show the value of the business but as a record of the transaction). But intangible? Ask the opposing team.

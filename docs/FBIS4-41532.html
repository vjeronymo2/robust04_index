			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1700 GMT on 26  June broadcasts the weekly "Itogi" program, which features a  four-minute interview with Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the  Russian Federation Council, in which he explains his recent  proposals on prolonging the mandates of Federal Assembly  deputies for two years.    First, Shumeyko states the main points of his proposal,  stressing that President Yeltsin had nothing to do with that  initiative: "Changing the existing laws and the corresponding  articles of the Constitution immediately and turning the  Federation Council into a more efficient body will enable us,  the current deputies, to deal with various issues on a deeper  level. I will not conceal from you that it is necessary to  introduce amendments into the Constitution, prolonging the  mandates both for the State Duma and the Federation Council for  at least two years. It has only just become possible for  deputies to pass laws and tackle legislative issues, but instead  they are being confronted with a completely different problem--a  new election. In my opinion, a fresh election will upset  Russia's balance to the utmost degree. I have not said a single  word about the president in this connection."    Shumeyko then comments on the public reaction to this  proposal: "I read the newspapers yesterday--the reaction is  quite normal. Who then distorted my meaning most and who has  been criticizing and accusing me of immorality? SOVETSKAYA  ROSSIYA, PRAVDA, Baburin, and Gorbachev--there is life in the  old dog yet! This means that I was right. These people do not  want political accord, they do not want stable work to begin in  Russia--that is all."    Shumeyko then explains the reasons behind his initiative:  "At  this stage, I can see no point in a change of power because  Russia will never come back to the state it was in when it was  part of the Soviet Union. This is impossible. Since we have  achieved political accord, the entire society now has to think  about the quickest way for our state to overcome this poverty  and crisis."    He says that social problems mattered more to the Russians  at  this stage: "The politicians ought to feel that people are tired  of these endless elections. They need anything but elections.  They need a job, a salary, a normal life, and a developing  state structure. They want the achievements of this state that  have been recorded in its Constitution to exist in real terms.  They want to be rid of crime and want courts to work normally,  and many other things, but not elections."</p>

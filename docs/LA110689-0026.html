			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Lost and Found: It's been musical chairs -- and directors and actors -- at the  Matrix Theatre, where Saturday night's opening of Constance Congdon's  much-anticipated "Tales of the Lost Formicans" was postponed for the second  time. Gone with the elaborate set and rear-screen projection effects are  actress Bette Ford and director Michael Arabian. K Callan is in for Ford,  Kristoffer Siegel-Tabori and Lee Shallat are the new directors. The opening has  been re-scheduled for Sunday. Claudia Puig and Aleene MacMinn  </P></p>

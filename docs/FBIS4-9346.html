			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- Bashkim Kopliku,  deputy prime minister of Albania, who is attending these days  the Crans Montana Forum conference in Bucharest, assessed as  remarkable the impact this conference is expected to have on the  general cooperation process in Europe and especially on detente  and development in the Balkans.    During a meeting he had Thursday, 21 April, at Victoria  Palace with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Mr.  Kopliku made a point of saying that after 45 years of isolation  Albania's most important foreign policy objective is the opening  to all European states, and primarily to the Balkan states.    Both sides shared the opinion that the Romanian-Albanian  relations, by their traditionally friendly nature, are an  example of cordiality between peoples in this so very troubled  region of Europe. The multiple problems generated by the  Balkans' ethnic patchwork configuration do not exclude the  possibility of their becoming the bridge between states, as is  the case of the Albanian minority in Romania, was one of the  positive ideas of the meeting.    The dialogue enabled the two sides to exchange opinions on  the stage reached by the reform process in their countries.</p>

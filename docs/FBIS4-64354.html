			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Some 4,000 marines landed in the Spanish port of  Cadiz for a NATO exercise that has former Yugoslavia as a  backdrop. The exercise entitled Resolute Response [preceding  name in English] is under the command of Iberlant [Iberian  Atlantic Command] in Oeiras near Lisbon. The future of Iberlant  is somewhat uncertain. Cid Saldanha reports:    [Begin recording] [Saldanha] About 4,000 NATO marines landed  in the Bay of Cadiz today for one stage in the exercise Resolute  Response, which involves 90 ships, 250 planes, and more than  35,000 staff. [passage omitted] For Admiral Carmo Duro,  commander in chief of Iberlant, this exercise demonstrates the  importance of this Iberian command in the Atlantic, but as  Renascenca has learned, the future of Iberlant is somewhat  uncertain. Everything is still being studied, but it is highly  likely that the Oeiras headquarters will be transferred to the  NATO European command, SACEUR [Supreme Allied Commander, Europe].    [Duro] Last year it appeared that Iberlant would not  disappear as a headquarters under someone else's control. I  believe this national objective must be preserved. It was  public knowledge last year that the objective was to increase  Iberlant's area and put it under the European command.    [Saldanha] In addition to this possibility, it is almost  certain that the Iberlant command will no longer be the  exclusive responsibility of the Navy and it will rotate among  the other branches. Another possibility is the simple  extinction of Iberlant as a major subordinate NATO command  [preceding two words in English] in the Atlantic.    [Duro] If it is decided to end within NATO with the [word  indistinct] of the Atlantic, then this headquarter's role will  be different. If there is a rotation between the three branches  of the Armed Forces here, I believe it will be to command  Portuguese forces, almost exclusively.    [Saldanha] In this case there would be a reduction of  Portugal's influence in NATO. It is the old war between  Atlantic and European commands -- in other words, the tug-of-war  between Washington and Brussels with Portugal on the Atlantic  border. [end recording]</p>

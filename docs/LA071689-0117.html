			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DON'T BLAME IT ON ISLAM  </P> <P> John Kelley's review of "The Closed Circle" (Book Review, June 18) is Arab  bashing at its finest. Kelley states that David Pryce-Jones' book is brave,  honest and thoughtful. I concede that it is indeed brave to publish such a  text; Pryce-Jones made honest observations regarding common Arab behaviors that  are unfortunately often true.  </P> <P> But, he was in no way honest about the causes of this behavior and certainly  not thoughtful when continuously blaming it on Islam. Pryce-Jones asks: "Why is  it that representative and parliamentary institutions, protection under the  law, individual rights and guarantees, have failed to take root in Arab soil?"  The answer is, no Arab country is following an Islamic system of government  true to the teachings of the Koran, which guarantees all of the above and so  much more. If Muslim Arabs engage in lying, cheating, violence, bribery, and  self-destructive acts, it is because they have failed to institute Islamic  ideals.  </P> <P> I must conclude with a remark about the arrogant manner in which Pryce-Jones  compares the Western system of justice and the "Orientalists." Islamic law is  far more "civilized" and "modern" than Western democracy. In this country, the  Civil Rights Act could easily be overturned simply by a change in the majority  vote of the people. In Islam, rights such as race and sex equality are  guaranteed and are irrevocable. Thus a misinformed public cannot change certain  unalienable rights just because they feel like it in this decade.  </P> <P> If journalists would start judging religions by their content instead of their  imperfect followers, most misinformation about Islam would vanish.  </P> <P> KATHLEEN M.

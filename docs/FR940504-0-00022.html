			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Can Regulations-Rules 3745&hyph;21&hyph;09(D)(1)(e) and (D)(2)(e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OEPA proposed a relaxation from 3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating (lbs VOC/gallon of coating, excluding water) to 4.4 lbs/gal for food can end sealing compounds. OEPA's basis includes a September 13, 1985, letter and testimony to OEPA from Heekin Can; an April 13, 1984, submittal from the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) to USEPA; and testimony presented by Campbell Soup Company before the OEPA on September 12, 1985. The basis of the can industry's requests for a relaxation is the purported unavailability of complying end sealing compounds for food can ends, as well as the infeasibility of add-on control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USEPA proposed disapproval of this relaxation because data from a San Diego source (Van Camp) indicates the possible feasibility of both add-on control equipment and low solvent coatings, and Ohio had not considered this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Comments on Proposed Disapproval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Heekin Can, Campbell Soup, Central States Company, OEPA, and the Can Manufacturers Institute commented on the proposed disapproval. Their comments, and USEPA's response to these comments are enumerated below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Campbell Soup Company Submitted the Following Comments on July 27, 1989  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendment should now be approved by USEPA in total: The data cited by USEPA in the notice of proposed rulemaking is, on its face, not an appropriate basis for rejection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data cited by USEPA in its notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) provided a strong indication that use of add-on control equipment may be feasible for controlling end seal compound VOC emissions. However, after reviewing the comments, USEPA agrees that use of add-on control equipment doesn't appear feasible. In addition, Van Camp has switched over to a solventless, waterborne end sealing compound for its pet food cans. However, USEPA has considered other relevant information, as discussed in this notice, including comments received, in conjunction with the data cited in the NPR, in its final evaluation of the proposed relaxation. Therefore, any shortcomings, or limitations, in the data cited in the NPR, have been taken into consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the Amendment cannot now be approved in total, it should at least be approved in part, by allowing relaxation of VOC standards for the period when compliance would otherwise have been technically and commercially impracticable, i.e., at least until May 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Only with Campbell's May 1989 conversion to a compliant end-sealing compound, following extensive research and development efforts funded by Campbell to develop and apply such a compound, is there evidence that a 3.7 pound standard became technically and commercially feasible for Campbell's Ohio facility.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA can only act on a proposed revision that has been submitted to it. Therefore, USEPA's only option is to approve or disapprove a permanent relaxation of the food can end sealing compound limit. It should be emphasized that as of May 1989 Campbell came into compliance with the 3.7 pounds VOC per gallon food can end seal compound limit. Therefore, USEPA does not believe approval of the permanent relaxation is appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If relaxation of the VOC standard to 4.4 pounds for the period ending May 1989, cannot now be approved for the entire food can end sealing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compound category, it should at least be allowed for such period for the human food can end sealing compound category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the response to comment 2, USEPA can only act on a proposed revision that has been submitted to it. The submitted rule provides for a relaxation for the entire category and cannot be approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any case, if the Amendment cannot now be approved in whole or in part, it should not now be rejected with prejudice. Rather, OEPA should be given a chance to modify or supplement the Amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``USEPA's proposed rulemaking notes that OEPA did not consider certain Van Camp data, i.e., the Lake paper which, in fact, was only publicly presented after the date the Amendment was submitted to USEPA. Accordingly, if the Amendment cannot now be approved in whole or part, and if such data is still deemed relevant by USEPA, these proceedings should be remanded without prejudice to OEPA so that the data can be considered, findings made, and, if deemed appropriate by OEPA, the Amendment resubmitted to USEPA in the same or modified form after the new data has been fully considered.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> USEPA Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> USEPA has an obligation to act on any pending SIP revision request and does not have the authority to ``remand'' such a submittal to the State. However, the State has the ability to withdraw or amend a pending SIP revision request at any time prior to final USEPA action. After USEPA takes final action on a SIP submittal, the State still may submit revisions to the existing SIP. USEPA will act on any proposed SIP revision submitted by Ohio in the future including additional relaxation requests for end sealing compounds. Any relaxation would need to be consistent with section 193 of the amended CAA. Moreover, it should be noted that USEPA has considered comments from OEPA on the Van Camp data in its final evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Heekin Can Submitted Comments on July 27, 1989  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These comments include background information, comments on the infeasibility of add-on controls, and comments on the unavailability of low solvent compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Before reviewing the infeasibility and unavailability issues it should be recognized that the level of VOCs that was emitted at the Heekin facility in 1987 as a result of following the food can end seal regulation (4.4 pounds of VOC per gallon) instead of the general VOC content end seal limitation (3.7 pounds of VOC per gallon) amounted to only 27.89 tons of VOC. Total VOC emissions from the entire end seal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation at the facility were 219.27 tons for 1987, while plant-wide emissions (base coaters, litho presses, side seam strippers, and end seal liner machines) were 652 tons per year after controls. Thus, the level of emissions sought to be restricted by disapproving the food can end seal VOC limit is only 4.2 percent of the emissions from the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KILLING OF DOG ON FREEWAY  </P> <P> I am writing with a sense of deep outrage about the deliberate killing of a dog  run over by members of the California Highway Patrol on the Harbor Freeway  (Metro, July 20).  </P> <P> The dog must have been in a state of terror and confusion after 20 minutes of  (efforts) to catch it. These are people who are supposed to represent law and  order, sanity and not insanity and certainly not outright cruelty toward a  helpless, frightened creature.  </P> <P> It was an appalling, vicious act and no excuses about the safety of those  people driving on the freeway are in order here. The traffic could have  remained stopped until the dog was out of harm's way.  </P> <P> MARGE LEONARD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

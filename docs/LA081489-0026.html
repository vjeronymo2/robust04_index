			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG GAIN FOR SLUM TRADERS IN COLISEUM DEAL REVEALED  </P> <P> While the Los Angeles city attorney was secretly investigating slum traders  last year, another public agency, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission,  paid some of the same traders $1.6 million for a dilapidated, fire-damaged  apartment house, according to records.  </P> <P> The rationale for the May, 1988, purchase was expansion of parking facilities  near the Coliseum, but officials say they primarily wanted to get rid of gang  members who inhabited the building.  </P> <P> The Coliseum Commission, anxious to raze the building at 3981 S. Menlo Ave.,  did not order a written appraisal and may have paid more than market value for  the property, The Times found. At the end of 1985, when the property was  legally habitable, it sold for about $1.1 million -- about a third less than  the $1.6-million sale price.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe the price when I heard it, I was so flabbergasted," said  insurance broker Benton O. Shannon, who handled insurance for the building  until the former owner, fugitive slumlord V. J. Sharma, stopped paying his  bills. "It just wasn't worth that. I heard about it from (one of Sharma's  associates) and he just smiled. It was one of those sly, shake-your-head  smiles."  </P> <P> Coliseum officials said that they have no regrets about purchasing the  building, which has been torn down and converted into a parking lot. "If we'd  paid $3 million for it, we would have thought it was a bargain," Joel Ralph,  general manager of the Coliseum and Sports Arena, said last week in an  interview. "We had parking lots no one would park on because they were scared  to death to walk by that building."  </P> <P> Almost all the principals involved in the building over the previous three  years -- including the real estate firm that got a $97,500 commission from the  sellers in the deal -- are now defendants in a civil racketeering suit filed  March 28 by the city attorney, the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, and  Litt &amp; Stormer, a private firm representing tenants.  </P> <P> The lesson to be learned from the deal, according to Kim Savage, an attorney  with the Legal Aid Foundation, is that the slumlords "won."  </P> <P> "They run it (a building) down until someone is willing to just knock it down,"  Savage said. "They win. They get what they are interested in, which is profit  from real estate. Then there is the most obvious loss: the loss of affordable  housing."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alleges Conspiracy  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that 142 financiers, investors and companies conspired to  drain 11 sample slum buildings of thousands of dollars in cash rents through  sham sales and inflated loans while leaving the buildings to fall into  disrepair.  </P> <P> The 3981 S. Menlo Ave. building was to have been the 12th example in the  lawsuit, and will still be used as evidence at trial, according to Deputy City  Atty. Stephanie Sautner, who heads the city's slum task force.  </P> <P> "This building fits the pattern of all the others with respect to the same  players, the same rapid transfers, the same slum housing violations and the  same lenders and brokers involved," she said. "Many of the sham transfers are  aimed at falsely inflating the value of the property."  </P> <P> Sautner said she could not comment on whether the $1.6-million sales price was  appropriate.  </P> <P> The story of 3981 S. Menlo Ave. shows how closely the management of a building  can be tied to crime in a neighborhood, and how costly a building's decline can  be in both human and financial terms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housed Immigrants  </P> <P> The building, called the El Portal Apartments, was erected in 1926 across the  street from what is now the Los Angeles Swimming Stadium in Exposition Park. In  recent years, the building housed immigrant families and other low-income  tenants.  </P> <P> In December, 1985, the building was purchased by Los Angeles real estate agent  William Leyton's Interreal Pacific Properties for about $1.1 million.  </P> <P> Recorded documents and interviews indicate the paper value of the property rose  steadily as its physical condition deteriorated. They also show how critical a  role lenders played in establishing that paper value.  </P> <P> On Dec. 30, 1985, records show, Interreal Pacific Properties got virtually 100%  financing on his purchase from A &amp; B Loan Co. of Inglewood, which issued  three separate loans for about $1.1 million on the property -- loans that would  ultimately be paid off in the Coliseum sale.  </P> <P> "They got this highly questionable loan," said Harold Gibbons, one of the  sellers. "And the place was just like a jungle within a matter of weeks after  we sold it. It just turned my stomach even to drive by it."  </P> <P> Generally, lenders require 20% down, and often much more for apartment  buildings or old structures. Therefore, anyone looking at the recorded loans  against the property would think it was worth considerably more than its actual  market value. That impression would be enhanced by the fact that the loans were  transferred -- one seven times in 24 months -- to different loan companies  apparently eager to buy them. And new loans would be added.  </P> <P> However, Sautner alleged, such deals are not "arm's length transactions." Many  of the transactions on this and the other slum buildings listed in the city's  lawsuit were among close associates.  </P> <P> Leyton, according to his resume, appraised "major loan applicants" for A &amp;  B. And most of the loan companies that bought the notes on the properties have  corporate ties to A &amp; B, most sharing the same address. Attorneys  representing Alexander Spitzer, owner of A &amp; B, declined to discuss the  company's loan transactions.  </P> <P> A holding company for A &amp; B recently filed for reorganization under Chapter  11 bankruptcy proceedings, listing more than $130 million in debts.  </P> <P> On his resume, Leyton lists the building as a "restoration" project "completed"  in 1986. However, records show the building not up to code during his  ownership.  </P> <P> Leyton deeded the property four months after its purchase to V. J. Sharma, an  occasional business associate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharma Convicted  </P> <P> By November, 1987, Sharma was convicted of 112 criminal slum violations on five  of his buildings -- the largest criminal conviction of a slumlord ever in Los  Angeles. That same month, he was also cited by the Los Angeles Fire Department  for 48 "life-threatening" code violations at the Menlo building. Dozens of  plumbing, electrical and building code violations also accumulated. One city  inspector called it the worst building he had ever entered.  </P> <P> During Sharma's ownership, some tenants moved out as gang members moved in,  squatting in empty units. The Coliseum Commission began placing an armed guard  outside the building on event nights after a spectator was murdered in 1986  behind the building.  </P> <P> Before dawn on Dec. 1, 1987, an arson fire broke out in an empty unit in the  Menlo building. Five units were destroyed and several others damaged. No one  was injured, but officials estimated the damage at about $230,000 and ordered  the building evacuated.  </P> <P> "That was our opportunity," said Margaret Farnum, commission secretary and  acting chief administrative officer. But, she said, the commission was unaware  that the building was a target of the city's slum task force -- even though  City Atty. James K. Hahn held a press conference outside it the day after the  fire.  </P> <P> Richard Ullman, general manager of Five Star Parking, which operates the  Coliseum's parking lots, negotiated the deal. "The parking was secondary  compared to (getting rid of) the problems the gang created," he said.  </P> <P> Ullman said he had difficulty even contacting the owners. Sharma, sentenced to  20 months in jail, had fled the country. Leyton, the former owner, emerged as  the real estate agent representing the new owner, an Encino-based company  called Ty Properties that is also a defendant in the city's civil racketeering  suit.  </P> <P> Leyton's attorney said in an interview that his client's involvement in this  deal was strictly that of a real estate agent contacted by the Coliseum  officials. He declined to allow Leyton -- a defendant in the city attorney's  suit -- to be interviewed directly.  </P> <P> Once a price of about $1.6 million was negotiated, Paul Conn, a partner in the  Charles Dunn Co. who specializes in low-income real estate, was asked to advise  the commission on whether to go ahead with the sale. He provided his services  without charge.  </P> <P> Conn said he did no written appraisal, and was not aware of the extent of fire  damage or of the code violations outstanding on the vacant building.  </P> <P> He said he assessed the building on the basis of a per-unit value to a  potential investor who could operate it as an apartment building. "I said,  'That's a good value, jump on it.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Written Appraisal  </P> <P> Since there was no written appraisal outlining the condition of the building,  it is debatable whether the price was appropriate. Records show that three  other lots, one already a parking lot, sold for $300,000 a block away, but  outside the area identified for public use in Exposition Park's master plan.  </P> <P> Gibbons, the co-owner of the apartment building until December, 1985, said he  was amazed to learn what the property later sold for after it had deteriorated.  </P> <P> "We would have expected the property to be worth maybe $1.5 million by then . .  . in decent shape, with paying tenants in it," he said.  </P> <P> The final sales price of $1,625,000 was financed primarily by parking fees. The  property went into escrow on March 24, 1988.  </P> <P> The commission's negotiator, Ullman, said he told Leyton that the Coliseum  wanted all encumbrances on the property removed. "The only thing the Coliseum  was interested in," Ullman said, "was that they deliver clear title without  liens or anything against the property. How they cleaned everything up, they  did all that through escrow."  </P> <P> It was cleaned up through an unusual foreclosure auction in the middle of the  escrow, according to records. The effect of the sale was to transfer the  property from one corporate name to another in the same office while wiping out  nearly $100,000 in liens to more than a dozen creditors.  </P> <P> The sale transferred ownership of the property from Ty Properties to Canadian  Pacific Inc., both of which occupy the same Encino office. According to the  city attorney's office, the companies are run by the same people, including  Mordehai Ben-Horin and Dan Tepper, both defendants in the city lawsuit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Proposed Price  </P> <P> Records suggest that the proposed purchase price was about $100,000 less than  the $1,625,000 the Coliseum had agreed to pay.  </P> <P> At the time of the foreclosure sale, according to the preliminary title report,  there were 31 liens, mortgages and court judgments against the property,  including many debts incurred by Sharma.  </P> <P> Several lien-holders contacted by The Times, ranging from a fire sprinkler  company to the city of Inglewood, lost their money. "I finally wrote it off on  my taxes," said Kami Boudai, president of California Technology Systems Inc., a  sprinkler company to which Sharma owed $11,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No State Record  </P> <P> The new owner, Canadian Pacific, agreed to Ty Properties' original terms of  sale to the Coliseum and the deal closed May 11, 1988. The deed was signed over  to the Coliseum by a "vice president" and a corporate "secretary" who Sautner  said were, in fact, clerical workers in the office of Tepper and Ben-Horin.  </P> <P> "The way this transfer took place and the manner in which they've placed minor  clerical workers as officers of the corporation is similar to all the . . .  transfers" in the slumlords lawsuit, Sautner said.  </P> <P> Two weeks after the building was sold, the same two clerical workers signed  notes for more than $500,000 using the Menlo building as collateral. The notes  were made out to "N. V. Boehmite, a California corporation." The secretary of  state's office says it has no record of such a company.  </P> <P> Tepper did not return a reporter's phone calls. Ben-Horin declined comment on  his financial transactions on the Menlo building. "This is business and it's  none of your business," he said.  </P> <P> Asked whether the sales price was fair, Ben-Horin said: "It doesn't matter to  me if somebody overpaid. . . . I didn't force anybody to pay."  </P> <P> The property was the first ever purchased by the Coliseum. Commission secretary  Margaret Farnum said the commission has new procedures requiring written  appraisals before to property acquisitions. "Our first time around, you could  maybe say we were a little naive," she said. "You could consider us novices who  took most things at face value."  </P></p>

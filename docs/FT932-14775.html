			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Austrian stock market reform plan approved THE AUSTRIAN stock market, which has been sullied by several insider trading scandals in recent years, is about to receive a strong dose of reform. Within the next few months, insider trading is to be made a criminal offence, punishable by up to two years in prison. This, and other reforms aimed at making the country's capital markets more transparent and efficient, were agreed yesterday by a strategy group chaired by Mr Ferdinand Lacina, the finance minister. The reform process has acquired urgency in recent months as investor confidence in the Austrian stock market has continued to ebb. The Austrian market has underperformed most leading world markets since early 1990, even though the country's economy has been one of the most buoyant in Europe. Mr Klaus Liebscher, president of the Borse, said yesterday that all his priorities for improving the credibility and liquidity of the capital markets had been accepted. The first step will be an amendment to the Borse Law making insider trading a criminal offence. It is expected to pass parliament in a few weeks and be introduced during the summer. It will also oblige the police to take action if Borse officials report a suspicious case, and will require banks to reveal the identity of account holders if requested by a judge. Mr Liebscher said the Borse would soon introduce a code of behaviour for its own members aimed at preventing insider abuses, including so-called front running, the practice of placing a house order in advance of a client order that is expected to move the price. The Borse would also raise listed companies' disclosure requirements, notably to include interim and ultimately quarterly reports. And it would set minimum levels of shares that companies must make available to the public to maintain their listing. Measures to improve the rights of minority shareholders were being discussed. It hoped to have a fully computerised trading system in place by mid-1994. Then a market-making system, in which brokers' own account and client orders were clearly identified, could be established. The committee agreed to set up a securities industry supervisory body, and will spend the next few months studying experience in other countries.</p>

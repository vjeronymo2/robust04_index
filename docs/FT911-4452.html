			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Boddington About the only good thing to be said for Boddington's bid for Devenish is that it has a certain symmetry to it. Each group wants the other's pubs and neither wants the businesses attached. Boddington proposes to get rid of the Devenish brewery, which probably means closing it. Devenish sounds on the point of making the same decision itself. There may or may not be a case for merger. There seems little reason for Boddington's shareholders to stump up a premium for control. The central difficulty is that one group of pubs is in Manchester and the other is in the West Country. It is hard to see any savings other than through the bulk buying of beer, which scarcely seems enough to recover the premium. The market is meanwhile awash with some 3,500 of the least desirable pubs in the UK, all being sold by the big brewers to comply with government orders. From Boddington's viewpoint, Devenish represents nothing more than a portfolio of more attractive pubs which can be bought with shareholders' money. Since its opening offer of 210p represents less than the pubs are worth, there is no incentive for Devenish's shareholders to accept. If Boddington offers much more, there is no reason for its own shareholders to accept the deal either.</p>

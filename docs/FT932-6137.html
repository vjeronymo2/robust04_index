			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Currencies There are two ways of looking at the tension emerging again inside the ERM. One is that the D-Mark has strengthened in sympathy with the yen, thus aggravating the peseta's weakness ahead of the Spanish elections. If this is the whole story, the tension should pass. An opposition victory might force the peseta out of the system. But the yen seems unlikely to strengthen much further without prompting a corrective interest rate cut by the Bank of Japan. The Tokyo authorities must be concerned that pressure on the export industry is reversing recent stock market gains, wiping out the fragile advance in economic confidence. Once the dollar stabilises against the yen, the D-Mark, too, might fall back again, easing broader worries about the ERM. That overlooks the more sombre aspect behind the D-Mark's movement. Despite the deepening German recession, the Bundesbank remains cautious about cutting rates. Several of its council members pointed yesterday to reservations, for example, about the renewed acceleration of the money supply and the trend in long term interest rates. Their arguments suggest that, far from making alleviation of recession a priority, the Bundesbank may be anxious to ensure the exchange rate remains firm to ward against inflation. Yesterday's poor French unemployment figures are a reminder of how ill-equipped the rest of Europe is to stand the strain. The peseta may yet struggle through, but its exit from the ERM would be harder to shrug off as a little local difficulty against a background of diminishing market expectations of lower German rates. Some of the remaining survivors would quickly come under threat as well.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Management: Learn the lessons of history Unlike their counterparts in politics, the armed forces and the legal profession, many business leaders would agree with Henry Ford that 'history is bunk'. They see little use for it. The loss is theirs - and that of their employees and shareholders. If Kenneth Olsen, founder and former head of Digital Equipment, had had a better grasp of America's 19th century industrial history, his company might not have plunged into the deep trouble in which it is now struggling. The same is true of IBM, Kodak and a string of other leading companies on both sides of the Atlantic that are having to go through fire to replace obsolete technologies. They are suffering from a phenomenon that has plagued successful large enterprises at least since industrialisation began: the tendency to react inappropriately to a technology or other kind of radical innovation that threatens their core business. Some companies fail to notice an innovation until it is too late. Others reject it, re-investing desperately but usually ineffectively in their existing technology or business. Still others embrace it, but only half-heartedly. Whatever their reaction, the net result is what James Utterback, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calls the disturbing regularity with which leading companies 'follow their core technologies into obsolescence and obscurity'. In different ways, Digital and IBM both mishandled the emergence of personal computers, under-rating vastly the impact that PCs would have on their mini and mainframe businesses. Digital then compounded the problem by its schizophrenia towards new Risc (reduced instruction set computing) architecture for computer workstations. It was slow to move into it and, torn by its long commitment to its old VAX technology, continued to make parallel investments in the latter for far too long. As a result it was torn by indecision and turf warfare. By contrast, its smaller arch-rival Sun Microsystems broke single-mindedly with its old workstation technology and prospered. Digital was probably more at fault than most companies. For, as Utterback shows in a fascinating and very readable new historical study* of how companies can seize the initiative in the face of technological change, one of the most instructive past examples occurred in Digital's own Massachusetts backyard. Over the four decades to 1860, the New England ice-cutting industry built a formidable delivery business across large swathes of America. The New Englanders invested steadily in so-called 'incremental' innovation, improving their processes and productivity sharply. But then a threatening 'radical' innovation arrived: mechanical ice-making machines from France, which allowed the product to be made near its markets. Over the next 30 years machine-made ice took over from the natural variety, even though the cutters ploughed more resources than ever into process improvements. But they steadfastly refused to embrace the new. None even experimented with carrying their ice south in refrigerated ships. Utterback's book is full of such examples. They include the self-defeating ways in which companies and their famous leaders - even the redoubtable Thomas Edison - reacted to successive 19th-century innovations; how Remington came to dominate the new typewriter industry only to cede leadership to IBM 80 years later when the electric age arrived; and the near-lethal resistance of Goodyear and Firestone to Michelin's radial tyre technology in the 1970s. Only in what Utterback calls non-assembled products, such as tyres, glass, and other continuous processes, do incumbents such as Michelin have a good track record in either pioneering the new, or switching to it when under threat. Utterback's analysis offers many other lessons for the hard-pressed modern manager. They include: Radical innovation is uncomfortable, but vital. If a company does only short-term, incremental innovation, it is failing to prepare for the future. It is hastening the inevitable decline of its business. Most radical innovations are less surprising than they seem. They exist in embryo for many years before they become commercially significant, and are based on well-known technical information or components - which defending companies sometimes possess themselves. Yet in many industries radical innovations almost always come from outside the industry. So 'benchmarking' and the collection of competitive intelligence should not be limited to industries resembling one's own. Instead, new company activity in other fields should also be monitored. It is hard enough for a company to follow a 'dual strategy' of defending its old technology and developing the new. Doing so in the same part of the organisation is a recipe for conflict and suppression of the new. Part of the solution is to establish a separate and very independent unit. The trouble is that most such units have always suffered an unfortunate fate, which Utterback does not discuss. The moment they have shown signs of success, they have tended to be wrapped back into the main organisation, and their innovative drive stifled rather than spread. IBM might not be in quite such a mess today if, instead of following this predictable pattern, it had given its originally independent PC unit longer life, and cloned the same approach for other innovations. But, like Olsen, IBM's recent leaders never bothered to learn such lessons from history. * Mastering the Dynamics of Innovation. Harvard Business School Press. Dollars 24.95</p>

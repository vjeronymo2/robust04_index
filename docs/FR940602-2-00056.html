			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's complaint against Beverly Hills also alleges that the company falsely represented that the price it advertised far its diet program is the only cost associated with losing weight on the diet program, when, in fact, there are substantial additional mandatory expenses that far exceed the advertised price. The complaint further alleges that Beverly Hills failed to disclose adequately to consumers the existence and amount of all mandatory expenses associated with participation in the diet program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order seeks to address these practices in three ways. First, part I.F. of the proposed order prohibits untrue representations that an advertised price for a weight loss program is the only cost associated with losing weight on that program. Second, for any advertisement containing a price at which any weight loss program can be purchased, the proposed order (part I.G.) requires Beverly Hills to disclose either the existence and amount of all mandatory costs or fees associated with the program offered or a statement identifying a list of all products or services that participants must purchase at an additional cost. This disclosure must be made orally under the proposed order if the price representation is made orally under the proposed order if the free offer is made orally in broadcast media. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the proposed order (part I.I.) requires the proposed respondent to disclose over the telephone to callers who inquire or are told about the cost of any weight loss program, the existence and amount of any mandatory costs or fees associated with participation in the program. Under the order, Beverly Hills can satisfy this requirement by: (1) Providing the center personnel with suggested language to be used when responding to telephone inquiries; and (2) making its best efforts to ensure compliance with its directive to disclose price information over the telephone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fee Offers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's complaint also alleges that, through offers of free weight loss services, Beverly Hills falsely represented that its weight loss programs were being offered to consumers at no cost. The complaint further alleges that the company failed to disclose adequately to consumers that the receipt of free weight loss services is contingent upon the purchase, at substantial expense to the consumer, of other goods or services that are mandatory for participation in the company's weight loss programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed consent order (part I.H.) seeks to address this practice by requiring that the company disclose either (1) the existence and amount of all mandatory fees associated with the free offer, or (2) a list of all products or services that participants must purchase at an additional cost to take advantage of the free offer. This disclosure must be made orally under the proposed order if the free offer is made orally in broadcast media.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order, or to modify in any way their terms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The Goode Committee's suggestion that the government should tailor gilts especially for pension funds prompts the question of what such instruments might look like. Since many pension fund liabilities are subject to limited price indexation - where pensions in payment are increased in line with the retail price index up to a maximum of 5 per cent - a bond offering a return on the same basis would provide a clear match. Rather than paying a cash yield, which pension funds then have to reinvest, index-linked bonds issued at a deep discount to face value would remove another element of risk. Such gilts would please many in the pensions industry. If they offered index linking up to 5 per cent, they could be sold at an even deeper discount than a bond which fully compensates for inflation. That would help pension funds match their liabilities in a particularly productive way. The government's attitude would doubtless turn on cost. But if inflation protection was limited, its debt repayment burden would lessen if prices rose at more than 5 per cent. Gilts linked fully to the RPI provide the Treasury with a particularly harsh discipline. Such innovation would have to be on a modest scale at first, but it could still be useful. Pension funds which are faced with winding up could buy such instruments instead of expensive deferred annuities from insurance companies. More important, the instrument would provide a clear benchmark against which the solvency of all pension funds could be measured.</p>

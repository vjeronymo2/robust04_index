			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Ming-yang (2621 0682 2254): "The Fuzzy </F> Nature of the CPC's Taiwan Policy as Viewed From Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"]    [Text] Following the conclusion of the 14th CPC National  Congress, a leading Hong Kong businessman who is also a member  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, published a full-page advertisement in  the party's organ, lauding Deng Xiaoping and describing him as a  "founder of the `Manifesto of the Communist Party' leading to  the 21st century" and a "great master of communism who carries  forward the cause and forges ahead into the future." After  Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping was  published last October, a RENMIN RIBAO editorial said that "the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics  founded by Deng Xiaoping is a powerful ideological weapon which  guides China to become prosperous and strong and is the  embodiment of Marxism in contemporary China." At the meeting to  mark the centennial of Mao Zedong's birth, Jiang Zemin pointed  out that Deng Xiaoping's theory is the "spiritual pillar and  scientific guide for us to advance triumphantly." All this  shows that the CPC's worship of Deng Xiaoping today has far  exceeded its worship of Mao Zedong in the 1960's.    As Deng Xiaoping's thought is the pillar and guide for all  trades, the CPC's approach to Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao  affairs is no exception. In Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, six essays are related to Taiwan.  1) The main points of Deng's talk with Professor Winston Yang  of Seton Hall University of New Jersey on 26 June 1983, entitled  "Ideas About Peaceful Reunification Between the Chinese Mainland  and Taiwan;" 2) Deng's speech at the third plenary session of  the CPC Central Advisory Commission on 22 October 1984; 3) the  main points of Deng's talk with Burmese President U Shan Yu on  31 October 1984, entitled "The Principle of Peaceful Coexistence  Has Strong Vitality;" 4) Deng's talk while being interviewed by  CBS reporter Michael Wallace for the news program "60 Minutes  Plus" on 2 September 1986; 5) part of Deng's talk with  Gorbachev, general secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, on  16 May 1989, entitled "Terminating the Past, Opening Up the  Future;" and 6) part of Deng's talk with Gwok Hok-nin, a rich  Chinese businessman from Malaysia, on 15 September 1990, and  this item is entitled "Making Joint Efforts To Realize the  Reunification of the Motherland."    Deng Xiaoping's instructions on the Taiwan work include  secret and open instructions. If the instructions are put in  chronological order people may find that the CPC's Taiwan policy  was rather inconsistent and elusive, and this showed the  character of rule of man.    On 1 September 1982, Deng Xiaoping pointed out in the  opening  speech to the 12th CPC National Congress: "Intensively working  for socialist modernization, striving for the reunification of  the whole country, including Taiwan, and opposing hegemonism and  safeguarding world peace are the three major task for the  Chinese people in the 1980's." (Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, p 3) In mid- January 1991, when  listening to reports by Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Wang  Zhaoguo, and Ding Guangan about Taiwan affairs, Deng gave the  following instruction: "In the period of the Eighth Five- Year  Plan (between 1991 and 1995), we should consistently carry out  the three major tasks. The first is to develop the economy; the  second is to persistently maintain stability; and the third is  to solve the Taiwan issue. Although these three items were not  explicitly and completely spelled out in the communique, we  should keep them in mind. None of the three is dispensable." A  casual remark uttered by Deng determined that the major tasks of  the 1980's were extended to the 1990's.    Readers who take notice of current affairs may still  remember  that, when Chiang Kai-shek died in 1975, then-Singapore Prime  Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who rushed to mourn the death of Chiang,  predicted that the Republic of China would last for another five  years only, but three five-year spans have passed, and the  Republic of China is still standing firm and has the world's  second largest foreign exchange reserves.    When foreign politicians or political commentators commented  on China's political situation, they often failed to hit home.  In fact, their erroneous remarks did not matter very much.  However, being the general architect of mainland China's  reform, opening, and modernization, the time validity of Deng  Xiaoping's remarks on resolving the Taiwan issue had to be  changed quite often, and this seemed rather haphazard.    The key to the CPC's Taiwan policy lies in its time  validity.  Not only will the 20 million troops and civilians in Taiwan,  Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu have to worry about this, but the  American, West European, and Japanese corporations will also  have to take it seriously. On 16 May 1989, Deng Xiaoping told  Soviet party and government leader Gorbachev: "In my life, only  one thing has not been solved. That is the Taiwan issue. It  seems that I will not be able to see its settlement." Deng was  85 years that year, and he revealed a sense of helplessness with  his remarks. These might have been words coming from the bottom  of his heart. Being a great man, he should be able to know his  own limitations.    However, six months after that, shortly before Deng  resigned from the chairmanship of the Central Military  Commission, he told the members of the Political Bureau Standing  Committee and the principal responsible officials of the Taiwan  Affairs Office and the United Front Work Department: "The  settlement of the Taiwan issue cannot be delayed indefinitely.  The longer this is delayed, the heavier the burdens will  become! It seems that the Taiwan authorities will never calmly  sit down to talk. We should make dual preparations.  Preparations cannot be made only in one aspect! You should  work out some methods and resolve this issue within five years.  You should not be able to sleep if this issue is not resolved!"  He set forth a five-year time limit, and this was related to  his desire to "live a number of years longer" and to see  reunification with Taiwan.    After the 4 June incident, the CPC maintained that Taiwan  remained the largest anticommunist base and even condemned the  Kuomintang for having its hand in creating "turmoil" in the  mainland. Therefore, the CPC leaders would not be able to set  their minds at rest as long as the Taiwan issue remained  unsettled. They had differences over economic issues, but Deng  Xiaoping, Chen Yun, and Yang Shangkun shared the same opinion on  Taiwan work. They all considered Li Teng-hui the largest  champion of Taiwan independence and maintained that the  separatist forces in Taiwan must not be allowed to succeed and  that preparations should also be made for using force to solve  the problem within three to five years. In Beijing alone, the  cadres engaged in Taiwan work number over 1,000.    The anxiousness to realize reunification also found  expression in Deng Xiaoping's unusual talk with Deng Wen-yi, his  schoolmate of the same age, on 19 May 1990 (after the 4 June  incident, he even refused to meet with Japanese Deputy Prime  Minister Shin Kanemaru and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan  Yew). Deng Wen-yi was the director of the Political Work  Department of the National Defense Ministry of the Nanjing  Government in 1949 when the Communist troops fought across the  Chang Jiang, and he was also a senior intelligence officer in  the Kuomintang regime. He lost power in his later years, but he  was not willing to live in silence. At the invitation of Hou  Jingru, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, he returned to the mainland to visit  his old friends and relatives. In Taiwan, he was denounced by  the Democratic Progressive Party as an "old thief." In the  mainland, he was treated as an honorable guest of the  government. The purpose of his mainland visit was to recover  two houses in Nanjing. Deng Xiaoping took this opportunity to  brainwash him and said: "Both of us share the same surname, and  we are also old friends. We can discuss anything except Taiwan  independence. The CPC and the Kuomintang cooperated very well  on two occasions in the past, and we can carry out the third  round of cooperation. In the future, Taiwan and the mainland  must be reunified. This may take another two or three years.  At most, reunification will be effected within three years."    Deng Xiaoping also told Deng Wen-yi: "We are all people from  the same family. There should be no war between us, as war is  unfavorable to both sides. We may discuss this more seriously."  However, on 10 October of the same year, after watching the  video tape about Taipei's celebrations of the "Double 10  Festival," Deng Xiaoping told Yang Shangkun and Ding Guangen:  "They are still putting on grand airs! Li Teng-hui's words are  unreliable. They use three hands to deal with us overtly and  covertly. On one hand, they talk big and utter high-sounding  words; on the other, they secretly support the Democratic  Progress Party which seeks Taiwan independence and continue to  carry out subversive activities against the mainland. Although  we have already talked too much, they still refuse to accept any  of our proposals and advice and even regard us as being weak and  timid!" Then there was the airborne troops' 12 October combat  exercise on an island with jungles, beaches, and marshlands.  This was a rehearsal for the attack on Taiwan.    On 1 July 1991, Deng Xiaoping told Jiang Zemin and other  leaders that the Doctors had told him that he would continue to  be healthy for another eight to 10 years, so it was not as  urgent to use force against Taiwan. He said: "In the 1980's,  we planned the first step for realizing reunification. Young  Chiang died too early, so we did not act in time. Can we now  make a breakthrough in a period of more than eight years?" He  added: "If China is not reunified, the people of our generation  will not be able to close their eyes when they die, and they  have no face when they see Marx. We hope to use peaceful means  and solve the issue through negotiations, but we should also  consider other methods at the same time!"    In August of the same year, Deng Xiaoping circled his name  to  endorse the Taiwan work program drafted by the State Council's  Taiwan Affairs Office for the remaining years of this century.  The program fixed the deadline for settling the Taiwan issue  around the turn of century.    In January 1991, Deng Xiaoping said: "Li Teng-hui is a  person full of ideas. You should first study him in order to  discover the right method for dealing with him." Deng Xiaoping  maintained that Li Teng-hui's statements about one China were  unreliable. In actual practice, however, the CPC never took Li  Teng-hui lightly. For example, Wang Daohang, chairman of the  mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits,  told Huang Chao-sung, editor- in-chief of Taiwan's LIEN HO PAO  on 14 December 1993: "When formulating the Taiwan policy and  handling the work related to Taiwan, we took Mr Li Teng-hui as  our principal counterpart, because he represents Taiwan's ruling  authorities."    To sum up, people may find that the CPC's Taiwan policy has  always been characterized by the "rule of man" -- it changes  according to the mood and health of an old man of 90 years. In  mainland China, where the one-party dictatorship is still in  force, policies outweigh laws. Policies are the administrative  guidelines for the state and the party. If the policies are  inconsistent and elusive, however, they will not be effective.  The cadres responsible for Taiwan affairs at all levels will  not know what course to take, nor will the enemies on the other  side of the straits fear various bluffs and blusters.</p>

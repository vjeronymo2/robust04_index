			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Pressure on government to accept pension law reform plan The government will come under pressure today from the Commons social security committee to accept reforms of occupational pension law drawn up in the wake of the Maxwell scandal. The cross-party committee's report, published today, supports many of the main recommendations of the Goode committee on pensions regulation which ministers had hoped to water down. Conservatives on the committee - in order to avoid the report being divided along partisan lines - have accepted the key Goode recommendation that at least a third of all scheme trustees be appointed by scheme members. Ministers fear that if the proposal was implemented it could undermine occupational pensions because management might question the value of such schemes which did not have absolute control of the trustees. Although the government, which is to publish its white paper later this summer, favours a code of 'best practice', it will find it difficult not to accept all of the committee's proposals. The committee also supports Goode's recommendation that employers wishing to reinvestcash from the schemes should first obtain permission from the pensions regulator, even if their trust rules specifically permit them to do so. However, it argues that the government should alter the tax regime to eradicate what is widely perceived to be a punitive tax for failing to remove cash from schemes which are in surplus. It wants to scale down significantly the tax penalties levied on employers with large cash surpluses and calls for more equitable treatment for 'early leavers' who can lose out on their final pension schemes because they have moved job. The committee wants employers to use more generous means of calculating the value of the final pension of those who change jobs before retirement. This would help frequent job leavers to earn a pension equal in value to that of a worker who stays with a single employer. Professor Roy Goode identified the treatment of early leavers as the single most divisive question considered by his committee. The committee backs the need for a government appointed pensions regulator and a pensions compensation scheme for fraud and suggests that it should also cover losses on schemes. Mr Jeremy Corbyn and Mr Jimmy Wray, two Labour members, voted against some of the committee's recommendations but pulled back from issuing a minority report after it backed most of Goode's proposals.</p>

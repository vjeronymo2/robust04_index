			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Aid for exporters to be increased AID FOR exporters under Britain's Aid and Trade Provision is to be increased this year, targeted mainly at China and Indonesia, the government said yesterday after a year-long review of the future of ATP, David Dodwell writes. The ATP budget for 1993-94 will rise by more than 6 per cent from Pounds 110m to Pounds 117m, mainly as a result of unspent funds available for last year being carried forward. The decision to target China and Indonesia follows criticism that the impact of the ATP budget had been blunted in the past because it had been spread too thinly across projects in the developing world. An official said yesterday: 'These are major growth markets where the best opportunities arise for British companies to win subsequent business on non-aided terms.' Other eligible countries - that is creditworthy countries with annual income per head of less than Dollars 700 (Pounds 466.60) - are India, Ghana, Lesotho, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.</p>

One commenter suggested expanding the 30-day period because of the difficulty of preparing and submitting such information to make the application more competitive within the 30-day time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the data requested would not be intended to improve the competitive position of the application, but rather to support the previously provided information, it was determined that increasing the 30 days would not be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Changes Made By This Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Imminent Threat Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 953.403, Availability of Funds, has been revised to allow the Office of Native American Programs to retain up to five percent of the funds made available by this part at the national level. The NOFA will specify the amount of Imminent Threat funds to be retained during each funding cycle. This change is intended to insure the availability of imminent threat funding throughout the fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 953.505&blank;Program Income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program income language in &sect;570.504, previously incorporated by reference, has been reproduced in &sect;953.505 of these regulations. This will hopefully make the ICDBG Regulation more user friendly by placing all program income requirements in one location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 953.606&blank;Conflict of Interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 953.606 (e) has been modified to provide for a public disclosure of the nature of the assistance to be provided and the basis of the selection of persons to be assisted for housing rehabilitation or new housing. Evidence of the disclosure must be submitted with the application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Justification for Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has decided to issue another interim rule to address the comments received on the April 7, 1992 interim rule and to allow the public to see how the rule works in conjunction with the latest Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA). This interim rule will enable Indian tribes and Alaskan native villages to meet with representatives of the HUD Office of Native American Programs (ONAP) field offices to make suggestions for modification of the regulation before it is issued in final form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has adopted a policy of setting a date for expiration of an interim rule unless a final rule is published before that date. This ``sunset'' provision appears in &sect;953.1 of the interim rule and provides that the rule will expire on a date 18 months from the date of publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50, which implement Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this interim rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The interim rule establishes criteria for funding eligible recipients among Indian Tribes/Villages and has no impact on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Semiannual Agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule was listed as Item No. 1690 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20470) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612, Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federalism, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that the policies contained in this interim rule would not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the interim rule is not subject to review under the Order. While the interim rule has some direct effects on States and political subdivisions, those effects are limited to direct implementation of instructions contained in statutes governing the grant program. Given the lack of discretion in the Department to refrain from implementing these statutory instructions, further analysis of federalism concerns would serve no useful purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12606, The Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Family, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has determined that this interim rule would not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.223.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 953  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alaska, Community development block grants, Grant programs_housing and community development, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, and under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 3535(d), title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part 571_[Removed] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

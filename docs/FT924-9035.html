			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK conglomerates It is tempting to see Hanson's withdrawal from the contest for RHM as a sign that times are truly difficult for conglomerates. All the more so since the market evidently has reservations about the wisdom of Tomkins staying the course. Less clear is how much this is simply a function of recession. In these straitened times, predators cannot easily use their own paper to pay for acquisitions. Nor can they readily dispose of the parts of any purchase they do not want. Few targets are going cheap. That may explain why an inactive Williams has underperformed the market so far this year by 8 per cent, while Tomkins is trying to convince investors it makes sense for it to be in food. It might have done better to desist. Until it bid for RHM its shares had outperformed the market by about 20 per cent this year. Now the premium is down to 3. At least Hanson has kept its firepower intact. One has to assume that when the cycle turns there will be less talk of organic growth and negotiated strategic acquisitions. That said, the best of the recovery may accrue to smaller conglomerates which can still add substantial value with every deal. Hanson may be condemned to lasting sobriety. It has outperformed the market by 7 per cent this year against 17 for BTR, the other conglomerate giant. BTR has Hawker Siddeley under its belt, but doubtless the market is also looking at the two companies' spread of businesses and how they are managed.</p>

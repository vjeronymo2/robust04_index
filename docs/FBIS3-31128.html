			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Security Bureau Chief Jerzy </F> Milewski by Piotr Swiac, of the "Directly From the Belweder"  program; place and date not given--recorded]    [Text] [Swiac] Mr. Minister, you have initiated a program  of changes within the supreme state institutions in the area of  defense and security. Do you not think that we should put this  very important issue on hold until a new constitution is enacted?    [Milewski] No, I do not think so because the lack of  statutory and constitutional provisions in this area is quite  troublesome--I would even say it is dangerous--for the country's  defense system and its security. This should--and can--be  remedied as soon as possible so as not to leave the issue  hanging in the air until the new constitution is enacted.    What is this all about? The goal is to achieve a certain  coordination in the functioning of various state executive  organs in this area, and also to make their mutual measures  coherent with one another, and to make them unanimous. We are  aware that the president of the Polish Republic is the supreme  state organ in these issues; in accordance with Article 34 of  the Small Constitution he exercises general leadership in the  area of the country's internal and external security. But it is  not defined anywhere in what way he is supposed to exercise the  aforementioned leadership.    In addition to that, the Law on the Popular Defense  Obligation continues to include the definition of a National  Defense Committee [KOK], which is a legacy from the previous  [presumably communist] period. The Law says that KOK is the  appropriate organ in issues of defense and security, and it is  supposed to function in consultation with the Council of  Ministers, but it is not known how that is supposed to come  about in practice, nor is it known what KOK is supposed to be  dealing with. Apart from that, the Small Constitution also  provides a definition of a National Security Council [RBN] as  the president's advisory organ in areas of defense and security,  but it is not defined anywhere what the relationship is supposed  to be between RBN and KOK, nor is it defined generally speaking  what the relationship is supposed to be between the organs I  just mentioned and the Council of Ministers.    [Swiac] But are you not afraid of disturbing a certain  balance existing among the different authority components?    [Milewski] There is no such balance right now, and so one  must simply achieve it, and that was the idea behind the  proposal, which by the way was submitted jointly by the defense  minister and the National Security Bureau [BBN] during the most  recent KOK session. Let me remind you that KOK's composition  includes the prime minister, four ministers--defense, internal  affairs, foreign, and finance--as well as the chief of the  General Staff, Sejm and Senate speakers, the minister of state  from the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland, the  president as the group's chairman, and myself as secretary. Now,  the proposal was debated by the group of people I just  described, and it was approved. The goal for us is to move for  an amendment to the Small Constitution which would go in the  direction of granting executive powers--and not just advisory  ones--to RBN which will replace KOK which had existed up to now;  KOK will be dissolved through appropriate amendments to the Law  on the Popular Defense Obligation. We suggested the  establishment of a permanent, interministry working group under  the leadership of the defense minister who will be dealing with  preparing all materials and issues discussed both by the Council  of Ministers' Defense Issues Committee and by RBN.    Right now, there are different ad hoc committees within the  government and in its close environment; there are also  anticrisis committees and committees dealing with specific  topics. Such committees are established, nobody knows how they  function or when they are supposed to cease to function. By  contrast, we would have [under the proposal] a permanent group  established, with which, by the way, BBN would cooperate on a  regular basis.    [Swiac] In your view, do these planned changes not conflict  with the Partnership for Peace program which is based on the  assumption of a democratic and civilian supervision over the  Army?    [Milewski] The changes that we are proposing include a  division of powers between a civilian defense minister and a  chief of the General Staff who would be a military--he is the  highest-ranking military in the Polish Republic. That division  of powers does not exist right now since the Law on the Popular  Defense Obligation which is currently in force, continues to be  adapted to the old situation when the defense minister was at  the same time the highest-ranking officer of the Polish Army  since he was an active general or admiral. So we proposed these  changes to have them implemented at the same time as dealing  with issues of higher importance. The appropriate drafts of  amendments were prepared and submitted to the Office of the  Council of Ministers so that the Council of Ministers may debate  them, and so that they may be later introduced in parliament on  the government's motion, not on the president's. Such a decision  was made at the most recent KOK session.</p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPHEAVAL IN THE SOVIET BLOC;  </P> <P> SOVIET-CZECH TALKS ON TROOP CUTS WORRY WEST;  </P> <P> MILITARY: THE U.S. MAY BE PRESSURED TO PULL THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN SOLDIERS OUT  OF EUROPE.  </P> <P> The Czechoslovaks and the Soviet Union began sensitive military negotiations  here Monday that could generate powerful -- and to, some Western strategists,  unwelcome -- political pressure on the United States to pull tens of thousands  of its troops out of Europe.  </P> <P> More than 20 Czechoslovak and Soviet diplomatic, military and economic  officials met at Czernin Palace to discuss the new Prague government's demand  that the approximately 75,000 Soviet troops garrisoned here be withdrawn by the  end of the year.  </P> <P> Czechoslovak officials insist that the issue has nothing to do with the  superpower talks in Vienna on reducing the levels of Warsaw Pact and North  Atlantic Treaty Organization forces in Europe. But a Western diplomatic source  here said that if the Soviets comply with the Czechoslovak demand, "there will  be tremendous pressure on us to start pulling out, too, and I'm not sure that's  a good idea, strategically."  </P> <P> The United States, with about 325,000 troops in West Germany, has the largest  contingent of foreign troops among the NATO countries in Europe, but Canada and  Britain also have a significant military presence on the Continent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Go-Slow Approach  </P> <P> NATO favors a more measured reduction of troops along the line that has  separated East and West in Europe since the end of World War II. It would  prefer to spread withdrawals out over a two- or three-year period to preserve a  degree of stability in the fast-changing political climate.  </P> <P> While the Soviets have not commented publicly on the Czechoslovak demand, they,  too, are believed to favor a phased withdrawal.  </P> <P> Soviet troops entered Czechoslovakia on Aug. 21, 1968, at the head of a Warsaw  Pact invasion force that put an end to the Prague Spring reforms of Communist  Party chief Alexander Dubcek. Their stay was legalized Oct. 16, 1968, by  agreement between the two governments.  </P> <P> The new Czechoslovak government, installed after last year's "velvet  revolution," proposed Dec. 3 that talks begin on a withdrawal of the Soviet  forces. The next day, Warsaw Pact leaders meeting in Moscow condemned the 1968  invasion, adding moral weight to Prague's contention that the October, 1968,  agreement was obtained by coercion and is therefore void.  </P> <P> The Soviets, in the course of a Dec. 20 visit to Moscow by the Czechoslovak  foreign minister, Jiri Dienstbier, agreed to discussions on the subject. And  last week, in what was interpreted here as an opening shot in the talks, a  Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Prague wants the troops out by the end of  this year.  </P> <P> Earlier, Hungarian officials called for the withdrawal of Soviet forces from  that country by the end of 1990, but the talks that opened here Monday are  believed to be the first formal negotiations on the subject between Moscow and  one of its Warsaw Pact allies.  </P> <P> "It's a very responsible but not easy job," Deputy Foreign Minister Evzen Vacek  told an interviewer, commenting on his role as head of the Czechoslovak  delegation to the talks. "I do hope it will be easier than I think."  </P> <P> Other Czechoslovak sources said Prague wants Moscow to pull out up to half of  its troops this spring and to commit itself to withdrawing the rest by the end  of the year.  </P> <P> Early withdrawal would presumably be a major plus for candidates endorsed by  the Civic Forum movement in national elections scheduled for June 8. Civic  Forum, while ruling in coalition with the Communists, has clearly been setting  the political agenda here since early last month.  </P> <P> Dienstbier was Civic Forum's spokesman before he was named foreign minister;  Vaclav Havel, who became Czechoslovakia's president on Dec. 29, was the  movement's leader.  </P> <P> Removal of the Soviet garrison is clearly a popular issue. About 6,000 people  demonstrated Sunday near the central Moravian town of Olomouc, where one of the  largest Soviet contingents is garrisoned, calling for complete withdrawal by  Aug. 21, the 22nd anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion.  </P> <P> Residents told a Western reporter who visited the town over the weekend that  they want about 600 apartments that are reserved for Soviets made available to  Czechoslovaks. They also complained about a nearby military airfield.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minimize Friction  </P> <P> The Soviet troops are reportedly kept close to their barracks in an effort to  minimize the possibility of friction with the Czechoslovaks. But in the center  of Olomouc, they have a fenced compound that includes barracks, a hospital,  stores and a school.  </P> <P> The Kremlin withdrew a tank division from Czechoslovakia last year as part of a  unilateral reduction involving about 50,000 troops from East Europe. It is  expected to withdraw the equivalent of another division this year, according to  diplomatic sources.  </P> <P> The negotiations here are expected to continue today and possibly Wednesday.  Czechoslovak officials said they hope the issue will be resolved at these  meetings, but Western diplomats are skeptical.  </P> <P> The complexity of the talks was underlined by the presence, on both sides, of  Finance and Interior ministry representatives.  </P></p>

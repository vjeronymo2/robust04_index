			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Blueprint for local government Sir, Contrary to the assertion in your leader, 'Local difficulties' (December 22), the Local Government Commission has recommended many of the structures that your leader supports. Thus, you argue for the retention in 'much of England outside the conurbations' of the two-tier system. We have recognised this in many of the largely rural areas of the counties we have reviewed so far. You also support the principle of single unitary authorities for the larger cities. So does the commission, provided the wider strategic issues concerned continue to be seen within a framework of a structure plan which encompasses the wider surrounding area, which is the case both in Middlesbrough and Bristol. The commission does indeed undertake systematic and objective opinion research, to help determine local feelings of communities, and to help gauge reaction to its draft recommendations. It has also received many thousands of other representations. We are obliged by our guidance from the secretary of state to 'take into account people's expressed preferences'. This we have done. There is no national blueprint. Clearly it is not possible in a review of this kind to please everyone. In particular, there is a need on the part of all those concerned to think ahead and to determine a structure which will ensure that local government in the future meets the needs of the community in such a way that many of the functions now undertaken by quangos may instead become the responsibility of local authorities with clear accountability for the way they carry them out. Martin Eastel, chief executive, Local Government Commission for England, Dolphyn Court, 10/11 Great Turnstile, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC1V 7JU</p>

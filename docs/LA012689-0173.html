These groups, the statement said, have  been difficult to reach because of language and cultural barriers.  </P> <P> Guest speaker at the event, co-hosted by the city and Voces Unidas, a Latino  organization, will be John E. Reeder Jr., a representative of the U.S.  Department of Commerce. The presentation will be at 1 p.m. at the Corbin  Community Center, 2215 W.

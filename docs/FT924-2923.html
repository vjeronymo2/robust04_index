			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Letter: Wider relevance of coup defeat in Venezuela Sir, I could not agree more fully with your leader ('Perilous moment', December 7) on Venezuela and Peru. The defeat last week of the second attempted military coup in Venezuela in less than 12 months should be looked at as a sign of strengthening the democratic basis of government in the country, and the administration of President Carlos Andre Perez should be congratulated on insisting that elections for state governorships and over 5,000 other posts at local level be held as scheduled on December 6. This is of particular significance to the rest of Latin America where the spectre of authoritarianism may be raising its ugly head once again. The opposition party, Copei, as expected won the majority of the state governorships, but the important point is that the country has probably entered into a new level of political maturity under which change is undertaken through the ballot box and not by the men in uniform. The current government of Venezuela faces serious political and economic problems in the coming months which will lead to further political uncertainty, as any other government has to tackle during its period in office. However, it should be obvious that a military solution is not one of the answers. It is encouraging that in other parts of the region a similar type of experience is happening with the impeachment process of President Collor under way in Brazil and elections being forced on President Fujimori in Peru to reinstate Congress. The region faces grave problems and difficult political and economic decisions ahead, but it should be clear to the military from recent events that the toppling of a democratically elected government only serves to complicate matters and obstruct development.

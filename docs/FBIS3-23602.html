He is criticized  for anything and everything. For example, for allegedly  surrounding himself in two years as head of the military  department with people knowing less than little about the army  and its problems. And distancing himself from the army,  stretching relations with real military professionals to the  breaking point. The accusation is extremely serious; if of  course it isn't unsubstantiated. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA received brief  dossiers from sources in the Ministry of Defense on  "confidential advisors" within Pavel Grachev's inner circle.    VALERIY LAPSHOV. The number one man in Pavel Grachev's  circle  is what Lieutenant-General Valeriy Lapshov, director of his  administration, is called. Prior to 1991 45-year-old Valeriy  Mikhaylovich Lapshov was an unpromising senior operations  officer in the Second Directorate of the General Staff's GOU  (Main Operational Directorate), without any ambitions for the  future. This is what he was, and most probably this is what he  would have remained, had he not had the luck to study earlier in  the Academy of the General Staff [AGSh] together with Pavel  Grachev. Soon after the August coup, Grachev, who was then still  the first deputy to Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov in the Union Defense  Ministry, assumed his first command. For practical purposes  Colonel Lapshov became a Major-General right away, in November  of the same year, and two years later he was promoted to  Lieutenant-General. (According to available information the  question of promoting Lapshov to Colonel-General was also  raised. However, Colonel-General Valeriy Mironov, Pavel  Grachev's deputy, who handled personnel issues at that time,  stated his categorical opposition. Such a high rank did not  correspond to the position occupied by Lapshov.)    According to friends an unusually gregarious, communicative  person and a fabulous organizer of parties, Lapshov could not  but be a soul mate to Pavel Grachev, no less gregarious than the  former.    As director of the Minister's Administration, Lapshov  possesses extremely significant power. Practically all documents  requiring the minister's attention go through his hands. It's  his decision whether they end up on Grachev's desk or get tossed  into the waste basket. Access to the Minister is also through  Lapshov.    DMITRIY KHARCHENKO. After graduating from the Academy of the  General Staff, Major-General Kharchenko was appointed commander  of a division. But the division commander's career was not a  long one. He was unexpectedly appointed to the position of Chief  of the General Staff's International Treaty Directorate. He had  never been a lawyer or a diplomat, but like Lapshov he studied  together with Grachev. To add to this, he was lucky enough to  establish family ties with the General of the Army: This summer  his daughter married one of the Minister's sons.    Recently, the quickly advancing Lieutenant-General  Kharchenko  was appointed deputy chief of the General Staff. Even though he  had no right to such an appointment on the basis of his  position--chief of an ordinary directorate. (The directors of  key main directorates, such as the Main Operational Directorate,  the Main Organizational and Mobilizational Directorate, the Main  Intelligence Directorate could have been deputy chiefs of the  General Staff). But of course it's easy to correct this  shortcoming: There are plans for raising the directorate headed  by Kharchenko to the status of a main directorate, and to  promote him to Colonel-General.    GENADIY IVANOV. Not long ago the chief of the Directorate of  Military Development and Reforms, Lieutenant-General Genadiy  Ivanov was a group leader in the Center for Operational and  Strategic Research--a body that has now been eliminated in view  of its absolute uselessness. From there, he was sent for  training to the AGSh, where he became acquainted with Pavel  Grachev and Valeriy Lapshov. After graduating from the academy  he remained there as an instructor. But not for long: Genadiy  Ivanov rode the crest of the wave of the "August Victory" into  the Russian president's administration and concurrently into the  Defense Ministry's administration. After that, Ivanov  transferred permanently to the Ministry of Defense, where he  hammered together an army reform group in the fastest possible  time. Then just as quickly he "grew" the group into the  Directorate of Military Development and Reform. All matters  associated with the army's reform are under his exclusive  control. It is through him, and not through the "brains" from  the General Staff, as was done before, that all necessary  decisions of the minister pass.    SERGEY ZDORIKOV. Major General Zdorikov studied together  with  Grachev, and he was recently appointed to the position of chief  of the Directorate for Work With Personnel. He is a regular  political worker who graduated from the Political Academy. While  studying in the AGSh he proved himself to be an extremely  undisciplined student. He rarely attended classes, as a result  of which he was in perpetual friction with the group leader,  Grachev. Now the relations between the "leader" and Zdorikov  have normalized.    VLADIMIR NIKITIN. Major General Nikitin, chief of the  Affairs  Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, is within the leadership  of the military department, and a very mysterious figure.  Ill-wishers have this to say about him: "Nikitin? Oh, before he  was promoted to general he never commanded a troop grouping any  larger than two typists!" A lawyer by education, Vladimir  Nikolayevich Nikitin came to the Main Personnel Directorate as a  civilian employee. And it was there that he became a lieutenant,  upon joining military service voluntarily. After this he was  transferred from the Main Personnel Directorate to, of all  things, the Main Intelligence Directorate. He served there to  the rank of captain, and once again returned to the Main  Personnel Directorate, where he was promoted to major. Then the  August coup occurred. Nikitin spent the "three black days" in  the White House, from which he moved to a position in the State  Legal Administration under the RF president. From there,  traveling the road from major to major general in a single year  (!)--Nikitin received his general's rank by an edict from USSR  President Gorbachev. He returned once again to the Ministry of  Defense, where he assumed his former position--chief of the  Affairs Directorate; a position which, in view of its unique  features, could be occupied only by a person known to be  "especially trustworthy."    YELENA AGAPOVA and VLADIMIR KOSAREV. Ministry press  secretary  Yelena Agapova and chief of the Directorate of Information and  the Press Major General Vladimir Kosarev finish off the list of  closest advisors.    Before joining the Ministry of Defense Yelena Aleksandrovna  Agapova worked around 30 years with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, where she  climbed the career ladder from editorial messenger to assistant  editor-in-chief. An accident decided her fate in the Ministry of  Defense. It was March 1993, deputies of the RF Supreme Soviet  invited Grachev to attend a hearing, where the defense minister  was to give a report on the status of the Russian Armed Forces.  As the appointed day came closer, Grachev became increasingly  gloomier: The report, which had been drafted by military  specialists and which contained a mass of "sticky issues," could  create an undesirable impression. It was then that Yelena  Aleksandrovna came to the rescue. Literally in one night she  managed to tailor the "explosive" text in such a way that by  morning the General of the Army not only survived but even  earned the applause of the deputies. Having become confident in  the abilities of his press secretary, Grachev elevated her to  the rank of an advisor to the ministry and instructed her to  form her own staff, for which 12 officers slots were foreseen.  After completing this task as well, Agapova petitioned to  establish a new subdivision under the Ministry--the Directorate  of Information and the Press. Vladimir Kosarev, also an  assistant editor-in-chief of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, became its chief.  What we know about Vladimir Grigoryevich is that he had no  military education at all, and that prior to August 1991 he  worked with KRASNAYA ZVEZDA as deputy director of the propaganda  division. After the coup he wound up in the president's  administration, from which he returned to a higher position with  the same newspaper.    In the ministry, Vladimir Kosarev is "Agapova's man": He  does  not resolve a single issue of even the slightest importance  without her knowledge and consent -- even selecting information  coming together in his directorate and the means of its  transmission to the minister.    Such is the appearance of General of the Army Pavel  Grachev's  "first ring of defense." The editor's office feels evaluation of  its reliability to be a matter for military specialists.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yinchuan, May 10 (XINHUA) -- China has brought 1.7  million ha [hectares] of its deserts under control through  various afforestation efforts over the past two years, a senior  forestry official said here today.    Zhu Guangyao, deputy minister of forestry, told a national  desert survey and monitoring conference that the efforts include  planting 1.6 million ha of trees, desert-control extension  projects in 20 counties and nine experimental zones.    Desertification is one of the world's ten major  environmental  issues, while China is one of the countries where desert  encroachment is a serious problem, he said. Some 15.9 percent  of the total land area, or 1.53 million sq [square] km are under  serious threat of desertification.    Zhu said 371,000 sq km of such land causes 4.5 billion yuan  (about 520 million U.S. dollars) in direct economic losses  annually to local people.    To change this situation, the State Council, China's highest  governing body, for the first time listed desert control as one  of the major environmental control efforts in the ten-year  program for national economic and social development in 1991.    To carry out the program, the State Council has called two  national desertification conferences and ratified ten-year  desert control projects and enacted some preferential policies  to this end.    At present, some 600 development projects are being carried  out in the desert areas in China so as to make the best use of  desert resources for economic development.    Despite these efforts, however, Zhu Guangyao warned that  desertification is still a challenge for China, and  environmental deterioration in desert areas remains a chronic  problem.    Estimates show that China's desert area will grow at a rate  of 1.33 percent annually if effective measures are not taken in  the upcoming ten years. This means that China would have  another 2300 sq km of desert every year, the equivalent of a  medium-sized Chinese county.    Moreover, regional desertification looms large in some  grassland, hilly and dry areas in Hebei Province, and the Inner  Mongolia and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions, where  desertification is growing at a rate of five percent a year.    Hulun Buir League, a grassland area in Inner Mongolia, is  being threatened by four growing desert zones and serious dune  flows. The large-scale exploitation of coal, oil and gas  resources in the northwest will put new pressure on the region's  fragile ecological environment, he noted.    Viewing the reasons for China's desertification, experts  said  it is partly the result of global warming, escalating drought  and weak environmental protection in some areas in face of  booming economic development.</p>

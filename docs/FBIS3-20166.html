			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bjarne Stenquist report: "af Ugglas Warned EU Countries"] </F>   [Text] Ioannina -- On Sunday [27 March] the Swedish  Government conveyed to the EU's [European Union] twelve foreign  ministers its "concern and dismay" over the fact that the EU has  still not been able to resolve its internal conflict over voting  which is slowing down Swedish membership of the EU.    This happened when Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas  participated in the final session of the EU foreign minsters'  meeting in Ioannina in northern Greece.    "I also warned that if they cannot reach agreement before  Easter this could do serious damage to our efforts to win  support for the European idea among the general public in  Sweden," af Ugglas told DAGENS NYHETER.    The same message was delivered jointly by the four foreign  ministers from Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria in  individual conversations with British Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd and Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana.    "There was no real drama; we sat Hurd and Solana in the  corner of a sofa and said that we were all concerned about what  is happening," Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal told  DAGENS NYHETER.    "Britain will have to carry a heavy responsibility if the  candidate countries' membership is pushed forward in time,"  Finnish Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto told Finnish  journalists.    But the most strident phrases from the four candidate  countries came from Margaretha af Ugglas who is, however, now  hopeful about a solution.    "But if it proves possible to reach agreement on Tuesday or  Wednesday, we can move forward with the preparations for the  referendums as we have planned. And then the uncertainty of the  past month will largely be a closed episode.    ``Everything else is an impossibility, seen from our  viewpoint. If the matter cannot be resolved now, but is put off  instead, this will have an effect on all our planning and could  in the final analysis also lead to our having to change the date  of the referendum,'' the foreign minister said.    "But my impression is that, it will be possible to finally  resolve this matter on Tuesday," Margaretha af Ugglas said.    "The warnings from the candidate countries made a strong  impression on me," Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes told  DAGENS NYHETER.    "It is definitely the case that this matter has led to a  situation in which the European Union is beginning to lose  credibility," Claes added.    "I have just had a meeting with the foreign ministers of  Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria and they are becoming more  concerned and dismayed the longer the time that passes without  an agreement. This is yet another aspect that we have to think  about," Douglas Hurd said in an interview with BBC Radio.</p>

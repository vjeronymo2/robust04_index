Karim: "Following FIS Representatives' </F> Statements Halting Violence, `Armed Islamic Group' Announces It  Is Decision Maker"]    [Text] Yesterday's faxed statement by the Armed Islamic  Group (GIA) presented the group's stand on dialogue in a way  that contradicted the view that Rabah Kebir and Anwar Haddam  presented last week. The GIA thus is trying to register its  presence forcefully in preparation for the next phase.    Regarding negotiations with the government, the GIA said  that  "the mujahidin are those who make the decisions; no one may  speak as a mujahid or in their name except the GIA--certainly  not those who live overseas."  <H5>  Kebir, Haddam Seek To Go It Alone, Obtain Prominence </H5>   The group, which in the past has announced that it does not  belong to the FIS, added a warning about how "media glitter and  the temptation of enticing positions is causing some groups to  forget our mutual promise to unite the ranks of mujahidin in a  unified organization. A clique has appeared, alleging that it  speaks for the mujahidin, in order to participate in talks and  negotiations with the regime in the manner of the FIS leaders at  home and abroad."    Externally, the GIA's statement goes on to confirm the  existence of talks with the government--what it terms  "maneuvers"--saying that it had warned against them, but that  they have now become a tangible reality through positions taken  in various places to stop the "jihad" and embark on dialogue  with the regime. The GIA, which is led by Djaafar Seifalla  [God's Sword] (called "El Afghani"), was alluding to Rabah  Kebir's statement linking continued talks by the FIS to the  extent of Liamine Zeroual's acceptance of the five conditions  that Ali Benhadj has demanded, as well as to the statement  against violence that a delegation of FIS representatives made  overseas through Anwar Haddam. In the latter statement, Haddam  came out demanding a halt to acts of violence against Algerians  (civilians and military personnel) and foreigners who did not  become involved in security operations. The GIA thinks that  "these men and others are trying to go it alone and obtain  prominence at the expense of true Islam."  <H5>  Makhloufi an Intelligence Agent, Traitor </H5>   On a related matter, the statement mentions what it calls  "internal maneuvers" that it said coincided with a number of  maneuvers that Said Makhloufi engineered to split the ranks of  the mujahidin from within. Among these was the discovery of  elements that the latter had planted in mujahidin ranks. The  statement added that 70 of these infiltrated elements had been  executed and that the others' turn would come--especially that  of their leader.    The statement opens fire on Said Makhloufi, whom it accuses  of treason and threatens with execution. This seems to explain  the disputes between the Armed Islamic Group (GIA), which is  said to consist mostly of participants in the Afghan war, and  the Armed Islamic Movement (MIA), which, according to circulated  reports, has turned into the FIS' army. Said Makhloufi and  Abdelkader Chebouti head the latter.  <H5>  No Presence for FIS and Its Army </H5>   In an earlier statement, the GIA said that it is not the  FIS'  military wing, but an independent group. The same statement,  issued about two and one-half months ago after the tape by Said  Makhloufi and the statement by Abdelrezak Redjam, contained  threats against Makhloufi's group and the "big butcher's  friends," [as published] whom it described as "opportunistic  groups whom everyone knows got on the train when it was about to  pull into its destination." Yesterday's statement, however, did  not allude to "the big butcher's friends"; it merely described  Kebir and Haddam, who are close to this current, as "those who  are seeking to go it alone and become prominent." Also, the GIA  did not include in its last statement its stress on continuing  the "jihad," nor did the statement include the words, "No  dialogue, no compromise, no negotiating, no discussion, no  handing of power to a neutral government or transition  government, and no half-solutions"--words that occurred in the  previous statement.    The authors of the latest statement preferred not to use  these words. The group's concern may be to record its presence  during this period so that it is not overlooked in any proposed  solutions to stop the violence. In this context, it has adopted  the method of intensified media activity. Speaking in an  interview with AL-WASAT magazine before the date of the national  convention, one of Djaafar El Afghani's assistants--he said he  was head of the political and legal committee--tried to claim  responsibility for all the assassinations reported throughout  Algeria. He said that although the GIA was founded in 1989, its  military activity began on 18 December 1991. He added that most  of its members were Algerians who had been in Afghanistan.    Speaking for Djaafar El Afghani about assassinations of  foreigners, the speaker declared: "We have attacked foreign  Jews, Christians, and pagans, because they are part of the  imperialist plot. They represent the vital artery and the heart  of every occupation, whether external or internal." He added:  "Those foreigners represent the regime's economic backbone.  Their safe presence indicates that the country is living in a  normal state."    Responding to a question about possible merger or  cooperation  with the army of the FIS, he said: "We wonder who this front is  to which you are referring and what army it is about which so  much has been said, especially now that peaceful solutions  involving capitulation are being brought forward. If anyone has  something else to say, let him confirm it inside the country in  the land of fire and dust, not in Intercontinental, Holiday, and  Hilton hotels."    Regarding a possible FIS accommodation with the government,  he said: "The position of the GIA will be defined by the Shura  Council of mujahidin and the courts of Islamic law."</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Hanson sells its stake in ICI HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday cleared the way for its next big acquisition by officially ending its phoney war with Imperial Chemical Industries when it sold its 2.8 per cent stake in the UK company. While there was no official comment from ICI except to say that it would continue to work on its cost improvement programme, one of its advisers described the sale as the final admission of defeat by the conglomerate. Hanson made a profit from its ICI shareholding of about Pounds 28m. It is understood that Hanson would like to make a big agreed deal by the end of the year. The conglomerate, one of the UK's most acquisitive companies, has not launched a hostile bid since 1986. Mr David Clarke, deputy chairman of Hanson Industries in the US, said: 'We are, of course, looking at acquiring another core business and will do so at some time.' He noted that Hanson's share price had risen because of strong US buying, and added: 'US investors are not waiting for another mega deal but are delighted with the running of our core businesses.' Since Hanson raided the market in May 1991 to take a 2.8 per cent stake in ICI, a full bid had been expected for the pharmaceuticals group, which waged an effective propaganda war against the conglomerate. In response to criticism of its corporate governance and lack of an obvious successor to Lords Hanson and White, respectively chairman and head of the group's US arm, the group last year appointed three new non-executive directors. It recently made Mr Derek Bonham group chief executive and appointed Mr Clarke to his position in the US. A financier close to Hanson said the group lost interest in developing its relationship with ICI after it became clear that the pharmaceuticals company would not contemplate either a merger or any joint ventures with Hanson. The conglomerate decided to sell its ICI stake after it received the final dividend late last month as part of its programme to eliminate net debt, which had risen to Pounds 1.5bn following the acquisition of Beazer, the aggregates and housebuilding company. 'Hanson has never been happy with net borrowings,' said one of its advisers. 'The sale of its ICI stake is part of the group's tidying up exercise before it makes its next big deal.' Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank which advised ICI in its dealings with Hanson, yesterday confirmed that it had bought Hanson's 20m ICI shares for Pounds 280m. Hanson, which bought the shares for Pounds 11.94, received Pounds 14.00 a share after Goldman placed about half the stake for around Pounds 14.10 to US investors. The profit on the holding was after carrying costs and minus ICI's dividend. The group had to pay three top financial advisers, N M Rothschild, Lazard Brothers and Cazenove, although one of Hanson's advisers said the total cost of the advisers for the year was not expected to exceed Pounds 1m.

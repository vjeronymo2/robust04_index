			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULLARD OUT IN USC TRACK SHAKEUP  </P> <P> Ernie Bullard has been removed as the USC men's track coach, and the men's and  women's programs will be reorganized under a single coaching staff, it was  announced Friday by Athletic Director Mike McGee.  </P> <P> The consolidated coaching staff will consist of a head coach, two full-time  assistants, a part-time assistant and a volunteer assistant. McGee said that  the operating budget and number of scholarships will not be affected.  </P> <P> Bullard, the Trojan men's coach the last six years, has been offered  reassignment within the USC athletic department, and second-year women's coach  Mike Bailey has accepted one of the full-time assistant coaching positions.  </P> <P> Larry Knuth, an assistant men's coach for six years, has resigned.  </P> <P> The status of men's assistants Don Quarrie and Jim Bush will be determined by  the new coach, according to McGee.  </P> <P> Bullard, 53, said he anticipates accepting an unspecified job within the  athletic department. He plans to retire in a few years.  </P> <P> Possible candidates for the combined USC coaching position are Ron Allice, the  Long Beach City College track coach; Ted Banks, the former Texas El Paso coach,  now at Riverside Community College; John Chaplin, Washington State's track  coach, and Art Venegas, UCLA's weight coach.  </P> <P> Bush, the former successful head track coach at UCLA, has indicated to friends  that he would rather remain at USC as an assistant, specializing in coaching  hurdlers.  </P> <P> It is believed that the restructuring of the program was, in part, prompted by  USC's failure to make a significant showing in the recent NCAA meet. The men's  team scored only nine points and the women scored 10 on Ashley Selman's first  place in the javelin.  </P> <P> USC has won 26 NCAA track championships, more than any other school and has had  23 gold medal winners in the Olympic Games.  </P> <P> But the Trojans haven't won an NCAA track title since 1976 and haven't been  competitive in the Pacific 10 or nationally recently  </P> <P> "I feel kind of burned out now," Bullard said Friday. "It's been a difficult  year. I thought we had to come through in the NCAA (meet) and for whatever  reason we didn't.  </P> <P> "My first response, to a degree, is relief," Bullard said. "You only have so  much energy to put into everything. Maybe this is the best move for me. I love  coaching, but I have no aspirations to coach again."  </P> <P> Bullard is a former USC pole vaulter who coached at San Jose State before  becoming USC's coach in 1985.  </P></p>

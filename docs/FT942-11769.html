			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone launches smaller companies trust Murray Johnstone is seeking up to Pounds 60m with the launch of Murray Acorn, an investment trust concentrating on the smallest end of the smaller company range. The trust will invest in companies with a market capitalisation of Pounds 50m or less, and principally those of less than Pounds 30m. Up to 10 per cent of the fund may be invested in unquoted companies, mainly those in a pre-listing phase. Special situations, such as management buy-ins or refinancings, may account for up to 30 per cent. Shares will be issued at 100p on a partly-paid basis, with 50p due when the public offer closes on June 16, and the balance due on November 30. This is to allow a more gradual investment of the fund in what can be an illiquid market. There are several smaller-company investment trusts listed in London, but most invest in much larger companies than Murray Acorn's planned targets, often having market capitalisations of up to Pounds 300m. However, two relatively new trusts, Pilot and Eaglet, have similarly low-cap limits. Murray Acorn will be aiming mainly for capital growth rather than income, and will take the Extended Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index (excluding investment trusts) as a benchmark. Shirescot, the Shires High-Yielding Smaller Companies Trust, managed by Glasgow Investment Managers, is hoping to expand by up to Pounds 25m with a placing and offer for subscription of conversion shares. The shares will be issued at 100p and on conversion, which will take place by October 14 at the latest, warrants will be attached on a 1-for-5 basis. The public offer is due to open on May 16, closing on June 7. First dealings are expected on June 15.</p>

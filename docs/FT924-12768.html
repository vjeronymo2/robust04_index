			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Government rejects halt to closures: Heseltine admits responsibility for pit turmoil MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterdaytook full responsibility for the turmoil he had created among Tory MPs over plans to shut 31 out of British Coals 50 pits. But he said there had been no alternative to the closures. He rejected the call by increasing numbers of Conservatives, the Trades Union Congress and leading members of the clergy for a temporary halt to the closures. 'I do not think there is a case for changing the recommendations that I have made,' he said. Looking tired after a gruelling week battling to persuade colleagues of both the case for closure and the manner in which it is to be implemented, Mr Heseltine repeated that contracts for only 40m tonnes of coal next year could be expected from the electricity industry - 25m tonnes less than this year. Asked if there could be a moratorium on pit closures as demanded by many Tory MPs, he replied: 'What am I to do with the 25m tonnes of coal?' Mr Heseltine made no attempt to deny causing a fierce internal Tory revolt. He did little to rebuff the suggestion that he had might have committed a spectacular error of political judgment. 'If I am in that position, I accept responsibility for that. I am the minister involved and I don't seek to share the responsibility or run from it,' he said on the BBC's On the Record programme. But Mr Heseltine said it had been for British Coal to consult with the unions and not for him to decide whether it was right not to give 90 days' notice of redundancies to miners. Mr Heseltine insisted that members of the cabinet, including Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, were fully aware of the pit closures. He admitted, however, that Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, had not been brought into the picture soon enough over the closure of three pits in Wales. But he added that ministers from all government departments had been discussing the closures 'for a considerable period of time'. Asked about the future of his political career in his present post, Mr Heseltine said: 'You don't come into politics expecting a sort of easy ride.' He said he did not expect the government to lose a Commons vote on the pit closures on Wednesday in spite of unprecedented protests from Tory MPs.</p>

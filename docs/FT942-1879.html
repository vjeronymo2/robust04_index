			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Arts: A happy 'Coppelia' - Ballet in London What a wonderful, odd ballet is Coppelia. Odd because of its blatant unreality - those peasants wearing a permanent rictus of joy; the whiff of alchemy in its second act - and wonderful because its joy touches our hearts. Delibes, of course, set it towards glory with an unflawed score. Whatever choreographic hands have fashioned its text today - and I do not think it is now possible to unravel who did what - they have taken the music as their guide, and blessedly so. The story may owe something to Hoffmann; it owes more to a kind of dramatic good sense that responds to the idea of a girl winning her boy after a trial by magic. Frantz must pass through Act 2 in Coppelius' workshop and learn the difference between a dream love and his real fiancee; Swanilda must know disappointment, and fight for her errant lover's return to a waking world. It is basic folk-myth that is the armature for this enchanting comedy. We may not notice it, but it gives a subliminal strength to the tale, and because of it we care about Swanilda, and even about Frantz, who is a less appealing figure (a roving eye; liable to pin butterflies to his jacket: would you let your daughter marry this man?) We care most immediately about the production which expounds this drama, and London City Ballet - at the Wells this week with their happy version - do not cheat us, or Coppelia. The text is neat but not gaudy, and so are the performances and the staging. I found it well-meant and well-reasoned on Monday evening. Peter Farmer's sets are discreet and pretty. The company bounced through the general dances; the principals - Tracey Newham Alvey as Swanilda, Roger van Fleteren as Frantz, Terry Hayworth as a jovial and touching Coppelius - worked with a will. I record with gratitude that in the audience was Pamela May, whose Swanilda was one of the abiding joys of our national ballet - witty, musical, deliciously pouting, shining in step, and serenely grand in the last act duet. Her performances taught me a lot about Coppelia's greatness - not least that is a ballet which rewards its audiences as handsomely as it does the finest dancers. London City's identity and task is as a missionary taking medium-scale ballet to a public who might otherwise never see a serious classic production. It is valuable work, and this Coppelia shows how well LCB does it. At Sadler's Wells all week</p>

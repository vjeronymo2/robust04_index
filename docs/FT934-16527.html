			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / C4 loses Clockwork Orange test case CHANNEL 4 Television was last night prevented from screening an arts documentary which included excerpts of the film A Clockwork Orange after Time-Warner, the owners of the film's copyright, won an injunction in the first round of a test case of the latest copyright laws. Channel 4 immediately lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal against the injunction. The film has not been shown in Britain for 20 years since its director, Mr Stanley Kubrick, voluntarily withdrew it from distribution. However, Channel 4 sought to include the excerpts in a review of the film in its programme Without Walls. Channel 4 argued that the 'fair dealings' provisions of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 - which extended copyright law to broadcasting - permitted the showing of illustrative clips without Time-Warner's granting permission for their use. Time-Warner argued that the excerpts accounted for almost half of the 25-minute programme and that the company would suffer financial damage if the film were ever shown. This is the first time the Act has been tested in the British courts when applied to reviews or criticism of broadcast material.</p>

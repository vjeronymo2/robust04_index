			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 8 Feb (EFE) -- It was reported today  that the foreign ministers of the 11 countries that make up the  Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) will define in  Montevideo on 11 February the steps to be taken to intensify the  process toward a common market in the zone.    The foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia,  Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela  will also have to solve the problem created by the presence of  Mexico in the ALADI after it joined the NAFTA with the United  States and Canada.    Article 44 of the Montevideo Treaty which created the ALADI  obliges a member country to extend to all ALADI members the  advantages it grants to third nations.    Mexico asked that this article not be implemented and that  it  prefers bilateral negotiations with the other partners.    In a news conference ALADI Secretary General Brazilian  Antonio Antunes said today that the Eighth Council of Foreign  Ministers will study the ways to strengthen the role of the  association in "the house of regional integration."    Antunes especially referred to the agreements reached in the  current subregional and bilateral integration process taking  place in Latin America, and on how to implement them.    He also talked about establishing regulations to strengthen  the current trends of intraregional trade.    Antunes noted the "outstanding growth" of regional trade  which according to figures of the ALADI Statistics Department  reached $22 billion, some 18 percent higher than last year.    In 1992 trade grew 29 percent in relation to 1991.    Antunes said regional trade has become a "great choice for  the region" and that world trade grew 3.3 percent in 1993.    Regarding Mexico, the NAFTA, and its compatibilization with  the ALADI, Antunes said a special group established after months  of discussions an interpretative protocol of Article 44 to allow  temporary exceptions to this article.    He added that Mexico must carry out bilateral negotiations  on  ways to compensate for the losses caused by the agreement with  third countries.</p>

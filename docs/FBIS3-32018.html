The  Fermathe priest thinks President Clinton and the U.S. State  Department want to reduce President Aristide's power because  they fear his popularity. Father Massac adds that the U.S.  Presidents are more concerned with U.A. interests in all their  relations with the little countries.    [Begin Massac recording, in Creole] The U.S. Presidents have  closed their eyes to the sufferings of the poor countries to  consider first the interests of the United States in all their  relations with those peoples. In Haiti, for instance, everybody  can see that the cause of the sufferings of all Haitians, who  cannot live at all at this time, is the willingness of President  Clinton and the State Department to prolong the crisis in order  to weaken Aristide's power because they fear his popularity.    It is time for Americans to stand up to protest the policy  of  their rulers who are weighing down several little countries.  What happened in Los Angeles may be a [word indistinct] warning  from God so they will be more caring about the sufferings  imposed on deprived peoples by the United States. It is time for  President Clinton to release the refugees who are in jail, to  stop sending them back to the Haitian hell of the coup d'etat.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Markets: A sporting charm that failed to work - Wall Street One of Wall Street's best-loved, if more obscure, market theories - the Ranger Rally - was put to the test this week. The theory holds that every time the New York Rangers ice hockey team wins the Stanley Cup (North America's championship trophy), the stock market stages a rally on the following day. Of course, to say 'every time' is a little misleading because, before this week, the Rangers had won the cup only three times and their last victory was way back in 1940. On Tuesday night, however, a 54-year-old curse was lifted when New York defeated Vancouver 3-2 in the last game of the finals. Pandemonium broke out throughout the city, and hordes of hungover but happy Wall Street brokers and traders trotted into work next morning looking forward to the first Ranger Rally in more than half a century. Alas, it never materialised because investors - or those outside New York, at least - seemed unimpressed by the Rangers' splendid achievement. After posting a quick eight-point gain at the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed course. By the end of the day, it was down more than 24 points and back below the 3,800 level. The reason the Rangers' charm failed to work its magic is the same reason the Dow has struggled to make much headway in recent months: inflation - or, to be more precise, the bond market's fear of inflation. Wednesday's declines were prompted by heavy selling of bonds by fixed-income investors unnerved suddenly by a sharp rise in commodity prices. Although the jump in the Commodity Research Bureau's index (from 3.31 to 238.61) on Wednesday was caused by political, not economic factors - in this case, rising tension on the Korean peninsula - it was enough to overshadow the morning's good news on inflation, an easing in the capacity utilisation component of the May industrial production figures. The reaction of bond prices to these two sets of data shows just how nervous the US Treasury market remains about inflation in spite of the Federal Reserve's round of four monetary policy tightenings. These were designed to nip inflationary pressures in the bud and reassure fixed-income investors that the value of their assets would not be undermined by rising prices. Capacity utilisation - the extent to which the capital stock of the country is being employed in producing goods - is a key inflation indicator. It has been watched closely all year by investors worried that demand in the rapidly growing economy will, eventually, outstrip companies' ability to boost production to meet that demand. As any student of economics knows, when demand increases relative to supply, prices rise. So, Wednesday's news that capacity utilisation had eased in May should have delighted the bond market, especially as it came a day after the May consumer prices index was released showing an unthreatening 0.2 per cent increase. Yet, jittery bond investors chose instead to focus on the CRB index, which rose sharply because gold and oil prices had firmed amid fears of a war between North and South Korea. The fact that the rise in the CRB was likely only to be temporary - and proved as much on Thursday and Friday when a meeting between former President Jimmy Carter and North Korean leaders in Pyongyang raised hopes of a diplomatic solution - did not dissuade the bond market from retreating at the first sign of higher commodity prices. This has been the pattern all year: the bond market has over-reacted to all the bad news about inflation while paying little attention to most of the good news. The stock market, meanwhile, also has continued to do what it has done for most of the year - follow blindly in the bond market's footsteps. Thus, the Dow, which rose 32 points on Tuesday because of higher bond prices, fell 24 points on Wednesday because of lower bond prices, then rose 21 points the next day because of higher bond prices. This will have to stop at some stage but, for now, the Dow seems handcuffed to the 30-year bond. Investors face a long, trying summer of modest rallies interspersed with equally modest declines, and a Dow likely to be stuck in a range somewhere between 3,750 and 3,850. As for the defunct Ranger Rally, sport-lovers will have to look elsewhere for a new market theory. Basketball, perhaps? The New York Knickerbockers are now playing the league championship finals, tied at two games apiece, against the Houston Rockets. I wonder what the Dow did the day after the Knicks last won the national title, back in 1973?  -------------------------------- Monday      3783.12  +   09.67 Tuesday     3814.83  +   31.71 Wednesday   3790.41  -   24.42 Thursday    3811.34  +   20.93 Friday      3776.78  -   34.56  --------------------------------</p>

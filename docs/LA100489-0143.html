			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CYNTHIA GARVEY FREED AFTER 1 DAY PENDING CONTEMPT CASE HEARING  </P> <P> Cynthia Garvey, the ex-wife of baseball star Steve Garvey, was released from  Sybil Brand Institute on Tuesday on the order of a state appellate court, a day  after she had been jailed for violating a child visitation order.  </P> <P> The four-judge 2nd District Court of Appeal determined that Los Angeles  Superior Court Judge Frances Rothschild had erred in denying Garvey bail,  pending a review of a sentence imposed by the judge.  </P> <P> "We find (Garvey) should be released on her own recognizance," the justices  ruled. "Nothing in this order is to be construed as to our ultimate decision on  the merits of the petition."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leaves With Attorney  </P> <P> Several hours after Tuesday's ruling, a sobbing Garvey left the jail in  Monterey Park, flanked by three female sheriff's deputies. She did not speak  with reporters before climbing into her attorney's car about 2:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Rothschild found Garvey guilty of 43 charges of contempt for violating a 1988  visitation order and immediately ordered her to jail, pending a Nov. 3 hearing  on a 126-day court-ordered sentence.  </P> <P> The judge ruled that she had "willfully" disobeyed an order requiring that  daughters Whitney, 13, and Krisha, 14, spend Tuesday afternoons and every other  weekend with their father and that he be allowed to speak to them on the  telephone.  </P> <P> According to wire service reports, Garvey was reunited with his daughters on  Tuesday morning. The children had refused to go with him when he tried to gain  custody on Monday.  </P> <P> The former first baseman for the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres, who is in  private business in San Diego, has remarried and lives in Del Mar with his  wife, Candace.  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: BNL reports profits of L592bn at midway point BANCA Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the Italian state-owned bank, reported operating profits net of extraordinary items of L592.1bn (Dollars 557m) in the first six months of this year. The figures include earnings for activities which were previously not consolidated, and are not directly comparable with those for the same period of 1991, when BNL's direct banking operations reported operating earnings of L552bn. The bank reported improvements in most operating areas. Interest earnings reached L1,564bn, while fee income amounted to L1,946bn. In the first half last year, BNL earned L1,161bn and L1,793bn for interest and fee income respectively. Again, the figures are not directly comparable.</p>

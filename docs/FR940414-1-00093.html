Best Management Practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 304(e) of the Act authorizes the Administrator to prescribe ``best management practices'' (BMPs). EPA may develop BMPs that apply to all industrial sites or to a designated industrial category and may offer guidance to permit authorities in establishing management practices required by unique circumstances at a given plant. Dikes, curbs, and other control measures are being used at some pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging facilities to contain leaks and spills as part of good ``housekeeping'' practices. Further, as described previously, the Office of Pesticide Programs is proposing to require these secondary containment systems at refilling establishments for agricultural pesticides. Due to the variety of products, formulation types and level of sophistication in the formulating and packaging equipment, EPA believes that regulating this industry by BMPs in national effluent guidelines regulations may not provide enough flexibility to the industry. However, on a facility-by-facility basis a permit writer may choose to incorporate BMPs into the permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Analytical Methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 304(h) of the Act directs EPA to promulgate guidelines establishing test methods for the analysis of pollutants. These methods are used to determine the presence and concentration of pollutants in wastewater, and are used for compliance monitoring and for filing applications for the NPDES program under 40 CFR 122.41(j)(4) and 122.21(g)(7), and for the pretreatment program under 40 CFR 403.12(g)(4) and (h). To date, EPA has promulgated methods for conventional pollutants, toxic pollutants, and for some nonconventional pollutants. The five conventional pollutants are defined at 40 CFR 401.16. Table I&hyph;B at 40 CFR part 136 lists the analytical methods approved for these pollutants. The 65 toxic metals and organic pollutants and classes of pollutants are defined at 40 CFR 401.15. From the list of 65 classes of toxic pollutants EPA identified a list of 126 ``Priority Pollutants.'' This list of Priority Pollutants is shown, for example, at 40 CFR part 423, Appendix A. The list includes non-pesticide organic pollutants, metal pollutants, cyanide, asbestos, and pesticide pollutants. Currently approved methods for metals and cyanide are included in the table of approved inorganic test procedures at 40 CFR 136.3, Table I&hyph;B. Table I&hyph;C at 40 CFR 136.3 lists approved methods for measurement of non-pesticide organic pollutants, and Table I&hyph;D lists approved methods for the toxic pesticide pollutants and for other pesticide pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes that the analytical methods for pesticide active ingredients contained in the promulgated pesticide manufacturing effluent guidelines and standards (see Methods for the Determination of Nonconventional Pesticides in Municipal and Industrial Wastewater, Volumes I &amp; II, EPA 821&hyph;R&hyph;93&hyph;010&hyph;A&amp;B, August 1993, Revision 1) will perform equally well on treated pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging wastewaters as on pesticide manufacturing wastewaters. Raw wastewater samples may on occasion require some separation prior to analysis, analogous to the emulsion breaking or chemically assisted clarification treatment included in EPA's costed BAT technology. Many of these methods have in fact been used on the PFPR sampled wastewaters. All of the active ingredient pollutant data that supports the proposed effluent limitations were generated using analytical methods that employ the latest in analytical technology. EPA may decide to promulgate these methods (which are contained in part 455) as allowable methods under 40 CFR part 136. However, EPA expects that monitoring of process flow will generally be the method used by permitting and Control Authorities to assure compliance with today's proposal. See section XIV of the Technical Development for a discussion of compliance monitoring.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 Apr (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid met today with Ambassador Nabil Najm,  Iraq's permanent envoy to the Arab League.    Following the meeting, Ambassador Najm said that he briefed  the Arab League secretary general on the statement made by Mahdi  Sa'di Salih, the Iraqi National Assembly speaker, in which he  invited a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation to visit Iraq to  discuss all pending issues between the two countries in order to  serve pan-Arab causes, fulfill the two sides' interests, and end  the state of conflict and instability in the region.    The Iraqi envoy regretted the decision made by the Lebanese  Government to sever diplomatic relations with Baghdad. He said  that this decision came at a time when Iraq was eager to  normalize its Arab ties.</p>

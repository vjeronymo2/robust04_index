			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- A UNIAN correspondent has learned that in  the second unit of Chernobyl nuclear power station,  approximately two tonnes of water, with a radioactivity of  approximately 1.0 microcuries per liter, has been leaking out  from the initial location of the containment of nuclear  assemblies [yaderna kaseta], which have been spent in the  reactor (the cooling pond), each hour since 7 June because of  damage, which has not been found yet.    Hennadiy Masakov, head of the inspectorate of the state  committee for nuclear and radiation safety at Chernobyl nuclear  power station, told a UNIAN correspondent that 480 nuclear  assemblies from the reactor, which was stopped in October 1991  following the fire in the turbine room, had been placed in the  cooling pond. The collection of the leaked water has been  organized at the unit. In addition to the basic scheme of the  water supply in the cooling pond, another three reserve ones  have been prepared.    The nuclear assemblies are not threatened with being without  water.    According to an elaborated program, the search for the  location of the water leak is being carried out.    It has been reported at Ukraine's state committee for the  use  of nuclear power that such incidents have occurred before, but  on 7 June it became more noticeable. The level of radioactivity  has not changed and remains lower than normative restrictions.    The document on this event, which Viktor Vasylchenko, chief  engineer at Chernobyl nuclear power station, signed, contains  this conclusion: "There is no uncontrolled emergence of  radioactive substances in accordance with restrictions  established by conditions of normal operation, no increase in  the dose of the irradiation of personnel, nor additional  contamination of the environment due to the leakage of water  from the cooling pond."</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Print leaders recommend deal LEADERS of the GPMU print union yesterday recommended a deal which they say would raise pay in line with inflation. The proposed agreement with the British Printing Industries Federation would increase craft rates by Pounds 4.45 a week on April 24 and Pounds 2.50 from from August 24. The federation, which represents 3,000 employers with a total of 50,000 workers, had originally pressed for a delay. The union opposed that and proposals for more flexible working.</p>

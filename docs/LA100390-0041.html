			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> GRAPPLING WITH LIBIDOS;  </P> <P> THE NEWPORT THEATRE ARTS CENTER CAST, DIRECTED BY D. JAY BRADLEY, OFTEN  STRUGGLES WITH SONDHEIM'S SCORE FOR 'A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC.'  </P> <P> At the Newport Theatre Arts Center, "A Little Night Music" has a pretty face:  Gil Morales' sets are airy and romantic, and Dan McWest's costumes, fetching  but not overly bright, complement the environment nicely.  </P> <P> The acting too was colorful at Saturday night's performance. But the cast,  directed by D. Jay Bradley, often struggled with Stephen Sondheim's score, a  relatively challenging collection of songs in three-quarter time.  </P> <P> "A Little Night Music," inspired by the Ingmar Bergman film "Smiles of a Summer  Night," offers a humorous take on love and lust.  </P> <P> Just about all its characters have to grapple with annoying libidos while  attempting to nurture feelings of a more "pure" nature.  </P> <P> Everything comes to a head during a weekend in the country. Middle-aged  Fredrick (Jim Rule) is married to lovely, naive Anne (CeCe Moore) but longs for  the experienced Desiree (Mary Tuck), an old flame.  </P> <P> She has taken the vainglorious Count Malcolm (Jeff Paul) as a lover. He, in  turn, has a witty, vindictive wife (scene-swiping Diane Botnick).  </P> <P> As Fredrick, Rule may not look like much of a romantic figure, but he does lend  the role a weary dignity that is close to heroic, and he brings a decent  singing voice to the proceedings.  </P> <P> Tuck's Desiree is appropriately vivacious and her handling of "Send in the  Clowns," while not the showstopper it can be, is gently felt.  </P> <P> Paul scores points with his pompous portrayal, while Botnick gives the show its  giddiest moments.  </P> <P> 'A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC'  </P> <P> A Newport Theatre Arts Center production of the Stephen Sondheim (music and  lyrics) and Hugh Wheeler (book) musical.

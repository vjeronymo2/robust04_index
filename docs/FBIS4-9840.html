			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Julita Corrado] </F>   Text] The Mutual Support Group [GAM] has issued a  communique denouncing and lamenting the assassination of  Epaminondas Gonzalez, saying this crime highlights the perilous  conditions under which the population is living, as well as the  government's unwillingness and inability to find solutions.  Although it is likely a state of emergency will be declared,  GAM believes this will only worsen the situation.    The assassination of the Constitutionality Court president  is  a harsh blow against the institutional and constitutional order  that prevails in Guatemala because the Constitutionality Court  is the guarantor of rights in Guatemala. The GAM pointed out  that it believes militant sectors may have ordered and carried  out Gonzalez's assassination, thereby employing violence and  impunity in response to the recent signing of the human rights  agreement to prevent the creation of the Truth Commission and to  hinder the subsequent signing of a fair and democratic peace  agreement.    The GAM communique concludes by asking the president and  security authorities to readily and resolutely investigate this  unofficial execution. Such an investigation will lead us to the  whereabouts and identities of the perpetrators and masterminds  of this crime. These people must be prosecuted to establish a  precedent of stopping impunity in the country and to prevent the  Epaminondas Gonzalez case from joining the already long list of  unsolved crimes.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / More stay on at school A RECORD proportion of 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds stayed in education in England last year, figures released yesterday by the Department for Education show. They reveal that 66 per cent of all 16-year-olds stayed in full-time education during the academic year 1991-92, compared with 60 per cent in the previous year, while the proportion of 17-year-olds rose from 43 per cent to 49 per cent. The government said the staying-on rate had increased 'dramatically', and that provisional estimates for this year showed further 'leaps' to 70 per cent of 16-year-olds, and 55 per cent of 17-year-olds. Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, said the introduction of new General National Vocational Qualifications (GNVQs) would increase the relevance of courses and stimulate greater participation. He added: 'The government has also provided funding for a record 25 per cent increase in student numbers in further education over the next three years.' Mr Tony Lloyd, Labour's further and higher education spokesman, suggested the figures were caused by the recession. He said: 'We know, and most parents know, that this is entirely driven by the lack of employment opportunities and a complete lack of faith in the youth training alternatives which, significantly, have not attracted anything like the same increase in numbers.' Teachers' unions were also unimpressed. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'With unemployment at around 3m can anyone be surprised that more children are staying on?' He also attributed rising staying-on rates to the continuing success of GCSE examinations, which replaced the old system of GCE O-levels and CSEs four years ago. There were broad regional variations. In Knowsley, on Merseyside, only 43 per cent of 16-year-olds stayed in full-time education. This was exactly half the proportion in the London borough of Barnet, where the 86 per cent of pupils staying on was the highest proportion in the country.</p>

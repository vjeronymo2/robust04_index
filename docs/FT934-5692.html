			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Denmark (2): Jobs are the biggest issue - Politics / Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister, outlines the principal objectives of his Social Democrat-led government in an interview with Hugh Carnegy When Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was sworn in as Denmark's prime minister on January 25 this year, his elevation capped a meteoric rise through the political ranks by the former trade union economist. A member of parliament since only 1988, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen took over at the head of the Social Democratic party in 1992 in a controversial but successful challenge to the leadership of Mr Svend Auken. Within nine months, the resignation of the Conservative-led coalition of Mr Poul Schluter, which fell after 10 years in office amidst a scandal over the treatment of Tamil refugees, allowed the 49-year-old Mr Nyrup Rasmussen to form his own coalition with the small Radical Liberal, Centre Democrat and Christian People's parties. With the aura more of a technocrat than a politician, he has sometimes seemed ill at ease in the prime ministerial hot seat. But once over the hurdle of last May's second referendum on the Maastricht Treaty establishing the European Union, he has waxed in confidence. In a conversation with the FT, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen discussed the principal political challenge facing his government - how to tackle the double digit rate of unemployment while simultaneously fulfilling the Social Democratic pledge to defend and sustain Denmark's highly developed welfare state. 'You should never forget that our unemployment rate is caused firstly by the lowest business cycle comeback we have had for many, many years,' he says. 'We have not been in such a situation since the end of the 1950s. That is why I say that time is working for the government in that the economic growth rate is coming up now. Our so-called economic wise men evaluate that we will succeed in 1994 in forcing the unemployment curve down again. But it is a very long job. We can force it down in 1994 but it takes years to reinforce employment.' A big fiscal stimulus next year and a range of measures such as job rotation and job-sharing have been adopted by the government. But the prime minister firmly rejects the notion that the long term solution to unemployment lies in radical restructuring of Denmark's labour market, with its high jobless benefits and high minimum wage levels. 'I don't believe a bit in that argument, for many reasons. One is that it is not well documented that relatively high unemployment benefits have been a barrier to obtain jobs for the lower paid. I believe fundamentally in adult education and training as the way to go. In my mind the debate about competition between the unemployment benefit rate and the minimum wage is not relevant in this country.' At the European level, Mr Nyrup Rasmussen talks of a 'New Deal' initiative by the EU to increase Europe's commitment to education, research and development and labour flexibility. But, again, he is suspicious of calls for deep, free-market reforms. 'There is no connection directly in the different countries between the degree of regulation - be it by law, be it by collective agreements - and the unemployment rate. So when it comes to making the labour market more flexible, it seems difficult to develop a European strategy which covers the significant differences in the different member countries. 'Spain is perhaps the most well documented single example of structural problems directly related to regulations on the labour market - but if you take the UK you see that the unemployment rate is very high but the regulation degree is very low. So it is not that simple.' The recent rise in popularity of the Liberal opposition party, which calls for just such structural reforms, has sharpened the domestic political debate in Denmark in recent months. Local elections and opinion polls have suggested a polarisation of support around the Social Democrats on the one hand, and the Liberals, led by the energetic Mr Uffe Elleman Jensen, the former foreign minister, on the other. If the trend hardened, it could lead to the marginalisation of the handful of small parties that have traditionally held the balance of power in Denmark - and could deprive the Social Democrats of vital coalition support. Mr Nyrup Rasmussen is therefore keen to stress the merits of Denmark's consensus tradition. 'This trend is not preferable because the tradition here is to have a plurality of political parties. So I would regard it as a serious loss in political life if this trend became stronger. We have always based ourselves upon talking together and listening together. This country was the first country of all - in September 1899 - to create a consensus on the labour market, with the first independent labour court, with the first place where you establish collective agreements. This country still has the lowest potential conflict degree in the labour market. It is an inbuilt factor in the explanation of our welfare society.'</p>

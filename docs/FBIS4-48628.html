			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ade Obisesan] </F>   [Text] Lagos, May 23 (AFP) -- Only a trickle of Nigerians  went to register Monday [23 May] in elections to a  constitutional conference organised by the military regime amid  boycott calls by pro-democracy campaigners, reports across the  country said.    At several polling stations in Lagos, the commercial capital  inhabited by some six million people, nobody at all had  registered in the first three hours after the polls opened,  while at others visited by AFP, fewer than a score of names were  recorded.    After registration, the election proper began at noon (1100  GMT), with voters expected to stand behind the portrait of the  candidate of their choice in a controversial "open ballot"  system.    The aim Monday was to choose electoral colleges in each of  Nigeria's 30 states and the federal capital territory Abuja,  which would in their turn, next Saturday, elect 273 delegates to  the conference, which the regime has said will chart Nigeria's  political future.    Pro-democracy movements, including a powerful group known as  Middle Belt Forum consisting of prominent politicians and other  figures in central states, have dismissed the vote as a  "charade" aimed at perpetuating military dictatorship.    They asked junta leader General Sani Abacha to invite, by  May  31, the presumed winner of presidential elections annulled by  the military last year, tycoon Moshood Abiola, to form a  government or face mass protests.    The Campaign for Democracy, a coalition of some 40  pro-democracy and human rights organisations, has also warned  that it would try "physically" to block the vote and called for  a boycott of the conference.    The junta, which plans itself to appoint 96 people to the  conference, won the support at the weekend from a group of  traditional chiefs in the ethnic Yoruba heartland in the  southwest, Abiola's home region.    The Yoruba rulers said they would back the government  conference in June on condition that the annullment of last  year's presidential poll be part of the agenda.    Sources reached by AFP in major cities in other parts of the  country reported widespread apathy about the poll.</p>

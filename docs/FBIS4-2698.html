			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>   [Text] Shanghai dissident leader Zhang Xianliang was  abused and attacked in a labour reform farm on the outskirts of  the city, his wife said.    Yan Huili, Zhang's wife, said her husband had lost about  four  kilograms, was suffering poor health and his meagre food rations  were being stolen by other inmates.    Zhang, 48, one of China's most respected dissidents, was  sentenced last year to three years' "re-education through  labour" for allegedly "inciting incidents" and organising  activities in Shanghai to mark the fourth anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square massacre.    Another jailed activist, Fu Shenqi was being treated poorly  at the Dafeng Labour Farm near Shanghai, but was not suffering  any major health problems, his wife, Li Liping, said.    In a letter smuggled out of Qingpu Labour Reform Farm, Zhang  had said he was abused by other prisoners under the orders of  team leader Chen Qingxing, Ms Yan said.    He was constantly followed by at least two prisoners who  shouted obscenities at him and pushed him around, she said.    Zhang had complained of poor food, and said other prisoners  even stole food from his meagre diet.    During Ms Yan's last visit, watched by farm officials, Zhang  had been unable to say much about his treatment, but she had  learned from other sources that her husband was suffering chest  pains, had sleep problems, had lost control of his right thumb  and could not keep his hands steady.    "They would not allow him to see doctors and only give him  the medicine which I brought to him during the monthly visit,"  she said.    Fu, 40, was detained last year for allegedly "instigating"  others to protest against Zhang's detention.    Ms Li said her husband was barred from keeping notes and  reading, and could write to his family only under official  supervision.    She said the authorities had not replied to Fu's appeal, and  no date had been fixed for the hearing.    Fu filed an appeal in January after the Shanghai Huangpu  District Court rejected his lawsuit against labour-reform  authorities for illegal detention.    Both wives said their families were under great financial  stress because of their husbands' detention.    Ms Yan had had to sell her personal belongings. Ms Li had  difficulty paying for Fu's expenses in the labour farm and was  living in extreme misery. She said she could not work because  of illness and could no longer support Fu's parents.</p>

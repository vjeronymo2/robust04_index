			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gerd Krause: "German Railways and Bundeswehr Do </F> Not Use DBP Telekom: Special Communications Networks Are a  Specialty of Stuttgart's Alcatel-SEL: New Railway System Is  ISDN-Capable for Digital and Analog Connections"]    [Text] VDI-N, Duesseldorf, 1 April 94 - Instead of  using the DBP Telekom system, power companies, the Bundeswehr,  and the German Railways have their own communications systems.  Alcatel-SEL in Stuttgart, which has installed much of the  network, calls this developmental field "special networks." The  company's know-how is now beginning to pay off. Such special  networks are becoming an export hit for the Stuttgart  enterprise.    John Doe is not the only person who likes to chat on the  telephone. Military personnel and railway workers also have  frequent recourse to the telephone. This occurs in the course of  their normal duties, but with a significant difference. While  Mister Average Citizen, providing he or she is not telephoning  via a private D2 mobile system, as a customer of the DBP (German  Federal Post Office) Telekom, uses the postal service's line  system, the military and the railway employees enjoy a  privilege. In addition to the power companies (EVU) and the  former Federal Railway System, the armed forces are also  exempted from DBP Telekom's telephone service monopoly. These  three user groups can operate their own systems for internal  communications traffic, i.e., the railways, the Bundeswehr and  the power companies have their own communications systems.  Alcatel-SEL in Stuttgart, which has installed most of these  systems, calls them "special networks." "Special networks," as  Wolfgang Dietze, the director of the special network systems,  defines them, "serve all of us, although they do not belong to  the Telekom's public communications system."    The German military is especially ambitious. In order to be  independent of the public infrastructure, the Bundeswehr decided  to build its own communications system. Alcatel-SEL had proposed  a single system for the military, but the Luftwaffe, the Navy,  and the Army could not agree on a common system. Each branch of  service wanted its own. Consequently, in 1989 SEL installed a  nationwide system with 6,500 connections for the Bundeswehr and  another nationwide special network with 40 large exchange  centers specifically for the Luftwaffe. The eccentric Navy chose  a wireless system. At taxpayer's expense, Fleet Command ordered  its own directional radio system from the Stuttgart company.    The know-how gained by the Stuttgart workers in developing  these systems is now becoming an export hit. The technology  underlying the special networks is the Alcatel 1000 S12 System,  which had been developed for public communications use and which  is used in Germany and in many other countries of the world by  DBP Telekom. To date, Alcatel-SEL has built special networks for  the armies of Thailand and Saudi Arabia, and last year the Swiss  Railways received a modern integrated service digital network  (ISDN) with 480 exchange centers. The modernization of the  Chilean railways system with 30,000 connections promises to be a  most impressive contract.    An actual contract is the new nationwide ISDN-network for  the  German Federal Railways--the former State-run Bundesbahn and  Reichsbahn. This project has been underway since July 1993 with  Alcatel-SEL as the consortial leader. Alcatel-SEL delivers the  lion's share of the entire switching technology, while the group  consisting of Siemens, ANT, and Alcatel-SEL delivers most of the  transmission technology.    As compared with public systems, special networks are small.  The most common definition, advanced by Wolfgang Dietze, puts  the number at up to 200,000 connections. The technology may be  seen in the example of the German Railways system. The  performance features--complete ISDN capability--are not limited  to local exchanges, but are available throughout the network,  mostly for subscribers with digital and analog connections.  Thus, for example, at any location in the rail system a  nationwide conference call capability (add-on third parties)  with ten subscribers can be established. Other performance  features are preset transfers in the case of a busy connection,  automatic recall, multiple numbers, secret numbers, and the  setting up of closed user groups. In addition, digital  subscribers receive other performance features like telephone  number indicators, call units indicators, or equipment selection  with select terminal number.    The compatibility of the special networks with analog and  digital technology is one of their strongest performance  features. All kinds of switching technologies can be used in an  exchange center. Connections can be made with digital and analog  technology, even the public exchange technology can be hooked  up. The modular construction permits the system to be expanded  gradually, so that the network, as originally planned, can be  extended to several subscribers if necessary.    In future, the German Railways system could become of  interest to the telephone companies. The telephone monopoly in  the countries of the European Union ends in 1998 and, according  to the Wolfgang Boetsch, the German Minister of the Postal  Service, the network monopoly will no longer be able to be  maintained. For the German Railways, this will mean that its  nationwide communications system could be opened up to private  customers. At any rate, Dietze emphasizes, it would become  technically possible to do so. Thus, for example, a customer in  Duesseldorf could select the railways exchange via his local  Telekom system, be switched to Hamburg through the railways  system, and speak to the other party on the Alster on the local  Telekom system there. Since Alcatel-SEL has selected the  internationally standardized Nr. 7 signalling procedure for the  special network, the transition to the public system would  easily be possible. "Technically," Dietze asserts, "everything  is in place." The 34 Mbit/s transmission capacity of the fiber  glass cables excludes the possibility of any bottlenecks  developing, while the exchange facilties can be expanded on a  modular basis.    The German Railways' new extensive system is entirely  comparable to the Telekom system as far as extensive  interconnections are concerned. But it is smaller, having been  initially designed for only 120,000 subscribers, while about 42  million now subscribe to Telekom's system.    In the first phase of its system expansion, the Railways is  installing network nodal centers, which are comparable to small  regional networks, at 44 sites. In turn, about 100 terminal  exchanges are attached to them. Even the expansion process is  similar to that of the postal system. The Railways system  consists of both fiber glass lines and directional radio. In  general, the fiber glass cables run underground along the left  and right sides of the track for a total of over 30,000 km.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] No official request for the safety of senators has  yet been sent to the Haitian police, according to the Senate  president, Firmin Jean-Louis, on 7 April. The senators are  hesitant because risks exist in parliament, he explained. He  stated, however, that everything will be done to resume  activities in the Senate. Let us listen to Senator Firmin  Jean-Louis.    [Begin recording] [Jean-Louis] Certainly, words were spoken.  You have heard Osny Eugene say he is resolutely waiting for us.  We have assessed the situation and again hesitate. The senators  [words indistinct] safety. Once there is a risk of danger or  real danger, we hesitate. The diplomatic lounge is not meant for  holding sessions. As you know well, there is a session room. It  is not question of meeting once or twice. It is question of  running the parliamentary institution, the senatorial  institution. There is now a problem -- the occupation of the  premises by those elected during the contested 18 January [1993]  elections. We make it a point of.... [pauses] We wish to resume  work. We wish to resume normal sessions. To do so, we must, of  course, have the session room; we must actually control the  administration of the institution.    [Unidentified journalist] Senator [Yvon] Gislain, a member  of  your office, has accused you of having done nothing to resume  activities. How do you react to his statements?    [Jean-Louis] Perhaps, Sen. Gislain (?did not attend) our  last  meeting. There are a total of 17 senators, including five who  are more or less dissident, who now side with the 18 January  parliamentarians; five others who peremptorily say they will sit  only in the session; and others who might possibly agree to work  elsewhere. You know very well that to hold sessions, you need a  minimum of 11 [senators], which constitutes our quorum. Until  now, it has been (?impossible) to hold sessions in a place other  than the session room. If the police would like to give us a  hand to convince those elected in the 18 January elections to  put an end to their occupation of the premises, we would  certainly not say no.    [Journalist] There is no formal request?    [Jean-Louis] No, not yet. [end recording]    That was Sen. Firmin Jean-Louis, president of the National  Assembly, who was answering questions from a crowd of  journalists concerning the situation in the Senate of the  Republic. No formal request has been sent to the Haitian police  to ensure the safety of parliamentarians if the activities  resume in the Senate of the Republic.</p>

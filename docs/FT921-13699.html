			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Cheney rejects new campaign against Iraq SAUDI ARABIA is urging the US to organise a large covert campaign to help Kurdish and Shia rebels overthrow President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, according to US newspaper reports, writes George Graham in Washington. The New York Times said Saudi Arabia wanted to provide air support as well as missiles and arms to help rebels against Mr Saddam's helicopters and tanks. Mr Richard Cheney, US secretary of defence, yesterday described the report as 'overblown', arguing that Mr Saddam no longer posed much of a threat to his neighbours or to the world. 'How many American lives is toppling Saddam Hussein worth? My answer to that is not very damn many,' he said in a television interview, adding he believed the Iraqi leader would eventually be ousted. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, added: 'So long as we maintain the sanctions as we have and as our allies have and as the UN has, I do not think he's a danger outside his country.' General Colin Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, is reported to have argued that increased US intervention could only be successful if it involved at least as large a ground force as that used in Operation Desert Storm. Saudi officials, according to the New York Times, believe the allies would not have to commit ground troops, but could limit their role to supplying missiles and munitions.</p>

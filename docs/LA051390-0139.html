			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: A TALENT WORTHY OF NAME  </P> <P> The thing about James Worthy is, you don't know whether that's a name or a  description.  </P> <P> You don't know whether he's James the Worthy -- like one of those old-time  kings who were Charles the Great, or John the Good, or Richard the  Lion-Hearted.  </P> <P> Whatever he is, he's basketball royalty. He didn't exactly come into the league  with banners waving and trumpets blaring. He wasn't "Magic" or "Air Jordan" or  "the Mailman." He was just James.  </P> <P> In fact, hardly anybody was throwing his hat in the air around the Lakers when  they drafted him No. 1. A lot of people thought the new general manager, Jerry  West, blew it. He should have picked the flashier Dominique Wilkins or the  long-shooting Terry Cummings or even the speedy Sleepy Floyd. They thought  James was Unworthy.  </P> <P> When you're on a team with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Byron Scott and  Jamaal Wilkes, it's hard to get noticed. It's not that easy to get the  basketball. After those guys, everybody else is Kurt Rambis.  </P> <P> James Worthy didn't explode into a whole bunch of 50- or 60-point nights. He  didn't spend half his game flying through the air like a Wallenda. He didn't  win any slam-dunk contests. He was just, well, Worthy.  </P> <P> He never showed elation when he won. He never showed frustration when he  didn't. James never let anyone know what cards he was holding. He missed a shot  with the same poker-faced resignation as he hit one. He almost never fouled  out. He was disqualified only once in the last six years.  </P> <P> He was as dependable as sunrise, as unflappable as a cigar store Indian. "James  always showed this great dignity and poise," his coach, Pat Riley, recalls. "I  remember when he first came up and we shook hands, I noticed his palms were  sweating, but he had this calm, quiet look on his face. All he said was, 'Just  don't call me Jim.' Somehow, a proper name fit. You don't need a nickname for a  Worthy."  </P> <P> The Lakers got 40 minutes of impeccable basketball a night out of this Worthy.  Somehow, it wasn't enough. The league knew about Worthy. The Boston Celtics'  coach, K.C. Jones, was once heard to observe: "We knew what we had to do about  Magic and Jabbar and Jamaal Wilkes. We had no clue about James Worthy."  </P> <P> But the general public overlooked him. Magic was adored. Kareem was held in  some awe. Michael Cooper was "C-o-o-o-p!" Worthy was just the subject of rumor  mills: James Worthy was going to Dallas for Mark Aguirre. Then it was for Roy  Tarpley. The story around the league was, West announced flatly he would resign  if James Worthy went for anybody. They were not getting worth for Worthy, he  told them.  </P> <P> The moment of truth arrived when Kareem retired. Now, the smart money said, the  Laker franchise would turn back into a pumpkin. Its lineup would just be an  orphan asylum.  </P> <P> The "orphans" only posted the league's best won-lost record, 63-19. As the  season wore on, Magic Johnson-James Worthy became as effective a combination as  a ballroom dance team -- or the Lone Ranger and Tonto. They moved in tandem.  Whenever Johnson was double-teamed, which was most of the time, Worthy was like  a man who had just been let out of a cage. "W-o-o-r-t-h-y!" rang through the  Forum night after night as he flipped, shoveled, arc-ed or tapped in 1,685  points, including 711 field goals, and took down 478 rebounds, praise-Worthy  statistics. But Worthy does not make the top 10, just the playoffs. "James is  the best post-up player in the league," Riley explains. "Our offense moves  through James. Magic is the artillery, James is the shell. James cannot be  handled one-on-one. He is the best in the league with his back to the basket.  He's our first option going to the basket, and when Magic is double-teamed, he  spots it instantly and goes right for the glass. He has the quickest feet of  any post player I've ever seen."  </P> <P> He's like a guy stealing a pie when he gets the ball. Of course, he got a late  start in the game. He was clear up to 4 years old before his brothers could get  a basketball in his hands at Gastonia, N.C. By the time he was 6, he had every  move Elgin Baylor ever had.  </P> <P> He plays the game in a pair of space-cadet goggles that make him look as if he  came to weld the backboard. There's nothing wrong with his eyes -- he just  wants to keep it that way. Earlier in his career, he got a fingernail in his  cornea and doesn't like the notion of a repeat.  </P> <P> The Lakers seemed to have their boots off and their guns out of reach when the  Phoenix Suns surrounded them in the opening game at the Forum Tuesday night.  They scored a limping 18 points in the final 12 minutes to lose by two. One  more loss and they might as well go to Phoenix in a blindfold with a chaplain  and a Bible and make ready to go to lie down in green pastures.  </P> <P> But Thursday night, James was Worthy again, and Magic was, so to say, up to his  old tricks -- making the basketball disappear, sawing Phoenix in half.  </P> <P> They only evened the series. When Phoenix won Game 3 Saturday, it was right  back to the wall for L.A. The Suns seemed to be looking down the barrel at them  and squinting for the kill. But, they still have to win four. And they still  have to overcome a most Worthy opponent.  </P></p>

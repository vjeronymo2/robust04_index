			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets: Zurich tests equity turnover peaks Turnover in leading European equity markets resumed its advance in October with a 10.1 per cent rise, matching the decline of the previous month. The October advance was accompanied by a strong 5.4 per cent rise in the FT-Actuaries Europe index, with confidence bolstered early in the month by President Boris Yeltsin's military success against Russian hardliners who had occupied the White House in Moscow. The Bundesbank's unexpected decision to cut discount and Lombard rates on October 21 generated more enthusiasm. Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities notes that the strength of the markets was reflected in sharp improvements in local market indices in Switzerland, which rose by 8.9 per cent, the Netherlands, up 8.6 per cent, Germany, 8.2 per cent higher, and Spain, 7.3 per cent ahead. Markets which rose most during the month also demonstrated the largest increase in turnover. Mr Cornish adds that turnover on Seaq International, the London screen based trading system, rose by 10.7 per cent on the month for the seven continental European markets, 'so that there was a slight rise in London international volume as a percentage of the domestic market turnover, suggesting buying interest on the part of both international and domestic investors'. Zurich and Amsterdam, September's worst performers, became October's biggest gainers. Buyers bought both as a result of the dollar's strength and falling interest rates. Swiss turnover surged by 42.9 per cent to levels surpassing the previous peak of July 1989 as the SMI index finally broke through resistance at 2,500 early in the month and went on to establish a series of record highs. Mr Nicholas Wergan of Smith New Court notes that demand for stock was the result of the apparent redis-covery by foreign investors of Swiss blue chips, on realisation that they had become cheap by international standards. Banks pulled the market higher as some interim results surpassed expectations, while insurers benefited from plans to increase the sector's weighting in the SMI index. Mr Wergan said Switzerland had also proved a beneficiary of hesitancy over the outlook for Germany and France, while there was a return of investor awareness towards the small and medium Swiss stocks in the light of the bottoming out of the domestic economy after monetary easing. The Netherlands saw turnover rise 32.8 per cent, also a record, and Spain advanced 26.3 per cent in October and 20.7 per cent over the average of the previous three months. Italy was the month's big loser as the market was unnerved by an increasingly uncertain political outlook and as it faced up to the prospect of a very heavy calendar of capital raising exercises, most notably that by Fiat. Turnover fell 28.6 per cent on the month accompanied by a 2.2 per cent fall in the local market index.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse                   Jul       Aug       Sep       Oct          US                         1993      1993      1993      1993  Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium                59.86     64.52     86.99     77.87        2.14 France                151.18    176.99    184.37    201.93       34.35 Germany               188.75    184.40    150.42    183.24      109.07 Italy               35,687.2    47,394  44,009.6    31,410       19.26 Netherlands            21.60     23.60     18.90     25.10       13.32 Spain                 806.04    959.64    825.61  1,042.89        7.75 Switzerland            26.90     24.50     19.80     28.30       19.06 UK                     45.99     50.90     49.82     49.32       73.40  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Zagreb, February 28 (TANJUG) -- Special envoy of the  U.N. secretary-general for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said  on Monday that the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] had not been  involved in today's action when four planes were downed over  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    It was a NATO action, he said, which was carried out in  agreement with the United Nations resolution on a no-fly zone  over Bosnia-Herzegovina, Akashi told Croatian television.    Akashi said he had spoken to the commander of NATO's  southern  command who had assured him that the regular procedure had been  respected.    Akashi said he had also contacted Bosnian Serb Leader  Radovan  Karadzic, telling him that the incident should not be  dramatised, and that efforts to establish peace should continue.    NATO combat planes on Monday downed four planes near Banja  Luka, a city in the northwest of the Bosnian Serb republic.  Neither NATO nor the U.N. could determine to which of the  warring sides in Bosnia the downed planes had belonged.</p>

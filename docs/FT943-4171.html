			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Dehaene plea to Schneider chief Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, yesterday called upon Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, the fugitive French industrialist and chairman of Groupe Schneider, to surrender to Belgian authorities. Mr Dehaene warned that it would set 'a dangerous precedent' if justice was flouted. 'No person is above the law,' he said. Mr Dehaene's intervention threatened to exacerbate strains between Belgium and France over the fate of Mr Pineau-Valencienne, who faces charges of fraud and embezzlement relating to Cofimines and Cofibel, two Belgian subsidiaries of Groupe Schneider. The Schneider board yesterday issued a formal statement in support of Mr Pineau-Valencienne. The statement followed an emergency board meeting called to discuss the international arrest warrant for Mr Pineau-Valencienne obtained by the Belgian judge investigating the alleged fraud. Mr Pineau-Valencienne has pledged to co-operate with the Belgian authorities, but only on condition that the interviews take place in France under the supervision of French authorities. His cause has been taken up in France, notably by Mrs Edith Cresson, the former Socialist prime minister and one of France's two nominees to the next European Commission.</p>

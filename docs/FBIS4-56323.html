			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Joao Domingos] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The action by the groups that a few days  ago impeded the approval of the government economic program has  shown the true colors of Congress: The Brazilian Congress that  really works is not the Congress of political parties, but the  Congress of groups. Such groups have created big, powerful  blocs, regardless of party membership. The rural bloc, for  example, is twice the size of the PMBD [Brazilian Democratic  Movement Party] bloc, which is the largest party in Congress.    The bloc of nationalist lawmakers is bigger than the rural  bloc, and also much more pluralistic. This bloc is made up of  leftist deputies like Haroldo Lima (PC do B) [Communist Party of  Brazil], Ernesto Gradella (PSTU-SP) [expansion unknown-Sao  Paulo], and PDT-RJ [Democratic Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro] to  politicians of such diverse trends as Prisco Viana (PPR-BA)  [Progressive Renewal Party-Bahia] and Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA)  [Liberal Front Party-Bahia]. The nationalist bloc has made  unfeasible all attempts to end the monopoly of Petrobras  [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. All bloc members consider  the oil sector a strategic area.    Whenever the interest of some of those groups is  jeopardized,  their members react immediately. The rural bloc has just  prevented the approval of Provisional Measure 457 [MP 457],  which established the URV [real value unit] as the basis of the  government economic plan. In exchange for support for the  Planalto Palace proposal, they demanded the pardoning of the  debts that were contracted before the Collor plan. During the  negotiations they obtained a promise to reschedule the debts  over a five-year period. They rejected the promise, and  increased their demands, because they know they can exert even  stronger pressure.    "There is an excellent environment for group action in  Congress," PFL leader in the Chamber of Deputies Luis Eduardo  Magalhaes (Bahia) said, adding that he is against the privilege  of such groups. Despite his position, Magalhaes joined the group  of lawmakers who acquitted PFL Deputy for Pernambuco Ricardo  Fiuza in the Constitution and Justice Committee. Fiuza had been  charged with irregularities within the Budget Committee.    At that moment the influence of those who were indebted  could be felt, as a large number of congressmen owe favors to  Fiuza.    In the opinion of the government leader in the Chamber of  Deputies, Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP), the growth of these  groups "is making politics, institutions, and parties  unfeasible." According to him, the constitutional reform was a  failure because the groups demanded favors in exchange for the  approval of important modifications to the Constitution. To  make the situation worse, some blocs -- such as the rural bloc  -- tried to introduce their demands into inappropriate  documents, such as the text of MP 457.    Smaller than the nationalist and rural blocs, the Health  Parliamentary Front unites congressmen of all ideological  trends, and insists principally on the allocation of funds to  hospitals that have agreements with the Health Ministry. This  bloc joined the rural bloc and made the government decide not to  have MP 457 voted on in a plenary session.    The rural bloc always reacts by defending its financial  interests. In several cases, however, the groups gather around  different banners, be they political or religious. The  Protestants, a group comprised of nearly 30 congressmen, are  always ready to fight for the reestablishment of censorship on  all means of communication or to request favors, particularly  the allocation of national budget funds to their churches. When  Congress was voting on a five-year mandate for then President  Jose Sarney, almost all Protestants were given radio stations.  <H5>  Who Makes the Decisions in the Plenary Sessions </H5>   The multiparty blocs that defend group interests in Congress  are:     -  Nationalists -- 300 members: They affirm they have the  majority of votes in the plenary sessions whenever issues that  are of interest to them are being voted on. One of their main  banners is to preserve monopolies. Their leaders are: Senator  Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA), and Deputies Miguel Arraes (PSDB-PE)  [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Pernambuco], and Haroldo Lima  (PC do B-BA).    -  Bank of Brazil -- 10 members: A small, but  influential bloc that always obtains the support of other  congressmen when the privileges of the official bank are at  stake. Their leaders are: Deputies Augusto Carvalho (PPS-DF)  [People's Socialist Party-Federal District], Paulo Bernardo  (PT-PR) [Workers Party-Parana], and Paulo Mandarino (PPR-GO)  [Progressive Renewal Party-Goias].    -  Protestants -- 30 members:  In the last few years they have lost some of their power, but  whenever the issue being voted on at a plenary session refers to  religion or behavior, they still act as a bloc. Their leaders  are: Deputies Maviael Cavalcanti (PP-PE) [Popular Party-PE],  Costa Ferreira (PP-MA) [PP -- Maranha], and Benedito Domingos  (PP-DF).    -  Judicial Branch, Attorneys -- 10 members: Few  congressmen come from the attorneys' offices or the judicial  branch, but these sectors are helped by deputies interested in  defending their issues, such as Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [PMDB-Rio  Grande do Sul], Jose Luiz Clerot (PMDB-PB) [PMDB-Paraiba], and  Nilson Gibson (PMN-PE) [National Mobilization Party-PE].    -  Rural  Bloc -- 206 members: It unites small and large producers in  defense of the sector's profits. The group is headed by  Deputies Ronaldo Caiado (PFL-GO), Odelmo Leao (PP-MG) [PP-Minas  Gerais], and Jonas Pinheiro (PFL-MT) [PFL-Mato Grosso], as well  as Senators Ronan Tito (PMDB-MG) and Saldanha Derzi (PRN-MS)  [National Reconstruction Party-Mato Grosso do Sul].    -  Union  Leaders -- 30 members: Comprised mainly of leftist congressmen  who began their political careers as members of labor unions.  They are led by Chico Vigilante (PT-DF), Pedro Tonelli (PT-PR),  Carlos Santana (PT-RJ), and Carlos Alberto Campista  (PDT-RJ).    -  Public Administration Employees -- 10 members:  Although they have no expressive power in Congress, their group  makes a lot of noise in the corridors. Their main leaders are:  "Shi'ite" Maria Laura (PT-DF) and Trotskyist Maria Luiza  Fontenelle (PSTU-CE) [PSTU-Ceara].    -  National Health Front -- 200  members: They seek to have the widest program possible but have  to face dissidence. A group led by Deputy Eduardo Jorge  (PT-SP), who is a doctor, charges the front with being an  instrument used by Chafic Farhat (PPR-SP), who defends the  hospitals' interests.</p>

Others, however, have  chosen an ambitious answer to what sometimes seems an  overwhelming problem.    With producers in the area clamoring for subsidized  environmental restructuring loans, those providing funding want  to know where each dollar will have the greatest impact. Their  tool is Project Silesia, an international study bringing  together the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the World  Bank, the U.S. Peace Corps and the Czech and Polish  environmental ministries. The study seeks to set priorities for  the region around Ostrava, northern Moravia, and Katowice,  southern Poland.    The EPA researchers found that air pollutants will probably  cause cancer in 1.4 percent of the region's 5 million  inhabitants. In areas with peak concentrations of toxins, more  than half the residents could be afflicted. On the Czech side of  the border alone, air-borne dust, sulfur dioxide and other  atmospheric pollutants are estimated to kill 380 people annually.    Cases of breathing paralysis and inflammations are also  common. Almost 1,000 miners annually suffer from traumas caused  by silicosis and physical stress.    The researchers also found high levels of poisonous  elements,  including PCBs, in food produced in Silesia and dangerous levels  of arsenic in the tap water.    In response, Project Silesia's first task was to identify  the  main culprits. In this coal-mining and steel-producing region,  the ax fell heavily on coke ovens.    Ostrava-Karvina Coke Ovens (OKK) released 3,800 tons of  pollutants into the atmosphere last year. Under pressure to cut  pollution, the company has reduced its production by one-third  since 1990.    OKK's manager, Vitezslav Hladik, hopes to export his  product,  which is used to fire metallurgical and power plant furnaces.  Environmentalists, however, would rather see his ovens  completely shut down in the near future.    "Exporting coke would be selling off our health, and  depriving ourselves of a non-renewable resource," said Project  Silesia's Czech coordinator, Helena Cizkova.    Like Hladik, other industrial chiefs both fear the project  and place their bets on it. The study's results will aid in  directing World Bank funds.    Still, "my biggest problem was `selling' the project,"  Cizkova said. "Many other studies are just gathering dust on  ministerial shelves."    Industry scientists typically state that they do not need  expensive foreign auditors to tell them where their pollution is  coming from. "We know our problems very well. Ninety percent of  them we know how to deal with," said Jan Chovanec, a technical  development worker at Nova Hut, the largest Czech steel producer.    Metallurgical plants, which the project identified as the  second-worst cause of pollution, want money, not advice.  "Repairs and technological updating will cost us 20 billion Kc  ($6.7 million)," Chovanec said. "We need long-term loans." Nova  Hut registered 1.9 billion Kc in profits last year.    The state has divested itself of its responsibility toward  the companies, Chovanec said.    Nova Hut's ailing Ostrava competitor, Vitkovice, has similar  complaints. "The Ministry [of Environment] has decided:  polluter, payer. But if we pay huge fees, we have nothing left  to make ecological investments," said Vaclav Hettenberger, head  of Vitkovice's environmental department. In 1993, the firm was  charged 120 million Kc for improper waste storage alone.    Industries point an accusing finger at overly stringent  green  regulations, saying that environmental protection laws passed by  the Czech legislature after the revolution did not take into  consideration the capacity of producers to adapt.    "Our technology is 20 years out of date. And now we are  suddenly expected to catch up with the European Community by  1997," Chovanec said.    Project manager Cizkova, who is also an employee of the  Ministry of Environment, says the laws and fees are necessary to  coax industries into action. "Companies are interested in  ecology when legislation forces them to be," she said. In fact,  the fees are so low that it profits the companies to put off  their clean-up investments, Cizkova said.    She agreed, however, that polluters mainly need help and  money to restructure. "Local loans are too expensive, and  foreign banks want a go-ahead from well-known international  consultants. Yet cheaper local technicians can do the job," she  said.    The EPA served mainly to put a prestigious label on the  project, thus attracting foreign creditors, Cizkova said.    The American agency also brought in new working principles.  "The Czechs have been used to throwing money at problems for 40  years. The whole idea of risk prioritization is rather new to  them," said Frank Wheeler of Hatch Associates, an engineering  and management consulting firm.    "When Project Silesia auditors first visited a company, the  management would first always give them a shopping list,"  Wheeler explained. There was little attempt to assess the best  destination for the limited funds.    The question is now whether Project Silesia's specific  proposals, expected later this year, will be heeded.</p>

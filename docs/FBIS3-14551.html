Serious riots  erupted in Nabulus this morning, and our correspondent Moti Amir  reports that 15 locals were wounded and a soldier was lightly  injured by a stone. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has clamped  a curfew on the city, as well as on the adjacent refugee camps.    Brigadier General Doron Almog, commander of IDF troops in  the  Gaza Strip, has been trying to calm down the situation. He  phoned several Fatah leaders in the area this morning to explain  the circumstances of the shooting of six armed Fatah members who  aimed their weapons at the soldiers.    The six victims were buried late last night in the Jabalyah  refugee camp. This morning a curfew was clamped on the camp, as  well as on Bayt Lahiyah and adjacent areas. A 24-hour general  strike called by Fatah is being observed today in the Gaza Strip.    Several stonethrowing incidents occurred near the homes of  the mourning families. Locals claim that soldiers tried to  prevent them from putting up shacks to accommodate the mourners.</p>

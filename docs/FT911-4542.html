			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Forest products group reports CDollars 50m loss THE Canadian forest products industry is reporting continued losses for the first quarter and warns that little relief is likely until well into 1992. Canadian Pacific Forest Products, a fully integrated group and one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, reported a first-quarter loss of CDollars 50.1m (USDollars 43.1m), or CDollars 1.14 a share, against a profit of CDollars 4.8m or 11 cents a year earlier. Sales fell to CDollars 526m from CDollars 623m. The company cited low market pulp prices, now down about USDollars 200 per ton from the recent peak, and also poor newsprint prices. Tonnage volumes were also sharply lower. CPFP is reviewing all its operations and will keep only those businesses where it has 'competitive strength'. But it is completing a CDollars 350m modernisation at Thunder Bay in Ontario and will invest a further CDollars 210m for a new pulping unit and paper machine modernisation at Gatineau in Quebec.</p>

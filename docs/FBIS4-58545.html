			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 4, IRNA -- International relations  experts say Britain's recent claim about Iran's collaboration  with Northern Ireland is out of spite and unfounded.    They say Britain, by propounding such a claim, thinks it can  ruin relations between Iran and Europe.    International relations analyst Farhad Azimi, in his  interview on Wednesday, says that by alleging an Iranian link to  the Northern Ireland issue, London intends to give plausibility  to its age-old hostile propaganda against Islamic Iran.    "Prime Minister John Major would do better to realize the  realities in Iran and discontinue London's efforts at  antagonizing Europe with Iran, and watch out against playing  into the hands of certain notorious elements," he added.    According to Azimi, the Islamic Republic must revise its  relations with those governments that are unable to realize the  factual realities in Iran.    College professor and Britain-watcher Dr. Reza Farahmandi  told IRNA today that since the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the British Government has consistently pursued a  fraudulent policy in its dealings with Iran.    He said British arms sales to Iraq during the almost eight  years of the Iraqi war (1980-88) against Iran, Britain's aids to  the terrorist grouplets with the idea of them subverting the  Iranian Government as well as the recent voicing of such  irrelevant claims as Iran having collaborated with the Irish  Republican Army (IRA) are all typical examples of Britain's  schemes for waging a political war with the Islamic republic.    "The triumph of the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 in  fact ended the history of foreign domination in Iran as well as  any cause for succumbing to any foreign pressure for yielding to  external threats," he added.    Dr. Farahmandi said another goal behind the scheme is for  the  British Government to divert attention from the shabby state of  affairs at home and direct public attention outside of England.    He commented that Iran's lobbying at international forums  for  the aggressed people of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its exposure of  grim realities about the discriminative polices of Britain,  Europe and the U.S. against the continent's native Muslim  population, has raised doubts about London's claims of  commitment to human rights and other international conventions  that disallow the massacre of innocent people of whatsoever  religious faith, origin and race.</p>

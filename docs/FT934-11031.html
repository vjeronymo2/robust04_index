			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / None of the Burgers wants to be Meister LESS than a month before local government elections, the eastern German state of Brandenburg is having a spot of bother: attracting candidates. In 300 of the state's 1,700 towns and villages, Germany's political parties cannot find people willing to stand as mayors. 'Who wants to stand for mayor when the councils are virtually bankrupt,' one official from the Brandenburg government said yesterday. Most of the city and town councils in eastern Germany are running budget deficits as high as 70 per cent. This means that any promises by prospective mayors about opening libraries, kindergartens, or building swimming pools, are sheer flights of fancy. But it is not only the councils' financial state which provides a disincentive to any prospective candidate. Brandenburg, led by Mr Manfred Stolpe, is the only eastern state in the hands of the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD). The established parties all admit that they are finding it difficult to create local elites in the five eastern states. For 40 years, eastern Germans were 'politicised' to the extent that they had to participate in a political system ranging from waving the Red Flag to joining the Youth Movement. 'It takes time to overcome a system in which political participation was compulsory,' explained Mr Wolfgang Thierse, an SPD member of the Bundestag, or Lower House, who represents a constituency in east Berlin. Voters in eastern Germany have also become rapidly disappointed with their new politicians, as the initial euphoria of unification has collapsed with the mass unemployment that it has brought to some regions. There is also a deeper sense of distrust. The electorate in Brandenburg has seen how Mr Stolpe, who before 1989 had close connections with the Lutheran Church and had tried to defend them, is now pilloried for his alleged connections with the Stasi, the former state security apparatus under the communist regime. 'You need to be strong to tolerate non-stop scrutiny of your past,' said an official from Potsdam, the capital of Brandenburg. Ms Regine Hildebrandt, Brandenburg's minister for labour, health and women, says she can understand these anxieties. However, she insists: 'We must pull the people out of their lethargy. They just can't sit back and let other people make decisions for them. 'That's what it was like in the former days. 'They must get up and become politically engaged and let their voice be heard, otherwise eastern Germany will be a political wilderness,' she added.</p>

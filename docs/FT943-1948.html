			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Commerzbank to buy 20% of Polish bank Commerzbank yesterday announced a further move into eastern Europe with the planned purchase of a 20 per cent stake in Bank Rozwoju Eksportu (Export Development Bank), a privately-owned Polish bank specialising in export and corporate finance. The German bank said its interest in the bank, founded in 1986 and now with 10 branches, was strategic. The stake requires the approval of NBP, the Polish central bank. The central bank said it would only consider the application after Bank Rozwoju Eksportu has held its next shareholders' meeting in mid-October. NBP is about to grant an application from Dresdner Bank of Germany and Banque Nationale de Paris to open a jointly-owned subsidiary in Poland. Deutsche Bank, also keen to open up in Poland, has bid for a majority stake in Interbank of Warsaw. Commerzbank already has a representative office in Warsaw. Elsewhere in eastern Europe, it has a branch in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and a subsidiary in Budapest, Hungary. The German bank also said it had just opened a representative office in Novosibirsk, , giving it more outlets in former Soviet countries than any other German bank.</p>

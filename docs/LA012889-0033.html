			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: A STREET WITH NO NAME  </P> <P> The man who came into the office of Acton's Unocal service station was dressed  in ordinary street clothes, but his face was made up like a clown and he wore a  punk style fright wig streaked in bright reds and yellows. It was hard not to  notice him. The others in the office had on denims and plaid shirts and  sometimes heavy jackets because there was still snow on the peaks that loomed  over the Antelope Valley and a cold wind was blowing across the high desert.  </P> <P> The clown man was in a stew because he was late for something and wanted to  know how far east Sand Canyon was. The lady behind the counter, who couldn't  take her eyes off his wig, said it wasn't east, it was west. He said, "Are you  sure?" the way people do when they don't get the kind of answer they want. "I'm  sure," the lady said. "You'll see all the housing tracts on the side of the  road," a customer offered.  </P> <P> "I'll never get there," the clown man said, hurrying off. Those in the station  office watched him go and one of them said, "He belongs in Sand Canyon." Then  they laughed and went on about their business. Someone said later the clown  probably reminded them of the jarring red-roofed tract houses that trim Sand  Canyon's "designer hills" about 15 miles away, hills flattened and restructured  to accommodate new development. The folks in Acton look upon it as a kind of  residential circus.  </P> <P> I was in Acton not in search of a circus but of serenity. It's a small town  about 50 miles northeast of L.A., just before you get to Palmdale. Someone told  me it was one of the last outposts of quiet living, a place where horseback  riders mosied down the main street and pigs were sold for slaughter, but now  land speculators are moving in and things are changing. It's understandable if  not desirable.  </P> <P> We're all searching for what a line in the song "'Midnight Train to Georgia"  describes as "a better place in time," which is to say a safer and more  peaceful climate, like the small towns that exist in song and memory.  Developers understand our longing and seek out places like Acton because  they're peaceful and the land is gracious. And then they set about destroying  the beauty with tract houses.  </P> <P> It's obvious just driving into Acton that change is in the wind. A large sign  on Crown Valley Road announces that 32 luxury homes are coming soon. "That says  it all," Steve Miller said, standing behind the counter at Acton Auto Parts.  He's president of the town's Chamber of Commerce. "That's what we're afraid of.  Big developers built one tract of $300,000 homes on the other side of town and  they were sold overnight. Now they're going to build $700,000 homes and they'll  be gone overnight too. It's getting so there's no place to hide."  </P> <P> What Miller meant was that when he was a kid he lived in Torrance, which was  horse country then, and when the rural nature of Torrance changed, buried under  a burgeoning population, the family moved to Corona. When Corona changed it was  off to Chatsworth, always just ahead of the advancing hordes of suburbanites,  and when Chatsworth boomed Miller came to Acton. He has no idea where he'd go  from Acton, and neither does anyone else.  </P> <P> I can understand the quest. If you're looking for a quiet life in a rural  setting, Acton is it. The town was started by miners and ranchers more than a  hundred years ago and still has a 19th Century feel to it. About 6,000 people  live in areas that surround an idyllic village setting. I spent the afternoon  wandering around and ended up on a street with no name looking toward the  market and the 49er Saloon.  </P> <P> Hills cascade in perfect symmetry to a distance that overlaps into diminishing  shades of brown and gold. Acton's older homes, shielded by pine and eucalyptus  trees, blend perfectly into the setting and from where I stood you couldn't see  the stark new tract houses across the freeway. Nothing violates the land from  the street with no name.  </P> <P> "We talked about incorporation but we just don't have the tax base," Steve  Miller said. "Instead, we're working to create a community ordinance that would  control development. I just hope we're not too late."  </P> <P> As I drove out of town, I passed the sign that said 32 new luxury homes were  coming soon. I also passed one that said Bingo was played on Friday nights at  the Acton Community Club. I realized suddenly that they pretty much summarized  a world in conflict, like the guy with the clown face in a town of muted tones,  and I wondered how long it would be before the Bingo games were gone too.  Euripides said all is change, all yields its place and goes. I thought about  that and about Acton as I drove back into the calamity of the city.  </P></p>

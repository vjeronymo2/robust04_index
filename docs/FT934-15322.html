			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Survey of Four Cities Partnership (1): A quartet tunes up - Four medium-sized European cities, each of regional importance, have formed a loose alliance in the quest for faster development. Tim Burt looks at co-operation between Nottingham in the UK, Nancy in France, and Karlsruhe and Halle in Germany THE creation of the Single European Market, bringing with it a lifting of economic frontiers across Europe, has forced not only national governments but also individual cities to re-examine the ways they do business. A number of cities which have seen their former industrial bases decline have begun to cast around for international partners. The prize is access to new export markets and the prospect of attracting inward investors. There is also the opportunity to learn from the experience of other similarly-sized cities or regions with similar industrial and economic problems. Nottingham, the de facto capital of the East Midlands, is one example. By the late 1980s, it was clear to council officials that they had to widen their economic horizons if the city was to rediscover the formula which a decade earlier had helped make the region one of the most buoyant in the country. Three years ago, the city's economic development committee approached its namesake in Karlsruhe, the German university town in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg. Attracted by the idea of a loose alliance, fuelled by an exchange of industrial expertise, research projects and joint business ventures, Karlsruhe invited its own twin cities of Nancy in eastern France and Halle in the former East Germany to join the group - giving rise to the formal launch of the Four Cities Partnership 18 months ago. Karlsruhe itself has managed very successfully over recent years to find a new role for itself, and new prosperity. As such it is perhaps the partner with the most to offer. Once the capital of Baden, it lost out to Stuttgart which became the chief city of the merged Baden Wurttemberg land, but it refused to allow the polarisation of business round its Swabian rival to relegate it to a backwater. The economy of Baden-Wurttemberg has been weakened by its dependence on big employers such as Daimler-Benz, and state unemployment has increased from 4.6 per cent to 6.7 per cent. Karlsruhe, however, has been protected from the worst of the recession by a diverse economy - even though unemployment has increased to 6.5 per cent. The city has developed an economy based on service industries and is home to some of the country's leading research institutions. Nancy, for its part, has been affected by the decline in heavy industry around Lorraine. But, as in its German twin city, unemployment has been contained by the concentration of service companies and large academic institutions. Unemployment In Nancy is 10.4 per cent against a national average of 11.7 per cent in France. Nottingham is having to come to terms with a rundown in the local mining industry, following the decision by British coal to close two nearby pits, and there are fears that the knock-on effects on the local economy could undermine the recovery among local companies. British Coal's decision to close the nearby pits at Silverhill and Cotgrave. Cuts in the mining workforce, according to local authority estimates, could lead to a 15 per cent shrinkage in the area's gross domestic product. That could undermine the recovery among local companies just when they thought they had beaten the UK recession. Unemployment totals in the city, at 11.6 per cent, are already worse than in its continental partners. In some inner city areas the total exceeds 40 per cent. The city retains, however, a diversified industrial base, including the headquarters of one of Britain's biggest companies, Boots the Chemist, the retailing to drugs group. Like Nancy and Karlsruhe, Nottingham has also seen strong growth in services. Recent arrivals in the city include the Inland Revenue and English Heritage. Halle, by contrast, has problems of a different scale, and in theory it has most to learn from its richer neighbours. Once the powerhouse of its region, the unification of Germany has rendered Halle's manufacturing, machine tool and chemical industries uncompetitive, and about 40 per cent of the workforce is unemployed. In the limited time since the partnership was formed the city partners have put in place a number of exchanges between businesses, academics and individuals, but so far they have not been able to take many of their joint initiatives beyond the discussion stage. But some tangible projects are now beginning to emerge. Among these is the establishment of technology regions based on a successful model in Germany. Designed to attract new companies with promises of cheap and readily available factory space and skilled workers, the technology zones have been taken up in all four cities. Universities in each city have also embraced the alliance. There are student and academic exchange programmes under way and a pooling of expertise. For example, a business graduate from Halle could seek the advice of management buy-out research centre in Nottingham. The exchange of expertise has also been taken up by city planners. The main beneficiary of this so far has been Nottingham, where officials developing a rapid transit system have been able to consult executives operating an existing network in Karlsruhe. Inevitably there are some problems in the relationship between the cities; some of the links between them work more effectively than others. These problems are more of tone than of substance, however, and partnership officials are determined to solve them. City leaders backing the Four Cities Partnership believe, too, that investment by the partners in each other's cities will come - given time. They acknowledge that the recession in Europe has delayed their vision, but are adamant that it has not been derailed. All four are determined to press ahead with their alliance, which they regard as a vital building block for future development. They also believe that they are creating a model which other cities and regions across Europe will find well worth examining and adapting to their own needs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, May 5 (BTA) -- "This is a friendly  country, I've come to see friends" -- these were the first words  on Bulgarian soil of Austrian Defence Minister Dr. Werner  Fasslabend. He is visiting at the invitation of Bulgarian  Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov as head of a delegation of  the Austrian Federal Ministry of National Defence. The purpose  of the visit is to specify the forms of future cooperation  between the Defence Ministries and the armies of the two  countries proceeding from the documents which have been signed  so far.    "Cooperation between the military ministries of Austria and  Bulgaria is very good: Their joint work is in the interest of  the smaller European states. Promising achievements have been  made and I am convinced that we will build a good relationship  in a relatively brief period of time", Dr. Fasslabend said after  his meeting with the Bulgarian defence minister. The two sides  discussed the state of bilateral contacts and the political  situation in the Balkans. "We tried to make a general  assessment of the political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Kosovo and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM]. We established that the opinions of the two  governments coincide on almost all issues," Dr. Fasslabend said.  The situation in the former Yugoslavia is of great interest for  both countries," Austria's defence minister told journalists  today. The security of both countries depends to a great extend  on finding an adequate solution to this problem, Dr. Fasslabend  believes.    Though the relations between Bulgaria and Austria are not  burdened by complicated historical circumstances, cooperation  between the armies of the two countries till the fall of the  totalitarian regime in 1989 was reduced to purely symbolical  contacts because of the existing bloc structures in Europe.

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A noisy brawl in a Contra Costa County jail exercise yard at Clayton injured  eight inmates, one seriously, and resulted in the transfer of some men to the  tougher facility at Martinez, officials reported. Chief Deputy Larry Ard said a  free-for-all broke out late Friday night and at its height as many as 100 men  were involved in the outdoor exercise yard. He blamed the outburst on racial  tensions, but another source was reported to have blamed it on friction over  newly transferred women inmates. Ard said most of the injuries were facial cuts  and bruises. One inmate, not identified, was taken to John Muir Hospital with a  neck injury.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- The agreement on civil peace  and accord will be signed by the majority of political forces in  the Kremlin on April 28, upper chamber speaker Vladimir Shumeyko  said in an interview with journalists here on Tuesday. He  claimed that "the influence of constructive forces in society  now is greater than that of right- and left-wing radicals".    In the speaker's opinion, it will become clear at the  agreement's signing ceremony who and why does not sign the  document leading to civil accord. The division of political  forces into groups will be clearly seen at that time. However,  if somebody does not sign the agreement, this will not split the  society, since the document will be open for signing after April  28, he stressed.    Asked about the influence of political forces in Russia's  life, Shumeyko noted that "centrist parties have a prospect to  become influential". This will take place when society will  "outgrow an yearn for rallies". The speaker believes that the  influence of political parties on Russia is now "purely  nominal". In contrast to Moscow, many in provinces do not know  what political parties mean and what their role is. People  judge about them by actions of their leaders.    Shumeyko claimed that the Russian president should not rely  on a single party. He should be "above party movements and rely  on the average derivative in order to find the only correct  solution as head of state".    The speaker noted that "if we are to judge about parties by  factions in the lower chamber, it will be clear that the  situation when communists block democrats' decisions and vice  versa, persists". This leads to the centre's consolidation,  Shumeyko underlined. True, he said with regret, "the centre is  being formed not in favour of reforms".</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right vision for UK industry Sir, Professor Myddelton's view (Letters, May 23) that there is no virtue in companies retaining profits if they cannot invest the funds profitably is typical of the finance/accountant approach which has destroyed British industry. US President Bill Clinton, unveiling his new federal technology policy, has left his country in no doubt that the challenges that lie ahead can only be met by advanced technology based on innovation and R&amp;D investment. 'Investing in technology is investing in America's future.' When will the British come to realise that manufacturing companies must be freed from control by short-sighted lawyers, financiers and accountants in favour of broadly based engineers with the drive, vision and capability required to secure the future?

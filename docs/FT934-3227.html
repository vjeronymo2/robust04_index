			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Erratic session in Rank A rollercoaster ride in Rank Organisation saw the shares jump wildly yesterday in response to contrasting reports. The stock opened brightly, spurred by a heavyweight buy note from Kleinwort Benson which stressed the group's long term recovery potential and its balance of profit centres. After jumping some 15p, the bears were alerted by press reports that Xerox, which co-owns the Rank Xerox subsidiary, had settled a court case in the US at a cost of Dollars 225m. There was further bad news as Xerox announced later in the session a Dollars 700m restructuring charge for its fourth quarter. However, with little guidance said to be forthcoming from Rank, London leisure analysts were unsure how much of this would impact on the UK group's profits, although suggestions of a Pounds 60m hit were being talked down last night. Having been 20 off at one stage, the stock rallied with the market and further consideration of the Xerox news to close 10 ahead at 914p in busy turnover of 2.8m.</p>

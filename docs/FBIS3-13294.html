			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] At a news conference, Lebanese Forces [LF]  Commander Dr. Samir Ja'ja' explained to the public the  circumstances surrounding what happened in Ghidras. He affirmed  that such measures will not change the stands of the party  leadership, which are firm stands over which there can be no  bargaining or pressure. Ja'ja' reminded political and judicial  authorities of their responsibilities.    Dr. Samir Ja'ja' affirmed that what is happening has nothing  to do with the measures the state is taking. He pointed out  that regrettably the state is doing things that harm Lebanon and  hamper its progress. He described this new development as a  mere tightening of the noose round the neck of the LF  headquarters in Ghidras. He clarified that neither laws, nor  regulations, nor the Constitution stipulate that journalists are  banned from entering Ghidras or bringing in the necessary  equipment they need to cover an event. This [the government  action] is not acceptable. If there are any political  authorities in the country, they should allow this. If there  are any judicial authorities, then all such measures should be  decreed by these authorities. Let us listen to part of what Dr.  Ja'ja' said in his news conference which he held last night in  Ghidras. [passage omitted]    [Begin Ja'ja' recording] [passage omitted] I very much  regret that the Lebanese authorities, which are our authorities,  behave in a manner that strips them of all credibility. This is  something that hurts and pains us. These authorities' behavior  shows that they have no self-respect. Our hopes and  expectations are to have authorities respected by everyone  inside and outside the country, but first they should have  self-respect. It is unfortunate for the state to be at a stage  or time where it allows itself everything, dodges all laws,  leaks information, creates news, provides the explanations it  likes, ignores facts, deduces and creates things that are not  there. It is regrettable that a state would do so. [passage  omitted]    The authorities cannot be this [word indistinct]. I will  ignore what has been said, such as statements that these  measures fall within the security arrangements. I do not  understand what security arrangements stipulate that a military  presence should be deployed at the four entrances of a house  that lead only to it. What we are certain of is that we shall  stand firm regarding our stand. If some sides think that they  will be able to change our stand through their behavior they are  very wrong. [passage omitted] [end recording]    In an interview with Radio Monte Carlo, Dr. Ja'ja' affirmed  that the state is losing its final shreds of credibility, which  it could have nurtured to its advantage, without achieving  anything. It is widening the gap between itself and its people.  This is undesirable and achieves nothing. He clarified that  the state is destroying itself through such behavior. [passage  omitted]    Before the news conference he held in Ghidras, Dr. Ja'ja'  asked all citizens and his supporters in various parts of  Lebanon not to react to these government measures and to remain  calm.</p>

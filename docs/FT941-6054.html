			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: CRH advances 33% to IPounds 76.5m - Acquisitions and better profit margins in US provide main growth CRH, the Dublin-based construction and building materials group, reported a 33 per cent increase in 1993 pre-tax profits from IPounds 57.6m to IPounds 76.5m (Pounds 74m) on turnover up 28 per cent to IPounds 1.43bn, against IPounds 1.11m. The strongest growth occurred in the US through acquisitions and improved profit margins. The US now provides a quarter of sales and 32 per cent of trading profits with IPounds 30.1m (IPounds 15.4m). Growth of 5 per cent in construction activity is forecast for 1994. Profit margins in Ireland and on the European mainland were further squeezed in 1993 resulting in trading profits of IPounds 31m (IPounds 32.1m) for Ireland and IPounds 21.9m (IPounds 20.7m) for Europe. Losses continued in Spain offset by strong profit contributions from acquisitions in the Netherlands. Analysts expect the Spanish activities to return to profit with an improvement in market conditions, although this is not expected before 1995. Trading profits for the UK rose to IPounds 11.9m (IPounds 3.96m) and volume growth and improved margins point to further recovery there in 1994. Last September's IPounds 147m rights issue substantially improved the balance sheet, bringing down net year-end borrowings to IPounds 66.6m for gearing of 11 per cent, against 47 per cent a year earlier. The group is in a strong position for further acquisitions, which are being planned in the US and the Benelux countries. Further improvement is expected in the present year due to increased construction in Ireland, the UK and the US, although continued difficult trading is expected in Spain and a slight decline in activity is forecast in the Netherlands. Earnings per share were up 27 per cent to 19.8p (15.6p) and a final dividend of 4.96p is recommended for a total of 7.23p (6.75p). Mr Harry Sheridan, finance director, said dividend cover had improved to 2.55 times, 'which underpins our ability to maintain a policy of steadily increasing the dividend'. COMMENT After two years of falling profits, the group's diversification into the US and European mainland is helping the bottom line. With the exception of Spain, management seems to be coping successfully with bedding-in its acquisitions. The strong balance sheet positions it well to take advantage of recovery in its main markets. Pre-tax profits exceeding IPounds 90m seem likely this year giving a prospective p/e of about 16. This lags far behind CRH's peers, suggesting a buying opportunity. Indeed, non-Irish shareholders increased their stake in the company from 8 per cent to 37 per cent over the past year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva, 8 March -- "Developing countries and states  must not be left on their own to cope with their difficulties on  the path of the creation of democratic societies." This was  stated today in an address at the 50th daily session of the UN  Commission on Human Rights by the head of the Russian  delegation, the human rights representative of the Russian  Federation Sergey Kovalev. After stressing that "Russia, too, is  facing plenty of transition period problems and difficulties,"  he thanked countries and international organizations which had  sent observers to the parliamentary elections and the referendum  on the new Constitution of the Russian Federation for their  assistance.    The Russian representative said that "fruitful contacts" had  been established with the Council of Europe, the Center for  Human Rights [as heard], the United States, the European  countries, and Australia. More than 30 non-government  organizations, including "Amnesty International" and "Helsinki  Watch," had opened missions in the Russian Federation. "We  welcome in every possible way intervention of this kind in  Russia's internal affairs and believe that the more vigorous and  the more large-scale it is, the more hopes and guarantees there  will be that the internal life of Russian society will change  for the better."    "We hope that our partners will not be indifferent to a  problem which is so painful for Russians like the situation of  their compatriots in the countries which previously were part of  the Soviet Union, including Latvia and Estonia. Not only  Russia's democratic future, but also the fate of many states  which were formed after the break-up of the USSR, and in the  final analysis, international peace and security, depend on how  timely and clear their voice is."    After touching on the situation in the Yugoslav conflict  zone, Sergey Kovalev stressed that the presence of Russian  soldiers and officers in Sarajevo is "an example of Russia's  sincere interest in a peaceful settlement of the crisis in  former Yugoslavia." Russian servicemen had come to the Bosnian  capital in order to "prevent further suffering and death in this  town." He warned against an unbalanced approach towards the  Yugoslav crisis and attempts to blame one of the conflicting  sides for everything, "to play down the crimes by one side and  to indulge yet another side." Inevitably such an approach "will  hamper the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the conflict  and will undermine trust in the Commission on Human Rights."    The address voiced concern at the situation in the human  rights sphere in Iraq, Iran, Myanmar, and Afghanistan. "So far  the problem of the release of former servicemen has not been  resolved," the head of the delegation said. "Some Afghanistani  politicians are continuing to block this issue. Our position is  that the problem of prisoners of war is of a strictly  humanitarian nature and needs to be solved immediately and  without linkage to any conditions whatsoever."    "We are disappointed by the lack of progress in ensuring  human rights in Cuba, for whose people Russia has the warmest  feelings," Sergey Kovalev said. "We call on the Cuban  authorities to ensure democratic rights and freedoms and also to  establish cooperation with the Commission's special rapporteur."    After recalling that at the 48th session of the Commission  on  Human Rights the Russian delegation "had raised the issue of the  arbitrariness of the state bodies of North Korea vis-a-vis DPRK  citizens at timber procurement enterprises in Russia," he said  that "at the Russian side's initiative the bilateral agreement  between Russian and the DPRK on cooperation in the sphere of  timber procurement, in spite of considerable financial  advantages, had been cancelled." In future such an agreement is  possible only "given the observance of the rights and freedoms  of the individual and the respect of Russian legislation."</p>

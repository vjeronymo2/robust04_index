			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Condoms at a pep rally scavenger hunt resulted in the suspension of eight  members of the Sutter High School cheerleading squad in Marysville. The  cheerleaders organized a scavenger hunt at a rally last week and used a list  that included the item "protection." Two male students provided the condoms and  turned them in with the other items. "We just don't think it's appropriate that  they should be displayed in public in our campus," said Vice Principal Douglas  Andreasen. "We feel it's a personal item that should be kept personal." The  mothers of three of the cheerleaders tried to talk to school officials  Thursday, but were told to make an appointment for a later date. Andreasen said  the male students who provided the condoms were not punished.  </P></p>

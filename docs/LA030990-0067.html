			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIAN FREEDOM MOVES PUT U.S. IN AWKWARD SPOT;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: AMERICA HAS NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED THE BALTIC STATES' INCORPORATION. BUT  IT DOESN'T WANT TO OFFEND MOSCOW NOW.  </P> <P> The United States is preparing for a particularly awkward turn in a 50-year  diplomatic minuet if Lithuania, as expected, declares itself independent of the  Soviet Union this weekend, U.S. and Lithuanian officials acknowledged Thursday.  </P> <P> The United States has never recognized the incorporation of Lithuania and its  two Baltic neighbors, Estonia and Latvia, into the Soviet Union in the opening  days of World War II. During much of the Cold War, Washington called on Moscow  to grant freedom to the three "captive nations."  </P> <P> But as that goal approaches reality in Lithuania, the United States has been  leaning over backward to avoid offending Moscow, which could reduce Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's willingness to allow secession. Instead of  calling for "independence" or "freedom" in the Baltics, for example, the United  States has said it supports "self-determination."  </P> <P> And now, as the new Lithuanian Parliament prepares to vote on formal  independence, Washington has indicated it will continue to tip-toe through the  legal and diplomatic complexities.  </P> <P> In response to a question Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret  Tutwiler repeated that "the United States does not recognize the forcible  incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into the Soviet Union. We  believe that all parties to these disputes should settle their differences  peacefully."  </P> <P> Tutwiler warned that little more will be said in the immediate future, however,  as the United States seeks to keep a low profile while it assesses its next  moves, such as whether to recognize a new government in Lithuania and how to  change the almost bizarre diplomatic relationship between Washington and  Vilnius.  </P> <P> At present, the U.S. consul general in Leningrad represents American interests  in Lithuania and the two other Baltic states. He periodically visits their  capitals to reassert the U.S. position that those states are not recognized as  part of the Soviet Union. He does not call on the top government leaders who  were imposed by Moscow lest the contacts suggest they are regarded as  legitimate representatives of the people.  </P> <P> The U.S. ambassador in Moscow, for his part, never visits the Baltic capitals.  But a former U.S. diplomat in Moscow said the U.S. ambassador can visit the  Baltic countryside. This results in an extraordinary division of responsibility  between U.S. diplomats "at the city limits" of those capitals, he said.  </P> <P> In the future, now that fair elections have been held in Lithuania, contacts  between U.S. diplomats and Lithuania's new legislature may occur, the official  predicted.  </P> <P> "We might actually seek out those people who have been popularly elected, while  still avoiding most of the government officials," he said. Yet he acknowledged  that deciding which Lithuanians are legitimate representatives of the people  would probably be more difficult.  </P> <P> Beyond these peculiarities, "our main concern now is not to turn the delicate  situation (in Lithuania) into a confrontation" between Moscow and Vilnius, a  U.S. official explained.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian Parliament is expected to declare independence, or perhaps a  goal of eventual independence, after which "acceptable solutions should be  negotiated" to the complex legal, economic and political problems arising from  the divorce, the official said.  </P> <P> The Lithuanian charge d'affaires in Washington, Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., said "we  understand fully the U.S. position."  </P> <P> "There is no point in offending or irritating the Soviets, and if something  happened to Gorbachev, the next man may not be better. The day will come one  day to exchange ambassadors (between Washington and Vilnius), but not now,"  Lozoraitus said.  </P> <P> "Also, it would be incorrect to recognize a new government which has no real  powers yet," he added. "After the vote, Lithuania will still be part of the  Soviet Union in practical terms for some time."  </P> <P> The Parliament must pass new laws regarding ownership, and agreements must be  reached with Moscow on separating a myriad of interlocking systems and  institutions, from telephone and transportation networks to banks and military  forces.  </P></p>

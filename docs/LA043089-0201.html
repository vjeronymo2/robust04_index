			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INVISIBLE TOXIC EMISSIONS CAST A CLOUD OVER 'CLEAN' FIRMS  </P> <P> The collection of buildings on West Bernardo Drive is a showcase of clean  industry: manicured lawns and freshly planted trees sweep up to angular  structures where hundreds of workers assemble television parts and electronic  circuitry.  </P> <P> There are no clouds of menacing black smoke coming from the factory stacks of  Unisys, Sony, Northern Telecom and Hewlett-Packard, all situated a mile up the  hill from a major housing development, gasoline stations and several new  hotels.  </P> <P> But the suburban scene doesn't mean these high-tech factories west of  Interstate 15 are pollution-free. In fact, recently released government figures  show that the four companies released nearly 50,000 pounds -- about 25 tons --  of colorless toxic substances into the air in 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Figures Compiled Nationwide  </P> <P> And they are far from the worst. In all, the county's largest manufacturers  spewed 2,519 to 2,534 tons of toxics and carcinogens into San Diego skies  during 1987, according to the figures, released under a new federal  Environmental Protection Agency program.  </P> <P> The San Diego numbers were among those compiled by the EPA nationwide to  determine how much toxic material industry is dumping into the air, water and  land. Under the federal community "right to know" law, the nation's largest  manufacturing plants were required to report their emissions beginning in 1987,  with smaller firms to be phased in later.  </P> <P> The first compilation of figures, made public last month, reveals that industry  dumped nearly 112.5 million tons of toxics into the environment nationwide, an  amount three times greater than first thought. Although cautious to draw  conclusions from the raw numbers, EPA officials said the figures are "startling  and unacceptably high."  </P> <P> In San Diego County, environmental activists were just as critical of the  amounts and types of substances released.  </P> <P> "If you look at the numbers realistically, you can't come to a conclusion that  industry is being a responsible San Diego citizen," said Ted Nordhaus, who  directs a local toxic-use reduction campaign for CalPIRG, a statewide  environmental watchdog group. "They are exposing the community to tremendous  health hazards.  </P> <P> "Your fate ends up being determined on which way the wind is blowing, and that  gets a little scary . . . " Nordhaus said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Substitutes Needed  </P> <P> Diane Takvorian, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Health  Coalition, agreed, adding that the numbers show that the current governmental  philosophy of "managing" potentially hazardous substances isn't working. The  answer is to make industry find environmentally safe substitutes for toxic  chemicals, she said.  </P> <P> "The reality is that we don't use them very safely," Takvorian said. "In fact,  the rate of air pollution is not decreasing, it's increasing."  </P> <P> But Bill Anderson, executive vice president of the Industrial Environmental  Assn. of San Diego, said many of the San Diego companies reporting their 1987  emissions are working to reduce the releases of toxic and environmentally  damaging gases from their plants.  </P> <P> He also said there is no proof that the toxic air emissions pose a public  health hazard.  </P> <P> "It is absolutely safe," said Anderson, whose industrial trade group includes  environmental officers from some of the companies reporting the greatest volume  of toxic releases under the EPA program.  </P> <P> "I think (the figures) should be reviewed, carefully evaluated with all the  rules and regulations that we have, because we live in this community along  with everyone else," he said. "And we are just as anxious to make sure that we  live in a community that is free of adverse pollutants."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2.2 Pounds Per Person  </P> <P> In all, EPA statistics show that 51 San Diego County companies, many of them  near populated areas, reported at least 2,519 tons of toxic air pollution  during 1987. The total amounted to about 2.2 pounds of airborne toxics for  every man, woman and child in the county.  </P> <P> Statistics also show that:  </P> <P> * More than half the toxic releases, or 1,367 tons, were made up of three  suspected carcinogens: methylene chloride, tetrachloroethylene and propylene  oxide. Preliminary scientific screening indicates that the last two substances  are suspected of causing, in addition to cancer, infertility and either genetic  or birth defects.  </P> <P> Two other compounds used as solvents in the high-tech industry made up another  26% of the county's toxic air releases. Freon 113 and 1,1,1-trichloroethane are  both known to deplete the Earth's ozone layer; the latter is suspected of  causing infertility and birth defects.  </P> <P> * Only 1,444 tons, or about 57%, of the air pollution came from industry  smokestacks, traditionally the site where companies connect pollution-control  devices.  </P> <P> The rest of the 1987 emissions, about 1,075 tons, or 43%, were classified as  "fugitive," meaning they were released straight into the atmosphere through  ventilation systems or evaporation.  </P> <P> "Basically, these are unanticipated and are uncontrolled and they don't know  where they are going," Takvorian said of the fugitive releases.  </P> <P> * Signet Armorlite, a San Marcos optical lens manufacturer, was the company  with the highest toxic emissions during 1987. The company, in an industrial  park a few blocks south of Palomar College, dumped nearly 450 tons of toxics  into the air, the EPA figures show.  </P> <P> The bulk of the company's emissions consisted of the suspected carcinogen  methylene chloride, which is used to clean the lenses for inspection. Company  President Richard Ormsby said this week that his company's use of the chemical,  which is unregulated by local air pollution officials, is increasing.  </P> <P> Caspian, a Kearny Mesa firm that chemically "mills" airplane parts, reported  the second-highest amount of emissions, with 417 tons. Most of that was  carcinogenic tetrachloroethylene, which the company uses in a process to reduce  the weight of the parts.  </P> <P> "It's bad news, we admit to it," Caspian President Cyrus Jaffari said in an  interview this week.  </P> <P> Jaffari said the problem with emissions bothered him so much that he committed  85% of the firm's net worth in a quest over the past two years to finding a  substitute for solvent-based chemicals such as tetrachloroethylene, which is  also used in the dry-cleaning business.  </P> <P> The gamble has paid off, said Jaffari, and Caspian has found a way to use  environmentally safe, water-based compounds to take the place of the toxic  chemicals. The result: The company is expected to reduce its toxic emissions to  only 1 1/2 tons, he said.  </P> <P> "We want to stay in this business, and we are dedicated to the proposition that  it can be done without damaging the environment," Jaffari said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Installing New Scrubbers  </P> <P> Likewise, officials of Kelco, in Logan Heights at the foot of the San  Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, are spending $2.5 million to install new scrubbers  this summer to remove 90% of their emissions. EPA figures show that the  kelp-processing plant was the No. 3 company for dumping toxics into the air,  with a total of 344 tons.  </P> <P> Most of that was propylene oxide, a substance Kelco uses to make food  emulsifiers, said Don E. Conner, the company's manager of community and  government affairs. The substance was also recently added to the state's list  of suspected carcinogens.  </P> <P> Conner said propylene oxide has been used by Kelco for 20 years and that the  amount of the substance is "diluted" when it comes out of the company's  smokestack.  </P> <P> "In our experience with this, we are not aware of any type of chronic health  problem with our workers or anybody else," Conner said. But he added that the  new scrubbers should virtually eliminate any worry.  </P> <P> On a smaller scale, in scenic Rancho Bernardo, a company spokesman for Unisys  said his company's 1987 release of 3.6 tons of 1,1,1-trichloroethane translates  into an amount well below the federal health standard of 350 parts per million  for worker exposure.  </P> <P> "By the time that is disbursed in the airstream and it goes a mile, you are  going to be less than any 350 parts per million," said Gary Garrison, Unisys'  manager for safety and the environment. "If you were standing up on our roof  with your nose in our exhaust, you might get enough there to make you sick to  your stomach."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Plans to Stop  </P> <P> At Signet Armorlite, the county's biggest toxic emitter, Ormsby said his  company will continue its heavy use of suspected carcinogenic methylene  chloride unless the EPA and the county's Air Pollution Control District express  concern over health hazards.  </P> <P> "We expect the Air Pollution Control District to provide us that input if there  is that type of concern," Ormsby said. "In the case of methylene chloride . . .  we have never heard that concern expressed.  </P> <P> "We report our usage to the APCD and the EPA yearly," he said. "We never have  been cited for using this material, and it is a non-regulated solvent. Until  this time, we have had no contact by any agency relative to its usage and vapor  release."  </P> <P> Dick Smith, the APCD's deputy director, said the agency has no reason to ask  the company to reduce its emissions of the suspected carcinogen, although the  state is developing regulations for the substance.  </P> <P> "We have no real reason to believe they are creating a local health problem,"  Smith said, adding that the agency has not received complaints from the  company's workers or of health problems in areas near Signet's San Marcos  plant.  </P> <P> But Takvorian, of the Environmental Health Coalition, said it would be foolish  for the district to wait for health complaints before forcing Signet to curtail  its emissions of the suspected carcinogen.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Onus on Companies  </P> <P> "Down the street, at Palomar (College), there's hundreds of thousands of young  people who have been exposed to some concentration of this material," Takvorian  said. "We probably won't know what the effects will have been. They are  experimental guinea pigs . . . . "  </P> <P> Although Takvorian applauded companies like Caspian for voluntarily reducing  the amount of toxic emissions by finding environmentally safe substitutes, she  also said the recent EPA figures should put the onus on local companies to  "prove that these chemicals are safe" for workers and those living near the  plants.  </P> <P> "We don't want to wait around for the health studies to prove that these people  will get cancer or did get cancer. We want to protect them before they get  cancer.  </P> <P> "We want to reverse the system," Takvorian said. "People are innocent until  proven guilty. Chemicals are guilty until proven innocent."  </P> <P> LARGEST VOLUMNE OF 1987 TOXIC AIR EMISSIONS BY CHEMICAL  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.43IN:2.66IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW>

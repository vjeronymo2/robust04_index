			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CURRIE CONDUCTS SCOTTISH EVENING  </P> <P> "A Scottish Celebration," presented by the Los Angeles Master Chorale and  Sinfonia Orchestra in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center, was no  mere potpourri of ethnic hit tunes in arrangements beefed up for a big hall.  </P> <P> True, canny Music Director John Currie did allow for more voices and  instruments than seem to fit the Scottish tradition of narrative songs (14 out  of 17 by Robert Burns), and his arrangements of the animated tunes tended to  the loud and slapdash.  </P> <P> But tenderness and intimacy were available as well: the sopranos alone  ("Willie's Fair"), the whole Chorale in hushed pianissimo ( "The Winter of  Life"), a loving account of "Annie Laurie."  </P> <P> However, the guests from Scotland really sparked the cumulative effect and  deeper experience Saturday night, nothing less than the baring of the Scottish  soul through music.  </P> <P> Jean Redpath must be considered an indispensable ingredient of any such  occasion. The renowned Scottish folk singer held the assemblage spellbound by  the simplest yet rarest means: total love of and identification with her  material and peerless artistry in its presentation.  </P> <P> Folk fiddler Alasdair Fraser's solo turn ran the expressive gamut from deep  Celtic melancholy to joyful jig, his fiddle imitations of the bagpipe almost  unbelievable, the whole rendered with a humble sincerity, flawless virtuosity  and just about the sweetest violin sound since Fritz Kreisler.

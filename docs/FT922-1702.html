			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: Schubertiade moves house HAS SCHUBERT moved house for good? The Schubertiade letter-head still reads Schubertiade Hohenems even though it has moved, lock, stock and barrel, to nearby Feldkirch (like Hohenems, a medieval town in the Vorarlberg). Last year the move might have seemed temporary; the main Hohenems venue, its medieval palace, had been renovated and was hosting an exhibition. This year (it opened on June 12) it begins to look permanent. Why? It has partly been a question of facilities. The Hohenems palace seats only 300 people and the authorities have been too short-sighted to provide any alternative. Feldkirch, with 27,000 inhabitants, is twice as big and can boast a concert hall, the Montforthaus, with room for 1,100 people. The Feldkirchers have also created other venues, like the courtyard of the local fortress (200 seats) and an open air stage in the forest (500). Above all they have renovated a hall with room for 500 in the local music conservatory, the former Jesuit school of Stella Matutina. Their dynamism has even created a brand-new headquarters for the festival administration in a new square by the river Ill (the Schubertplatz, naturally) and a rustic footbridge over one of its tributaries leading to the open-air theatre and the mountainside beyond. You begin to wonder whether the special flavour of the Schubertiade won't suffer. Of course, growth was inevitable. There were only 3,000 tickets sold for the inaugural event in 1976; seven times as many are sold today. This growth may not continue too dangerously. This is essentially a festival of lieder, piano and chamber music. That means a strictly limited, self-selecting public. There will never be popular operas here, so the danger of the place developing into a second Salzburg is remote. The intimacy should remain, and with it the charm of being able to bump into Brendel or Peter Schreier on your afternoon walk. Musical standards also seem secure. This year you could hear singers like Schreier and Olaf Baer, Gruberova, Margaret Price and Fassbaender in the space of a couple of weeks (Fassbaender will also exhibit some of her own paintings). The Emerson and Alban Berg quartets are here. And best of all, Andras Schiff is playing all 18 Schubert piano sonatas. The Schubertiade is a rare bird among musical events in being self-supporting. The annual budget - 9-12m Austrian schillings, say Pounds 0.5m - is met entirely from ticket sales; seats range from Pounds 15-Pounds 40 for average recitals, rising to Pounds 25-Pounds 80 for major events, including orchestral concerts. This year about 23,000 tickets have been sold. Of the patrons, a quarter come from Austria, 40 per cent from Germany and 20 per cent from Switzerland; Britain, with 5 per cent, is well ahead of the other non-German countries. On average each spectator attends four events. That means serious money. I was told that between 15,000 and 18,000 hotel beds are booked over the 18 days of the festival; the patrons spend a further estimated Pounds 1m. One can only wonder at the Hohenemsers letting their share of that go. Franz Schubert means hard cash today, unlike in his lifetime; I wonder if he will ever move back to Hohenems.</p>

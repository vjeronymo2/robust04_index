			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE BUY SITE NEAR ANAHEIM STADIUM  </P> <P> A six-story office building near Anaheim Stadium has been sold for $19.7  million to a Japanese company, which plans to add two more office towers to the  7.6-acre site, negotiators of the deal said Monday.  </P> <P> Tobishima Development Co. Inc. bought the building on the northwest corner of  the intersection of Orangewood Avenue and State College Boulevard in Anaheim  from Connecticut Life Insurance Co.  </P> <P> Tobishima, a California subsidiary of Tokyo-based Tobishima Corp., an  engineering and construction company, already owns four county buildings, all  in Santa Ana: two office towers at Hutton Centre, the Ebasco Building at 3000  West MacArthur Boulevard and another at 2020 E. 1st Street.  </P> <P> Jim Kniest, director of marketing/acquisitions for Hutton Development Co., said  Tobishima plans to build two more high-rises of 10 and 12 stories at the  Anaheim site. The new buildings will more than quadruple the amount of office  space to 586,000 square feet, he said.  </P> <P> Hutton Development Co. has been a partner with Tobishima Development in its  county real estate ventures for three years, Kniest said.  </P> <P> Tobishima owns 50% of Hutton Development, he said.  </P> <P> The newly purchased office complex now called State College Plaza will be  renamed Hutton Stadium Centre, Kniest added. Ground breaking on the 12-story  building is scheduled for the first quarter of next year.  </P> <P> Kniest said the Anaheim purchase, completed July 12, reflects Tobishima's  interest in the potential of the central county office market.  </P></p>

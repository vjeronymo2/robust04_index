			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Technology: Revamping liquid crystal displays - Worth Watching Liquid crystal displays, seen today in notebook computers, are tipped as the successor to the cathode ray tube in television sets. But to achieve acceptance researchers have still to make LCDs less expensive, more compact and more reliable. GEC's Hirst Research Centre, in London, has demonstrated a technique for etching the drive circuitry on the same piece of glass as the screen, which could contribute to this. As well as reducing the size, the technique does away with the need for an expensive quartz substrate and other components. The method also increases reliability because it reduces the number of connections needed to join each pixel, or picture element, to a transistor. Hirst Research Centre: UK, 081 908 9000.</p>

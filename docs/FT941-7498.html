			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Four directors at Lonrho to receive Pounds 2.4m Payments totalling more than Pounds 2.4m are being paid to four Lonrho directors, aged between 64 and 77, who are leaving the international trading group's board. In a highly unusual compensation package, the company is asking shareholders to approve payments of Pounds 772,624 each to Mr Paul Spicer and Mr Robert Dunlop, both deputy chairmen, aged 64 and 66. Meanwhile, the 74-year-old chairman Mr Rene Leclezio will receive Dollars 732,000 (Pounds 491,000) and Pounds 120,000 in other payments. Sir Peter Youens, 77, gets Pounds 300,000. The payments are bigger than each director's one-year contractual entitlement because no director can be removed from the board without its unanimous consent. In other words, a director can only be removed with his consent. Lonrho's accounts, published yesterday, also disclose that the group's 76-year-old founder and joint chief executive, Mr Tiny Rowland, who has no plans to retire, received remuneration last year totalling Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 1.65m). The payments to the four directors are bigger than expected because each will remain a director of a Lonrho subsidiary until December 31, 1998. Their remuneration for these directorships is part of their packages. Mr Dieter Bock, joint chief executive with Mr Rowland, believes the payouts are justified because it gives him control of the board. The four are closely identified with Mr Rowland, who has resisted some of Mr Bock's plans to transform Lonrho into a more orthodox company. A spokesman for Mr Bock said: 'There is nothing to explain about the payments which represent two years' salary. The four will remain directors of a subsidiary they have been closely identified with.' Lonrho's institutional investors have already indicated to Mr Bock that they will support the compensation arrangements. One of the company's biggest shareholders said: 'Lonrho is proposing to pay out a huge amount of money to persuade old directors to step down when the retiring age of directors at most companies is 65. However, in these circumstances we believe it still represents good value for money.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["uhl"-initialed report: "Government Too Optimistic"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 13 Apr -- In the view of Uwe Jens, economic  policy spokesman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany  Bundestag group, the Federal Government is interpreting the  "meager signs of economic recovery" far too optimistically.  Even if the GNP were to be about 1 percent higher in 1994 than  it was in 1993, this does not change anything concerning the  economic and, above all, the difficult long-term structural  problems. Therefore, an "active German and European economic  policy" is necessary. Thus, the Bundesbank should lower the  prime rate to about 3 to 4 percent by June. The European Union  must decide quickly on its infrastructure program of about 29  billion German marks. After the signing of the new GATT  agreement, the agreed reduction of trade barriers are to be  implemented quickly. In addition, an innovation offensive  should be started, Jens said.</p>

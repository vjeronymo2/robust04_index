			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- Contacts between North  Korea and European banks and businesses have become brisk with  inter-Korean consultations almost suspended, relevant  authorities and business sources here said Monday.    A few European banks, including ING (Internationale  Netherlanden Bank M.V.) of the Netherlands, are consulting with  North Korea on establishing offices in Pyongyang and U.S.  multinational corporations such as McKinsey Inc. and IBM Corp.  are trying to advance into the communist state, the sources said.    North Korean imports of machinery and social infrastructure  goods, including telecommunications equipment from Europe, have  risen sharply from last year, according to the sources. In  contrast, South-North economic cooperation has made no headway  since last year as the nuclear dispute has chilled inter-Korean  relations.    North Korea's efforts to get closer to European banks and  U.S. multinational corporations are designed to revitalize its  economy by inducing investment and obtaining loans from foreign  banks and businesses. For example, a North Korean economic  mission toured European nations including Britain, Germany and  Austria late last year to hold seminars aimed at attracting  investment to the Najin-Sonbong special economic zone. Thanks to  such efforts, foreign banks have begun paying more attention to  North Korea.    ING bank is seeking to establish a liaison office in  Pyongyang -- a first for Western banks -- while Australia and  New Zealand (ANZ) bank is pushing for a Pyongyang office to  secure a bridgehead there.    Banks from Britain, Germany and Switzerland are also  consulting with North Korea, according to the sources.    McKinsey Inc. of the United States has contacted North Korea  through its firms in South Korea, Japan and Europe, and IBM's  British subsidiary sent staff to the isolated state last summer  to provide technical training.    Thailand dispatched a large-scale economic mission to North  Korea recently to discuss a 50-year lease at Najin port and to  secure real estate within the Najin-Sonbong special economic  zone.</p>

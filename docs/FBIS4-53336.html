			<p>BFN     [Text] Nara, May 18 KYODO -- Representatives from Chinese  and Japanese municipalities sharing sister-city ties are taking  part in a two-day symposium that opened Wednesday [18 May] to  mark more than 20 years of friendly cultural exchanges.    Some 160 participants, including 20 Chinese delegates from  cities such as Xian and Shanghai, will discuss ideas on further  promoting exchanges and mutual understanding.    The delegates are expected to offer ideas on youth exchanges  as well as city planning and management, organizers said.    The conference, hosted by the Japan-China Friendship  Association, is the first of its kind to be held on such a large  scale, organizers said.    The western Japanese port city of Kobe and Tianjin,  southeast  of Beijing, were the first to conclude sister-city ties in June  1973 and since then some 150 similar sets of ties have been  established.    Nara was selected as the site of the symposium because of  the  ancient capital's history of dispatching envoys to China from  the seventh to ninth centuries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, June 7 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni warplanes  have attacked northern oil installations for the first time  since the civil war began a month ago, Western oil industry  sources in Sanaa said Tuesday [7 June].    The southerners had vowed to retaliate after Aden's oil  refinery was bombed on Sunday and storage tanks set ablaze.    A Western oil official said that two planes dropped bombs  near one of the facilities in the Ma'rib oil field in north  eastern Yemen early Monday but there was no damage.    The official news agency SABA' said the attack by southern  warplanes was "unsuccessful" and that the jets were driven off  by northern jets.    The oil company Yemen Hunt Oil, a local subsidiary of the  Dallas-based Hunt Oil, is still operating in the Ma'rib field  neighboring the Shabwah region.    The Ma'rib zone produces 320,000 bpd, nearly all of Yemen's  output.</p>

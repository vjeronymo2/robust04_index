			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN ANONYMITY OF CALLER IS LOST, WE'RE THAT CLOSER TO A SURVEILLANCE SOCIETY  </P> <P> The people who brought us call-forwarding and call-waiting have done it again  -- this time in the form of call-identification. Telephone customers in many  parts of the country who are willing to spend an extra $6 a month will soon be  able to know the number from which an incoming call was dialed before they pick  up their phone. This service requires purchasing a video display device that  keeps a record of the time and phone number of incoming calls.  </P> <P> The system offers many advantages. It can deter (or determine the origin of)  crank calls and false alarms. It will provide the location of persons who  request emergency help. It can mean faster consumer services (a sales  representative can have your record displayed even as the phone is being  answered). Burglars who telephone to be sure that no one is home may be  identified by the phone number they unwittingly leave. Call-identification  permits screening calls (you don't answer if it's a tiresome relative).  </P> <P> People calling know your number; isn't it only fair that you should know  theirs?  </P> <P> Not necessarily. There may be times when an imbalance in the relationship is  desirable. Anonymity has positive as well as negative consequences. Persons  with unlisted phone numbers may involuntarily have to reveal them. The calls to  law- enforcement and counseling hot lines may decline because of the suspicion  that anonymity is no longer guaranteed.  </P> <P> Those calling for information about goods and services may receive an avalanche  of unwanted phone and mail solicitations, particularly if their names are  distributed by a mass-marketing company.  </P> <P> The new visibility encroaches on white lies, spontaneity and quiet personal  detective work. Our sense of autonomy and self are enmeshed in a complex web of  privacy, secrecy, diplomacy and fabrication. Anything that curtails social  maneuverability and alters these delicate relationships, whatever its other  benefits, is likely to be morally ambiguous.  </P> <P> The increased ease of verifying location might be thought to make people more  honest, but this is balanced by the fact that a record will be left of the act  of verification. Thus, if you invite friends to a party and they say they can't  come because of an obligation at home, you may be less likely to call to check  if they were telling the truth since there will be a record that you called.  Knowing that, they may be more likely to lie.  </P> <P> Supervision in the home will become more intensive and democratic. Spouses,  parents and children will find it easier to check up on each other. The spouse  who is visiting a friend can no longer call home and say that he or she is  working late; the teen-ager prohibited from associating with a certain person  will find it more difficult to take calls from that person, while pretending to  be talking to someone else. Gone is the freedom to hang up if a person we do  not want to talk to answers, or if we develop second thoughts about making the  call.  </P> <P> The consequences of the service will depend partly on how it is offered.  Callers could be told that the line they have reached has call-identification  and be given the option of hanging up before their number is revealed. Or  callers could be told that they can block call-identification by entering  several digits. Or callers could be denied any controls and their number  displayed without their knowledge or consent. The latter will be the case for  callers in New York and New England served by Nynex. The interests of the  receiver are put above those of the caller. In the system proposed by Pacific  Telesis for its West Coast customers, callers will be able to block the display  of their number.  </P> <P> The West Coast offering is far superior. It preserves the caller's privacy, but  not at a cost of being unable to make the phone call. Those receiving the call  would be given some information that the party calling did not want his or her  number revealed. Crank callers could still be identified through another new  phone company service -- call-tracing.  </P> <P> In their marketing research the phone companies discovered that West Coast  customers were much more concerned with privacy protection than were East Coast  customers. But when matters of principle are at stake, marketing research ought  not to prevail. There are important questions of informed consent and privacy  here. As phone company customers, we are both callers and receivers and the  interests of both ought to be served.  </P> <P> Call-identification is a small eddy in a torrent of new information-gathering  technologies that are turning us into a transparent or surveillance society.  Liberty to do good or evil partly resides in the cracks of inefficient  technology. As these are patched, our vigilance must increase.  </P></p>

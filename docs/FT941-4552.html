			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru's blossoming desert goes on the market - Irrigation is filling the only gap in an otherwise perfect climate A strange sight greets the visitor to Peru's northern coastal desert. Men and women trudge along furrows apparently ploughed in the sand. From time to time they pounce, burrow with their bare hands and come up with a long white object resembling a stick. They are harvesting white asparagus. White asparagus, unlike green, must be grown underground to avoid photosynthesis; and the unpromising-looking desert soil of Peru's desert coast is an ideal medium - zero precipitation means no diseases and funguses attack plants. The cold Humboldt Pacific current keeps temperatures exceptionally stable, ensuring a sort of permanent spring, which is perfect for cultivation and year-round harvesting of almost any crop known to man. All the Peruvian desert needs is irrigation, and the capital to install it. Not surprisingly, the leaders in drip irrigation technology are the Israelis and the Peruvians are learning fast from them. 'With the climate Peru enjoys, plus water, we have unparalleled comparative advantages here,' says Mr Alon Lidai, local representative of Netafim, an Israeli drip irrigation company. On a 11-hectare pilot asparagus farm, formerly useless desert, Mr Lidai and the Peruvian owner are growing top-quality asparagus and exporting to Germany. The ultimate in high-tech irrigation costs Dollars 2,800 a hectare installed. Annual costs, including water, labour and fertilisers (large quantities are required on this poor soil) are around Dollars 5,000 leaving a good Dollars 7,000 a hectare profit - very substantial for a Peruvian farmer. Now a first 14,770-hectare lot of newly, irrigated desert land, is coming on to the commercial market. The Peruvian government, through the national development institute, Inade, is selling off to private investors the lands within the initial ambit of the vast Chavimochic irrigation scheme. 'It's the first time in over 25 years - since General Velasco's 'land reform' - that it's possible to buy large extensions of land,' says Mr Rodolfo Masuda, Peru's vice-minister for agriculture. 'The intention is to allow the private sector, national or foreign, to bring about the agricultural advances we need.' The Chavimochic project - an 80-year old dream for the people who live in the Chao, Viru, Moche and Chicama valleys near Trujillo, from which the scheme takes its name - started to become a reality in 1987. The Santa River, one of Peru's most bountiful, has been partially diverted, its waters channeled through 85km of impressive canals and tunnels across the Andean foothills. Eventually, the Santa waters will benefit a total of 133,000 hectares (bringing 59,000 new hectares into production and supplying another 74,000 with permanent water). Under the philosophy of the Fujimori government - ironically the extreme opposite of the preceding Garcia regime, which launched Chavimochic and obtained start-up funding from the Banco do Brasil - the state has no role in productive activity. It will sell off the modern, unused tomato paste plant, originally intended to generate foreign exchange earnings to finance the loan. It will award a concession to a private company to maintain and operate the infrastructure of headwater intake, canals and so on. And it will make farmers, for the first time ever, pay the 'real' cost of the water. Mr Masuda is relatively optimistic about sale prospects. He hopes some large food processing consortia will buy the Chavimochic lands (they can acquire up to 1,000 hectares), install plants and bring new technology. They will also provide the marketing skills and contacts as yet lacking in Peru. The model tomato paste processing plant in the Chao valley is scheduled for sale in April or May. It comes with 1,000 already-irrigated hectares and has capacity to produce 21,000 tonnes of paste a year. World prices have recently surged from around Dollars 650 a tonne to Dollars 800 or so, raising hopes for a successful sale. Several large Japanese companies are reported to be interested. Apart from the area that accompanies the Chao plant, however, the Chavimochic lands require substantial further investment. Secondary channels must be built to run water off from the main canal, the land prepared and high-tech irrigation equipment installed. Costs could run between Dollars 5,000 and Dollars 6,000 a hectare, on top of the average Dollars 1,450 base price being asked. Sceptics say it is possible to acquire irrigated land in other Peruvian valleys for a third of that price. Prospects for real development at Chavimochic are likely to hinge on the big investor who has the bucks to back the vision.</p>

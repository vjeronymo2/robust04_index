			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Record Caterpillar result in spite of UAW strike Caterpillar, the US producer of construction machinery, reported record sales and profits in the third quarter, in spite of a continuing strike by its United Autoworkers' union employees. The company said earnings jumped on a 19 per cent increase in sales of engines and machinery, and that the strike had no significant impact on its bottom line. Caterpillar earned Dollars 244m, or Dollars 1.20 a share, in the quarter, up from Dollars 142m, or 72 cents, in the corresponding 1993 quarter. Sales were Dollars 3.51bn, compared with Dollars 2.81bn in the third quarter last year. News of the results drove Caterpillar's share price up Dollars 2 to close at Dollars 58 1/4 on Wall Street, where analysts had expected the company to return 85 cents a share. For the first nine months the company earned Dollars 676m, or Dollars 3.32 a share, on sales of Dollars 10.4bn, compared with last year's Dollars 533m, or Dollars 2.64 a share, on sales of Dollars 8.4bn. The strike, which began on June 21 and covers 14,000 employees at eight Caterpillar plants in the Midwest, left nearly 6,000 salaried and management employees to man the assembly lines during the quarter. The company also brought in contract workers, called back retirees and hired new full-time employees to meet production schedules. The costs of alternative labour offset any savings garnered from not paying striking employees, the company said. Mr James Owens, Caterpillar's chief financial officer, said the company was prepared to continue to operate in this mode indefinitely. Mr Owens said the company was not asking customers to delay deliveries, but that shipments of many products were being made based on the urgency of customer needs. Caterpillar said that it expected a strong fourth quarter and forecast higher worldwide sales in 1995.</p>

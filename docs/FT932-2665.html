			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce busy Trading volume in aero engine maker Rolls-Royce rose to 4.2m shares in good two-way business after suggestions in the market that Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, may be planning to issue a warrant enabling overseas buyers to continue purchasing the stock, although foreign ownership levels are already at maximum permitted levels. Rolls-Royce announced a week ago that foreign ownership of its shares had reached 29.5 per cent, the maximum allowed by the company's articles of association. As things stand, any further purchases by non-UK investors would have to be relinquished or transferred to UK ownership, as soon as the company confirms the purchases. However, Rolls-Royce said last week it would take no immediate action in the hope that its announcement would itself reduce further foreign purchases. The suggested move by Goldman Sachs would appear to offer an alternative investment entry for overseas investors, for whom Rolls-Royce remains an attractive stock. However, there was no-one available at Goldman to comment on the suggestion. Rolls-Royce closed unchanged at 149 1/2 p.</p>

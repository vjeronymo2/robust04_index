			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Sport: In the image of the boss - Football One of the oddest aspects of this season's English Premier League has been the tingling sense of deja vu created by two of the division's more entertaining teams Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur. In recent weeks, as Newcastle swept Liverpool aside 3-0 and lost 2-1 at Arsenal, the former Liverpool players who throng English television's commentary boxes have been eagerly bestowing their ultimate compliment: comparing the team Kevin Keegan has built to the Liverpool side he and they played in. Those who have seen the old Liverpool and the new Newcastle in training say Keegan has duplicated the methods of Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, his managers at Anfield. But Newcastle differ from the great Liverpool sides of the 1970s and 1980s. In particular they lack the physical presence of those teams. Keegan has assembled a side of quick-witted, hard-working nimble players. Newcastle are not modelled on Liverpool, but on Keegan himself. Keegan is not alone in producing a team in his own image. Osvaldo Ardiles returned to Tottenham Hotspur as manager this year to take over a team already built around the playmaking of Vinnie Samways, a man who learnt his craft while Ardiles was still a Spurs player. At times on Wednesday night when Spurs ambushed Blackburn Rovers in the Coca Cola Cup, Samways looked alarmingly like a lesser Ardiles, short, dark, arms bowed, skipping past tacklers with short choppy strides, clipping neat little passes. But Ardiles has not been content with one little general. He has found a place for young Darren Caskey and completed a petite midfield trio by buying Mickey Hazard, another Spurs protege of his. The Tottenham midfield can provide the disconcerting illusion of a swarm of Ardiles imitators buzzing about their business. Yet playing style is an unreliable predictor of management style. Many great players are simply bad managers. Others find it difficult to recreate their style with lesser players. Glenn Hoddle's attempt to build an elegant passing team in his own image with the squad of clodhoppers he inherited at Chelsea borders on the dogmatic. So far the team has dived into the relegation zone while Hoddle's stock has risen. His dedication to 'pure' football has made him a popular candidate for the position of England manager. There are also the managers who confound expectations. As a player Don Revie redefined the role of the English centre-forward, lying deep and creating, rather than scoring, goals. The Leeds team he managed could play creative football but regarded it as a last resort once more abrasive methods had failed. Brian Clough was the archetypal English bulldozer centre-forward and yet his teams were built on guile and ground passing. Nobody epitomises this paradox better than George Graham. In his playing days, Graham was nicknamed 'stroller'. He brought a touch of elegance to Arsenal's much-criticised double-winning team of 1971. No-one would dare stroll while playing for Graham. Gravalues work rate and collects centre-halves. The result is two league championships and three cups and a team that, while it contains little of Graham's personality as a player, is as true to the traditions of his club as Ardiles is at Tottenham, Gerry Francis at Queen's Park Rangers and Billy Bonds at West Ham. The only current manager who can surpass Graham's success, Kenny Dalglish, remains an enigma. His detractors say he was lucky to start his management career at Liverpool by inheriting the best side in Europe and that he kept the team at the peak for six years simply by waving a Liverpool shirt and Liverpool's cheque book at the best players. And yet, as his successors have found, life is not quite so simple. Dalglish bought John Barnes and Peter Beardsley and few Paul Stewarts or Istvan Kozmas. He has continued to buy well at Blackburn. At White Hart Lane on Wednesday the team he has built looked, as it always does, like another collection of enthusiastic Premier League trundlers. The secret of Dalglish's thinking lies in his cheque stubs. When he started to spend Jack Walker's money he bought enough Pounds 1m attackers to make two-and-a-half forward lines at most clubs, and only then did he start spending comparable sums on other, defensive, positions. The message is clear: the creative responsibility falls on the attackers. This is, then, a team built in the manager's image. Dalglish is not alone in feeling comfortable spending money. Graeme Souness, of Liverpool, and Trevor Francis, at Sheffield Wednesday, were among the first generation of British chequebook players, now they are chequebook managers. As players both enjoyed success as high-priced purchases at Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, before capping careers dotted with costly transfers in Italy. For both, the first instinct when faced with a problem seems to be: buy an established international. It is a reliable way to build a good team but makes it difficult to create the distinctive personality of a great one. Managers who were mediocre players are not prisoners of their past. Howard Wilkinson was a winger whose playing career peaked with 22 first division games. As a manager he took cash-strapped Sheffield Wednesday from the third to the first division with simple assault course football. At Leeds he built a championship team around the delicate midfield play of Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister. Wilkinson can simply manage according to his resources.</p>

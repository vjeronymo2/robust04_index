			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: What duty? Sir, In taking Ms Clare Spottiswoode to task about her understanding of her duties as director-general of Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, Mr Andrew Warren - who represents the interests of the industry that supplies energy efficiency hardware and services - fails to make it clear why she or anyone else should have a duty to further the interests of the members of his industry (Letters, October 11). If their products are worth buying, the market should take care of their interests in the same way as it does for any other industry. If they are not, so be it. L G Brookes, 16 Ipswich Road, Bournemouth BH4 9HZ</p>

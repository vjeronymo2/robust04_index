			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: National Mutual returns to the black with ADollars 227m National Mutual Life Association, the Australian financial services group, has announced a return to the black for the latest year following a turnround of more than ADollars 250m (USDollars 168m). The group reported a net profit of ADollars 227m for the year to September against a restated loss of ADollars 30.3m in the previous year. Mr David Tomlinson, managing director, said the group's statutory reserves rose from ADollars 1.08bn to ADollars 1.33bn in the year. Mr Tomlinson said the improved results reflected tighter expense controls, prudent underwriting and good investment results. He said the company's listing of its Hong Kong insurance business had also contributed gains while reorganisation of Australian and New Zealand insurance operations had reduced expenses by more than ADollars 60m.</p>

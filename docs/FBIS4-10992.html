			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the extraordinary military council of the  Eastern Army opened with Army General Raul Castro; Commander of  the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque; Division Gen. Ulises Rosales  del Toro, chief of the General Staff; and Division Gen. Ramon  Espinosa Martin, head of the Eastern Army, in attendance.  Council members and first secretaries of the party from the six  provinces that form part of the Eastern Army were also in  attendance. Party officials from Ciego de Avila and Sancti  Spiritus were present as special guests.    During the first part of the event, participants heard a  detailed report, presented by Brigadier Gen. Urbelino  Betancourt, head of the General Staff of the Eastern Army, on  the energy potential of the Eastern Army. The report disclosed  its capacity and considerable potential, based on its reduction  in consumption of conventional fuel, which reached 77 percent in  comparison to 1989; while with electricity, it used 50 percent  less, without affecting fulfillment of combat preparation  programs, equipment conservation, ammunition savings, and a  considerable increase in food production.    The increased use of fuel-saving devices and methods, such  as  windmills, biogas processors [digestores], solar energy,  bagasse, sugarcane straw, and firewood as alternate sources; and  the use of animal power in various activities; the use of  magnetizers, direct fuel emulsifiers for service and combat  vehicles, and the use of efficient stoves are realities that  were verified by those who attended this extraordinary military  council of the Eastern Army, which focuses on the organizational  measures being carried out, with the goal of securing the  instruction process of the troops under conditions very close to  option zero.    The meeting held with combatants of a great tank unit  selected as one of the best in the whole FAR, allowed them to  see the operation of a classroom complex specializing in tanks,  infantry, and communications. It was here, where Raul and those  who are accompanying him received many demonstrations on the  overall state of the troops, target practice with tanks using  lever mechanisms and stabilizers, in which variations in terrain  and moveable targets create a sensation of a real offensive  movement by these machines.    The overcoming of obstacles, activity on the practice range,  and mastery in camouflage are objectives of the combat  preparation that can be seen, along with solutions to substitute  or adapt means and equipment for conservation in view of the  lack of some essential elements in defensive preparations.  Combatants pedal to make the communication stations work.  Workshops that repair and manufacture parts continue operating  without fuel. Industrial electric energy continues operating  through the initiatives of workers, which makes them worthy of  an outstanding position in the country. Transparent shingles are  used on warehouses, variants for nonmotorized transportation are  elements that contribute to the savings in this great unit.    The final stop on the tour was at the medical facility,  which  is the pride of the Eastern Army because it is the best of its  type in the FAR, and where more than 135 formulations of herbal  remedies are manufactured. There is a high use of acupuncture  and a great quantity of medical equipment that operates without  conventional energy.    This great tank unit, which has maintained its vanguard  performance for four years in a row, has not neglected the  production of alternative materials based on Roman cement for  the construction of housing and fortifications, the production  of feed and phytopharmaceuticals [fitofarmacos] that were  previously imported and are used in the poultry and pork farming  they have developed, or increased possibilities of producing  freshwater fish in recently built small tanks and dams.    An impromptu meeting set the tone for congratulating the  members of the tank unit on the occasion of their day, and the  day honoring the Bay of Pigs. Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del  Toro spoke to those present.    [Begin Rosales recording] On behalf of the minister, the  generals, and the leaders who accompany us, all of whom will be  with you for two days participating in the military council of  the Eastern Army, we wish to congratulate you on this day. [end  recording]    Division General Nestor Lopez Cuba, head of the political  directorate of the FAR, a tank driver during the Bay of Pigs,  also spoke to the soldiers.    [Begin Lopez recording] On this day, we salute all members  of  tank units and ask that they outshine the tank units from the  Bay of Pigs. [end recording]    Afterwards, an accurate demonstration was held by a group of  combatants of the unit, who confidently battled enemy targets as  any other of the 100,000 experts and marksmen of the FAR would  do, and who are ready to act under the concept of the people's  war.    This extraordinary military council of the Eastern Army with  its activities continues to demonstrate with specific facts how  our combatants, dressed in their olive green uniforms, do not  fold their arms and are not intimidated by the current material  obstacles. To the contrary, they arm themselves with new  initiatives, elevating themselves to the level that this moment  demands. Above all, each day they perfect their fighting  capabilities.</p>

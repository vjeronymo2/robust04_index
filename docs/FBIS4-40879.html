			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw </F> Bahdankevich: "The State Is Endangered!"]    [Text] In assessing the results of our economic and social  development, Belarusian statesmen are pushing forward the idea  that, despite the exacerbating crisis, the key sectors of our  economy were not destroyed, there has been no massive drop in  production, and prices have not continued to increase. They  erroneously believe that it was regular and centralized  deliveries of energy resources that allowed our economy to  remain afloat.    It should be noted that, indeed, production and consumer  demand for energy resources were completely met in 1993-94.  However, no one ever asked the question -- at what cost and  with what consequences? -- or saw fit to provide an answer.    Let us clarify this issue.    The centralized supply of these resources to the Republic is  being carried out through natural exchanges in the form of  clearing operations and bartering. However, such economic  relations have irrecoverably damaged the national economy and  triggered a wide range of negative consequences. In particular,  according to experts' estimates, in comparison with our losses  in 1993 -- due to underestimated prices for Belarusian-made  products delivered on a clearing basis ($349 million) and  overestimated prices for Russian-produced goods ($88 million) --  our 1994 will total some $437 million.    Belarusian economic entities -- dealing with clearing-basis  deliveries -- continue to suffer losses. For example, prices  for tractors delivered on a clearing basis stand at 82 percent  of market prices in Belarus and Russia, while prices for cars --  85 percent. Due to this, in 1993 the Minsk Vehicle Factory  suffered losses amounting to 69 billion Belarusian rubles [R],  while in January-April of 1994 -- R18 billion. To fulfill  planed deliveries of refrigerators on a clearing basis in 1994,  the Minsk Refrigerator Factory will suffer losses amounting to  R135 billion.    Due to the unprofitability of deliveries of  Belarusian-produced goods by our enterprises, the Republic  chronically fails to meet its commitments. Already in 1994,  clearing-based imports from Russia have exceeded our exports by  37 percent, which automatically triggers equivalent  nondeliveries from Russia.    Economically unjustified prices are imposed on products  delivered on the basis of clearing transactions and  intergovernmental agreements. In particular, oil prices on the  Belarusian market in January slightly exceeded 70 percent of  clearing-based prices, in May -- 62 percent (foreign prices for  oil in 1994 stood at $85 per tonne, while the domestic price in  January was $61, and in May -- $53); prices and tariffs on  electricity and central heating in Belarus are roughly four  times lower than prices for electricity and gas imported for  these purposes. If we can put it this way, our economic policy  lacks sense. We are buying products from Russia at high prices  and selling them on our domestic market at low prices. The  question arises: At what expense and who is being made to  compensate for these expenditures? At the expense of eating  away at our foreign loans.    In accordance with the aforementioned trends, as a result of  price distortions, participants in clearing-based deliveries are  suffering huge losses. For example, this year, the Ministry of  Resources -- handling clearing-based oil deliveries to Belarus  -- suffered losses to the tune of R838 billion, while the  Ministry of Energy -- after selling electricity and heating to  Belarusian consumers -- suffered losses amounting to some R4  trillion.    The Belarusian Government probably has resources, which  could  allow it to compensate for these losses. However, the answer  is not clear: The government has no such assets. Between  January and April of this year, the government used some R1.2  trillion -- or 15.4 percent of all budget expenditures, that is,  the entire volume of yearly budget expenditures designated for  these purposes -- to underwrite state subsidies.    Moreover, according to Finance Ministry estimates, in  connection with the shortsighted pricing policy regarding the  import of energy resources and the preservation of the old  system of regulating prices for agricultural products, bread,  milk, tariffs for municipal services, city transportation, and  so on, some R5-6 trillion will have to be issued for these  purposes (according to May 1994 figures, we have every reason to  believe that this sum will be much higher).    Despite the fact that Belarusian consumers receive energy  resources at prices which are lower than their import prices,  and due to the weakening of payment discipline and solvency  among the enterprises, their debts for using energy resources --  received on a clearing basis and through intergovernmental  agreements -- are growing.    As of late May 1994, the oil debts of Belarusian enterprises  to the Ministry of Resources amounted to R760 billion or 69  billion Russian rubles; gas debts to the Belarusian State  Company for Gas Transportation and Delivery -- R5.9 trillion or  534.1 billion Russian rubles; debts for electricity and central  heating to the Ministry of Energy -- some R1.4 trillion or 125  billion Russian rubles. Mutual debts of all Belarusian  enterprises for oil, gas, and energy resources total more than  R8 trillion or 729 billion Russian rubles.    Distortion of domestic and foreign prices, increases in  debts  for energy resources, lack of budget means necessary to cover  losses of importers of energy resources prompt increases in  Belarusian debts to other states, primarily to Russia. Oil  debts of the Belarusian Ministry of Resources in late May  reached R760 billion or 69 billion Russian rubles, gas debts --  R5.8 trillion or 533 billion Russian rubles, and electricity  debts -- $869 billion or 79 billion Russian rubles.    The system regulating economic relations exerts constant  pressure on the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble and  triggers its decrease. Taking into account the impact of a  stable exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble on the  stabilization of the national economy and continued speculations  of some of our statesmen on this issue, I will present the bases  of this subject.    The economic essence of the ratio of one currency to another  is nothing more than the price of money. It, in turn, as the  price of any commodity, depends on the market correlation  between supply and demand.    It has been tested in practice and confirmed by economic  relations that if demand exceeds supply, prices rise. If it is  the other way around, prices fall.    Considering the price of money -- the currency exchange rate  -- the correlation between these indexes is defined by trade and  payment balances. If they are negative, then the price of a  given state's currency is lower than the price a partner-state's  currency. When these negative balances increase, prices -- the  currency rate of a state with this negative tendency in trade  and payment balances -- continue to fall.    What about these tendencies in the Belarusian economy?    According to the State Committee for Statistics, Belarusian  imports in 1993, in particular, from Russia, exceeded exports by  R1.149 trillion, while in the first quarter of this year the  negative trade balance reached a level of R713 billion.    Due to this negative balance and the aforementioned  regulation of intergovernmental agreements, current Belarusian  debts to Russia, as of late May, stood at R7.4 trillion or 681  billion Russian rubles. In connection with the increase in the  negative balance in trade and current debt, demand for Russian  rubles has increased, while in connection with the decrease in  exports -- the supply of Russian rubles has decreased. This,  overall, triggered the devaluation of the Belarusian ruble.    The increase in the supply of Belarusian rubles -- due to  increased credit allotments by the Belarusian National Bank  forced under constant pressure from the government --  considerably decreased the exchange rate of the Belarusian  ruble. Our estimates indicate that the rate of the Belarusian  ruble against the Russian ruble fell in inverse proportion to  the increase in earmarked credits.    The increase in the proportion of the Belarusian-Russian  trade balance -- based on barter and clearing deals -- has also  had some impact on the falling Belarusian ruble exchange rate.  If in 1993 barter deals composed 17 percent of all Belarusian  exports, in the first quarter of 1994, that figure reached 30  percent. Barter operations narrow the sphere of the  money-exchange relationship and thus increase the disparity  between supply and demand for a currency.    The increase in the negative trade and payment balance,  growth in the unfounded issue of credits, and the naturalization  of foreign trade prompted the drop in the Belarusian ruble  exchange rate against the Russian ruble from 1.33 (as of 24  March 1993) to 4.51 (as of January 1994), later to 9.97 (as of 1  April 1994) and 11.00 (as of 1 June 1994).    Therefore, state regulation did not only exacerbate the  problems, but also triggered an economic collapse and deep  crisis in the financial situation of enterprises and the state.  The image of social welfare, however, did develop.    Proceeding from the officially confirmed 35-percent drop in  industrial production in the first quarter of 1994 and taking  into account the impossibility of selling at least half of all  goods produced, the real drop in production stood at 75 percent.  By using energy resources and other material elements of  production, and selling products at fixed prices, enterprises  are operating in a mishmashed environment, which aggravates  their financial situation. The bulk of our enterprises lost  their directions and prospects -- formed under market relations  -- for development.    Our agricultural sector is also experiencing difficulties.  Increases in state support for this sector of the economy, in  the form of state subsidies and favorable credits, does not at  all compensate for all losses incurred from violations of price  parity for agricultural and industrial goods.    The financial situation in the transportation network -- in  particular, in city transport -- and municipal services due to  tariffs, which are lower than production expenditures, is  continuing to exacerbate. In particular, 90 percent of costs  for housing and municipal services should be subsidized by the  state and only 10 percent -- be covered by tariffs. Limited  subsidies from the budget do not provide for the financial  stabilization of the enterprises in this sector.    Eventually, state regulation of the economy, which does not  agree with basic economic laws, has exacerbated the already  distorted financial situation in Belarus, primarily, its budget,  and has prompted a huge budget deficit.    To cover this deficit in the first quarter of this year, the  Belarusian National Bank has used its yearly quota of credit  issues. Along with this, foreign debts have climbed to such a  level that the Republic is in danger of going bankrupt.    The Belarusian people will have to pay a considerable price  for overcoming this situation.</p>

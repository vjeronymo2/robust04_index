			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chen Jinjun (7115 6651 6511)] </F>   [Text] Wellington, Jun 20 (XINHUA) -- Li Tieying, Chinese  state councillor and minister in charge of the State Commission  for Economic Restructuring, said here today: China will  continue to uphold its policy of reform and opening up,  establish a new market economic structure as soon as possible,  quicken the pace to make its new economic system compatible with  international practices, and actively participate in  international competition and economic cooperation.    Speaking at a reception hosted by (Murray Horn), secretary  general of the New Zealand Finance Ministry, Li Tieying said:  Doing so "not only serves the fundamental interests of the  Chinese people but also conforms to the common aspirations and  fundamental interests of the people in the rest of the world."    He said: "Over the past 15 years, guided by Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China  made remarkable achievements in reform, opening up, and  modernization. Its economic structure and operational  mechanisms underwent profound changes."    He added: A situation has taken initial shape in China in  which the publicly owned economic sector constitutes the  mainstay while the state-owned, collective, individual, private,  and foreign-funded economic sectors develop simultaneously,  compete on an equal footing, and develop together. China has  made unceasing efforts to extend the scale of reform in  state-owned enterprises and explore practical ways to establish  a modern enterprise system. China is cultivating a market  system, accelerating price reform, and continuing strengthening  the role of market mechanisms. Instead of trying to directly  control enterprises by giving them administrative orders, the  state mainly uses economic and legislative means to indirectly  regulate and control enterprises. China has set up a  distribution system in which remuneration according to one's  work as the principal mode of distribution and various other  means of distribution serve as supplements. A new social  security system has also been established. The household  contract responsibility system, with remuneration linked to  output, is extensively carried out in China's rural areas. This  and the adjustment of agricultural produce prices and  procurement systems have motivated peasants to work harder.    Li Tieying said: "China's commitment to a market-oriented  economy in its reform and opening up is correct. Our cause is  extensively and wholeheartedly supported by our people. Chinese  people are marching toward the goal of establishing a new system  and accomplishing modernization."    He added: In 1988, China doubled its gross national product  [GNP] of 1980 ahead of time, basically realizing the first stage  of its strategic target of improving the people's living  standards. We may foresee that our GNP will probably be doubled  again by the end of the century. By that time, we may achieve  the second stage of the strategic target of improving the  people's living standards in advance. China's current major  task is to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic  development by establishing a socialist market economic  structure so as to ensure the realization of the third stage of  the strategic target. That is, China hopes to catch up with or  surpass the present standards of moderately developed countries  by the middle of the 21st century.    Li Tieying said: Developing and strengthening our economic  relations and cooperation with countries and regions in the  Asia-Pacific region constitutes an integral part of China's  overall opening up policy. China is willing to actively expand  its cooperation with New Zealand in the political, economic,  scientific, technological, and cultural fields through various  channels under the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and  efficiency.    The China economic structure investigation delegation,  headed  by Li Tieying, arrived in New Zealand on 18 June.</p>

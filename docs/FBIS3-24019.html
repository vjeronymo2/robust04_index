			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed item: "Pirates Against Their Will"] </F>   [Text] Due to the fuel shortage Ukraine is compelled to  drain Russian gas in pipelines flowing in transit to West  European countries. An ITAR--TASS correspondent was informed  about this by one of the Ukrgazprom executives who wished to  remain unanimous. Ukrgazprom representatives refused to indicate  the amount of gas taken from Russia in that manner.    As indicated by material released by the UNIAN agency,  thanks  to its energetic "pirating," Ukraine provided heating for  communal needs and prevented stoppage of major industrial  enterprises during the recent freezing weather. At present the  situation is becoming stabilized as temperatures start to rise.  Several more days, however, will be needed in order to renew the  export delivery of Russian gas in full volume. In accordance  with Ukrainian - Russian agreements such acts require payment of  fines.</p>

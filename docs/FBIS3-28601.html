			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hosokawa Needs To Take Open And Aboveboard </F> Attitude]    [Text] The government's conclusion on reforming the tax  system, which has been a major point in the coming economic  stimulus measures, came about in the early morning of 3  February, when Prime Minister Hosokawa made a political  decision. Prime Minister Hosokawa said that a 6-trillion-yen  [Y] reduction in income and resident taxes will be carried out  while the consumption tax will be replaced with a 7 percent  national welfare tax. The prime minister said that the proposed  tax system is designed to help boost the economy, noting the tax  reductions will be retroactive to 1 January 1994 and the tax  increase will go into effect in April 1997 -- about three years  after the tax reduction is carried out.    We would like to give a positive evaluation to the  government's proposal because the prime minister's decision  basically reflects the purpose of tax system reform aimed at  introducing a new tax system that imposes adequate taxes on  income, consumption, and properties so that the people feel  impartial about their own tax burden. We would also like to  admit that even though a future tax hike is scheduled, the tax  reductions will have instant an effect on the economy.    There is the opinion that it would be more effective to  increase taxes two or three years after a tax cut is carried  out. However, of course, there is a counter-argument that the  people would feel uneasy about when and what sort of tax  increase will be carried out and that such a plan would curb  economic activities. Above all, we would like to stress that  this issue's real substance lies in tax system reform.    For those reasons, we can basically support the government's  decision. However, there is a problem in the government's  decision- making process. Although we do not simply subscribe  to a critical view that the government has formed a hasty  conclusion without listening to public opinion and the ruling  parties' opinions, we wonder why the prime minister could not  simply say that the government will raise the consumption tax.  He must have thought that the government's introduction of the  national welfare tax, which replaces the consumption tax, can  win the people's understanding. But it is wrong.    However hard one thinks, a national welfare tax is a  consumption tax. There is no doubt that most of the people will  consider the government's proposal as deceiving the people, and  the people will increase their opposition to the proposal. Most  of the taxpayers must be considering that the consumption tax  has taken root in its own way except political activists,  scholars who stick to their own ideas, and their followers. In  this sense, the prime minister should have openly and logically  explained the reason the government has to raise the consumption  tax. If he takes such an honest attitude, the people would  further support his government.    We also wonder why the amount of the tax increase is set at  Y9.5 trillion despite the amount for the tax cut being Y6  trillion. We think the tax increase is too big, even if various  welfare measures are taken under the name of the national  welfare tax. The government is required to study the  possibility of expanding the scale of tax reductions including  corporate taxes.    It will take a little more time to make a final decision.  Thorough discussions by the Tax System Reform Council are  scheduled to begin soon. In promoting discussions, there are  many things to discuss -- such as whether three years is an  adequate grace period for the tax increase, whether some  portions of the current consumption tax system should be  reviewed, and for what purposes the national welfare tax should  be used.</p>

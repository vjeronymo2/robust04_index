			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> 20 INDICTED IN DRUG SMUGGLING SCHEME  </P> <P> Twenty people, including four U.S. Customs Service workers and a former Cuban  political prisoner, were indicted for smuggling nearly 40 tons of cocaine and  marijuana into the country. The 15-count indictment by a federal grand jury in  Miami charged the defendants, all of whom are in custody, with using law  enforcement information provided by the customs employees to elude detection of  their drug smuggling operation. "Employees who sell their badges and the trust  of their fellow workers are really committing treason against the United States  and should be punished as traitors to their country and the U.S. Customs  Service," said the agency's assistant commissioner for internal affairs.  </P></p>

			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Fresh demand for Sun A MIXTURE of takeover speculation, economic recovery hopes and reports that the UK government has agreed to pay out for acts of terrorism drove the composite insurance sector sharply higher. The heaviest activity was in Sun Alliance, up 11 more at 355p on above-average turnover of 7.6m shares. There were hints that the recent burst of buying in Sun Alliance represented one major fund management group purchasing large amounts of stock and that one of the UK's biggest insurance groups had unloaded a big block of shares. Specialists, however, said that the level of business over the past two sessions indic-ated that a single buyer could have accumulated around 1 per cent of Sun Alliance shares. Commercial Union advanced 11 to 619p, General Accident 17 to 587p and Guardian Royal 7 to 182p. Royal Insurance suffered from switching into the other composites and closed 3 easier at 288p. The Dollars 145m worth of asset sales by Lasmo, reducing its gearing by around five points, delighted the market and helped the shares leap 9 to 151p on heavy turnover of 10m. Other active oil issues mirrored the latest improvement in global crude oil prices. Among the UK engineering stocks, TI jumped 17 to 311p after the sector analyst at Credit Lyonnais recommended it as 'the quality stock in the sector'. British Aerospace moved ahead 10 to 177p on suggestions that it was on the point of disclosing a joint venture with Taiwan Aerospace. Suggestions in the market that Queens Moat Houses would maintain the final dividend pushed the shares up 4 to 42p in active turnover. Forte, also busy, climbed 8 to 180p. The two classes of BT shares were among the worst performers in the Footsie constituents after an Italian newspaper ran a story that BT was involved in talks with Stet with a view to taking a stake of between 10 and 20 per cent in the Italian state-owned telecoms group. There was no official comment from BT on the story but telecoms specialists were sceptical that any deal would materialise. 'BT has been unofficially denying the story all day, and there seems to be no financial or strategic benefits to BT,' was the view of one leading analyst. BT shares settled 5 1/2 off at 390p on thin volume of 6.8m, while the partly-paid weakened 5 to 285 1/2 p on 2.2m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (195).

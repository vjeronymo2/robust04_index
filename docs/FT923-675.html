			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Party for V2 rocket under fire A ROW broke out yesterday over German plans to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the first launch of Hitler's 'wonder weapon', the V2 rocket that was supposed to humble Britain, Reuter reports from Berlin. Critics say the celebration on October 3 in the former rocket base of Peenemunde is in poor taste, because the supersonic V2 killed thousands of British civilians, while 20,000 concentration camp inmates died making it. The organisers say the V2 - whose inventor, Werner von Braun, later headed the US space programme - was 'the first step into space'. Germans protested in May when Britain erected a statue to Gen 'Bomber' Harris, who initiated the carpet bombing which destroyed Dresden and many other cities.</p>

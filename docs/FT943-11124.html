			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / The Markets: Why shock therapy? - Economic Eye Only one of the predictions that made Marxism the secular religion of the 20th century has proved true. This was the proposition that socialism would lead to the withering away of the state. So indeed it has, not by its success, but by its failure. The collapse of the state is a strong argument for what is called 'shock therapy', but might be better labelled 'big-bang' reform. In an illuminating recent paper, Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, justifies this approach by pointing to the three interrelated economic crises that confront post-communist countries: state bankruptcy, systemic collapse and structural transformation.* The first shows itself in default and inflation, the second in the disintegration of state economic control and the third in the shrinkage of the hypertrophied heavy-industrial sector. 'The aim of shock therapy,' argues Prof Sachs, 'is to address these three crises via the rapid introduction of the core institutions of capitalism.' These are private property; a stable, convertible currency; freedom for trade and international investment; corporate control of large enterprises; and a social safety net. In a paper written jointly with Alan Gelb of the World Bank, Leszek Balcerowicz, architect of the Polish reforms, argues that the necessary policies embrace stabilisation, liberalisation and institutional restructuring.** It is the first two that can be done quickly and need also to be done together, because they are complementary. Without price liberalisation, the need to go on subsidising undermines stabilisation. Similarly, only after stabilisation will people be subject to hard budget constraints and have to respond to market signals. A fundamental reason for speed is that the initial conditions are simply unsustainable. Almost always among those conditions is a collapsed state. Just as in the world of physics every action creates an equal and opposite reaction, so in the world of politics communist tyranny leads to anarchy. Its downfall creates something akin to Thomas Hobbes' state of nature, in which life is 'poor, nasty, brutish, and short'. The fiscal aspects of Moscow's rake's progress are shown in the chart. Prof Sachs, in another paper, points to five elements of this vicious downward spiral: people refusing to pay taxes because nobody else does; regions failing to transfer revenue to the centre because the government loses the ability to punish them; cancerous criminality, because the probability of capture declines as the number of criminals rises; default, as foreign creditors refuse to advance new loans, because none of the others do; and flight from money, as people refuse to hold the currency, because nobody else is willing to do so.*** What is important about these five cases is that they all involve contagion. What is needed then is to deliver a big jolt to self-justifying pessimism. The jolt is provided by a package which includes exchange-rate stabilisation and non-inflationary foreign finance of essential budgetary expenditures. With exchange-rate stability and high domestic interest rates, there will be flight back to the currency. Similarly, with inflation down and the state financed, structural reform can proceed and legal private business expand. Every successful stabilisation of a collapsed, hyperinflationary economy was preceded by rampant pessimism and followed by an equally unjustifed belief that the special characteristics of the countries concerned made success inevitable. Five years ago many argued that shock stabilisations elsewhere contained no lessons for the very different problems of post-communist countries. Many also feared that the Poles were about to starve. These positions, though wrong, did hold a certain plausibility. But the evidence is now in. We know from experience that big-bang reform is costless, when comparison is made, not with some utopian ideal, but with the available alternatives, which are either to do nothing or to have higgledy-piggledy reform. What does it mean to say it is costless? It means that the decline in measured output (which grossly exaggerates the true decline in output, let alone in welfare) has actually been smaller in countries that have reformed quickly than in those that have not. Between 1989 and 1993, the cumulative decline in Poland's gross domestic product was 12 per cent, while the economy started growing in 1992. In Hungary the cumulative decline has been 16 per cent. In Bulgaria and Romania it has been 26 and 29 per cent, respectively. But in utterly unreformed Ukraine, GDP declined by 32 per cent in 1992 and 1993 alone. Expectations can be turned around and reforms successfully started even amidst the ruins left by communism. The only questions are why so many continue to deny this; and also why western governments and institutions have failed to provide Russia in particular, much the most significant single case, with the forms and levels of assistance needed to make shock therapy work there too. *Jeffrey D Sachs, 'Understanding 'Shock Therapy' ', paper for a seminar on 'Post-Communist Societies in Transition' at the Social Market Foundation, June 30 1994. **Leszek Balcerowicz and Alan Gelb, 'Macropolicies in Transition to a Market Economy: a Three-Year Perspective,' paper for the World Bank annual conference on development economics, April 28-29 1994. ***Jeffrey D Sachs, 'Russia's Struggle with Stabilisation: Conceptual Issues and Evidence,' paper for the World Bank annual conference on development economics, April 28-29 1994.</p>

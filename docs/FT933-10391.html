			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Abtrust Scotland net assets ahead Abtrust Scotland Investment, an investment trust which concentrates its portfolio on unlisted Scottish companies, reported an undiluted net asset value of 34.3p per share as at May 31, a rise of 6.5 per cent over the year. Mr Calum Macleod, chairman, said that the trust's net asset value had risen by 37 per cent over the past five years, against an advance of 12.3 per cent in the NatWest Securities Venture Capital Nav Index. A number of companies in the portfolio showed 'outstanding performances' Mr Macleod said, notably Grampian Television, Aberdeen Trust, John Wood, Seaforth Maritime, GRT and Scotcare. In contrast, the trust suffered a significant write-down in the value of its holding in Adam and Company, the Edinburgh-based private bank which recently disclosed losses of Pounds 21m in unauthorised treasury transactions. Reduced dividend income and the early redemption of high-yielding preference shares by some companies left net revenue sharply lower at Pounds 139,993 (Pounds 258,645), equivalent to earnings of 0.42p (0.77p) per share. Nevertheless, the dividend is maintained at 0.6p.</p>

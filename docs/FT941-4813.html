			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Valeo earnings steady at FFr705m Valeo, the French car parts company, yesterday said it had managed to maintain profits last year in spite of the depressed state of the European motor market. The group made net profits of FFr705m (Dollars 199.5m) in 1993 against FFr700m in the previous year. As a result the board proposed raising its net dividend to FFr8 from FFr7 in 1992. Valeo, like other suppliers to the European motor industry, has been affected by the downturn in demand. It sustained a 2 per cent fall in sales during the year to FFr20.2bn compared with FFr19.8bn. However, it said that it had managed to outperform the rest of the market by limiting the fall in its European sales to 10 per cent during a year in which the European market declined by 16 per cent. The group increased car part sales in North America and Asia. The proportion of its exports sold outside Europe rose during the year to about 22 per cent, against just 16 per cent in 1992. One of the main reasons for the improvement in Valeo's net margins was the reduction in its financial costs due to a decline in its borrowings. The level of net debt fell to FFr1.16bn by the end of 1993, from FFr2.15bn for the same period in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR STATE CONTROLLER: DAVIS  </P> <P> In the race for state controller, incumbent Democrat Gray Davis is under  challenge from Republican newcomer Matthew Fong.  </P> <P> The big difference between the two candidates who want to be California's chief  fiscal officer is experience. Davis is better qualified to serve as watchdog  over the state's $55.7-billion annual budget. We endorse Davis for this  important post.  </P> <P> During his four-year term, Davis has shown some creativity in fiscal matters, a  doggedness in the job and a streak of independence. Davis, 47, is a 16-year  veteran of state government. Prior to his election as controller, he served as  chief of staff to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. and later as a two-term assemblyman.  As controller, he serves on 52 boards and commissions, including the State  Lands Commission and Franchise Tax Board.  </P> <P> He helped establish the 37,500-acre Dye Creek Wildlife Reserve in Northern  California through an innovative debt-for-nature swap. He has aggressively  pursued the state's suit against the federal government to recover California's  share of millions of dollars in royalties from Kern County's Elk Hills Naval  Petroleum Reserve.  </P> <P> And in an act that raised a lot of eyebrows, Davis released millions of dollars  to California schools in August against Gov. George Deukmejian's attempt to  impound the money because of a political spat with state Supt. of Public  Instruction Bill Honig.  </P> <P> Fong's bid for controller is his first statewide and public office race.  </P> <P> The 36-year-old Los Angeles attorney specializes in Pacific Rim trade and  business. He once served as campaign manager for his Democrat mother, Secretary  of State March Fong Eu.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Fong switched parties. He has challenged Davis' squeaky-clean  and straight-arrow image by questioning the incumbent's judgment on accepting  certain political contributions and using state personnel and equipment for  political purposes in 1986. (Davis reimbursed the state $28,000.)  </P> <P> These are valid political points -- fair questions to raise in the heat of a  political campaign. But Fong offers insufficient alternatives to the policies  and programs of Davis.  </P></p>

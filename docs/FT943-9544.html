			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fortex meat processing plants sold after tender The financially troubled New Zealand meat processing industry is headed for further difficulties after it was announced yesterday that two former Fortex plants will reopen under new owners. The announcement coincided with the release of a study by Southpac, the merchant bank, which says the industry has lost money in each of the past five years and will continue to do so unless it is restructured. Meat processing is New Zealand's biggest industry, with a turnover of NZDollars 3.4bn (USDollars 2bn) a year. Fortex was placed in receivership earlier this year after it incurred losses of around NZDollars 600m. Mr Alan Isaac, the receiver for Fortex, said yesterday the plants had been sold after an international tender, and would reopen. He refused to disclose the prices paid. The South Canterbury plant has been bought by a consortium including Japanese interests, the Brierley controlled Huttons Kiwi and Meat Board subsidiary Anzco, and local group Phoenix Meats. The Dunedin plant has been bought by a former city mayor, Sir Clifford Skeggs. The group's 24-hour processing methods and harmonious labour relations had attracted international interest and its collapse embarrassed the New Zealand government. Two of the company's founders face fraud charges. The collapse was blamed on a costly battle with its competitors to buy stock. With sheep numbers having fallen by around 23m-50m during the past decade, companies have been forced to offer high prices to farmers for animals in a bid to stay in business. Industry leaders said the plants' closure had relieved the competitive pressures in the industry.</p>

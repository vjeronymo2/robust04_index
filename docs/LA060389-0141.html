			<p><P> June 3, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HARRIET'S HOUSE;  </P> <P> FOR YEARS NELSONS' WEEKEND RETREAT, LAGUNA BEACH HIDEAWAY IS NOW HOME  </P> <P> With a cool breeze blowing in off the steel-gray ocean below, Harriet Nelson  stood on the deck of her cliff-top Laguna Beach house and remembered warmer  days.  </P> <P> "Ozzie would swim way out past the rocks, and then he'd swim all the way down  there," she said, pointing to the rocks off Victoria Beach to the north and  then down to Blue Lagoon a half mile to the south.  </P> <P> "When we first came down here he'd swim twice a day and play volleyball with  all the kids," she said, adding with a throaty laugh: "He'd knock his brains  out. Ozzie had to win, you know. Ozzie could not come in second. No way."  </P> <P> Since 1932, when bandleader Ozzie Nelson hired Harriet Hilliard to be the  vocalist in his band, it has been difficult not to imagine one without the  other.  </P> <P> And for anyone who grew up watching "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" on  television each week in the 1950s and '60s, it is difficult to picture the  Nelsons without also thinking of their white, two-story Cape Cod house (footage  of the family's actual home in Hollywood was used in the opening credits of the  early episodes).  </P> <P> This is Ozzie and Harriet's other house.  </P> <P> They built the one-story, two-bedroom beach house in Lagunita -- a gated  community on Coast Highway where homes now sell for up to $4 million -- in 1955  as a weekend retreat.  </P> <P> And while it is a lot less familiar than their Hollywood house, it figures no  less prominently in the Nelsons' family history.  </P> <P> It's where the entire family came on weekends to unwind after filming all week  and during summers when the show was on hiatus.  </P> <P> It's where Ozzie and Harriet retreated the day they finished filming their  final "adventure" in 1966, ending the show's phenomenal 14 years on television  and 10 years on radio.  </P> <P> And it's where, two years after Ozzie died of cancer in 1975, Harriet moved  after selling the big house in Hollywood.  </P> <P> Since then, the Lagunita house has been Harriet Nelson's full-time residence.  And with frequent weekend visits by son David and his wife, Yvonne, and  Harriet's grandchildren and their friends, the house is still very much a  family home that reflects the casual beach life style that originally drew the  Nelsons to Laguna.  </P> <P> From the road above, the gray house with the French blue trim is hidden from  view by the garage and a one-room guest house.  </P> <P> A visitor enters through a plain wooden door that opens onto brick steps that  separate the garage and guest house. The steps lead down to a large,  plant-filled brick patio. (The plants, like the surrounding landscaping, are  tended by gardeners from Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar.)  </P> <P> The L-shaped house has an airy, wood-paneled living room with a beam ceiling  and a stone fireplace between a large picture window and a sliding glass door  that offer spectacular views of the ocean and the beach 20 feet below. Harriet  had the beam ceiling and mahogany paneling painted a warm white color a few  years ago. ("I'm glad I did it," she says in that familiar, good-humored voice.  "It makes such a cheerful house.")  </P> <P> The stylish yet unpretentious living room features off-white carpeting and a  long white couch facing the fireplace. Above the fireplace is an original oil  painting by the renowned primitive artist Streeter Blair, a family friend, who  also did the painting of Ozzie's and Harriet's first house in New Jersey that  hangs above an antique Shaker herb chest. (Harriet has been collecting antiques  since 1934, "when it didn't cost your right arm," but had to sell much of her  collection when she left her Hollywood home for the much smaller Lagunita  house.)  </P> <P> One wall of the living room is devoted to a built-in television and a built-in  mirrored wet bar where Ozzie would often stand while working on scripts for the  TV show.  </P> <P> On the shelf above the TV is a collection of personal family photographs,  including pictures of Rick, who died in a 1985 plane crash, and David, who is a  Hollywood film director. On the wall above is another primitive painting, a  seaside town painted by Harriet's former daughter-in law, Kris Nelson, who  divorced Rick in 1981. The whimsical painting incorporates family members:  Harriet is shown gardening; Ozzie is holding a volleyball.  </P> <P> A framed black-and-white photograph of Ozzie and Harriet, taken shortly before  they were married in 1935, sits atop an antique oak cricket table next to a  wingback chair. The inscription down the side of the clear frame reads:  "Ozzie's Girl." The frame was a gift from friends during the making of Ozzie  and Harriet's short-lived television comeback in "Ozzie's Girls" in 1973.  </P> <P> Harriet converted the small second bedroom into a study, which has an antique  mahogany desk where she does her "desk work." Built-in shelves, filled with  books and family photographs, frame a love seat where Harriet often sits while  reading her mail -- including occasional fan letters from a new generation of  viewers who watch "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" on the Disney Channel.  </P> <P> As viewers of the old show know, the TV Harriet Nelson spent a lot of time in  the kitchen.  </P> <P> The truth is that although her Hollywood house had a spacious kitchen, complete  with a butler's pantry, Harriet was too busy during the show years to cook for  the family. She employed a full-time cook-housekeeper. The kitchen in the  Lagunita house is small, with a breakfast bar, and is distinguished by a  vintage stainless-steel refrigerator and built-in stove and oven (gifts from  Hotpoint, "Ozzie and Harriet's" sponsor at the time the house was built).  </P> <P> And, yes, Harriet Nelson does know how to cook: "I'll get on kicks where I see  a recipe and then I'll do it, but it isn't necessary. Everybody knows what  cooking for yourself is like." When she entertains, it's usually with a few  close friends and, she says, she keeps it "very simple. Nothing elaborate. It's  very homey."  </P> <P> In Lagunita, the Nelsons always had an "open-refrigerator policy" for guests.  "This was called Hospitality Hall: everybody helped themselves. Thank God they  did," says Harriet.  </P> <P> During the '50s, David and Rick's friends would often show up on weekends,  camping out on the living room floor. "I'd have to step over them to get to the  kitchen in the morning," she says with a laugh, adding, "Now I've got the  grandchildren's friends. Fortunately."  </P> <P> The guest house, in fact, was built to give David and Rick -- and their friends  -- more room. But turning the original two-car garage into a guest house and  building another garage next to it actually served a more practical purpose: It  gave the Nelsons much-needed privacy.  </P> <P> While eating dinner one evening shortly after the house was built, Harriet  recalls, they looked up to find a man and a woman and their two children  staring at them through the front picture window. "I said, 'Can I help you?'  And they said, 'We just heard the Nelsons lived here.' "  </P> <P> Wearing an ivory silk blouse and navy blue pants, with her reading glasses  hanging from a gold chain around her neck, Harriet sat at her French country  dining table and discussed what Laguna and her Lagunita home have meant to her.  </P> <P> It was Ozzie's love of the ocean, she said, that originally brought them to  Laguna.  </P> <P> "I didn't care for it at first, but he loved it so," she said. "I learned to  put up with it and then, gradually, I learned to love it, too. Now I find I  don't want to live any place else."  </P> <P> The Lagunita house is the second weekend home Ozzie and Harriet bought in  Laguna.  </P> <P> In the late '40s, during the peak of their radio show's popularity, they bought  a big old Mediterranean-style house down the coast at Camel Point. But the  house was too large and too difficult to take care of. They sold it in 1954 and  as part payment received an empty lot in Lagunita.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar architect William Blurock, in association with architect Richard  Pleger, designed the Lagunita house in accordance with Harriet's  specifications.  </P> <P> "I knew what I wanted," she said. "I'd sit on the beach and make notes of what  I'd do if I built a house down here. Just from experience: 'Well, I don't like  this, I wouldn't want this' -- that kind of notes."  </P> <P> (Today Blurock recalls installing "black-out" drapes -- "double drapes like  they have in hotels" -- in Ozzie and Harriet's bedroom: "Ozzie wanted his  bedroom, which was all glass, absolutely blacked out so he could sleep," he  said.)  </P> <P> As with all the windows in the house, Harriet's bedroom now features wide-slat,  natural wood shutters which, she says, "makes more sense than anything else if  you live at the beach" because they are adjustable and let in as little or as  much light as desired.  </P> <P> The emphasis in designing their new weekend retreat, Harriet said, was that it  require minimum upkeep. "I had that in mind all the way through, and I'm  certainly grateful for it now," she said.  </P> <P> Home has always been important to Harriet.  </P> <P> During the '30s when she and Ozzie were on the road with Ozzie's band, she used  to clip pictures of homes and furniture out of magazines and paste them into a  scrapbook. With a laugh, she recalled: "The boys in the band used to call it  'Harriet's house.' I'm a nester."  </P> <P> In the late '60s, Lagunita became something of a Nelson family compound. At one  point, Rick and Kris Nelson had a condominium down the beach at Blue Lagoon,  and Rick's in-laws, Tom and Elyse Harmon, lived a few doors down from Ozzie and  Harriet. Ozzie's brother Don, who wrote for the show, still has a house in  Lagunita. So does actor Kent McCord, who got his acting start playing one of  Rick's fraternity brothers on the show, and producer Joe Byrne, a high school  friend of David who began his career working as a gofer on the series.  </P> <P> Harriet, who does her own shopping at the supermarket across the highway and at  other Laguna stores, enjoys the "village atmosphere of Laguna."  </P> <P> "I like almost everything about it," she said. "I know everyone down here, and  they are all such nice people."  </P> <P> Harriet said she spends a lot of time on her deck, especially in the evening  "because it's so lovely. The ocean's noisy, but it's a quiet noise." She also  enjoys sitting on the beach but says, "if you've got stuff to do upstairs you'd  better not go down to the beach because you won't come back up. I don't. It's a  different world down there and you kind of leave everything else upstairs. I  could be a beachcomber very easily."  </P> <P> Harriet is a member of the women's advisory council of South Coast Medical  Center and is a patron of Las Marineras, an auxiliary to Family Service of  America, a family counseling service. Although virtually retired from acting,  Harriet earlier this year did a guest shot as a nun on granddaughter Tracy  Nelson's television series, "Father Dowling Mysteries."  </P> <P> Last year, thinking she'd like to be closer to family and friends in Los  Angeles, Harriet bought a second home in Studio City.  </P> <P> Her intention was to divide her time between Studio City and Laguna. But  despite spending several months having the Studio City house remodeled, Harriet  recently put it up for sale.  </P> <P> "It's a very nice house," she said. "It's just that I find I can't live with  one foot in one and one foot in the other."  </P> <P> Although she has lived in the Lagunita house for 12 years, it has only recently  come to feel like home to her, Harriet said, explaining that it was a wrenching  experience for her to give up the Hollywood house where she and Ozzie lived for  35 years.  </P> <P> "You know, I didn't realize (the Lagunita house) was really home until I bought  that house up in Los Angeles. Then I realized it didn't feel like home, and  that this is it. So that's the good that came out of it for me."  </P> <P> Asked to describe what the Lagunita house has meant to the Nelson family over  the years, Harriet recalled something her 14-year-old grandson, Sam Nelson,  said while spending the weekend with her recently.  </P> <P> "We were sitting in the living room and he said, 'Grandma, this is the nicest  house in the world,' " she said. "Later on I told that to Tracy, who was down  here with him, and she said, 'You know what he meant, Grandma? You're a  constant to us.' She said, 'No matter what comes and goes, you're always here.'

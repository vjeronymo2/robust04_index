			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 28 March carries in its  regular 35-minute newscast three reports on the combat situation  in the republic.    Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "an  artillery  attack at Mijanovici, from the direction of Miljane, is still in  progress. The chetniks still do not believe that they cannot  take another inch of the Gorazde free territory, although they  are using the most destructive mortar shells, tanks, Pragas, and  other deadly weapons. New groups of chetniks have reached  Kozara, Ogorjevac, Duge, and Praca. The reconnaissance units of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army East Bosnian Operative Group have  noticed that the chetniks are mining the railroad line in [name  indistinct] on the Rogatica-Ilidza road. They have also noticed  a large concentration of aggressor's forces in this area. In  addition to attacking all the defense lines in the area of the  Gorazde Municipality, the chetniks have managed to cut short the  supply of humanitarian aid to Gorazde."    Correspondent Velid Djindo reports on the situation in Olovo  and says that "this morning's gunfire announced another fierce  day of war. The enemy guns were soon joined by mortars, which  shelled military and civilian targets with the heaviest shells.  Attacks at Olovo continued in the afternoon hours. We have no  information about the consequences of the aggressor's attacks."    The studio announcer reads a report by the 1st Corps  Information Service and says that "the aggressor today violated  the cease-fire in the Sarajevo area. There were small arms'  provocations from Nedzarici, from the direction of the Bosut  barracks. The enemy snipers were particularly active, which  resulted in the wounding of two members of our Army in Hladivode  and Stupsko Brdo. The 1st Corps troops did not respond to these  provocations."</p>

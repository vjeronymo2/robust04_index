			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 24 May (EFE) -- Chilean Foreign Minister  Carlos Figueroa said today that the country is "very calm and  very confident" about the results of the defense it made before  the arbitration tribunal that will establish the borderline in  Laguna del Desierto. He also denied Argentine reports of an  alleged "territorial barter deal."    The minister emphatically denied Buenos Aires press reports  that Argentina had assured for itself a favorable decision in  the dispute, and that in compensation Chile would be granted  some territories in the continental glacier zone, which is also  under dispute.    "The two areas are being considered in an absolutely  independent manner, and there is no link whatsoever between the  conversations or negotiations over the arbitration in Laguna del  Desierto and the treaty that was proposed for the continental  glacier zone," Figueroa said.    "We are very calm and very confident in the defense Chile  has  made of its interests before the international tribunal, and  what we will do now is wait for the decision," the minister  added.    He said that the decision on Laguna del Desierto is unlikely  to be made before the end of the year.    He reiterated that Chile and Argentina have no pending  border  problems, recalling that in October 1991 the presidents of the  two nations resolved 22 of the 24 border disputes.    On that occasion, only the Laguna del Desierto dispute was  left unresolved, and it was decided to submit the matter to  arbitration, while a solution -- which must be ratified by  Congress in the two countries -- was reached for the continental  glacier zone.    He added that the Peace and Friendship Treaty that the two  countries signed in 1984 has mechanisms for finding consensus  solutions through juridical channels for any difficulty that may  appear during the ongoing border negotiations.    Figueroa reiterated that Chile had made "a very good  defense"  before the international tribunal, which is headed by Colombian  jurist Rafael Nieto and includes four other Latin American  jurists.    The disputed territory in Laguna del Desierto covers a bit  more than 500 square kilometers between parallel 62 south [as  received] and Mt. Fitz Roy.    Minister Figueroa also announced that on 8 June he will  travel to Argentina to start negotiations in search for a  formula for a partnership with the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur) countries.</p>

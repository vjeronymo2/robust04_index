			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Government decision threatens UK energy chances The government's decision to back only three small projects producing electricity from crops has jeopardised Britain's chances of becoming the European Union leader in this emerging technology, claim supporters of the industry, Alison Maitland writes. Fast-growing willow and poplar trees, harvested for burning in power plants, could provide 20 per cent of Britain's electricity needs by 2025, according to the most optimistic projections. Farmers' leaders see short rotation coppice as a promising source of alternative income as food production is cut. However, the government announced funding for coppice power plants with a capacity of only 19MW in its latest round of subsidies for renewable energy. Two of the three approved bids are believed to have been from South Western Electricity and the third by Yorkshire Water.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This rule would not establish a preference or set aside for the Great Lakes. Availability of U.S.-flag service would continue to be determined on a national basis. The amount of cargo reserved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for U.S.-flag vessels overall would not decrease because the cargo to be moved on foreign-flag feeder vessels to Canadian transshipment points would not be ``subtracted out'' from the 75 percent of cargoes reserved for U.S.-flag carriage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule recognizes the operational limitations of the St. Lawrence Seaway and makes it possible for U.S. ports situated on the Great Lakes to compete with ports located on the other coastal ranges of the United States for the shipment of bulk agricultural product cargoes. It would not guarantee that cargoes will move through Great Lakes ports, but would only allow the Great Lakes ports an opportunity to compete for such cargoes. Movements out of the Great Lakes would still be required to be cost competitive with U.S.-flag service from the other coastal ranges in order to attract cargoes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would not interfere with the concept of ``lowest landed cost'' contained in the regulations of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a unit of the Department of Agriculture responsible for obtaining agricultural products for shipment under various foreign aid programs. The CCC regulations, at 7 CFR 1496.5, provide that the lowest combined total cost of the commodity, plus transportation charges to the port of destination calculated on the basis of U.S.-flag rates and availability, will prevail with regard to awarding contracts. The proposed combined transportation originating at Great Lakes ports would compete on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the basis of lowest landed cost with U.S.-flag vessel availability from the other port ranges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for determining a ``fair and reasonable'' rate for this mixed carriage, the U.S.-flag component would be considered under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulations at 46 CFR part 382 or part 383, as appropriate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the cost for the foreign-flag component incorporated into the U.S.-flag component in the same way as the cost of foreign-flag vessels used in lightening operations in the recipient country's territorial waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Rulemaking Analyses and Notices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This rulemaking has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866 and Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). It is not considered to be an economically significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, since it has been determined that it is not likely to result in a rule that may have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. Since this rule would affect other Federal agencies, is of great interest to the maritime industry, and has been determined to be a significant rule under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures, it is considered to be a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. The abbreviated time for comment on the one-season trial period is necessitated by the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway System on April 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MARAD projects that this rule would allow the movement of up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 250,000 to 300,000 metric tons of agricultural commodities from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Great Lakes ports, with a reduction in the shipping cost to the sponsoring Federal agencies of up to $2 to $3 per metric ton ($500,000 to $900,000).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Federalism  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Maritime Administration has analyzed this rulemaking in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that these regulations do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Maritime Administration certifies that this rulemaking will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Environmental Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Maritime Administration has considered the environmental impact of this rulemaking and has concluded that an environmental impact statement is not required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This rulemaking contains no reporting requirement that is subject to OMB approval under 5 CFR Part 1320, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 381.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Freight, Maritime carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, MARAD proposes to amend 46 CFR part 381 as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 381_[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Dutch win back state debt trade - International The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is claiming a victory on its home turf. After years of witnessing the steady seepage of trading business in Dutch government bonds to London, the Amsterdam exchange now claims the tide is turning and that the proportion of trading in Dutch state debt conducted overseas is gradually declining, due to the introduction of a new inter-dealer-broker (IDB) system in Amsterdam. The Dutch central bank, which has been monitoring the relative level of trading of Dutch government bonds both in Amsterdam and in London, announced earlier this month that the proportion of business carried out in London has fallen from 50 per cent during 1992, to around 30 per cent this year. London had seen as much as 60 per cent of the trading activity in Dutch government bonds back in 1989, and the Amsterdam exchange was clearly concerned about the flow of business overseas. In its efforts to claw back trading volume, it asked McKinsey &amp; Co to study the problem and make recommendations as to how the exchange should develop in order to become more competitive. McKinsey made its report in late 1992 and noted that the competitive position of the Amsterdam stock exchange in both equities and bonds had deteriorated in the late 1980s, adding 'quantitative comparisons and interviews point to three major causes for the recorded loss of market share. 'First, foreign investor trading in Dutch securities has grown strongly. Second, competition from foreign intermediaries has increased. And third, the performance of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange has lagged behind that of London's securities market.' Foreigners have been keen investors in Dutch government paper in recent years for several reasons. The Dutch currency is very tightly pegged to the D-Mark, and Dutch monetary policy has followed that of the Bundesbank very closely. Furthermore, the Dutch inflation picture was far less of a worry than in Germany, so when 'convergence' was the buzzword of the European government bond markets, investors simply regarded Dutch government bonds as 'bund surrogates' with the result that Dutch yields have tended to trade very close to, or even lower than those on German bonds. The Agency of the Ministry of Finance, which sells new issues of Dutch government paper, has steadily tried to increase the appeal of Dutch bonds to international investors. Mr Henk Bevers, the agent, stresses that the key change has been to improve the liquidity of the individual bond issues. 'Foreign investors said that liquidity was very important, so we have been trying to boost that,' he says, adding that while the Agency of the Ministry of Finance used to hold about 10 tap issues a year of around Fl 2bn to Fl 3bn each, 'now we have four or five issues a year but of greater size'. The Agency has also opted for a wider array of maturities - issuing a 30-year stock at the end of 1992 which had considerable appeal for both domestic and international institutional investors. Such long-dated issues are a common in the French and US bond markets. 'The market was very appreciative when we did our 30-year issue,' said Mr Bevers. The decision by the Dutch to launch a 30-year bond may well have provided some of the inspiration for Germany, which followed with its own 30-year bund a few months later. However, while ownership of Dutch bonds by foreigners steadily increased from 19 per cent in 1988 to 24 per cent in 1993, the Dutch authorities were far less thrilled at the clear signs of trading activity disappearing to London. To counter this flow of business, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange encouraged the establishment of an inter-dealer-broker in Amsterdam last year, whereby banks and brokers could inform the IDB of their bid and offer prices. The IDB then advertises the prices on its screen system while ensuring the anonymity of the prospective buyers and sellers. In October last year, foreign broking houses which did not have offices in Amsterdam were invited to take up 'special membership' of the Amsterdam Treasury bond market so that they could buy and sell via the IDB without having to set up offices in Amsterdam. Already, the Dutch authorities are claiming the structural changes have proved a success as trading activity is gradually enticed back to their home territory.</p>

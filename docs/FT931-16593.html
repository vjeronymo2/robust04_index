			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / US to step up efforts to collect heavy weapons in Somalia The US is about to step up efforts to collect heavy weapons from armed factions in Somalia, special envoy Robert Oakley said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. Mr Oakley said the move was possible 'now that we have more forces on the ground and those forces have more mobility - helicopters for example, some of which are just arriving this week'. The extent to which US troops try to disarm the warring factions has been the subject of debate between the Bush administration and the United Nations. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, has pressed Washington to take a more activist role.</p>

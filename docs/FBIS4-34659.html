			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The </F> Cartagena Summit"]    [Text] The Ibero-American Summit has proved to be more  important an international event for the number of figures  attending it -- this time 22 chiefs of state or government  attended it in Cartagena -- than for the decisions made therein.  In terms of the number of statesmen attending it, the summit  also proved useful for bilateral contacts that otherwise would  not be made. Aside from that, however, it simply served to  emphasize the contradictions and the discrepancies between the  two Ibero-American worlds and point out the differences inside  each of these worlds. It is, therefore, almost impossible to  reach agreements at these summits, particularly on principles so  broad that their contents prove to be obvious and end up by  becoming almost irrelevant.    There is, however, one noticeable exception. Cuba invariably  takes the opportunity afforded to it by Argentine President  Carlos Menem to recruit supporters for its sad cause. This  time, after Menem's customary attack on the Castroist regime,  President Itamar Franco sympathized with Cuba's plight, seeing  "positive signs of a reform" being implemented on the island and  defended Cuba's readmission into the Inter-American system.  Commander Fidel Castro decided to contribute to the agenda of  the Summit of the Americas, which will be held in Miami in  December, even though Cuba has not been invited to attend. As  expected, Castro calls for the end of the economic embargo  imposed on Cuba by the United States, the evacuation of  Guantanamo Base and of the U.S. bases in Panama, the pardoning  of the Latin American foreign debt, and the abolition of Super  Law 301.    Ibero-American countries should really do their best to  clarify the distorted image Cuba reflects. For the past decade,  no Latin American country has subjected the island to any  important or special trade restrictions and for the past decade  European countries have been trading with Cuba as they wish.  Despite all this, Cuba's misery is attributed to an embargo  imposed on it by the United States. This is one of those lies  that run the risk of becoming accepted as true out of sheer  repetition. Cuba faces dreadful economic hardships because  Fidel Castro perseveres with his clumsy policies -- maybe  because he chose socialism instead of capitalism, maybe because  he remains in power thanks to his caudillo-like dictatorship  instead of trusting the virtues of liberal democracy. The U.S.  embargo is the best excuse for Fidel Castro's failure.    There is, however, another side to this coin. There is harsh  criticism in the United States of the embargo on Cuba and its  exclusion from the Inter-American system. The U.S. people  understand that Castro uses the embargo to remain in power  without having to commit himself to any reform that would  undoubtedly lead to the redemocratization of the island. An  ever-increasing number of influential U.S. citizens, including  members of the active Cuban colony in Florida, openly call for  normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations. As to Cuba's readmission  into the OAS, it must be recalled that the reasons for  suspending Cuba from this forum have ceased to exist. Cuba no  longer exports the revolution and the original reasons for  temporarily preventing the Cuban Government from fulfilling its  functions at the OAS no longer exist either. In addition, most  OAS member countries have diplomatic and trade relations with  Havana.    In spite of what President Itamar Franco said, there are no  signs in Cuba that democracy is being restored. Economic dogmas  are more lax as a result of the increasing shortage of basic  products and the opening of the country to tourism is the only  way the government could at least partially replace the inflow  of strong currencies previously received from Russia. The  democracies of the hemisphere and President Itamar Franco  should, however, press the Cuban dictator in a friendly way to  agree to freedom-promoting political reforms. This is the  goodwill sign Fidel Castro should give before the Inter-American  community takes another step forward.</p>

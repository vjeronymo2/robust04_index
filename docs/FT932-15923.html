			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Observer: Comeback in bear market Stuffed koala bear makers, currently producing Australia's leading tourist goods, are in danger of being overtaken by a backward industry, thanks to aerospace engineer Conrad Stacey. The Brisbane boffin has used his computer to sharpen the design of boomerangs, which have hitherto lagged behind the bear market as a tourist attraction. The reason is that most of those in the shops won't come back when you throw them. About 85 per cent of them are 'rubbish', the country's Boomerang Association says. Stacey is promising a virtual return-on-sale guarantee for his version, measuring 16in long with a 90 degree bend in the middle, and called the Hooper after the type of pinewood from which it is made. 'Even a beginner will get it returning after about 10 minutes' practice,' he claims. Besides selling to visitors, his improvement may start a comeback in the boomerang's popularity with native Australians. Although it was first used by their aboriginal precursors millennia ago, they have since let their throwing skills slip. The one throwers' club in the country is outnumbered a hundredfold by clubs in America. No Australian has ever won the boomerang world championships, which are to be held next in Japan in 1994. And the world record for long-distance throwing of a round 489 feet is held by a Frenchman, Michel Dufayard.</p>

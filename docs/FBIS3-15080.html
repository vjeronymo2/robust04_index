Terrorist  reprisals are simply the most obvious of troubles which may  occur.    The positions of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and his  entourage, which took the risk of recognizing Israel's right to  exist despite being cursed by many Palestinians who are sure  that the only way to resolve all their problems is to cast the  Jews into the sea, have been weakened.    The Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories which  began after the bloodshed in the mosque on Friday is terrifying  the Israelis. Neither negotiations with the Palestinian Arabs  nor peace with them -- only force of arms --- seems to be a  guarantee of their security. In looking for protection, the  Israelis are turning to right-wing parties, opponents of the  negotiations with 'Arafat and of the return of the occupied  territories to the Arabs. Yitzhaq Rabin's government may lose  its support.    Israelis are full of doubt about peace negotiations with the  Arabs because it is the Jews who must make all the real  concessions (including returning the territories). The Arabs,  on the other hand, are being asked for something metaphysical --  to recognize Israel and conclude peace with it. But a treaty is  not a docket for a purchase. It can be dissolved, then it is no  longer possible to return land. To the Israelis this exchange  -- taking into account the Arabs' hatred toward the Jewish state  -- seems to be unequal and unreliable. But the Israelis have no  choice. [passage omitted]    The only correct response by Israel to the massacre in the  mosque is to accelerate talks with the PLO and grant the  Palestinian Arabs autonomy as soon as possible. Otherwise,  Israel will have an uncertain and lonely future which is  dependent on a narrowing circle of friends.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Tough entry proposals for new EC states THE European Commission wants to set high entry requirements for new members of the EC before the Community's next constitutional review in 1996. This was the main outcome of last week's closed Commission debate on enlargement, at which all but two of the 17-strong EC executive agreed to shelve plans to seek a redistribution of power among Community institutions to accommodate new members. Because early membership will allow such countries as Sweden and Austria to take part in the 1996 review, intended to launch the next phase of the European Union agreed at Maastricht, Brussels wants to commit entrants before then to accepting the logic of greater integration - including an eventual common defence policy. The Commission fears that, otherwise, member states like the UK will be encouraged in their efforts to dilute integration. The confidential discussion document setting out the implications of opening the EC to up to 30 members makes clear that the Commission is looking at a radical reform of the Community power structure in the medium term, as new waves of members come in from Nordic and Alpine countries, eastern Europe, and the Mediterranean. Last Tuesday, Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, denied to Danish journalists that he had suggested strengthening the powers of the EC executive at the expense of small member states. The denial followed an attack on Mr Delors by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, who warned him that rumours of the Commission's plans were jeopardising the outcome of the June 2 referendum in Denmark to ratify the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary union (Emu) and political union. The confidential document is drawn up by the Commission's Enlargement Task Force, to assist the Commission in preparing a report on 'widening' the EC for the Lisbon summit on June 26-27. It includes as possible reforms: a 'group-presidency' of three member states to replace the current system, whereby the presidency rotates each six months alphabetically among the 12, regardless of their size and administrative capacity. The group formula would have a president and two vice-presidents who would share presiding over internal EC business each four months; these groups would rotate alphabetically each year, but with 'modulation to avoid conjunctions such as Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg', the document says. It leaves open the sensitive issue of whether 'big' states should always lead the group. a strengthened executive 'combining elements of presidency and commission, and accountable to parliament and council.' Like much of the document, this suggestion is accompanied by a question mark. an extension of majority voting. The current qualified majority system requires 54 votes, or 71 per cent of 76 votes, apportioned according to size of country. The document's most radical suggestion is to 'freeze the qualified majority at its present level of 54 votes, so that each successive enlargement (with more votes added to the total) reduces the relative level, from 71 per cent progressively towards 50 per cent.' These formulae would favour member states like Germany, concerned to strengthen integration while opening up the EC, as well as France, which wants to 'deepen' before any 'widening'. Senior Brussels officials make clear that consideration of them has been shelved, so as not to endanger ratification of Maastricht by the 12.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / ICI-Du Pont deal hangs in balance THE outcome of the European Commission anti-trust inquiry into the asset swap planned by Du Pont of the US and Imperial Chemical Industries was in the balance last night, after a meeting of senior officials broke up inconclusively. Commissioners' advisers, who must suggest to their political bosses how they should vote on the deal at next Wednesday's Commission meeting, were unable to decide yesterday whether it should be blocked, waved through, or approved with strict conditions. The deal involves ICI swapping its worldwide nylon interests for Du Pont's acrylic business and Pounds 250m in cash. The German fibres factory is one of three European plants which will be transferred to Du Pont. The inquiry is emerging as one of the most complex and difficult yet handled by Brussels under the two-year-old EC merger regulation. 'Everybody agreed that this was a borderline case,' said one Commission official after yesterday's four-hour meeting, which he said was conducted in a good spirit. Two weeks ago, the Commission's own merger task force suggested the commissioners should block the deal because it would give Du Pont a dominant position in nylon carpet fibre. The official later indicated the deal was unlikely to be blocked outright. Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, has provisionally agreed a compromise solution with the two companies. This would involve Du Pont sharing the German fibres factory it intends to buy from ICI with a competitor. Related operations - such as research and development - would also be shared.</p>

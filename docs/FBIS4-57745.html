			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Glenda Romero] </F>   [Excerpts] Today, President Carlos Roberto Reina was upset  and angered by an article published in THE ECONOMIST, a British  magazine, in which Honduras, together with Iraq and Bosnia, is  described as a country where investment is risky.    [Begin Reina recording] I ask all of you to repudiate the  article. I am sure you are all patriots and you cannot accept  such rude remarks. Honduras is a country that is making huge  efforts to ensure legal security and to compare Honduras with  Bosnia-Hercegovina, where even the bodies of the dead are being  eaten, is unforgivable rudeness. [end recording] [passage  omitted]    While the article that appeared in THE ECONOMIST continues  to  provoke reactions and the awakening of patriotism in some  sectors, the Honduran Foreign Ministry did not give much  importance to the article and denied that it will protest the  article published in that important magazine.</p>

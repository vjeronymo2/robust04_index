			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Euro-gloom THE ELECTION of Mr Bill Clinton as president of the United States may go down in economic folklore as the event which finally switched both the US dollar and the US economy into recovery mode. Yet Mr Clinton should be wary of reading the wrong message from the markets. It is the lack of leadership in Europe that is largely responsible for this shift in sentiment. The dollar has certainly staged an impressive recovery. Since its record low of DM1.35 in August, the dollar has climbed by 21 pfennigs and by 11.5 per cent on a trade-weighted basis. This explains why sterling has recently looked weak against the dollar while remaining relatively stable against the D-Mark. A dollar rally had to come - the currency has been grossly under-valued because of the low level of US interest rates compared with European rates. But it is doubtful whether the markets can yet feel confident that a rise in real returns on US investments is in the pipeline. Mr Clinton's election may boost confidence, but there is precious little sign that a strong US recovery is underway. A dollar-boosting rise in US interest rates looks unlikely until Mr Alan Greenspan is confident that the US financial sector is in better shape. Nor does Mr Clinton have much room for fiscal manoeuvre. A large fiscal package could raise long-term interest rates while the promise of action may postpone investment as companies wait for tax breaks to arrive. It is in Germany and Europe where events and economic prospects appear to have taken a turn for the worse. A sharp cut in German and continental European interest rates has been inevitable for some time: the unknown has been whether they would come soon or very soon. The Bundesbank is still talking tough while the federal government vacillates. But day by day, the west German economy steps nearer to recession. The recent dollar rally reflects a belief that the Bundesbank is running out of time. But it is also a product of a growing sense of European political malaise. The UK economy is also paralysed by this stultifying and confidence-sapping gloom. But the British chancellor of the exchequer, as he prepares to deliver tomorrow his autumn financial statement, has one advantage over his continental partners. UK interest rates can fall faster than Germany's. They should do so. In the short term, the authorities should be ready to tolerate a further fall against the D-Mark.</p>

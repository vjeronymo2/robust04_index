The EP requests the Commission to draft a report  at the earliest opportunity on any experiments in this field  that may be underway in the Community and to immediately submit  a proposal with a view to prohibiting such experimentation on  Community territory. It also calls on the Community to take the  initiative internationally to convene negotiations for a general  prohibition of the cloning of humans. Presented by the Greens,  this resolution was given the unanimous support of all the  political groups.    As the first parliament in the world to adopt a resolution  on  this subject, the European Parliament has taken an extremely  important initiative in the combat for human dignity, pointed  out Mr. Paul Lannoye (Greens, Belgian). Expressing indignation  over what he called "the worst news of the week", Mr. Otto  Habsburg (Christian Democrat, German) regretted that humanity  has reached the stage at which reality, in which we can now  "truly create Frankensteins", is more terrifying than fiction.  "Nothing stops inventiveness," noted Professor Leon  Schwartzenberg (Socialist, French), regretting that "duplicates"  have been successfully created. Justifications exist, but they  are all unacceptable, he added, before raising the following  question: "When will women be replaced by incubators?" Human  beings cannot be reduced to biological material, he went on to  note. The MEP [Members of European Parliament] concluded by  calling for legal provisions serving as "genuine commandments  for humanity" so that Rabelais' famous comment will not come  true: "Science without conscience is the ruination of the soul."    On behalf of the European Commission, Sir Leon Brittan  recalled that the goal of the American experiment was to help  couples who cannot have children and that researchers have  themselves declared that they do not intend to go further. The  Commission is not aware of any experiments of this type being  conducted in the Community. In any event, such experiments could  not receive Community funding. He added that several Member  States, including the Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland and the  United Kingdom, already have legal provisions banning this type  of research. Even if no Community legislation exists, there is  consensus on this question throughout the Community, concluded  Sir Leon Brittan.</p>

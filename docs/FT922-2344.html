			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Church withholds Pounds 1m aid for cities THE CHURCH Commissioners have been forced by recessionary pressures to withhold a Pounds 1m grant that was to have been made to the Church of England's inner-cities charity, and to tell churchgoers they must contribute more to clergy stipends. The commissioners, who handle the church's main investments, saw investment income grow by only 1 per cent to Pounds 167m last year. They expect little further growth in the near future, while costs are predicted to rise substantially, and speak in their annual report yesterday of a 'period of sharp adjustment' ahead. The charity, the Church Urban Fund, was set up in 1988 as a main recommendation of Faith in the City, the church's report on urban troubles. Its initial target was to raise Pounds 18m from churchgoers in the dioceses and Pounds 5m from industry, with the commissioners contributing a regular Pounds 1m a year. Successful early fund-raising has made the fund one of Britain's 50 largest charities, but the commissioners say they were unable to give their Pounds 1m grant last year 'in the light of the difficult economic outlook'. The announcement of the decision comes a week after a lecture in which the archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, spoke of the importance of charities in a 'society suffering from shallow materialism and spiritual bewilderment'. Financial pressures, the commissioners say, mean they will have to cut the proportion of clergy stipends they fund in future. Providing pensions for the clergy and contributing to their pay consumes 85 per cent of the commissioners' investment income. Last year's Church of England pay bill was Pounds 145m, of which the commissioners met 45 per cent. A typical church member currently contributes about Pounds 3 a week.</p>

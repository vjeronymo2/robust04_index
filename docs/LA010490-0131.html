			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 69 EXECUTED IN 1989, TAIWAN REGIME SAYS  </P> <P> The government of Taiwan executed a record 69 people in 1989, more than triple  the number shot the previous year, a Justice Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Taiwan law allows the death penalty for murder, rape, kidnaping, gang robbery  and other serious crimes. Executions are often carried out with a shot through  the heart while the criminal lies face down in a sandpit.  </P> <P> The spokesman said in a telephone interview that 22 people were executed in  1988, and 94 people between 1978 and 1988.  </P> <P> Taiwan, a country of 20 million people, has been plagued by a crime wave, with  almost daily reports of robberies, kidnapings, shoot-outs and murders.  </P></p>

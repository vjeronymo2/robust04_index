			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / FT Conference: Aircraft industry sees cancellations increase THE world commercial aircraft industry is facing a growing short-term crisis because of the oversupply of aircraft in a financially depressed airline market. Airlines cancelled 138 orders for new aircraft last year, the highest total since the 1982 recession, Mr Gunter Eser, the director general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said in Singapore yesterday in an address to a Financial Times Conference on Asian-Pacific aviation. Mr Emmanuel Vasseur, executive vice-president of France's Banque Indosuez, also warned that manufacturers including the European Airbus consortium, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US were coming under increasing pressure as airlines reduced their new aircraft commitments and cut their longer-term fleet acquisition programmes. Mr Eser said the airline industry would be lucky to contain its overall losses last year to between Dollars 3.5bn and Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2bn and Pounds 2.29bn). 'The immediate fall-out from this is evident. Aircraft orders and deliveries are being delayed or cancelled,' added the head of the association grouping 202 airlines. Airlines received 650 new jet aircraft last year and still have more than 3,000 on order. But the signs of a cutback are clear. Mr Eser said orders placed last year dropped by 60 per cent compared with 1990 from 1,218 to 467 aircraft. Iata's two largest member airlines - American Airlines and United Airlines - have already announced big cuts. American is deferring or dropping options on 93 aircraft valued at more than Dollars 5bn; United has cut 123 aircraft worth Dollars 6.7bn from its fleet plans for the next five years. In Europe, the German carrier Lufthansa, which has just announced its first loss since 1973, is delaying orders for 11 new Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 airliners. The growing problems now facing aircraft manufacturers were to a large extent of their own making by encouraging airlines to acquire more new aircraft than necessary in the late 1980s creating a significant overcapacity in the market, Mr Vasseur argued. The manufacturers are focusing their attention on the Asia-Pacific airline market which continues to hold the best prospects for growth. Mr Eser said Iata's latest forecast expected to see Asia-Pacific passenger traffic grow by 8.6 per cent a year between 1991 and 1995 and by a further 7.5 per cent a year between 1995 and 2000.</p>

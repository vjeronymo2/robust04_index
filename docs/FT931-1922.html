			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BAT's paper solution BAT Industries offer of an enhanced scrip dividend has been made in spite of, rather than because of, last week's Budget. The lower rate of Advance Corporation Tax promised by the chancellor should if anything encourage a company with predominantly overseas earnings to reward shareholders with cash. Even so, the proposed scrip might save BAT Pounds 100m unrelieved ACT this year. What is, in effect, a small rights issue should not then dilute earnings per share. Together with a solemn promise not to repeat the exercise, that may overcome the markets' suspicion of companies which prefer to print shares than fork out hard cash. BAT must still convince it can earn a decent return on the money that will be saved if all shareholders elect to take the scrip. Its case is helped by the fast growth of the tobacco and US insurance businesses. Net debt is expected to fall even if the scrip is shunned. Other companies which might be planning similar arrangements simply to avoid paying ACT or prop up weak cash flow deserve to be sent away with a thick ear. The whole exercise underlines the unfortunate side-effects of the ACT system. One can only hope the chancellor's proposed foreign income dividends survive beyond the consultation paper and result in a more sensible solution. Common sense dictates dividends should be set according to companies' resources and the rate of return on alternative investments. Setting dividend policy by every new twist of taxation is putting the cart before the horse.</p>

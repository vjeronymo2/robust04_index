			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santiago, 4 Apr (EFE) -- Chilean businessman  Carlos Cardoen, who made a fortune in arms sales to Iraq and is  now facing possible extradition to U.S. justice, will not  voluntarily go to that country, his lawyer Nurieldin Hermosilla  said.    Hermosilla's comments were published by LA SEGUNDA today.  Hermosilla explained that Cardoen will not appear before a Miami  court "because in the United States there is no certainty as to  when he would be tried. He could be in prison for years before  the trial."    The lawyer said: "Cardoen did not commit any crime. That is  known in detail by the prosecutors. They met with us in  Jamaica, last year in April, and we held a long conversation."    Hermosilla recalled that his son, Juan Pablo Hermosilla, who  is also a lawyer, is in the United States talking with Eduardo  Palmer, one of the prosecutors in charge of this case, to gain  some "advantage" for Cardoen, but he reiterated: "They know  this is a lost case."

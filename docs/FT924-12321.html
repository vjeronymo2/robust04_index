			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Greenalls Since Greenalls has no large acquisition to finance, coming to the market under current volatile conditions is a little strange. Indeed, the need to tread gingerly is highlighted by the way its modest one-for-five rights issue is pitched at an 18 per cent discount to Monday's closing price. Perhaps the company was unwilling to see gearing rise further and so felt constrained in its piecemeal pub purchase programme. Or the deal may have as much to do with restoring interest cover to a more comfortable 3.5 times as it has with providing ammunition for Greenalls to use against distressed sellers of hotels and pubs. But shareholders might have liked to know what they were buying before pulling out their chequebooks. Whatever the timing considerations, investors have to judge the management's strategy. The decision to pull out of brewing was sensible, given Greenalls' lacklustre beers. Improving the quality of the pub estate also seems to have helped margins, though the capital expenditure involved may continue to drain cash from the group. But tactics in the hotel chain are more questionable. Poor conditions in the three-star middle market are scant justification for expanding in the four- and five-star area during a recession. The company, and its shareholders, should be cautious.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Former NTT Chairman Pleads Not Guilty: The former chairman of Nippon Telegraph  &amp; Telephone pleaded not guilty to taking bribes in the Recruit  shares-for-favors scandal, one of the biggest to rock Japan. "I myself have  never done any favors for Recruit," the local media quoted Hisashi Shinto as  saying. Tokyo prosecutors charged Shinto with receiving stock in return for  favors while he headed NTT, the world's largest company in terms of the value  of its outstanding shares. Shinto admitted that he received unlisted shares  from the Recruit Co., but he told the court he did not see the stock as a  bribe.  </P></p>

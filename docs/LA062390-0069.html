			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWISS LINK IRANIAN GOVERNMENT TO ASSASSINATION OF REBEL LEADER  </P> <P> Swiss justice authorities Friday charged that Iranian government agencies  directly planned and carried out the assassination in Switzerland of resistance  leader Kazem Radjavi.  </P> <P> Radjavi, 56, was gunned down April 24 by two masked men in the small town of  Coppet on Lake Geneva.  </P> <P> The brother of Massoud Radjavi, head of the Iraq-based Khalq resistance  movement, Kazem acted as a lobbyist at U.N. human rights meetings against the  fundamentalist regime in Tehran.  </P> <P> A statement by Swiss investigating magistrates Friday said there was evidence  that 13 people had taken part in "minutely planning the killing" beginning in  January.  </P> <P> It said assassination team members with Iranian government service passports --  "all issued on the same date" -- flew between Tehran and Geneva on Iran Air and  stayed at hotels in and around Geneva.  </P> <P> "At the current stage of the investigation, police have collected various  evidence that one or more official Iranian agencies were directly involved in  the assassination of Kazem Radjavi," the statement said.  </P> <P> "It appears that the actual assassination squad comprised four persons," it  said. "The investigation has shown that several persons left Geneva by air for  Vienna less than two hours after the murder."  </P> <P> Police believe the two men who gunned Radjavi down had passports issued in the  "almost certainly false" names of Yadollah Samadi and Mohammad Said Rezvani,  the statement said.  </P></p>

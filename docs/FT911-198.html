			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Management: Self-help takes off from the flat-lands - The application of community bonds in Saskatchewan Any effort to lure new industry to rural Saskatchewan runs the risk of ending up as more of a repellent than a magnet. Far away from North America's main markets, the farming towns which dot the Canadian prairies are best known for their pancake-flat scenery and numbing winters. But in their quest for diversification, these remote communities have hit on a novel way to tempt small and mid-sized businesses into setting up or expanding on their doorstep. Their bargaining chip is a scheme of government-sponsored 'community bonds'. Launched last year, the bonds are designed to mobilise equity for local enterprises, using the sizeable amounts of money which frugal prairie townsfolk and farmers have up to now squirrelled away in low-risk bank deposits and blue-chip shares. Several businesses have already taken the bait. Trinitral International, a small maker of telephone sets, expects to open a 17-person assembly and packaging facility next month in the south-east Saskatchewan town of Melville (population 5,000). Melville's Community Bond Corporation raised CDollars 250,000 from local residents late last year, giving it a 25 per cent stake in Trinitral. Other shareholders are a provincial government agency, the company's managers and Dorart Industries, a Singapore company which will supply kits and know-how to Trinitral. In the town of Kindersley, near the Saskatchewan-Alberta border, a newly formed community bond corporation hopes to rake in CDollars 500,000 over the next month or two. The money will be invested in Rotary Airforce, which is developing a slow-moving type of helicopter suitable for crowd control and pipeline inspections. Rotary's existing R&amp;D operation is currently occupying aircraft hangars near Edmonton, in neighbouring Alberta. The infusion of equity from community bonds has led the company to set up its manufacturing facility in Kindersley. Over 60 towns have registered community bond corporations in the past year. Three financings have been completed, while ten other bond offerings are currently under way. Other project companies include a maker of combine harvester attachments and a pea-chip processing plant. Some communities plan to use the corporations like mutual funds, first raising money and then searching for one or more businesses which they would like to have in town. The key to the scheme is a guarantee provided by the provincial government on the principal amount of the bonds. In other words, local investors stand to lose no more than the interest, dividends or capital gains which might have accrued elsewhere. Even with this safeguard, however, the community bond scheme is fraught with risks. At least some of the businesses will almost certainly fail, which could leave the government with sizeable financial obligations, and local communities with the political and economic scars of a serious misadventure. Some community bond corporations, designed as vehicles for 'people's capitalism', may have difficulty functioning as sophisticated shareholders. Many of the directors are neophytes in economic development. The 12-member Kindersley corporation, for instance, includes a local dentist and a farmer. Each board must also appoint a 'youth director' under the age of 18. There is a nagging suspicion in some quarters that the provincial government, facing an election later this year, has launched the scheme with an eye on popular appeal rather than sound commercial practice. One observer notes that 'there is quite a lot of nervousness among those close to the process, compared with the euphoria of the politicians who are touting it'. Despite these potential stumbling blocks, Dale Botting, regional manager for the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, thinks the scheme is worth a try. He expects that the government's total liability to holders of community bonds will turn out to be far lower than the millions of dollars which it has poured into extravagant projects over the years. 'The real value of this may be to shore up the equity of businesses already in the community and to encourage an entrepreneurial culture,' Botting says. For instance, Trinitral was able to get sufficient bank financing for its telephone set business only after it came up with the extra equity provided by community bonds. Among other spin-offs, residents who volunteer to sell community bonds receive a short training course in the basics of investing in a small business. Students at the Saskatch-ewan College of Commerce can obtain course credits by helping with administrative work in the corporations. Rick Dillabaugh, Kindersley's economic development officer, acknowledges that many of the bond-financed ventures will fail. But he contends that 'if you don't go out and try, you won't get the good ones either. This puts the destiny of the community into its own hands. They can choose what direction they want to take.' The proceeds of bond sales are normally invested in a company's preferred shares, convertible into common stock after three to five years. In that way, holders can benefit from increased dividends and capital gains, if there are any. Bond corporations have a right to nominate directors to the boards of project companies proportionate to their equity stakes. The province is well aware of the risk that the scheme could degenerate into a gravy train for dubious ventures. Community bond corporations are encouraged to hire a reputable accountant or lawyer to help them sift through project proposals. Every investment must also be approved by a six-member provincial review committee, comprising two business lawyers, a former head of the provincial finance department, and three economic development experts. Graham Parsons, a government economist who claims credit for devising the scheme and is now in charge of implementing it, reckons that the best safeguard is the board of directors of the bond corporations themselves. 'These people will be in the community for the next 10-20 years,' Parsons says. 'They have a significant responsibility to be fair and reasonable to others in the community.'</p>

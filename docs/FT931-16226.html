			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Dangers behind the stand-off with Iraq: Saddam Hussein continues to call the tune in spite of the latest sabre rattling by the west THE PERVERSITY of Middle East politics makes it probable that the longer the confrontation lasts between President Saddam Hussein and the western allies the greater will be the benefit to the Iraqi leader and others who want to undermine the more conservative regimes in the region. The US, Britain and France would be bound to react militarily if surface-to-air missiles were to remain in the exclusion zone imposed south of the 32nd parallel last August. The missiles threaten allied aircraft and, like yesterday's skirmish at the Kuwaiti border, appear designed to provoke a response. Limited air strikes against the missile batteries would make little difference to the situation on the ground and will not assist the Shia population in the south. Politically it seems unlikely to hasten Mr Saddam's departure. However, in the wider Islamic context, any allied action could be presented in a very partial light. Further bombing of Mr Saddam's forces will contrast sharply with the perceived Allied indifference to the fate of Moslems in former Yugoslavia. Such vigorous western insistence on Iraqi compliance with UN resolutions will be set alongside the toleration of Israel's rejection of UN resolution 799 demanding that Israel takes back 415 Palestinians it ejected from the occupied territories. The west's friends in the Middle East were unhappy about the southern air exclusion zone when it was imposed. They feared the start of a process which would divide Iraq into three: the autonomous Kurdish region in the north, the Shias in the south, and the central portion controlled from Baghdad. Iranian officials point out that the two air exclusion zones incorporate the areas where Iraq's main oil fields and pumping stations are located, Kirkuk in the north and Basra in the south. They choose to see the US-led action as an extension of its policy to secure control of Middle East oil supplies, with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia having already in effect been militarily occupied. Kuwait, which will always feel vulnerable to its northern neighbour, is the only Gulf country which fully backs an American military presence. The fear for other countries, in particular Saudi Arabia, is that the allied air forces and navies are becoming a fixture. After the Kuwait crisis it was with a sense of huge relief that the ruling family in Saudi Arabia watched the bulk of the US forces depart. The financial damage to the nation's exchequer had been substantial but the social and political fabric had survived with no more than a containable backlash from the more extreme clergy. Evidence of Saudi sensitivity to international attention was again evident when visa requests from American journalists were refused last summer as US aircraft returned to Saudi bases to police southern Iraq. Now, more than ever, there is no obvious cut-off point or moment when victory could be declared and the Shias said to be safe from persecution. Worse than that, Saddam Hussein will see it in his interest to keep a US military force in the region as a way of deflecting attention in Baghdad from worsening economic conditions. In such an open-ended situation it is the Iraqi leader who can call the tune, while it may be the western allies who ultimately suffer more from their response.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Close vote on US gun ban law expected The US House of Representatives was facing the tightest of votes yesterday on the bill banning sales of 19 different types of semi-automatic assault weapons and large magazine guns. The bill, sponsored by Congressman Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat, has emerged as a serious test of the power of the gun lobby, which has experienced some unaccustomed setbacks around the country in recent months. Earlier this week it appeared that the legislation would fall 15-20 votes short of securing a simply majority in the 435-member House. But a ferocious lobbying effort by the Clinton administration, bolstered by supportive letters from former presidents Ford, Reagan and Carter, had narrowed the gap by yesterday morning. Some conspicuous converts to the gun control cause were achieved in the last 24 hours, including two congressmen from Texas, a state in which the National Rifle Association has long been a particularly powerful political force. Yesterday morning, President Bill Clinton personally welcomed in the Rose Garden Congressman Steve Neal of North Carolina, who is retiring at the end this session, as the latest convert. However, the bill finds the Democratic party leadership divided. Congressman Jack Brooks from Texas, chairman of the House judiciary committee, opposes the ban and kept the provision out of the omnibus crime bill passed by the House last month (the Senate version, passed last year, does outlaw the assault weapons). Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House, is also on record as opposing it, mostly out of deference to his constituents in the state of Washington, where hunting is popular. But on Wednesday he hinted that he would only vote 'in case of a tie', leaving open the prospect that he might choose not to oppose his president on the issue. The bill places many members in severe dilemmas. All polls suggest overwhelming public support for such a ban, also desired by police authorities. Support is strongest in America's suburbs, the most populous political constituency. But the opponents of gun control, directed by the NRA, are well financed and organised. Their argument is that the ban on assault weapons is merely the beginning of the slippery slope which ends with the banning of all privately owned firearms, thus, in their view, violating the constitutional right to bear arms. Congressman Jim Chapman, the Democrat from east Texas, said: 'If you polled my district, it would be a toss-up. But all the calls are against it.'</p>

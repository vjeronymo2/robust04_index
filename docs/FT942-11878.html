			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Founder of Hyundai to retire from management Mr Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai conglomerate, said yesterday he would retire from management of South Korea's largest business group. His departure is meant to ease tension between Hyundai and the government, which has discriminated against the group since Mr Chung unsuccessfully stood against President Kim Young-sam in the 1992 election. Since that election, Hyundai has not received low-interest industrial loans from the state-run Korea Development Bank and has been restricted in raising capital abroad. Three of its main subsidiaries have also been denied listings on the Seoul bourse. The retirement of 78-year-old Mr Chung would end a business career that began with the founding of Hyundai in 1947 as a small motor service company. During the next three decades he developed Hyundai into a symbol of Korean industrial might with 48 subsidiaries and total assets of Won31,700bn (Pounds 25.8bn). Share prices for Hyundai companies rose in the expectation the government would resume financing to the group. Some government officials have urged that the restrictions against Hyundai be removed for the sake of the national economy. Aides to Mr Kim expressed scepticism that Mr Chung would in fact withdraw from Hyundai's management and retire to live on his farming estate. They noted that he will remain as honorary chairman and continue to provide advice to his brother, Mr Chung Se-yung, the group chairman. Mr Chung described the honorary chairmanship as a 'ceremonial' position, but his status as group founder almost certainly guarantees he will continue to guide the conglomerate from behind the scenes. South Korea yesterday accused North Korea of violating the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the Korean war by threatening to withdraw from the military armistice commission. North Korea said it would try to dismantle the commission unless the US agreed to conduct negotiations on a peace treaty to replace the truce pact.</p>

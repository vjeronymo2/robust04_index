			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / US accused of inflexibility in Cuban refugee talks Cuba's chief negotiator in the current talks with the US said yesterday that Washington has taken a rigid stance over possible moves to stop the flight of Cuban refugees to Florida. Mr Ricardo Alarcon predicted little progress until the discussions tackle the US economic embargo of the Caribbean island, agencies report from New York. The Cuban former foreign minister insisted that thousands of his fellow-citizens have recently risked crossing the Florida Straits in flimsy rafts because of the 30-year embargo by the US against Cuba. He said on CNN television that Cuba was 'flexible enough' to discuss attempts to end the exodus when talks resume in New York, which was due to happen late yesterday. 'But we have to make it very clear,' he went on, 'that, if you want to find a real resolution to this problem, you cannot ignore the sources' - namely the economic embargo. The US negotiators were 'not prepared even to talk about that,' Mr Alarcon said. 'It's very unfortunate. That means that a real solution cannot be found.' The latest flood of Cubans leaving the island began when President Fidel Castro responded to riots in Havana on August 5 by suggesting that his government would no longer stop citizens trying to leave. Since then, more than 28,000 Cubans are believed to have tried to reach Florida on home-made craft. The tide of refugees was slowed on Saturday, when 850 people were picked up by the US Coast Guard. This was down from nearly 1,300 on Friday. During two days of talks in New York last week, US officials said Washington had proposed putting in place an 'expanded, predictable, dependable and legal' migration programme, provided that Havana took steps to prevent an illegal, dis-organised exodus from the island. Mr Alarcon was not optimistic about the chances of reaching an agreement during the talks yesterday, or any time soon. 'I think that there is still a pretty long road to go before we can finalise a specific agreement. That's my impression. But it's possible to find one.' The US state department stated that the US delegation at the talks would have nothing to say until after the meeting last night.</p>

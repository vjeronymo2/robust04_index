			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 12 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Troops loyal to  Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio have thwarted two  coup attempts against his government over the past three months,  the Guatemalan newspaper EL GRAFICO reports today.    The newspaper, which cites Army "officers" as its sources,  reports de Leon has been the object of two thwarted coups since  he assumed the Presidency in June 1993, replacing deposed  President Jorge Serrano, following his self-perpetrated coup on  25 May of the same year.    Troops loyal to the president thwarted the attempted coups,  the paper reported without expanding on the details of those who  participated in the alleged coups to disrupt constitutional  order.    The report adds after the thwarted coups the Army "has been  strengthened, and democracy is safe."    Both de Leon and his defense minister, General Mario Rene  Enriquez, have denied intense rumors of alleged coup attempts to  unseat the chief of state.    They have admitted, however, "retired military and  frustrated  politicians," who were not identified, once knocked on the doors  of the garrisons to promote a coup d'etat against Ramiro de  Leon, former human rights ombudsman.    Enrique states the Armed Forces will no longer lend itself  to  any more revolts as in the past and that institutionality and  the democratic process are guaranteed.</p>

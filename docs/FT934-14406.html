			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The art of thinking small - Neil Moore sets out some ground rules for investors SMALLER companies are firmly back on the investment agenda. The theory is that the green shoots of recovery have appeared and that niche operations and short lines of communication, which became vices during the recession, have recovered their virtue. Restricted share marketability, which magnified investors' losses during four years of underperformance, could now sharply magnify the gains. Well, perhaps. But investing in smaller companies is an art as much as a science. More accurately, it calls for an exercise of judgment beyond analysts' conventional number-crunching. Nonetheless, there are some useful rules. Investment in any company begins with a look at the products and/or services that it offers. The smaller the company, the fewer the areas of activity and the more specific one's questions. Is demand for the product sufficiently large and growing? Will it continue to grow? What is the bargaining power of the supplier vis-a-vis the customer? How high are the barriers to entry for would-be competitors (for example, heavy capital investment, technical know-how)? An ideal situation would be a company making an advanced component, the reliability of which is essential for the customer's end-product while forming only a small proportion of its total cost. That leads to wide and sustainable margins. You then look at the company's financial position. Unfortunately, this is not as straightforward as you might think. Accountants have been described as people who would rather be precisely wrong than roughly right and this portrayal, while unkind, is not without foundation. A generation of creative accountants, pursued by successive exposure drafts and accounting standards, has left the ordinary investor bewildered. Naturally, you look for balance sheet strength, hoping (or rather checking) that all the debts and similar obligations have been shown properly. And you look, too, for a progressive earnings-per-share growth record through all stages of the economic cycle - with comfortable (and ideally expanding) margins. But it is especially important to look at cash balances and cash flow. Pay particular attention to the 'Source and Application of Funds' statement and check that the company, having serviced its debt, paid its taxes and distributed dividends, has generated sufficient cash to replenish its capital and invest for future growth. You can, of course, bend or break these rules - for example, if looking for recovery or turn-round situations. But, while the potential rewards may be great, so are the risks. The next stage, appraising the quality of management, is the most tricky. A professional investor will visit the company, have face-to-face discussions with key staff, check internal reporting systems and financial controls, and ensure that the business plan is sound and that there are contingency arrangements. This is obviously impracticable for a private investor but it is a crucial part of the appraisal process. Accordingly, as with any steps for which you lack the resources or the time, make the professionals work for you. Consult your stockbroker or other financial adviser and read the stock market commentators in the press. Decide the points that you wish answered and be sure the pundits have at least satisfied themselves on those scores. So much for company analysis - how about stock market prospects? The main yardstick here is the price/earnings ratio. I have a personal rule of thumb. To avoid being carried along by extremes of fashion or exposed to unrealistic expectations, you should not buy a share with a p/e more than three-quarters the percentage annual earnings growth rate. This is no more infallible than any other yardstick but it could help to keep your feet on the ground. One particular merit of smaller companies is that directors often have significant share stakes, ensuring a community of interest between management and investors. Thus, it is important to monitor directors' share dealings. Be wary if you see them selling: there might well be a humdrum explanation in an individual case (say, a tax bill) but sales from more than one director in the same company are a definite amber light. Another word of caution - take any profits setback seriously , especially if apparently unexpected. The first piece of bad news is rarely the last. It is painful to sell after a significant fall in the share price, but it can be even more painful to hold on in such circumstances. Finally, back to the question of risk. Individually, smaller companies are more risky than larger ones although, historically at least, not when in groups of sufficient number to provide adequate diversification. If you wish to hold shares in just one or two smaller companies, recognise that, while not quite on a par with putting your stake on the favourite in the 2.30 at Epsom, you are doing it as much for the interest and excitement as for the reward. If you want a diversified portfolio and lack the means or opportunity to manage it yourself, study the form and choose a specialist smaller companies unit trust or investment trust from a stable of established pedigree.</p>

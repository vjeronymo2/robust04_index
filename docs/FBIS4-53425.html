			<p>BFN     [Text] He Zhiqang, the governor of China's Yunnan  Province, called on Board of Investment [BOI] Secretary General  Sathaphon Kawitanon last week. During the talks, the Yunnan  governor asked the BOI to promote Thai investment in southern  China as part of the hexagon sub-regional economic development  project.    BOI Secretary General Sathaphon told reporters after the  meeting that the Yunnan governor wanted more foreign  participation to support his plan to move towards a  market-oriented economy. Thailand has so far invested in 11  projects worth U.S. $50 million in Yunnan and ranks as its 6th  most active foreign investor. Its businessmen invest mostly in  small and medium-sized enterprises. Two of the 11 projects are  supported by the BOI.    During the meeting, the BOI secretary general said Thai  businessmen have recognized the investment opportunities in  Yunnan well, but they felt obstructed by the inadequate  infrastructure. Yunnan Governor He Zhiqiang said a large amount  of Thai investment would likely enter Yunnan when the  construction of a highway linking Thailand and southern China is  completed. He Zhiqiang is accompanied by a nine-member  delegation including the Mayor of Kunming.    Yunnan needs foreign investment to develop its economy. To  date, 129 foreign investments in projects worth U.S. $500  million have been undertaken in Yunnan. Hong Kong investors are  the most active, followed by the Taiwanese, Japanese,  Singaporeans, Americans, and Thais. The most active sectors are  machinery, agriculture, food, real estate, hotels, and chemicals.    The BOI secretary general said Thailand might participate in  zinc and coal mining, or in agriculture. Moreover, nearby  Vietnam has a number of waterfalls that can accommodate  hydro-electric plants. However, he noted that businessmen have  found it difficult to transport their products from Yunnan to  other areas due to the inadequate infrastructure. But, this  problem will be solved soon because Thailand and China are  planning to link Thailand to southern China as part of the  hexagon economic development project.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises 6.2 per cent on the week WHILE the Nikkei average failed to continue its winning streak after rising more than 1,000 points in two consecutive days, traders were heartened by an increase in volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed down 34.93 at 18,375.95, up 6.2 per cent on the week, after a high of 18,500.00 and a low of 18,172.42. Arbitrage-related selling and profit-taking weighed down the index in early trading, but buying by foreigners and investment trusts helped cut most of the losses. Volume rose to 450m shares from 400m. Despite the fall in the Nikkei, advances led declines by 623 to 378, with 137 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 0.32 to 1,374.38 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index up 0.56 at 1,106.89. Traders said that sentiment was improving. Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities said: 'We've probably confirmed the bottom, and more investors are coming back in.' He added that the recent rise in share prices has prompted investors to cover short positions. Speculative issues were traded actively by dealers. Biotechnology issues advanced, with Morinaga Milk, the most active issue of the day, up Y41 to Y840 and Okamoto advancing Y100 to Y1,380. Shimadzu, a medical equipment maker, rose Y25 to Y705 on the Aids theme. Foreign investors sought high technology blue chips. Sony added Y80 to Y4,480 while TDK rose Y40 to Y4,450. However, NEC fell Y30 to Y1,010 and Matsushita retreated Y10 to Y1,430 on profit-taking. Bank stocks lost ground on reports that four commercial banks, including Sakura Bank, will bail out Taiheiyo Bank, a regional bank in financial trouble due to an increase in bad loans. Sakura lost Y30 to Y1,040 and Fuji Bank lost Y50 to Y1,440. Kanebo, the cosmetics maker, fell Y14 to Y445. Investors were discouraged by an announcement that the company will make a consolidated after-tax loss of Y6.6bn compared to an earlier forecast of a profit of Y1bn. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 138.88 to 20,893.70 in volume of 32m shares. Dealers sought speculative issues while foreigners and investment trust were seen bargain-hunting. Short-term trading lifted Ono Pharmaceutical by Y330 to this year's high of Y6,380. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed while Bangkok regained some ground after large falls this week. HONG KONG declined after recent gains. The Hang Seng Index lost 21.39 to 5,608.19, but was 2.2 per cent higher on the week. Turnover was HKDollars 3.68bn. HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 43.50 on news that it was posting a formal offer document to Midland Bank shareholders valuing the UK bank at some Pounds 3.4bn. BANGKOK improved as investors anticipated an early resolution to the political crisis. The SET index rose 22.17 to 732.89, but was down 3.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was Bt4.37bn. Bangkok Bank gained Bt20 to Bt680 and Siam Cement rose Bt10 to Bt518. KUALA LUMPUR saw some interest in blue chip stocks. The composite index closed up 2.15 to 605.71, a 2.3 per cent rise over the week. Turnover fell to MDollars 107m from MDollars 112m. Telecom advanced 30 cents to MDollars 12.90 while Genting lost 30 cents to MDollars 12.60. SEOUL fell on profit-taking.

The All Ordinaries index shed 2.3 to 1,663.6, barely changed on the week. Turnover was ADollars 286m. John Fairfax Holdings, making its market debut, closed up 18 cents at ADollars 1.38.

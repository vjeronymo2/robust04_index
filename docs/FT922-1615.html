			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / The European Market: National barriers chipped away - Semiconductor makers ahead of a trend THE end-1992 date for completion of Europe's 'single market' is still more than six months away. But for Europe's semi-conductor manufacturers, it has virtually arrived already. Motorola, the US communications and electronics group, is paving the way towards a single European pricing system for the network of distributors through which it sells semiconductors. It also intends to bring in common payment terms as a way of unifying sales conditions across Europe. 'The challenge is to deal with distributors in one currency, to allow them to respond to customers in different countries, and to make that channel to customers more efficient,' says Mr Barry Waite, general manager of Motorola's European semiconductor group. 'If Europe intends to have a competitive semiconductor industry, it has to be competitive not only in design, manufacturing and technology, but also in the way it takes things to the market,' Mr Waite adds. Semiconductor manufacturers mostly sell their products directly to large industrial users in such areas as telecommunications, consumer electronics and the automotive sector. Sales through distribution intermediaries however account for roughly 20 per cent of the Ecu10bn (Pounds 7bn) a year turnover of the European semiconductor market. Motorola has been bringing in single pricing step by step. It has been gradually aligning prices for such products as integrated circuits and memory chips over the last two years. Apart from single pricing, Motorola plans to introduce invoicing in the currency of the distributor's choice, including Ecus. It is also proposing to provide Europe-wide technical and commercial support. For example, a distributor which buys products in the UK could still count on local technical support from Motorola if the goods were then shipped to Germany. These changes will bring the European distribution market more in line with the US and Japan, where a single currency and market enable suppliers to operate off a single price list and maintain central stocks. Other semiconductor manufacturers agree that the trend towards a single market is here to stay. 'It's a developing road map,' says Mr Ken Sanders, managing director of Texas Instruments in the UK. Texas Instruments has been working since 1988 on adapting its semiconductor organisation to a pan-European structure. It has a common order book that lets it move products quickly from country to country. The shifting strategies of the semiconductor groups partly mirror the changing face of the market for distribution. The distribution sector has seen a flurry of activity as companies have established pan-European capabilities. Cross-border mergers and acquisitions have created larger distributors with activities in several European countries. For instance, the Benelux countries have recently witnessed concentration in this sector. This trend has been a growing necessity for distributors who had seen their margins shaved by falling semiconductor prices. Additionally, distributors have been squeezed by moves among suppliers to improve their servicing of the big semiconductor users, according to Mr Jim Eastlake at Dataquest, the high technology consultancy. One drawback is that the economies of scale which should stem from centralised warehousing and inventories have been slow to materialise. If these economies are, in fact, to be realised by moves by such companies as Motorola, this will probably intensify the trend for concentration in the distribution sector. The losers, then, would be the smaller distributors who stick to their local national systems. Mr Sanders of Texas Instruments, however, believes it is important to balance the European dimension in distribution with a strong local element. 'Integrated European distributors will have an advantage over non-consolidated distributors - but not over strong national champions,' he says.</p>

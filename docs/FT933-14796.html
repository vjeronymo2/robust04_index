			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Threat of strike by post staff recedes A STRIKE by postal workers in London over the closure of five sorting offices and the loss of up to 6,000 jobs looks unlikely, following talks between Royal Mail management and the Union of Communication Workers. Royal Mail has agreed to seek volunteers for redundancy and transfers between offices, and will cushion any loss of earnings for up to a year for those transferring. The deal has been agreed by union leaders but postal workers in London will be balloted this week before the threat of a strike is finally withdrawn. The union had warned of the 'devastating effect' there could have been on postal deliveries in the capital without an agreement. Mr Mike Hogan, union negotiator, said the deal was 'an entirely satisfactory settlement which contains elements which the union has been seeking for some time'. He added that it had always been the union's intention to reach agreement without disruption of services.</p>

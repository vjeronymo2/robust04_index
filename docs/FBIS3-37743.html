			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Republic's President Geydar Aliyev left for an  official visit to Great Britain today. Our correspondent  reports:    [Begin recording] [Akif Mecitoglu] Azerbaijani President  Geydar Aliyev left for an official visit to Great Britain today  at the invitation of the British Prime Minister John Major.  Agreements on political, economic, and cultural cooperation  will be signed between the two countries.    [Unidentified correspondent] Esteemed President, the signing  of a number of economic cooperation agreements between  Azerbaijan and Great Britain is envisaged. You will also be  meeting with British businessmen and state officials. What  effect will such ties have on the development of Azerbaijan's  economy?    [Aliyev] The Azerbaijani president's visit to Great Britain  is aimed at establishing and developing ties between Azerbaijan  and Great Britain. This is because, since the attainment of  independence, Azerbaijan has not yet been able to forge  interstate ties with a great world power such as Great Britain  to the degree needed. The British ambassador arrived here only  a few months ago, and Azerbaijan's ambassador left for Great  Britain only in recent days. Thus, diplomatic ties are just  being established. As a young independent state, Azerbaijan is  in dire need of broad interstate ties, first and foremost  political and economic ties. The economic ties in themselves  cover a broad spectrum, ranging from trade to close ties between  the various British and Azerbaijani business circles to  scientific and cultural ties.    As you know, Britain is one of the major world powers, is  one  of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, and is  one of the seven most developed countries. Both in the past and  at present Britain has been strongly influencing international  politics and economics. Therefore, the creation of close ties  between Azerbaijan and Great Britain is first of all exceedingly  important for the national interest of the Azerbaijani Republic.  We are also aware that Britain itself is highly interested in  Azerbaijan. It wants to establish economic ties with  Azerbaijan. Historically, Britain's interest in the Caucasus  and Azerbaijan is obvious. In this present stage at the end of  the 20th century, Britain wants to establish economic ties with  Azerbaijan on a new foundation. We have already accomplished  some work in this direction. That is, we have done preparatory  work. We have to resolve all these matters there.    As you know, my visit to Britain is of an official nature.  This is an official state visit that is taking place at the  invitation of British Prime Minister John Major. Some days ago  I received a letter from Mr. John Major in which he says that he  is looking forward for our meeting and is hopeful that this  meeting will produce fruitful results for Britain and Azerbaijan.    Therefore, I attribute great importance to this visit and  hope that the British leaders are also giving it great  importance. Our program there is now clear: There will be  talks with Prime Minister John Major and we will sign a number  of agreements with both the prime minister and other officials.  We will have meetings at the British Parliament and at other  state departments. Undoubtedly, all these are important matters  aimed at strengthening our young and independent Azerbaijan's  foreign policy and its international position. And I am going  to Britain to resolve these problems.    [Unidentified correspondent] We wish you success.    [Aliyev] Thank you.    [Mecitoglu] Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Rasul Guliyev,  Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, and other officials saw off the  president at Bina Airport. [end recording]</p>

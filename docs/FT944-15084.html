			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Canada looks to big spending cuts Mr Paul Martin, Canada's finance minister, has given notice hefty public spending cuts will be the prime tool to reach the Liberal government's deficit-reduction targets. He told the House of Commons late on Tuesday he was determined to cut the federal budget deficit to 3 per cent of gross domestic product by the fiscal year ending March 31 1997, from 5.4 per cent this year. 'It is a target we will meet, come hell or high water,' Mr Martin said. The target implies a reduction in the budget deficit from a projected CDollars 39.7bn (Pounds 18.7bn) in the current fiscal year to about CDollars 25bn in 1997. Mr Martin estimated the government needs about Dollars 3.1bn in spending cuts or tax increases next year and another CDollars 6.3bn in 1996/97. He plans specific proposals in his next budget, due in February. The budget is seen as a critical test for investor confidence in Canada. Together with Italy and Sweden, Canada has the heaviest debt burden among industrial countries. Interest payments are projected to reach CDollars 47.3bn this year, over a quarter of total federal spending. Financial markets are likely to focus on Ottawa's willingness to take the axe to federal social programmes, which consume about one-quarter of this year's CDollars 166bn budget, and on transfers to the provinces for health, welfare and education, totalling CDollars 27bn. The government published a discussion paper on sweeping social-security reform this month. It contained few specific proposals, but it has run into strong criticism and Mr Martin's cabinet colleagues may be less enthusiastic about painful and unpopular cuts.</p>

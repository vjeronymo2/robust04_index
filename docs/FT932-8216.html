			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / French police to get wider powers FRENCH police will have a freer hand to make spot security checks under a draft law which the cabinet of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur approved yesterday for submission to parliament. The measure will relieve police of their current need to prove that an individual was behaving suspiciously before checking his identity card, and forms part of the centre-right government's electoral pledge to improve law and order in French cities. Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, the government spokesman, denied this constituted any threat to civil liberties which, he said, in reality came from 'insecurity on the streets'. President Francois Mitterrand who, under the bizarre cohabitation system presides over the formal cabinet meetings of his political opponents, was said to have acquiesced because the draft law provides for possible judicial review of such street searches. Nonetheless, civil rights groups have complained that young people and immigrants will inevitably be the target of freer police checks. Last week the National Assembly endorsed a move - which had started in the Senate when the Socialists were still in power - to make the offer of French nationality to immigrants less generous. The new nationality law removes the automatic right of children born in France of immigrant parents to acquire a French passport.</p>

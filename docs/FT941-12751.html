			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / TV bidders look to relaxed rules ITV companies involved in takeovers believe the Office of Fair Trading is moving towards allowing one company to control up to 25 per cent of all UK television advertising. This would relax much narrower existing limits, set at 25 per cent of ITV revenue. If the market were redefined as all television advertising  - including Channel 4, cable and satellite - only a modest reorganisation of the advertising sales house system would be needed. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, last week said it should be possible to avoid referring the Granada-LWT and Carlton-Central takeover bids to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The condition, however, was that competition concerns over too great a concentration of power among advertising sales houses should be resolved. A Granada takeover of LWT would mean the combined sales houses would account for 40 per cent of ITV revenue. Mr Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, said yesterday, during a renewed attack on LWT, that he did not expect advertising reorganisation costs to be significant. He was speaking as Granada sent another missive to LWT shareholders urging them to accept the hostile offer of six Granada shares for every five LWT, worth roughly Pounds 725m, with a 528p a share cash alternative. The offer was yesterday extended until February 9, but not improved. Yesterday's attack featured '10 Facts LWT Would Rather You Didn't Know', such as claims that Granada Television's performance was better than LWT's on everything from programme sales to cash generation. Mr Robinson also raised questions about LWT's profit estimates of Pounds 43.8m for the year. 'We will not be using these numbers in our internal calculations.' Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT (Holdings), commented that the estimates had been reviewed by an audit committee of non-executive directors and were 'rock solid'. Meanwhile it emerged that Granada plans, if it wins, to go below the existing senior management - many of them multi-millionaires - and rely on promoting young middle managers. Lex, Page 18</p>

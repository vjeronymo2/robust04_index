			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Japan Gas Association and four major city gas  companies, including Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd. -- in cooperation with  Isuzu Ceramics Research Institute (Yokohama City; President:  Takeshi Inao); Noritake Co., Ltd.; and Nippon Shokubai Kagaku  Kogyo Co., Ltd. -- will begin the development of a ceramic  natural-gas engine for power generation. The development project  will run for five years, and its outlay is expected to be  approximately &yen;5 billion, one half of which will be  subsidized by the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy.    Ceramic engines can generate high energy efficiencies by  eliminating the need for cooling water, because the cylinders  are made of high-heat-resistant ceramics. The projected  power-generation efficiency, which indicates the degree of  conversion of fuel into power, is 46 percent, which clearly  exceeds 30 to 38 percent for earlier gas engines. If a ceramic  gas engine is used for a co-generation (heat- and  electricity-supplying) system, the overall energy efficiency is  expected to be increased to 86 percent.    The ceramic gas engine, when developed, will be first  promoted for uses in offices, hotels and hospitals. The office  use will be particularly promoted because there its power  generation efficiency is much higher than the co-generation  system it replaces.</p>

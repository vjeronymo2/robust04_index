			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. A. Sobolev, A. D. Zavyalov and Ye. N. Sedova; </F> UDC 550.343(009)]    [Abstract] When a short-range prediction of an earthquake  becomes known to the public it may result in panic and urgent  measures by the government become especially urgent. Especially  since the Armenian earthquake there has been improper  dissemination of earthquake warnings by the press and some  specialists, many of the latter working outside the field of  their competence. This includes astronomers, specialists in  biofields, those with extrasensory perception and amateurs.  Among the seven hundred such predictions reviewed by an expert  group not one of them proved valid. Several specialists are  named who have been exceptionally active in making and  disseminating alarming and unwarranted predictions. This also  happens in other countries. This problem was dealt with in two  resolutions of the 22d General Assembly of the European  Seismological Commission (Barcelona, 20 September 1990) calling  for a moratorium on such not fully validated predictions and  calling for a code of ethics for those issuing such warnings.  Such a code was adopted at Strasbourg on 18 October 1991 (the  Russian text of this code, as well as that of the two mentioned  resolutions, is given). It is requested that all who make such  predictions in Russia direct them for review to:  Nauchno-inzhenernyy i koordinatsionnyy seysmologicheskiy tsentr  RAN (Scientific Engineering and Coordinating Seismological  Center, Russian Academy of Sciences), Moskva, ul. Ulyanovskaya,  51. References 6: 3 Russian, 3 Western.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Tokyo to finance up to Dollars 1bn US exports JAPAN'S Ministry of Trade and Industry yesterday announced a unique cooperation programme under which Japanese agencies would finance up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 592m) worth of US sales over the next 11 months. US officials say the programme, in co-operation with the US Export-Import Bank, is 'a political decision' by the Japanese government to help reduce the US trade deficit and to use Japanese capital to help defuse bilateral trade frictions. 'This will go on the positive side of the ledger,' said Mr Ray Albright, vice president of Eximbank's Asia division. In the first arrangement of its kind, MITI and Eximbank said the Japanese funds would be used mostly to support joint US-Japanese projects, though help will be provided for US businesses in some other programmes. The Ministry will fund local costs of infrastructure in third world countries, for example, to promote projects purchasing US goods or services. It will also provide insurance for third country projects and financial institutions which advance financing to US exporters. It will assist small US businesses by offering pre-export insurance when advanced payment is required. Medium and long term financing will be available from the Japanese Export-Import Bank for US exports to Japan. Mr Eugene Lawson, Eximbank vice president, said that besides promoting US exports to Japan, the programme will help sustain trade and investment flows to developing countries and increase cooperation between suppliers and banks in both the US and Japan. Mr Albright sees the programme as a natural outgrowth of the growing cooperation between US and Japanese companies which increasingly have been bidding jointly. Projects in Mexico, Indonesia and Thailand are expected to require such cofinancing 'in the near future.' Mr Lawson said Japan may, in future, establish similar cooperative programmes with the export credit agencies of other countries. Lucas, the international engineering group based in the West Midlands of the UK, has extended its penetration of the US defence market with a contract to supply harpoon missile capsules worth at least Pounds 25m over the next five years, reports Paul Cheeseright. The defence fabrications division of Lucas Aerospace won the contract from McDonnell Douglas Missile Systems.</p>

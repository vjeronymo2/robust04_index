			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Kodak sells credit arm and two of its information subsidiaries EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest producer of photographic equipment, yesterday announced a series of disposals. Kodak's Atex subsidiary, which make computer systems for newspapers, is being sold to a British entrepreneur; Estek, which produces cleaning and inspection equipment for the semiconductor industry, is being bought by ADE Corporation, based in Massachusetts; and Kodak's credit facility is being purchased by GE Capital, part of the General Electric group. The Atex and Estek disposals were foreshadowed in July, when Kodak said that it planned to dispose of 10 lines of business, primarily in its information division. Although the businesses were not individually identified, Atex and Estek were known to be among those up for sale. The purchaser of Atex is an investment consortium headed by Mr Danny Chapchal, a British businessman. Mr Chapchal, a trained accountant, heads SQL Systems International, a Surrey-based management systems software company. He was originally invited into SQL by a group of venture capital firms to help stem its losses. Mr Chapchal said yesterday that the same group of institutions - which includes Euroventures Benelux and the South Yorkshire Pension Authority - were backing the Atex deal. 'I see this as a major opportunity in a market I know extremely well,' said Mr Chapchal, although he declined to comment in detail on future plans for the business. Atex was founded in 1973, acquired by Kodak in 1981, and supplies electronic pre-press systems to about 900 users, including The Times in the UK, The New York Times, The Jerusalem Post, and Fortune. Atex has recently been embroiled in the controversy over whether the design of computer pre-press equipment has caused repetitive strain injury among users. A number of damage claims are outstanding against the company. Yesterday, however, Mr Chapchal said that 'the purchasers (of Atex) are not assuming any RSI liability'. He declined to discuss details of the purchase agreement. No price was disclosed in the other deal in Kodak's information systems business, the disposal of Estek to ADE Corporation. Estek was formed in 1986, and employs around 60 people at its Charlotte plant. The third transaction, the sale of the credit operations to GE Capital was not foreshadowed in July. The credit business was established in 1986 and is designed to provide long-term financing to customers purchasing Kodak equipment. It currently provides financing to over 12,000 clients, and has assets of around Dollars 1bn. GE Capital, a financial services institution with assets of over Dollars 80bn, is acquiring the Kodak subsidiary's stock but will operate the business under the Eastman Kodak Credit Corporation name.</p>

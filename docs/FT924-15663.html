			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (47): High speed customer analysis - How to gather data on 36,000 people in just five seconds THE BUSINESS of MAI Research is data and information. The company interviews about 70,000 individuals annually on details of personal finance. It collects, records, collates, and then sells details about bank accounts, savings and spending habits, writes Claire Gooding. The technology in which it invested in the last two years has already made a difference in the service it offers its customers. Every six months, MAI (a division of NOP Corporate and Financial) publishes 16 core reports based on the information it culls, which amount to anything between 10,000 and 16,000 pages of information. 'We visit people on a one-to-one basis and ask them about their finances: building societies, banks, Tessa, stocks and shares,' explains James McCullagh, associate director. Strangely, people are happy to co-operate, and a very small proportion baulk at revealing their financial arrangements. The buyers of the reports are largely banks, building societies and other financial organisations. Building societies, banks and insurance companies are all competing for the same sort of customer, and increasingly need to use the data more creatively for marketing in general, and profiling and segmentation in particular. 'Traditionally, our business is to collect the data and sell tabulated reports. Whereas we used to hold the database on a mainframe with some interactive ability, we were keen to find an online solution.' says McCullagh. 'With 60 clients, it made sense to provide a software and hardware solution on the desk.' On joining the Financial Research Services (FRS) at NOP 18 months ago, he realised that some drastic changes were needed. 'Everything was done in-house, but if you wanted to modify a particular table, there was no way of re-arranging the data without going back to the DP people.' He has single-handedly researched and pushed through the technology programme for the company, which since MAI's take over of NOP, has become MAI Research. Typically, MAI clients wanted to look at the data in all sorts of different ways, perhaps cross-referencing mortgage holders with credit-card holders. 'Every client has a different need, so it's important to let them choose how they look at the data,' he says. The end-user requirement meant that user friendliness and flexible, simple commands were a must for McCullagh. MAI looked at M-Tab, a product from US-based Gamma, and Quanvert, from UK company Quantime - 'there is not a lot of off-the-shelf analysis software around. We wanted to be in control of the software and the hardware. Quanvert, we found, actually worked, and was easy to use.' It was an extra comfort factor that the developers keep a close eye on the product, and constantly incorporate new features such as Quantime for Windows. Although Quanvert is a package, MAI has been able to contribute to the development process so that monthly upgrades have included more and more features, some of which have benefited other Quantime clients. The EPS 433 DX notebook computers which host the software are themselves easy to use. MAI now has 13 of its 60 clients equipped with notebooks. In November, a comprehensive system goes live, based on the last two years' experiments. James McCullagh has already been giving the software a thorough road test: the unorthodox 'site visit' in this case meant that he was the one doing the visiting, portable laptop in hand. The last two years' data is already on the system, and open for analysis and manipulation. 'Now that the data is available interactively, on the desk, clients are beginning to discover that there are lots of other ways they can use the data. Instead of six months worth of books sitting on the desk, they have all the information on one little notebook computer. We want to encourage them to use the data creatively.' The Quanvert system supports computer graphics and is surprisingly swift at delivering the results of fairly complex analyses of large amounts of data. Nor is it difficult to add in new fields after models have been created. It takes a remarkable five seconds or so to run through data on nearly 36,000 people, and present an analysis on a specific sector, such as families with young children where both parents are working. Such analysis helps the users to formulate strategies, deciding on target markets. For instance, 87 per cent of Tessa saving plans are sold to people over 55 years of age: such a well-defined pattern can be used creatively for marketing.</p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Cominco to decide fate of lead smelter COMINCO, the Vancouver- based metals and fertiliser producer, expects to decide the fate of its troubled lead smelter at Trail, British Columbia, by the middle of the year. Announcing a fourth-quarter loss, Cominco said senior management would visit Stolberg, Germany, next month to review tests on a smaller version of the Trail smelter, which uses the same QSL technology. The new CDollars 130m (USDollars 112m) Trail plant has been idle because of technical problems since March 1990. The project has embarrassed Cominco and Lurgi, the German process engineering company which supplied the QSL technology. Cominco's fourth-quarter loss was CDollars 16.3m, or 21 cents a share, compared with earnings from continuing operations of CDollars 3.4m, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Sales dipped to CDollars 344m from CDollars 385m. The operating loss was CDollars 0.9m, compared with earnings of CDollars 17.6m. Income from mining and metal operations tumbled to CDollars 5.5m from CDollars 15.9m. The fertiliser division suffered a CDollars 6.4m loss, compared with a CDollars 1.7m gain. For 1991 as a whole, Cominco lost CDollars 41.3m, or 56 cents a share, compared with earnings of CDollars 59.1m, or 70 cents, in 1990. Sales dropped to CDollars 1.3bn from CDollars 1.4bn.</p>

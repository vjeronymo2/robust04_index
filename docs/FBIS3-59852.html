			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Amir Tahiri: "The Iranian Policies...in Context </F> of Words and Deeds"]    [Text] According to what has been reported, the mullahs  [clerics] in Iran have started a "friendly" offensive in order  to end the diplomatic isolation of their country and to attract  foreign capital, as well as other forms of aid to the stagnating  Iranian economy.    During the past two weeks, the mullahs have contacted three  major European countries. In that respect, one of the mullahs, a  brother of President Rafsanjani, visited Germany where he held  three meetings with government officials. His message there was  that the Islamic Republic was a responsible member of the  international community and that it was ready to open a "new  chapter" with the West.    Also, as part of that offensive, the secretary-general of  the  French Foreign Ministry, paid a 48-hour visit to Tehran where  his Iranian hosts assured him that the Islamic Republic opposed  terrorism and that it would not do anything to stir trouble in  the region.    Finally, Iran welcomed Michael Berton, a senior official in  the British Foreign Ministry, who, according to the official  version, had come to discuss the death warrant issued by  Khomeyni against the British writer, Salman Rushdie.    Such visits are in themselves quite positive, and every move  concerning the normalization of Iran's foreign policy, should be  welcomed.    However, what in fact is needed is a real change in Tehran's  thinking. But so far, there is no indication that this is going  to happen any time soon.    The crux of the matter concerning the mullahs can be  explained by an Iranian folk story about an aristocrat who had  set on a difficult journey in winter time during the Middle  Ages. One night, the aristocrat and his servant stopped to rest  in a little house along the road.    The weather was very cold. The aristocrat was shivering like  a tree shaken by an autumn wind. The servant did his best to  cover him with all the blankets he could find. But the  aristocrat was still cold; he screamed at the servant with  arrogance and despair saying: "Can't you look for few additional  things to cover me with?"    The servant was embarrassed because the only thing left was  the saddle of the donkey. He wondered how could an aristocrat  sleep covered by a saddle. Nevertheless, the servant gathered  his courage and told his master about what was available.    The master yelled: "Stupid...bring the damned thing, but do  not mention its name, and do not tell anybody about it!"    The moral of this story is obvious, namely, that one has  sometimes to sacrifice appearances out of necessity. The  aristocrat was not ready to freeze and die of cold because  sleeping under a donkey's saddle might hurt his dignity.    The revolutionary mullahs in Iran are in a similar position.  They need to abandon their slogans so as to remain in power as a  class of their own, in a world which is changing in a  fascinating way.    And a number of them are ready to change.    President Rafsanjani once even said that he was ready to  exchange his mullah's clothes for those worn by ordinary  Iranians so as to remain in politics.    He was, in fact, realistic enough to make secret deals with  the United States and to organize the freeing of the Western  hostages who were held captive on Khomeyni's orders. Also, it  was Rafsanjani who pressed the old angry man "to swallow the  poison" [bite the bullet] and sign the cease-fire with Saddam  Husayn. It was also partly thanks to Rafsanjani that Iran  refused to conclude a foolish alliance with Iraq following the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.    However, other mullahs believe that giving up their slogans  would mean a dangerous loss of face to a regime with such a  narrow basis of power, especially at a time when the social and  economic crises are so acute.    Still, another group of mullahs have suggested using the  peace agreement between Israel amd the PLO as an excuse to  launch a "third wave" of Revolution.    At the center, between those two groups, there are a few  mullahs, together with their technocrat aides, and who most of  the time are related to them by marriage, who advocate a  compromise solution. Such a solution is derived from the claim  that "the State," which is represented by Rajsanjani, is  officially separated from the "revolution," which is led by  Khamene'i.    That was exactly the old deceit that had been used by the  Soviet Union, and later, China for many years. At certain  occasions, the late Alexis Kossygine used to speak as prime  minister, while Leonid Brezhnev used to express opposing views  as chairman of the Communist Party. Foreign Governments used to  read the editorials of PRAVDA on the ground that they expressed  the views of the Communist Party, at the same time those same  governments were led to believe that it would be better to read  IZVESTIA in order to understand the position of the Soviet  Government.    That game became a farce to such an extent that Brezhnev  decided to put an end to it by appointing himself both president  and chairman of the party.    The Iranian version of that same game is as ridiculous.  During his visit to Tehran last week, Boidevau, raised the  problem of the threats directed at the former Iranian officials  living in France. He was told that: "The Government of the  Islamic Republic has nothing to do with this at all. And that if  there was any threat, it must have originated with some  revolutionary institutions that had no relations with the  government." There is no way to know whether the French diplomat  believed that excuse, but if he did, then his brain must be  examined. The Islamic Republic should end this dualist talk and  adopt clear positions which would leave no doubt on the  important issues and the policies vital to Iran's interests in  the region and beyond.    The use of "Taqiyah"--i.e., to hide one's beliefs when one  is  in a minority among other ideologies--cannot serve as a sound  basis for an earnest foreign policy.    Nor could Iran adopt two policies at the same time: one for  the government and another for the revolutionary institutions.  Such duality involves a great danger to the people as a whole.  It is currently playing that game concerning the  Israeli-Palestinian Agreement. The mullahs are entitled to  oppose the agreement, but their position should be stated  clearly because it is not possible to tell foreign visitors one  thing while "the leaders of the revolution" of the Revolution  Guards present an opposing view.    The Iranian people should be informed through rational  arguments, and in a precise language, not in slogans, as to why  the peace agreement between Israel and the PLO would be a bad  thing to Iran's rights and its national interests; and in what  way would it hurt Iran if Israel and the PLO decide to put an  end to their struggle and live in peace.    Last week, I asked a number of West European and Asian  foreign ministers about their opinion concerning the Iranian  reaction to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. Their response  was unanimous, namely, that Iran had acknowledged in private  that the Agreement was an issue that concerned the two parties,  and that Iran would not encourage terrorism or violence in the  Middle East.    This is an acceptable position. Iran could say: We are not  happy with the agreement, and we do not see that it could help  the Palestinians, yet we would not hinder that process through  violence.    That position would be similar to that adopted by Syria,  which is favorable to the peace process. Moreover, Syria seeks  to establish good relations with the United States.    Yet, we hear Khamene'i the High Murshed [counselor] repeat  over and over to the Republican Guards that Israel should be  wiped out of the map and that Yasir 'Arafat should be extracted  as "bad grass in the garden"; but he did not care to say what  are the interests of Iran in all that.    There are many people in Iran, among them certain ruling  mullahs, who are aware that it is dangerous for Iran to be  singled out as a troublemaker in the region; especially that  Iran, as any other country, has its own problems which it ought  to solve before trying to solve the problems of others.    The most stupid thing is to instigate unnecessary  disturbances with the intent to mislead. Iran cannot hinder the  peace agreement, especially if this latter is accepted by the  majority of the Palestinians and Israelis. So there is  absolutely no rational to wish to appear doing something when  one does not in fact want to do it, nor can he do it, even if he  wanted to.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> VOTE ON WHO ENTERS HEAVEN PUT OFF  </P> <P> A controversy over whether ministers should preach that only Christians can  enter heaven was referred to a committee today at the convention of the  Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).  </P> <P> The 700 delegates postponed a vote to accept or reject a report on the  so-called "Jesus Resolution" drafted with an eye toward healing the rift  between the church's theological conservatives and liberals but which may only  have deepened them. The proposed resolution asks that the Disciples affirm that  salvation is possible only through Jesus and that only Christians will have  eternal life after death.  </P> <P> The report on the proposed resolution was prepared by the church's Commission  on Theology and suggests it might be inappropriate and self-righteous to say  salvation is possible only through Jesus. It says only God, not Christians, can  determine who should enter heaven.  </P></p>

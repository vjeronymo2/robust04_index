			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ oil field litigation ends with sale THE NEW ZEALAND government has sold its highly prospective Ngaere field on onshore Taranaki for NZDollars 119m (Pounds 37m) to a consortium led by Fletcher Challenge companies. This decision four years of often bitter litigation about the ownership of the field which ended at the Privy Council in London. The potential of the field was noted on the eve of the sale of Petrocorp to Fletcher Challenge in 1988, and Mr David Butcher, then Minister of Energy, made a last minute decision not to include it. In its recent decision, the Privy Council agreed with the government. Petrocorp and its 80 per cent owned subsidiary Southern Petroleum are also major shareholders in the adjoining fields, Waihapa, Tariki and Ahuroa. They said that the purchase with neighbouring Waihapa would produce an estimated 20m barrels of oil and 100bn cubic feet of gas. The agreement includes a clawback provision under which the government will receive extra dividends if the field produces more than expected. The government is not exposed to extra costs if the field produces less. With the purchase Petrocorp's share of the field rises from 32 to 48 per cent, at a cost of NZDollars 44m, and Southern's from 23 to 37 per cent, costing NZDollars 43.6m.</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Proudfoot names new chief executive The restructuring and rationalisation measures at Proudfoot, the management consultancy chaired by Lord Stevens, yesterday claimed the job of Mr John Prosser, the chief executive. He is stepping down from that post and will head the group's European sales operations. Mr Malcolm Hughes, the former managing director of Vernons Group, will take over as chief executive. Previous cost-cutting moves helped the group report a 16 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.5m to Pounds 6.4m from continuing operations. Overall first-half losses last time totalled Pounds 14m, including a restructuring provision of Pounds 18.3m. However, in the six months to June 30, tough conditions in the European side of the business, together with the withdrawal from some markets, saw turnover fall 26 per cent to Pounds 60.5m (Pounds 81.7m). Mr David Gill, finance director, said that, following the completion of changes to the group, the challenge was to achieve revenue growth from new and existing business. 'We have put everything in place, we now have to prove we can do it.' Mr Gill admitted that the problem in the European operations was due partly to organisational difficulties. 'John Prosser is going to do a job in which he excelled during the 1980s and early 1990s.' The core Proudfoot consultancy business continued to be the main source of revenue, even though operating profits fell by 30 per cent to Pounds 5.34m (Pounds 7.66m). Operations in the US and Mexico performed well; the consultancy achieved a tripling of billings in the US. However, Canada and Brazil were weak. Mr Gill said Proudfoot would continue to pull in its horns from peripheral markets and concentrate on its core North American businesses. A turnround was achieved in the Crosby teaching-based consultancy, which turned a Pounds 1.5m loss into a Pounds 1.2m operating profit. However, the group said current trading in the division was 'disappointing.' It added: 'The realignment of the cost structure of the business should mitigate this impact, though the decreased revenue will reduce second-half profitability.' Earnings per share slipped 0.1p to 5.2p, while the dividend was maintained at 2p.</p>

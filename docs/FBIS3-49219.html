			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a news conference at the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs today, spokesman Mircea Geoana announced that the first  action of that ministry in 1994 will be the visit to Bucharest,  which will begin today, by the first deputy minister of foreign  affairs of the Republic of Moldova, Mr. Ion Cebuc, at the  invitation of Ambassador Marcel Dinu, state secretary. Among  other things, an exchange of views will also take place in  connection with developments in Central and East Europe, the  situation in the Dniester region, and the fate of the Ilascu  group.    Regarding Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's statements about Romania  and the Romanian people, and about other European states --  which were termed irresponsible -- the Foreign Ministry  spokesman emphasized that these statements have caused the  unanimous reaction of condemnation in the political media and  international public opinion.    The Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has acknowledged  with particular interest the statements made by the U.S.  representative at the United Nations, Mrs. Madeleine Albright,  whereby she emphasizes that the United States rejects the idea  of creating demarcation lines in Central and Eastern Europe, and  that, as far as the U.S. Administration is concerned, all  countries in this area have the same political and strategic  interest, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  stated at the same weekly news conference. He added that Mrs.  Albright will pay a visit to Bucharest on 15 January as  President Bill Clinton's special envoy. The main purpose of the  visit is to brief the authorities in Bucharest on the results of  the NATO summit, and specifically on tangible aspects of the  partnership-for-peace alternative.    During a meeting with Romania's president, with the Romanian  foreign minister, and other figures, the sides will also discuss  Romanian-U.S. bilateral relations, the Yugoslav crisis and the  effects on the Romanian economy of the sanctions imposed against  the Yugoslav Federation, as well as cooperation with the United  Nations.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman also emphasized  that the letters addressed to the U.S. President by Romania's  president also present our country's concerns about security.  They clearly emphasize Romania's desire for NATO integration, a  subject that enjoys the consensus among Romanian political  forces.    At the same news conference by the Romanian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs spokesman, journalists were informed that the  letter from President Ion Iliescu on 24 December 1993 to the  heads of state and government of the NATO member countries and  the NATO secretary general regarding Romania's desire for  integration in the alliance as a member with full rights was  positively received by the member states and viewed by the  majority of the representatives of the ministries of foreign  affairs or of the offices of the heads of state and government  as being particularly opportune.    The move by the Romanian president was assessed as being  direct, firm, and clear. On receipt of the letter, the  representatives of several countries emphasized that they will  support Romania in its effort toward integration into NATO and  the other Euro-Atlantic structures.    As our reporter, Doina Saiciuc, informs us, this letter from  Romania's president was unanimously assessed as an important  sign of the absolute priority Romania gives to intensifying its  political, economic, and security relations with the Western  countries.</p>

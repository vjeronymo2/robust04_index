Company would not provide FCM services with respect to foreign currency contracts. BNP also has applied pursuant to section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act, to acquire Mitsui T&amp;B Futures, Inc., Chicago, Illinois (to be renamed BNP Futures, Inc.), and to provide FCM clearing-only services with respect to those contracts for which Company would provide execution and advisory services. BNP would engage in these activities on a worldwide basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act provides that a bank holding company may, with Board approval, engage in any activity which the Board, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined (by order or regulation) to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. This statutory test requires that two separate tests be met for an activity to be permissible for a bank holding company. First, the Board must determine that the activity is, as a general matter, closely related to banking. Second, the Board must find in a particular case that the performance of the activity by the applicant bank holding company may reasonably be expected to produce public benefits that outweigh possible adverse effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A particular activity may be found to meet the ``closely related to banking'' test if it is demonstrated that banks generally have provided the proposed activity, that banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally similar to the proposed activity so as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed activity, or that banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed activity as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Ass'n v. Board of Governors <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229, 1237 (D.C. Cir. 1975). In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks. Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y, 49 FR 806 (1984). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BNP states that the Board previously has determined by Regulation that certain of the proposed activities, when conducted within limitations established by the Board in its regulations and in related interpretations and orders, are closely related to banking for purposes of section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 225.25(b)(15) (full-service securities brokerage); 12 CFR (b)(4) (investment advisory services); 12 CFR 225.25(b)(7),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Citicorp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 72 Federal Reserve Bulletin 497 (1986), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Citicorp <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 68 Federal Reserve Bulletin 505 (1982) (data processing services). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BNP also maintains that the Board has determined by order that several of the other proposed activities, when conducted within the limitations established by the Board in previous orders, are closely related to banking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Sakura Bank, Limited <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 723 (1993) (providing execution-only, clearing-only, and investment advisory services, and buying and selling contracts through omnibus accounts, with respect to financial futures and options on futures);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 217 (1989), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nippon Credit Bank, Ltd. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 308 (1989) (proprietary trading of futures and options on foreign exchange for nonhedging and hedging purposes);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Swiss Bank <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 77 Federal Reserve Bulletin 126 (1991), and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Societe Generale <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 76 Federal Reserve Bulletin 776 (1990) (acting as a specialist and registered options trader on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange). BNP maintains that Company and BNP Futures, Inc. would conduct these previously approved activities in conformance with the conditions and limitations established by the Board in prior cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to approve the proposal, the Board must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company and BNP Futures, Inc. ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C.  1843(c)(8). BNP believes that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, BNP maintains that the proposal will enhance competition and enable BNP to offer its customers a broader range of products. In addition, BNP states that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound banking practices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets, or is likely to meet, the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. 20551, not later than November 7, 1994. Any request for a hearing on this application must, as required by  262.3(e) of the Board's Rules of Procedure (12 CFR 262.3(e)), be accompanied by a statement of the reasons why a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This application may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors or the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, October 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jennifer J.

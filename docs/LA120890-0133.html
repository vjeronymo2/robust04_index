			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SWEETWATER'S SANCHEZ QUITS  </P> <P> Andy Sanchez, coach of the Sweetwater High football team the past three  seasons, resigned Friday, ending weeks of speculation.  </P> <P> Sanchez cited time constraints as his primary reason.  </P> <P> He also is director of the Sweetwater Learning Center, a highly regarded  program for students who have fallen behind academically. He resigned as coach  after pondering the decision for several weeks.  </P> <P> "I was relieved that I resigned, but at the same time, I was saddened," Sanchez  said. "I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss the kids, but it's time to move  on."  </P> <P> Sanchez's teams were 17-15, including 7-4 this year after the Red Devils lost  to Rancho Buena Vista in the first round of the section 3-A playoffs.  </P> <P> Sanchez' replacement could be the man he replaced, Gene Alim, who was 74-9-1  from 1981 to 1987.  </P> <P> "More than likely, Gene will put his name in the hat, and I don't think he'll  be refused," Sanchez said. "Whoever gets the job, I wouldn't mind helping out  (as an assistant coach)."  </P> <P> As a wide receiver at Castle Park High, Sanchez was the section player of the  year in 1969. In 1968, he led the Trojans to the county championship. He later  played with the Memphis Southmen of the World Football League. Also on that  team were Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and Paul Warfield.

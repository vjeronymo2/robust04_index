			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bank to take holding in Aerospatiale CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, has agreed to take a minority stake in Aerospatiale, the debt-laden, government-controlled aircraft maker, writes William Dawkins. The investment is likely to attract the scrutiny of the European Commission in its continued vigilance against state industrial subsidies, though Brussels is unlikely to block the scheme if it conforms to a previous judgment. Although Credit Lyonnais and Aerospatiale said they had agreed on the cash injection in principle, they would not confirm French press speculation that the bank would pay FFr1.5bn (Dollars 280m) for a 10 per cent stake in the aircraft maker. Aerospatiale needs cash because recent heavy industrial investments have driven up its net debts to FFr14bn, just over twice its FFr6.8bn shareholders' funds. Profits recovered last year, to FFr213m net, from a FFr396m loss in the previous year but new orders fell 50 per cent. A cash injection of the size being envisaged will not dramatically improve Aerospatiale's balance sheet. Yet any reduction in the pressure on its spending is likely to be welcomed by its partners in the Airbus consortium.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bass reshuffling its gambling interests BASS, the hotels, brewing, and leisure group, is reshuffling its gambling activities as part of its strategy of seeking to dominate the markets in which it operates. The company is paying Pounds 147m for Granada's bingo clubs to give it joint market leadership with the Rank Organisation. At the same time it is seeking offers for its Coral Racing betting shop chain, which lags a poor third behind Ladbroke and Brent Walker/William Hill. It is estimated that it will fetch at least Pounds 300m. Bass is paying Pounds 56m cash and taking over debts of Pounds 91m. The acquisition of Granada's 74 bingo clubs had been expected for some time following Rank's takeover last year of Mecca Leisure. That made Rank the largest bingo group with 165 clubs, well ahead of Bass's 91. Bass claimed the deal did not depend upon clearance by the Office of Fair Trading. Unlike the Rank/Mecca deal, when the OFT forced Rank to sell some bingo halls in London, Bass said there was no over-lap between its bingo halls and Granada's. It believed the OFT would accept its argument that a merged national chain would provide more effective competition with Rank. Granada's bingo operations in the year to September 29 1990 produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7m. At the year end net assets were Pounds 81m. Bass's management is understood to have been concerned for some time at the problems of operating in the number three slot in the betting shop market. Of a total UK market of some 10,000 betting shops, Coral has some 900, while Ladbroke has about 2,000 and Brent Walker/William Hill 1,600. Although Brent Walker, with the problems of restructuring its debt, may have to sell William Hill, there seems little chance for Bass to buy the chain and avoid a monopolies investigation. Thus it makes sense for Bass to sell the Coral chain if the right price can be achieved. There is speculation that a management buy out might be in prospect, given the lack of any other leisure operator with the necessary funds.</p>

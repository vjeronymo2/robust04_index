			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Revco plan approved by bankruptcy court THE end to another big US retail bankruptcy came into sight, when a US bankruptcy court approved the reorganisation plan put forward by Revco. The plan is likely to take effect within a few weeks. Revco, based in Ohio, operates about 1,150 drug stores in 10 states and is one of the nation's largest drug store chains. The retailer's prospective 'rebirth' echoes the successful re-emergence from bankruptcy of the Allied and Federated Department Stores chains - previously part of Campeau Corporation - earlier this year. However, some US stores groups have fared less happily; R. H. Macy, the New York-based department store chain, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code shortly after Christmas.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (ANEX-ANTARA) -- The Central  Executive Board of the Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI)  told its members here Tuesday to maintain self-restraint so they  would not be carried away by activities outside the PWI  regulations.    In a statement signed by Chairman Tribuana Said and  Secretary  General Parni Hadi, PWI expressed its worries that  demonstrations as a follow up of the recent closure of three  Jakarta weeklies might only ruin efforts still being worked out  by the association to solve the banning problem.    PWI noted that demonstrations have been used as a means of  expression of various aspirations which might further complicate  things.    Therefore, the association called on all of its members to  always uphold previous statements which among others expressed  concerns over the banning.    However, at the same time, the statements expressed  understanding as well over the government's reasons behind such  a decision.    PWI, the Tuesday's statement said, had encouraged the  government to issue a new press publication permit so that all  PWI members previously affiliated to the three banned weeklies  would not be left without employment for too long.    It further said that as long as legal and professional  mechanism are upheld by all the concerned parties, revocation of  press publication permit would not take place again in the  future.</p>

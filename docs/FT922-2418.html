			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / International Company News: Handelsbanken hit by credit losses SVENSKA Handelsbanken, Sweden's third largest commercial bank, has reported a 35 per cent fall in operating profits, to SKr664m (Dollars 237m) for the first four months of 1992, from SKr1bn a year earlier. The decline was mainly attributable to a 46.7 per cent jump in credit losses, to SKr1.56bn from SKr1.1bn last time. The credit losses amounted to 1.6 per cent of total lending at the end of April. The bank's receipts rose 6 per cent to SKr4.01bn, from SKr3.79bn, while earnings per share declined to SKr2.98 from SKr4.57. Return on equity dropped to 7.9 per cent from 12.5 per cent. The latest results suggest that despite a more prudent and controlled credit policy than other leading Swedish banks, the bank was now also suffering the consequences of lending to property and finance companies in the late 1980s. For 1991, its total credit losses rose to SKr3.2bn, representing 1.1 per cent of loan volume. Although Handelsbanken remains Sweden's most profitable bank, its rapid fall in operating profits contrasts sharply with its 1990 results, when it earned SKr4.558bn. This was the highest in its history, while at the same time its credit losses were a more modest SKr623m. The bank's underlying position remains strong, with total assets at the end of April standing at SKr387.98bn, only slightly down from the SKr389.11bn a year before.</p>

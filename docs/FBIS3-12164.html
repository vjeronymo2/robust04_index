			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and Gaza [CJSJSG] approves of the establishment of a  state commission of inquiry into the Hebron killings, but at the  same time demands that the commission check all the events in  the six years of Arab terror. CJSJSG denounces the release of  terrorists from prison, and opposes the proposals to seize  weapons from Jews in the territories. Our correspondent Gil  Litman reports that in a communique released today, CJSJSG once  again expresses sorrow over the murders and denounces the  killing of innocent people.</p>

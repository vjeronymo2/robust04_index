			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 22 (TANJUG) -- British Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd said on Saturday that Western allies  faced a hard choice of whether to stay on in Bosnia or pull  their troops out.    The decision to go or stay would have to be made, but not in  the immediate future, REUTERS quotes him as saying in the  central Bosnian town of Vitez. "It will have to be a very  substantial weighing up process."    Western allies face a tough decision whether to stay in  Bosnia saving lives and getting aid through, or to pull out,  leaving a risk of greater savagery, said Hurd after inspecting  the British troops near Vitez.</p>

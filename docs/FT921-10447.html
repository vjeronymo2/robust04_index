			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Expansion takes Steel Burrill into bloodstock insurance STEEL BURRILL Jones yesterday announced the acquisition of Nelson Steavenson Bloodstock, a specialist bloodstock insurance broker, for an initial consideration of Pounds 1m. The deal is the latest of a number of acquisitions by SBJ, which is continuing a drive to reduce its initial dependence on marine reinsurance business. SBJ will fund the purchase through the issue of 349,090 new ordinary shares. Kleinwort Benson Securities has agreed to place 298,243 shares with institutional investors at 285p apiece. The vendors will be entitled to receive a deferred consideration in April 1995 related to the level of profits earned in the three years to December 31 1994. NSB, which specialises in the wholesale broking of risks related to bloodstock and domestic pets, employs 20 people and places the bulk of its business at Lloyd's. Most of its bloodstock business is generated in the US. The company's brokerage income in the year to March 31 was over Pounds 1.8m, when pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 153,000. Net tangible assets at that date were Pounds 92,000. Last December, in its biggest ever takeover, SBJ acquired Regis Low, a Lloyd's broker with a substantial energy, marine hull, and protection and indemnity account for Pounds 33.4m. SBJ also financed that deal with paper. In November SBJ bought a 45 per cent stake in a newly-formed company to broke Australian and other overseas risks into the Lloyd's and London markets.</p>

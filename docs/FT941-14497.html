			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Contracting-out curbs will go Obstacles to contracting out public services in central and local government will be swept away as part of the de-regulation bill. Ministers, civil servants and local authority officers will be able to pass their legal responsibilities on to contractors. They will also be able to hand over confidential information to contractors, who would be bound to maintain confidentiality. At present many public functions cannot be passed on to private-sector contractors - including the payment of civil service pensions. The de-regulation bill will allow a wide range of functions to be fully contracted out, including company registration, local tax collection, the registration of patents and the collection of business statistics. The bill includes a new power for ministers to remove obstacles to contracting-out, subject to a parliamentary vote to confirm their removal. This procedure could not be used for functions that affect the liberty of the individual or that involve entry, search and seizure powers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Defense establishment sources said that Russia and  eastern European countries are continuing to supply arms to the  Middle East in order to earn foreign currency. According to the  sources, the arms race would continue in the long run because  there were cheap weapon stockpiles in eastern Europe and Russia.  Additional countries, such as China and North Korea, had also  begun selling arms to the region. The sources noted that  increasing pressure from Western arms industries to produce  weapons would lead to a continuation of the arms race. These  trends would effect the scope of the threats that the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] would have to face over the coming years.    Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that  according to the defense sources, Iraq remained in regional and  international isolation and the efforts to supervise its nuclear  capabilities continued. Iran was purchasing weapon systems and  submarines and rapidly emerging as the main danger to the  region. The Persian Gulf, the sources explained, would remain a  source of instability and it could be safely assumed that Saddam  Husayn's behavior would remain a constant cause of tension.    It was also reported that approximately 25 percent of the  IDF's budget last year was earmarked for its military buildup,  approximately 25 percent was spent on training, 10 percent on  operational activities, with the remaining 40 percent going to  maintenance and wages.    Last year, the Intelligence Branch focused on improving  early  warning capabilities, pinpointing threats, and coping with  long-range challenges. The Intelligence Branch invested great  efforts in supplying all the information needed for the  political process.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 23 January  carries a report by Yariv Ben-Yehuda about a briefing to  military correspondents by Major General Amnon Shahaq and Major  General 'Uzi Dayan, respectively the deputy chief of staff and  the head of the IDF's Planning Branch. Referring to the IDF's  work plan for 1994, Shahaq is quoted as saying that the plan  "does not foresee changes in the deployment of the troops on the  Golan Heights," and that "the entire security budget totals  20.24 billion shekels."]</p>

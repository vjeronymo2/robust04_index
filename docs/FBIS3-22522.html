Tizi Ouzou -- Ouacif has not escaped this terrible  affliction. In the last 10 days, several cases have been  diagnosed in the remote region of Tizi Ouzou. As of last  Wednesday, the toll was one person dead and 11 hospitalized. The  sudden resurgence of this disease, which everyone thought was  eradicated forever, is due mainly to the inadequate coverage of  the vaccination program in recent years, according to what we  were told by various physicians. Mr. Semmoud, a physician and  Ouacif's top health official, said the majority of individuals  diagnosed with the disease fall in the 12-to-17-year-old age  bracket, most of them in very poor condition, already sick or  never vaccinated. To cope with any further escalation of the  problem, a crisis cell was created to maintain a 24-hour watch  on the situation. In that context, and because it was in Ouacif  that diphtheria cases were first identified, personnel at the  CEMs [Colleges of Intermediate Studies] and high schools of  downtown Ouacif were vaccinated. Also, in each case diagnosed,  everyone living in the household and immediate vicinity were  examined.    For the moment, the situation is far from reaching alarming  proportions. All the necessary equipment and personnel have been  deployed to the scene, a fact that we were able to verify during  our tour of Ouacif high school, where we noted a massive  official presence. From the prevention standpoint, it is vital  to understand that diphtheria is an infectious disease,  transmitted orally, whose symptoms are inflammation and  spasmodic constriction of the throat and high fever. Thus,  citizens should consult a physician immediately at the onset of  these symptoms.    Finally, it should be noted that this epidemic has also  affected other parts of Tizi Ouzou, as well as several other  wilayas.</p>

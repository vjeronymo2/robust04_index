			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> BOOSTER IN OKLA. GRID SCANDAL CALLED A FELON  </P> <P> The University of Oklahoma booster who was banned from associating with the  school's football program in the wake of a three-year NCAA probation is a  convicted felon, according to a published report.  </P> <P> The Daily Oklahoman reported in today's editions that William E. Lambert,  president of H.T.S. Oilfield Services Inc. in Lindsay, had served time in  federal prison for possessing stolen stock certificates.  </P> <P> Lambert was convicted in 1969 for possession of $300,000 worth of stolen stock  certificates, the Oklahoman reported. The certificates were part of $15 million  in securities stolen from a New York airport a year earlier.  </P> <P> Lambert told the newspaper he was not the same person convicted of that crime,  but a comparison of the Social Security number Lambert has used in his oilfield  business matched the number of the man sent to prison.  </P> <P> Court files indicate Lambert was in federal prisons at Texarkana, Tex., and  Springfield, Mo., the newspaper said, at least until 1971.  </P> <P> Dan Gibbens, the school's faculty representative, and Athletic Director Donnie  Duncan said they were unaware of Lambert's record.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Summer Job Allegations  </P> <P> The NCAA placed Oklahoma on three years' probation last month. Among the  alleged violations was one that some football players had received money from  summer jobs without doing the work.  </P> <P> Lambert was ordered to disassociate from Oklahoma's athletic programs for five  years after the NCAA found he had provided a recruit with free use of a car and  $6,400 for work the recruit never performed.  </P> <P> Lambert said he employed 10 to 15 Sooner players and assistants per year for 15  years.  </P> <P> He said Oklahoma officials, on their own volition, asked him to stop hiring  football players around 1984 or 1985, according to the Oklahoman.  </P></p>

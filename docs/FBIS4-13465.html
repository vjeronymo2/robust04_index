			<p>BFN     [Text] London, Apr. 21, IRNA -- A Saudi opposition group  said Wednesday [20 April] that following a crackdown on its  members in Riyadh, it had no option but to move outside the  country to resume its activities. The Committee for the Defense  of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia issuing a statement said  that it was pursuing its mission in London for continuing its  struggle until justice is established and oppression is  eliminated in Saudi Arabia.    The statement added that the group, which was set up by  scholars and professors in May 1993, had no choice because "all  means and methods of free expression and reform became  impossible" and that it would be "unwise and risky to postpone  undertaking the initiative." The committee called on the Saudi  citizens and others eager to support the elimination of  injustice to cooperate until their goals were accomplished.    Repressive measures listed against the group included being  banned from travelling, dismissal from work, closed down of  professional practices, imprisonment, torture and threat of  murder, it added.    The committee's statement was signed by the official  spokesman, Dr. Muhammad al-Mas'ari, who was reported to be  missing in March. But the group said his disappearance after his  release from prison last November was a cover to arrange his  escape to Europe.    Scores of the group's members, including al-Mas'ari, a  physics professor from King Sa'ud University, were arrested last  year, following the submission of a letter to King Fahd,  demanding reforms.    The statement said that the state's response, although  violent, convulsive and escalatory, did not alter their  determination to pursue a peace path for the just cause of  justice in Saudi Arabia.</p>

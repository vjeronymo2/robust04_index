			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (9): Budget brands spell growth - Asia's deluxe hotel market is at saturation point Asian hotels are considered the best in the world. They collect most of the accolades and awards to prove it. Their facilities and service levels are second to none; the envy of hotels outside the region. But future growth in this burgeoning region will come less from the deluxe category of hotel and more from the moderate three and budget four star hotel. Quite simply, the big cities of the region, from Bangkok and Hong Kong to Jakarta and Singapore, are at saturation point with deluxe hotels. Supply exceeds demand and room rates are soft in much of the region. In Singapore, Bangkok and Jakarta it is a buyer's market. Hong Kong remains an exception: rates appear to have hardened. Many of the big hotel operators have a two-prong strategy: to move on to secondary and even tertiary cities with their top-of-the-line brand in a bid for market share - Surabaya is 'flavour of the month' in Indonesia, for example - and to introduce a budget brand in either the important or secondary sites - or both. The Shangri-La hotel group is typical. It is doubling in size in the next six years; all new hotels concentrated in the Asia Pacific region. A Shangri-La hotel opened in Taipei in March this year, the tallest in the city, followed by another in Jakarta. Surabaya will open before the end of the year. To augment its main line brand in Singapore, it is opening a three-star Traders brand property there early next year. 'Traders hasn't got momentum yet, but it will be an important thrust in certain destinations,' says David Hayden, chief operating officer of the group. 'The future is in three or four star in Asia.' At present the Shangri-La Traders brand only exists in China. It is in Beijing, adjacent to a Shangri-La hotel in the downtown area. Its success, as a no-frills product, has spurred the group to expand. Fuelling the growth in more budget-priced properties is the growth in numbers of the regional businessmen and women, Taiwanese and Chinese in particular. Of the two countries, China seems the main attraction for the development of more cost-conscious hotel expansion. With China fitfully awakening, expected to become a centre of economic growth as an export power and a market of 1.2bn potential consumers, hotel investors are queueing up. The whole of IndoChina is also ripe for hotel investment, although Vietnam, followed by Cambodia, heads the wish list of investors, rather than Laos or Myanmar (formerly Burma). US President Clinton's recent lifting of trade sanctions between the US and Vietnam has opened the floodgates for American investment and Japanese investment will not be far behind. InterContinental is set to announce a deal in Cambodia's capital, Pnom Penh. Sheraton, the large American hotel chain which has 45 properties throughout Asia, is ready to expand in the region. While it is pushing ahead with its Sheraton brand - there will be openings in Kuala Lumpur in 1996, and a second site in Bangkok - it is developing a four-star brand for Asia, specifically for China. 'They will service the growing indigenous population of businesspeople,' says a spokesperson. Omni, the Asian four-star hotel operator, is also expanding into China. By the end of next year it will open an Omni Marco Polo hotel in Xiamen, Fujian province, in southern China, an old trading port and strong secondary city halfway between Hong Kong and Shanghai. 'It's an old Taiwanese homeland, so there's high Taiwanese investment,' explains Michael Hobson, vice president, sales and marketing, of Omni Asia Pacific, talking about the financing of the project. Omni's three hotels on Kowloon side, Hong Kong, are part of the Harbour City Complex which has restaurants, offices and 1,000 shops. Likewise, its newest property, in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, which opened in February this year, is also a mixed use project. The group is also looking for a suitable site in Hanoi, a city in desperate need of more, good hotels. At present the Metropole, a Sofitel-managed hotel, is the only western-style hotel in the city Choice, the US mid-market hotel operator, is pushing ahead with budget accommodation in Asia, with the biggest thrust in Thailand. There is a serious lack of 'dependable accommodation below the five-star luxury level' there, claims Brendan Ebbs, senior vice president of Choice's International Division. Six budget Sleep Inn hotels are on the drawing board for Thailand, while its Quality (three star), Comfort (two/three star) and Clarion (four star) brands are already represented in nine properties in Thailand. The opening of a Clarion resort this summer at Trang, near the Malaysian border, makes 10. The chain will open its first hotel in China: a Clarion, near Shanghai, this summer. Other budget hotel groups operate in the region. Southern Pacific Hotels is opening a three-star property, the Ancol Travelodge, in Jakarta in October this year (dubbed 'the Disneyland of Indonesia' by spokesperson Bob James): a 310-room city resort located near the harbour. It will be marketed as a gateway to the 1,000 islands. In Kuala Lumpur, Southern Pacific is augmenting its current hotel with the opening, this December, of Travelodge Apartments, seeking to take advantage of the long-stay market in the city. The apartments will be located in the former race course site, being developed as a commercial centre called the KL City Centre. In a similar venture, Westin, the US chain, will open an all-suite hotel in Bangkok early next year 'for the person who doesn't have to make a statement  -the discreet traveller,' explains Dennis Johnson. It seems that, at long last, the business traveller on a tight budget to Asia will soon have a wider choice of hotels.</p>

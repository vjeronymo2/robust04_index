			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization [MKO] vehemently  condemned the bomb explosion on Monday morning in Mashhad and  announced: The Khomeyni regime's linking this criminal act to  the Mojahedin and the Iranian Resistance is an absolute lie.    The MKO office in Paris issued a statement declaring this  stance, saying: An MKO spokesman vehemently condemned the  explosion at the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, in the  holy city of Mashhad and has said that the Khomeyni regime's  linking such a criminal act to the Mojahedin and the Iranian  Resistance is an absolute lie and its objective is merely to  tarnish the image of the just and extensive resistance of the  people of Iran against the religious and terrorist dictatorship  of the clerics.    This spokesman added: The Iranian Resistance would never  resort to such criminal actions which would desecrate the  sanctity of the infallible imams, and would cause such an  extensive loss of life and [word indistinct] among the innocent  people. This filthy and criminal action is only in the interest  of the clerical regime.    On numerous occasions in the past, the regime has planted  bombs and resorted to such acts, including hurling a grenade at  the French Embassy and the Air France office in Tehran,  ascribing these acts to the MKO.    We now draw your attention to the interview by the leader of  the Iranian Resistance, brother mojahed Mas'ud Rajavi, on the  atrocity perpetrated on Monday by the misanthropic clerics in  the hallowed precincts of the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon  him.    Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian Resistance, condemned  the heinous atrocity of an explosion in the sacred precincts of  Imam Reza's shrine in Mashhad by the terrorist dictatorship of  the clerics on 'Ashura [tenth day of Moharram] which resulted in  martyring and wounding a large number of innocent pilgrims and  damage to the tomb of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, and he  conveyed his condolences to the people of Iran. He described it  as a profane, antihuman, and anti-Islamic crime on the part of  the ruling tyrannical Yazidi [Yazid was Umayyad Caliph in  Damascus, and considered a heretic] clerics.    The leader of the Iranian Resistance stressed that the  objective of the Khomeyni regime in staging the explosion in the  holy precincts of the Imam Reza shrine, linking it to the MKO,  is nothing but a precursor to a series of terrorist acts in the  future against the Iranian Resistance which in the past have  included the aerial attack on the National Liberation Army  bases, explosions in offices and bases of the Iranian  Resistance, and the assassinations of Resistance activists  abroad.    Some days ago, the Khomeyni regime disseminated consummate  lies, claiming that the MKO had launched an attack on the Ilam  border, western Iran, in which some persons had been killed and  wounded.    Rajavi added: The criminal clerics are entrenched in a deep  political and economic crisis and are unable to combat the  proliferating dissatisfaction and increasing resistance by the  Iranian people. They do not find any recourse but to embark on  such inauspicious and bestial crimes and in the holy precincts  of the Imam Reza shrine at that. This is an unprecedented crime  which no other dictator has resorted to before.    Rajavi stressed: The cruel clerics have--since the heroic  uprising by the people of Mashhad--[words indistinct] continued  to seek revenge and harassed the people of Khorasan Province and  the pilgrims to the shrine of Imam Reza. He continued: The  Khomeyni regime is seeking to justify its next crime and thus to  arouse the religious sentiments of the people and to tarnish the  face of the MKO, who--because of their deep devotion to Islam,  the religion of mercy and liberation--enjoy greater credibility  among the Iranian people. They therefore chose the day of  'Ashura, the site of the holy shrine of Imam Reza, and the  anniversary of 30 Khordad--the day when the MKO uprising against  the regime was initiated--for perpetrating this crime.    The statement issued immediately by Khamene'i, the leader of  the clerical regime, linking this explosion to the MKO, and the  threatening propaganda by the regime, based on vengeance against  the MKO, are part of this previously formulated scenario.    While recalling the setting on fire of the Rex Theater in  Abadan, and the killing of innocent people in the last few  months of the shah's rule, the setting ablaze [as heard] of the  precincts of the Holy Ka'bah by agents of the Khomeyni regime in  1366 [year beginning 21 March 1987] Rajavi emphasized that the  clerical regime--despite its claims to being a protector of  Islam--has gone a step further and has massacred innocent  pilgrims in the Imam Reza shrine, the most hallowed site in all  of Iran. The unprecedented crime is an indication of the  incurable crises in Iran, and the abject impotence of the  clerics before the resistance of the Iranian people.    He added: In addition, the vestiges of the Khomeyni  regime--in view of the lack of participation on the part of the  people in the anniversary ceremonies for Khomeyni--are seeking  to damage the Imam Reza shrine and by violating its sanctity,  they wish to replace it with the temple of idols in which  Khomeyni is interred. Rajavi called on the United Nations,  Islamic Conference Organization, the Islamic governments,  international organizations that are defenders of human rights  to condemn this appalling atrocity and to send a team to Iran to  investigate this crime.    In order to thwart any deceitful actions by the clerical  regime, the Iranian Resistance deems the presence of its  representatives necessary in an international delegation to  investigate this incident. This is the insistent demand of the  people and the Resistance of Iran to the international community  who should not permit the criminal clerics to escape unscathed  after committing such an unprecedented crime.

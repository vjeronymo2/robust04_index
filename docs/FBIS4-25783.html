			<p>BFN     [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 14 (XINHUA) -- U.N. Envoy to Yemen  Lakhdar Ibrahimi said here today that there has been "positive  and encouraging progress" on the Yemen issue.    Before leaving the UAE capital for Doha, Qatar, Ibrahimi  said  there are some progress since both Sanaa and Aden have agreed to  resume the former joint military committee and add new members  to it.    The U.N. envoy was on a visit to Yemen and other Gulf and  Arab countries for implementing the U.N. Security Council  Resolution 924 for ending the five-week long Yemeni fighting.    The U.N. envoy said Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  has  accepted Aden's suggestion of keeping foreign members and  increasing new members in the committee.    Ibrahimi said U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali  today reappealed to the rival forces in Yemen to abide by the  Security [Council] resolution of truce.    Commenting on his meeting with leaders of the southern part  of Yemen in Mukalla on Monday, Ibrahimi said both Sanaa and Aden  had accepted the cease fire suggestion, but it was regrettable  that there was no truce, though the intensity of fighting has  decreased.    Both Sanaa and Aden accepted the idea of dialogue, but both  of them had their conditions, he added.    Ibrahimi denied the information reported by some news  agencies that he planted in Mukalla a suggestion of settling up  a Yemen federation or confederation, saying that to discuss the  matter is too early.    Today, Ibrahimi also met with UAE President Zayed Bin-Sultan  Al Nahayyan.    The envoy arrived here Monday night and left here today for  Qatar.    Latest reports reaching here from Doha said Qatari Amir  Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani received this evening the  U.N. envoy in Doha.</p>

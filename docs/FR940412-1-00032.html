			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> This NPRM proposes to link revenues received for ancillary services to the cost of services provided through the use of revenue offset methodology. Under this method, revenues received from charges for ancillary services are ``offset'' against the direct expenses of providing that service. In the above example, overhead costs would be reduced by the revenues received for the cancellation charge, other costs (pilot compensation costs for example) would be unaffected. The total amount of revenue received (needed) or expenses recognized under revenue offset methodology is unchanged. However, as discussed below, this NPRM proposes to set the charges for ancillary services separately from the basic pilotage rates in this NPRM. In addition, this NPRM also proposes to equalize ancillary charges between districts. For equity, as well as for economic reasons, a docking charge at Duluth should be equal to one at Chicago, Detroit, or Buffalo. This NPRM will discuss these charges in turn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Docking/Undocking and Harbor Movement Charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The current docking/undocking charges in undesignated waters are $297, $256, and $271, for Districts 1 through 3, respectively. Districts 1 and 3 also have a direct charge for a moveage in a harbor, at $580 and $531, respectively. For comparability, during the next ratemaking the Coast Guard would propose to set the docking/undocking charge at the same level for all three districts (e.g. at $250), subject to supported comment for establishment at any other level, or for differentiation between districts. This NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation, but may change the level of the charge from time to time upon review of the Director. In similar fashion, during the next ratemaking the Coast Guard would propose to set the charge for moveage in a harbor for all three districts at twice the docking charge, (e.g. $500), under the presumption that a moveage requires both an undocking (or lifting anchor) and a docking (anchorage). This adjustment is again subject to supported comment as to level and applicability. Again, this NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation, but may change the level of the charge from time to time upon review of the Director.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revenue received for docking/undocking and moveage within a harbor would be offset against revenues required for pilot compensation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Delay Charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Delay charges, per hour, whether for trip interruption or departure or moveage delays, would be set at the rate determined in the pilot compensation phase, below, as adjusted for ship size. The maximum basic rate for any 24 hour period would be the per hour delay charge, as adjusted for ship size, times 16 hours. Delay charges would not be imposed for interruption caused by ice, weather, or traffic (except from December 1 through April 8 of each year), and would also not be imposed in undesignated waters if a trip, though delayed, is still completed within the minimum 6 hour period under 401.410(a). Revenues received for delay charges would be offset against revenues required for pilot compensation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Cancellation Charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> If a pilot reports for duty and the order is cancelled, the ship would pay the minimum basic pilot compensation charge for a six-hour period, unadjusted for ship size; if the order is cancelled, and the pilot has started travel but not arrived, the minimum charge would also apply. If the cancellation is more than six hours after the pilot reports to the designated boarding point, the ship would pay the minimum basic pilot compensation charge for six-hour period, plus delay charges for each hour or fraction of an hour over six hours, subject to the maximum basic rate for delay charges (the delay charge per hour times 16 hours for any 24 hour period.) Revenues received for cancellation charges would be offset against operating expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Lock Passage Charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As for docking/undocking and moveage, this NPRM proposes that the fee for lock passage should be the same for all three districts. During the next ratemaking the Coast Guard would propose to set the lock transit charge at the same level for all three districts (e.g. $150), subject to supported comment for establishment at any other level, or for differentiation between districts. This NPRM does not propose to adjust this charge for inflation, but may change the level of the charge from time to time upon review of the Director. Revenues received for lock passage charges would be offset against revenues required for pilot compensation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Part A.4. Development and Application of Hourly Pilotage Charges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The operating expenses recognized under this NPRM's proposed methodology are broken into two major components, pilot compensation costs and non-pilot operating costs. The projected non-pilot operating costs for the ensuing navigation season, including the constructed amount necessary to bring the pilot organizations to the ROI standard, would be divided by the sum of the estimated pilotage hours for both designated and undesignated waters, by District. This standard charge per hour would be applied on a per hour basis for each supplied pilotage hour, whether in designated or undesignated waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Total pilot compensation costs for designated and undesignated waters are derived from the target pilot compensation for masters and first mates, times the number of needed pilots. The pilot compensation cost per hour for designated and undesignated waters is this constructed cost, divided by the pilot hours projected in designated or undesignated waters. Target pilot compensation and the number of needed pilots is developed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Bosnians renew air-strike plea Fighting increased throughout Bosnia at the weekend following the failure of talks last week on the former Yugoslav republic's partition. Bosnian Moslems appealed for Nato air strikes against Serb gunners besieging Sarajevo, the capital. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian prime minister, said a mortar attack on Saturday, in which six children died, was another Serb snub to a passive world. In a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, Mr Silajdzic said: 'This act humiliates the international community, mocks the dignity of the United Nations and renders senseless all of our efforts to reach peace through negotiations.' Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, indicated yesterday during a visit to Paris that there was uncertainty about the Nato strategy, despite the alliance renewing its pledge at a summit two weeks ago to use air strikes to prevent strangulation of Sarajevo and UN 'safe areas'. Mr Christopher said he was confused about the French position towards Bosnia and had to confer anew with Britain and Germany, but reaffirmed the US commitment to Nato's position. Lieut-Gen Francis Briquemont, outgoing commander of the UN Protection Force in Bosnia, said UN forces were suffering a crisis of confidence as politicians denied them the means to do their job. In Bosnia, three children were reported killed yesterday in a Moslem attack on the Croat-held part of Mostar while four civilians were killed in the Croat enclave of Zepce. Kieran Cooke adds from Kuala Lumpur: Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has launched a stinging attack on western countries for their failure to act decisively in Bosnia. During a visit to Malaysia by Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Dr Mahathir said the west's policies amounted to hypocrisy at its worst.</p>

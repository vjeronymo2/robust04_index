			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Lloyd's faces row on governance reforms A ROW over the governance of Lloyd's of London is brewing in the wake of last week's report by a task force which advocated far-reaching reforms to the insurance market. The task force, made up of underwriters, brokers and Lloyd's executives, recommended a number of radical changes - including proposals to modify the unlimited liability of Lloyd's Names, the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Lloyd's Council, the market's governing body, accepted most of the proposals but rejected the suggested separation of its own regulatory and business-development functions. It said that acceptance would have delayed implementation of other reforms. Hinting that Lloyd's had understated the depth of its opposition on this issue last week, Mr Alan Lord, chief executive of Lloyd's and a member of the 28-strong council, said yesterday he would have considered resigning had the proposal on corporate governance been accepted. Mr David Coleridge, chairman of Lloyd's, said that the report was 'full of incredibly sensible, well-thought out things' but described some of the thinking on governance as 'codswallop' and 'absolute hot air'. In their report the task force suggested the council, which would retain the majority of outside Names (who do not work at Lloyd's) and nominated members as at present, should retain its regulatory role but would be chaired by an independent nominated member. But it also advocated the creation of a market board, made up mainly of representatives of underwriting businesses, which should have responsibility for developing the market's business strategy. Mr Lord said the creation of the market board would be 'retrogressive' because it would have reduced the effectiveness of the regulatory structure introduced by the 1982 Lloyd's Act.</p>

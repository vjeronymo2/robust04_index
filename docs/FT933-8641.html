			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Provoking the markets HAVE WORLD stock markets lost touch with economic reality? In the UK this week the FT-SE 100 index broke through the 3,000 barrier just as a whole series of economic statistics and company results cast serious doubt on the strength of the recovery. In continental Europe, equity markets soared despite the continuing contraction in industrial output. Wall Street has looked overvalued for so long that it is hard to remember when, if at all, it was last remotely near to being in touch. At times like this, the apologists tend to argue that the markets are a barometer that reflects expectations about the future, while the cynics claim that the markets are driven by money, not economic fundamentals. The cynics are probably nearer the mark. There is nothing new, in the UK, about a market that breaks through ceilings when the real economy is looking sickly. Liquidity abounds in recessions and invariably fuels a rise in the markets. That said, other economic forces are at play in the sense that the present surge in European markets has largely been prompted by expectations of falling interest rates. Where the barometer analogy breaks down is in the way that markets themselves influence economic activity. By creating a wealth effect, a rising market affects spending within the economy. The locus classicus of the broken barometer theory is Japan, where the whole economy overheated, then crashed, on the back of the stock market bubble of the late 1980s. Ideological attack At a time when markets are under ideological attack, notably from politicians in the countries that formed the former hard core of the European exchange rate mechanism, it does no harm to point out that buoyant securities markets have been exceptionally accommodating of late to businessmen and governments alike. In the UK, industrial and commercial companies took advantage of an increasingly giddy market to raise more than Pounds 8bn of fresh equity in the first half of 1993, compared with Pounds 5.3bn for the whole of 1992. The Bank of England, meantime, has already sold enough gilts to cover nearly 60 per cent of its Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement for 1993-94 in the first four and a half months of the financial year. As for the French government, a soaring equity market is likely to make light work of a heavy privatisation programme. The Italians have been fortunate in being given the benefit of the doubt by international bond investors despite a bloated stock of public sector debt and a poor record on inflation. Governments generally have seen the risk premium in their IOUs tending to narrow as investors' inflationary expectations have subsided. The risk in the present high level of share prices is less that equity markets will succumb to an autonomous free fall than that governments will provoke a collapse by confounding market expectations about interest rates. It is not difficult to see how this might come about in Europe, where politicians' understanding of markets is woefully deficient. Classic case In the aftermath of the ERM fiasco, for example, the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, has chosen to ignore the message implicit in the near-collapse of the ERM and is calling for reforms to curb the activities of the speculators. Even if it were possible to reintroduce some workable form of exchange control, which seems unlikely, this would still be a classic case of shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted. For a consequence of the widening of the ERM bands is that the ability of markets to wield discipline over governments has shifted from the currency markets to the securities markets. Since exchange rate relationships are no longer fixed within the ERM, they are invulnerable to attack. But if interest rate policy is inflexible, investors can cause a securities market collapse by bolting for the exit. In an inflationary environment, such market discipline is exercised through the government bond market, leaving the politicians with an unpalatable choice between cutting expenditure or raising taxes. In a deflationary environment of the kind that prevails in continental Europe, the discipline is felt in equities. A falling stock market causes a negative wealth effect, as savers respond to their loss of capital by spending more cautiously and investing in cash. Companies suffer from a higher cost of capital. This adds to the deflationary pressure within the economy. By failing to make use of the opportunity to cut interest rates sharply now that the opportunity is available, the ERM members whose economies are shrinking and whose unemployment rates are rising are courting trouble in the equity market. Elsewhere, notably in the United States, the risk is more that a favourable downward trend in interest rates has simply come to an end. The message for investors is to watch for nervousness over lack of action on interest rates in Europe and for an active change of policy by the Fed in the US. Equities are in dangerous territory.</p>

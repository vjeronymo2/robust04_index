			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / International Company News: CarnaudMetalbox plans sale CARNAUDMETALBOX, the Anglo-French packaging group, plans to sell its high-performance plastics division to Huhtamaki, the Finnish consumer products group. The sale, which is subject to the signing of an agreement by the middle of this month, comprises all CarnaudMetalbox's activities in the division, which supplies rigid plastic packaging for the food industry. The division has factories in France, Northern Ireland, Italy and Portugal. It employs about 750 people and achieved sales last year of FFr650m (Dollars 112m). CarnaudMetalbox would not disclose the value of the disposal or the profits of the division. The Anglo-French group said it was selling the division because it represented only about 7 per cent of the European market for rigid plastic packaging and conditions required a stronger presence. Mr Jurgen Hintz, chief executive, said the sale would allow CarnaudMetalbox to focus on its main strategic activities where it has technological and marketing leadership. Mr Timo Peltola, Huhtamaki's chief executive, said the acquisition complemented Polarcup, the company's own packaging division, which last year had net sales of FM1.8bn (Dollars 316m). 'Although already Europe's leading company in the field, Polarcup has had no manufacturing presence in France or Italy. The acquisition will also strengthen our product range in dairy and other food containers,' he said. The Finnish group said it may launch an international equity issue to finance the deal. It also disclosed a 9 per cent rise in profits after financial items to FM307m for the first eight months and maintained its prediction that its full-year result would exceed last year's FM399m profit. The improvement stemmed mainly from lower financial expenses, with operating income virtually unchanged at FM405m. Sales grew 14 per cent to FM5.0bn, helped by the weaker Finnish markka.</p>

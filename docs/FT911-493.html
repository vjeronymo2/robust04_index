			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Travel: Almost the key to all mythologies - Unpredictable Key West, Florida ON THE long string of islands stretching southwards into the Gulf Stream from the Florida mainland, most wildlife is, at 2am fast asleep. On the docks of Key Largo pelicans perch motionless in the moonlight on timber pilings. On Big Pine Key miniature deer drowse in dark thickets. At water's edge all along the keys, fiddler crabs have stopped fiddling and spoonbills have stopped spooning. Even the fish, eyes lidless and gills pumping rhythmically, sleep peacefully suspended in the gentle ebb and surge of underwater reefs. But there is one place where a bountiful collection of wildlife rarely sleeps at all. On Key West, at the extreme southern tip of the islands, you can count on finding a noisy, neon-lit circus every night of the week. From sunset into the small hours, Duval Street is the haunt of a variety of exotic creatures, some attractive, some repellant, gathered from all over the US. Out on the brightly-lit street, tattooed bikers on Harley Davidsons vie for space with yuppy-driven Mercedes and hippy-powered bicycles. On sidewalks overhung by palm and fragrant frangipani trees, a hundred bars, pizza joints, souvenir shops and clothing boutiques suck in and disgorge crowds voraciously seeking distraction. Here trim and trendy Long Islanders struggle past obese Iowans. Would-be novelists bump into one-time painters. Drifters beg spare change from drunks. Philosophers argue with plumbers. Men pursue women. Women pursue men. Men pursue men. Somewhere along the 160 miles of keys and bridges that separate Miami from Key West, the established rules seem to have fallen by the wayside. Losers and winners, the dull, the witty, the elegant, the vulgar, the eccentric and the desperate are all on the prowl together. Without a big top, without protective bars, this is one of the gaudiest shows in America. But Key West, as any aspiring student of literature is aware, is also touted as one of the great cradles of American high culture. In the 1920s it was the hideout of novelist John Dos Passos and poet Wallace Stevens; in the '30s, home to Ernest Hemingway; in the '40s and '50s, a retreat for Tennesee Williams. Stephen Crane, Robert Frost, Elizabeth Bishop, Truman Capote, John Hersey, John Ciardi and many other prominent American writers lived and worked here. All this I discover in my Key West Reader, a book I have brought along with the intention of whiling away long afternoons under some shady tree. Writers have gathered in large numbers in Key West for over a century, I read, because it represents 'a unique confluence of factors of history, climate, physical beauty, cultural diversity, and unabashed romantic appeal.' This tiny patch of coral only four miles long by one mile wide, I learn, is 'a rare place in the geography of the American consciousness.' High praise, indeed. It is a piece of information I take some time to ponder as I sit in Rick's Bar one Thursday evening watching Rick's wet T-shirt contest, one of the more celebrated events along Duval Street. As iced water is poured over squealing female flesh, as puckered anatomies reveal themselves beneath thin, soaked cotton, as the crowd roars its approval and several young men jump up and attempt to rip the shirts entirely off the contestants, I consider such lofty concepts as physical beauty, cultural diversity and unabashed romantic appeal. Well, yes, they are all here, in a way. But in such a way as to make Key West a rare place in the American conciousness? Couldn't I see the same goosebumps rise in Philadelphia? What has happened to the picturesque and isolated retreat of the literati? What are the rowdy philistines of the American hinterland doing to Key West? Is the artistic legend of the past even now being pushed off its island perch and into deep water beyond the reef? The answer, in short, is no. Ever since Spanish explorers came across it in the 16th century, the island has been a place of unconventional activity and extremes of behaviour. Physically detached and far from the suasion of middle America, this has always been a refuge for individualists and eccentrics. The list of colourful originals who have adopted Key West is long and varied. War-like Indians and Spanish conquistadors were followed by pirates who used the island to attack shipping. Hard on their heels came the American Navy, and the base and seaport town that grew around it attracted a drifting population of itinerants, adventurers and sea-going desperados. All worked at building Key West's reputation as a place that played hard and drank hard. The island's 'wreckers' did nothing to decrease that reputation. Making fortunes from the many ships wrecked along the dangerous reefs of the keys, island salvagers had, by the 1830's, transformed tiny Key West into the richest city per capita in the entire US. In thin times, with the islands of the Caribbean just a fast boat ride away, rum-running, gun-running and drug-smuggling have proved highly popular activities. More than once Key West has seen itself revert to its early existence as a neglected fishing village. All this makes Key West the end of the line, a place that operates outside the mainframe of conventional, middle-class American life. Back in the 1940's, Tony Tarracino, on the run from New Jersey gangsters, hitched a ride into Key West on a milk truck and marvelled at its gambling, drinking, womanising ways. Of that day he now says: 'I knew as soon as I got off that milk truck that Key West didn't belong to the United States.' He liked it and stayed, opening his own bar. Today Tarracino, gambler, drinker, womaniser and outsider extraordinaire is mayor of Key West. Against this background, what kind of dent could any amount of high culture, literary or otherwise, make? None whatsoever. Like everyone else here, American writers in fact came to get away from that kind of culture, and engaged in some fairly Key-West-like behaviour themselves. The elderly and retiring Wallace Stevens became involved in the one and only fist-fight of his life on Key West. The man who blackened his eye, Ernest Hemingway, came to Key West to fish and liked to spend days drinking at Sloppy Joe's Bar on Duval Street with a 300lb bartender named Big Skinner. Key West today remains a tolerant place where most kinds of people and behaviour are accepted. And if today the island is coming under ever greater pressure from commercial and property interests, it is being resisted by Mayor Tarracino and by residents who a few years ago, and only half jokingly, declared Key West an independent republic. Nor should the unpredictability of Key West life be forgotten. As one old island adage warns, perhaps just a little bit nostalgically, one good hurricane and the whole place will be a quiet fishing village once again.</p>

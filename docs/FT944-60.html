			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Revenue is right - Briefcase I am the trustee of a discretionary trust for my grandson (a minor). Its capital is invested in a government deposit bond, and the sole income is the gross interest which this bond pays annually. The Inland Revenue bases its tax demand of 35 per cent each year on the previous year's actual interest. Because of the declining interest rates of recent years, this has meant that the tax levied on each year's actual income is, effectively, at a rate higher than the nominal 35 per cent (for instance, it is 42 per cent for 1994-95). This higher rate has not hurt my grandson; since his income is below Pounds 3,445, he has been able to reclaim fully the tax paid by the trust. But the Revenue now says it has erred in previous years by allowing the full reclaim. It says the reclaim is limited to a tax rate of 35 per cent on the actual income in any tax year. Unfortunately, the Revenue is correct. Your case is a graphic illustration of the curious results that can be thrown up by the preceding-year basis of assessment (soon to be replaced). The form R185 - which the trustees must provide to your grandson in respect of actual income payments made to him - will show those payments grossed up at a tax rate of 35 per cent. The fact that the trustees may have paid tax more or less than 35 per cent of the gross income of the year (because the assessment is based on the income received in a different year) is irrelevant for this purpose. The situation is no different if it is an individual who is getting gross interest income at a time of falling rates. The net interest received will be reduced by the fact that the tax liability for a particular year will exceed the individual's marginal rate for that year as a result of the preceding-year basis of assessment. In such cases, taxpayers often take the opportunity to close accounts and re-open them with other deposit-takers to ensure that the opening and closing rules of assessment apply, thus ensuring assessment on a present-year basis.

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LISTEN  </P> <P> Making Out Like Thieves  </P> <P> Where can you pick up a Christian Lacroix suit for $200? Certainly not off the  usual racks. Listen spied the outfit in the pricing office of the Thieves  Market, the fashion bazaar to be held Oct. 28 at the Santa Monica Airport  Center. Lacroix's miniskirted suit is among hundreds of secondhand items in the  sale. There's an Oscar de la Renta peignoir for $50, a Missoni dress for $50,  and a Calvin Klein suit for $150, not to mention the dozens of designer shoes  uniformly priced at $30 per pair. And shoppers who spend $150 to attend the  Gala Preview Party and Auction, set for today, will get first dibs on the  goodies. Others will have second choice, from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Oct. 28, but  admission is free. Information: (213) 825-3264.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shimmering at the Beach  </P> <P> Ever wonder where Chanel, Ungaro and Oscar de la Renta shop for the gilded,  beaded, sequined, shimmering fabrics they use for their collections? One place  is Jakob Schlerpfer Bambola, the Swiss textile design company. Now, spokeswoman  Jeane deCoster explains, the firm is opening it's only U.S. retail store. And  of all places, it's located a stone's throw from Marina del Rey harbor. The  store's swanky fabrics, priced at $50 to $4,000 a yard, are quite a contrast to  the T-shirt and surfer-wear shops in the neighborhood. Why here? "To test the  market," deCoster says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Get Your Old Shoes Here  </P> <P> Part of the fun at Saturday night's Halloween for Hope charity bash will be an  auction of old Reeboks belonging to a number of celebrities, including George  Burns, Tracey Ullman, Marlee Matlin, Arsenio Hall, Lakers Coach Pat Riley and  tennis champ Michael Chang. A Reebok spokesperson says the company is planning  to adorn each pair of worn and autographed athletic shoes with a little  something "to match the celebrity's personality." But Whoopi Goldberg has beat  them to the punch by decorating hers with miniature braids that resemble her  signature dreadlocks. The $75-a-person costume ball takes place at 20th Century  Fox Studios on the "Hooperman" sound stage. Information: City of Hope, (213)  626-4611, ext. 327.  </P></p>

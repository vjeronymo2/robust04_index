			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- A training course for  60 operators from Pakistan's Cashma Nuclear Power Plant opened  today at the post-graduate school under the China National  Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).    The 300,000 kilowatt Cashma is modeled after the Qinshan  Nuclear Power Plant in coastal Zhejiang Province, which was  designed and built entirely by China itself. It is the first  nuclear power plant China has ever exported to a foreign country.    The contract obliged CNNC to provide training in basic  theories to Pakistani engineers and technicians to ensure  Cashma's safe operation and maintenance. The trainees are to  receive on-job training at Qinshan at the end of the course.    According to CNNC officials, some 62 Chinese scientists were  organized to prepare a set of 17 textbooks in 14 subjects for  the training course, which were examined and approved by the  China Institute of Atomic Energy, the National Nuclear Safety  Administration and the prestigious Qinghua University.    The textbooks were accepted by the Pakistani side, the  officials said.</p>

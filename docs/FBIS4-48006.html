			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   Whites `Laid the Foundation' for Prosperous South Africa --  "The people, the vast majority of whom are Black, have spoken  and are celebrating their liberation with the joy that the ANC's  victory gives them," declares the page-6 editorial in  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 6 May. "Neither they,  nor the outside world, will shed a tear for the demise of White  rule. Yet it will not be amiss to say that the legacy left to  Mr Mandela and his government has not all been bad." Apartheid  was "a grim abandonment of human values and rights, causing  great suffering and holding back a people in most spheres of  life. But as a country we have progressed to become a  powerhouse in sub-Saharan Africa, a country that has a solid  foundation for growth, a developing country with First World as  well as Third World standards, a country that can bring to all  its people the benefits of modern technology and great  entrepreneurial skills." THE CITIZEN believes white South  Africans "deserve to be recognised as a people who laid the  foundation for what is going to be a prosperous and wonderful  country."  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   New Cabinet ANC-Loaded -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English  on  9 May in a page-10 editorial notes that South Africans are  entitled to "feel a quiet pride" at the formation of the  Government of National Unity (GNU). However, "it is a pity that  the GNU Cabinet should be quite as ANC-loaded as it is,  particularly after all the honeyed protestations of  inclusiveness that have dripped from the nation's rooftops in  recent weeks. Worse, an alarm bell has already rung loudly,  although so far overlooked in the election over Nelson Mandela's  victory speech.@??Zn? in the middle of that speech, Mandela  seemed to reveal his understanding of the way his party's  partners in cabinet are required to behave. Their views were to  be accommodated...'within the context of the Reconstruction and  Development Programme'." "Alarm bell indeed. Insofar as  Mandela is urging his about-to-be Cabinet partners to serve  reconstruction (small r) and go in for development (small d),  good and well. If he is insisting that they unquestioningly  imbibe a party programme with which they have major arithmetical  difficulty, not so. 'National Unity' cannot merely mean  permitting a token opposition presence in the Cabinet room. It  must mean two-way adjustment. Most adjusting, fair to say, must  come from the minority parties; but not all. Mandela seems to  see his partners as a set of voluntary hostages. He must revise  that view before it leads to tears."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Mandela's `Curious' Cabinet Appointments -- The page-12  editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 May  comments on President Nelson Mandela's "more curious provisional  Cabinet appointments." The "impending reappointment of Derek  Keys to the Finance portfolio is, from business's perspective, a  bonus. With Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals's mid-year  reappointment already as good as confirmed, Mandela probably  need not have gone that far to convince business of his good  intentions." However, Mandela should realize that Keys "is not,  like some other NP [National Party] Cabinet possibilities, a yes  man. A discordant note was struck in Mandela's victory speech  on Monday, when he warned that Cabinet partners would have to  accept the ANC's reconstruction and development programme,  failing which there would be serious strains. Yes, the ANC has  a clear mandate to make the RDP the basis of the new  government's programme, but Keys will put his foot down if he  believes it necessary in the interest of good fiscal management.  Mandela should not take that as a sign of hostility to  reconstruction and development per se. And, if Keys felt  compelled to resign over such a dispute, the effects on investor  confidence could be dire." BUSINESS DAY believes Alfred Nzo was  appointed foreign minister as "a reward for past services, but  he is "likely to be ineffectual in Foreign Affairs." "The two  main security portfolios -- Defence and Police -- are the most  worrying. Prospective Police Minister Sidney Mufamadi's  three-year reign as head of the ANC's peace desk was uninspired  as the country descended into violence. Proposed Defence  Minister Joe Modise is held in high esteem only by factions of  Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] and a  few others. Assuming the NP is still fighting for one of these  two posts, it would do Mandela no harm to concede the point."  "There are, in the end, two grounds for consolation regarding  Mandela's less-inspired choices. Weak ministers can be carried  if they have competent directors-general and other senior  officials. They can also be removed at the President's will."</p>

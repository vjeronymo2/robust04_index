			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / French blamed for conflict Nigeria accused France yesterday of escalating Nigeria's border conflict with Cameroon by sending paratroopers there. 'It is a direct provocation and we regard the escalation of the conflict as the entire responsibility of the French,' Mr Baba Gana Kingibe, foreign minister, told a news conference. A contingent of 15 French paratroopers and two helicopters arrived in Yaounde on Sunday after Nigerian and Cameroonian troops exchanged fire in the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula which both west African countries claim. 'I hope that war is not imminent. Our endeavour is to avoid war. . . . but that does not preclude our being prepared for any provocation from France or Cameroon,' said Mr Kingibe. French companies have close ties with the Nigeria in the oil industry, manufacturing and construction. Elf Aquitaine owns 40 per cent of a joint venture with the Nigerian government producing 100,000 barrels a day of crude oil. Elf is also in partnership with Shell, Agip and the Nigerian government in the Dollars 4bn liquefied natural gas project re-launched this year.</p>

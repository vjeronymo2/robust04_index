But it enables it to raise the question of confidence in the  government. It is fairly likely that the Duma in the very first  weeks of its work will get bogged down in debates precisely on  this issue.    The election results and the composition of the State Duma  call for preemptive actions on the part of the president and the  prime minister. They must not wait until the Duma raises the  question point blank about changing the government composition.  It is better to do this by themselves. In that event many  upheavals would be avoided.    In my opinion, it would be most reasonable to renew the  government completely, keeping Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in  his post. There are serious grounds for that. The most  important among them is that over two years the first stage of  reform has been passed and now adjustment of the course is  required.    Whereas in internal politics adjustment should consist in  working out a coherent industrial and social program, what is  needed in foreign policy is a clear-cut definition of national  and state interests and priorities. Up to now the possibilities  of international support by Russian speakers in the neighboring  countries have been left absolutely untapped. The United States  and Western countries, about which Foreign Minister Kozyrev  speaks as of Russia's allies, have not been in any way helping  to address problems related to human rights in the former Union  republics. Meanwhile these problems have substantially  aggravated the internal political situation in Russia, which has  been brilliantly used by Zhirinovskiy in his preelection  campaign.    There is also a psychological dimension, which must not be  ignored. The conduct of serious economic transformations always  leads to a situation where their social side effects are  associated with certain figures. Society has basically gotten  tired of the same persons. Their replacement in itself will  calm the people and prolong the "benefit of the doubt" even if  the economic course remains unchanged.    To be sure, to pursue a consistent reformist line a team of  like-minded people is needed. The current government is no  longer a monolith: It has broken up into several blocs that  have vied for seats in parliament. The latter circumstance is  always seen in public consciousness as an irritating factor.  Today the government especially needs professionals who would  be ready to work on a nonpartisan basis. And there is no need  for politicians who are thinking about their own political  future in the post-Yeltsin Russia, concerned about creating a  social and organizational basis for their own participation in  the next presidential elections.    The need to revise substantially relations between the  president and the government is also there. For the president  to realize the powers granted him by the new constitution, a  strategy of reforms must be formed in the presidential  structures. And the government is called upon to implement this  strategy. Otherwise Yeltsin will find himself in Gorbachev's  situation in 1990-1991 when the USSR president was left with  only one option -- to react to the sociopolitical process that  had acquired its own logic of development.    What is in fact required from the government today? First,  to prevent hyperinflation. Second, to conduct a more rational  industrial policy. These tasks will confront any cabinet of  ministers. But the authorities should be interested in seeing  it formed from among the "second echelon" of reformer  economists. Viktor Chernomyrdin is quite capable of becoming the  conductor of such a course. While formally embodying the  industrial lobby in the government, over the year of his  premiership he has shown that he understands the laws of  macroeconomic regulation and sees the possible negative  implications of the "Ukrainization" of the economy. The  presence of the constructive "reformist lobby" in the Duma from  among the leaders of Russia's Choice, on the other hand, will  restrain the new cabinet of ministers from an unduly  inflation-oriented policy. But the main guarantor of the  continuity of the reform course must be President Yeltsin, ready  at any moment to intervene in the government's actions.    A renewed cabinet of ministers would undoubtedly receive  support from the Federal Assembly for the next year or year and  a half. It is not ruled out that a fairly broad left-of-center  coalition could be formed in the Duma, oriented toward  constructive cooperation with a government that has not tainted  itself with "shock therapy."    Of course, the president has weighty reasons to doubt the  expediency of a complete overhaul of the government. Such  people as Gaydar, Fedorov, and Chubays epitomize the reforms.  Their electorate is also the most active and consistent  electorate of Yeltsin. But proceeding from Russia's long-term  interests, the president should distance himself somewhat from  the leaders of this orientation. In no case ignore them, but  try to use these people in other power structures. Their  deputyship gives them such an opportunity. Remaining rigidly  linked to one of the groups in the current political spectrum,  the president should be prepared to see that this will sharply  narrow the social base of transformations, polarize society, and  cause damage to the strategic aims of the reform.    Yeltsin may -- and not without reason -- fear that he will  be  charged with "treachery" for "changing the team." It is another  matter if the initiative for the renewal of the government comes  from Chernomyrdin; for this he will naturally have to present a  program for the continuation of the reforms and a concept for a  new government. But it would be best if the idea of creating a  nonpartisan "cabinet of professionals" were initiated by leaders  of Russia's Choice and other partisan factions in the  government. This guarantees a conflict-free renewal of the  cabinet of ministers and its calm work in the near future.    It appears, however, that there will no complete renewal of  the government. What follows from this? Most likely the State  Duma, where Russia's Choice has no majority, will raise the  question of confidence in the government. This would mean a new  spiral of confrontation between the representative and executive  branches. Of course, the Duma has no serious possibilities of  changing the government, and generally its powers are limited.  But this conflict, not so important in itself, will have  far-reaching implications. The entire responsibility for  economic failures will be laid exclusively on the government and  the president. In the context of the crisis and the quite  probable "popular unrest," even a weak Duma, having embarked  down the path of confrontation, is capable of extremely  aggravating the political situation.    And amid social and political instability nobody has better  chances for success than politicians like Zhirinovskiy.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> MAIL MAY ARRIVE A DAY LATER  </P> <P> Some mail that now gets delivered the next day will take a day longer starting  this weekend.  </P> <P> Postmaster General Anthony Frank announced he will go ahead with selective  cutbacks in overnight delivery service, originally announced last January,  despite opposition from the independent Postal Rate Commission.  </P> <P> The commission, in an opinion issued Thursday, said it opposes the reductions  nationally, although cutbacks in delivery goals might be justified locally in  some areas.  </P> <P> The commission criticized the postal service for failing to estimate how it  might save or customers might lose with the change. It also said the market  research on which the service based its decision accurately measured what  customers want.  </P></p>

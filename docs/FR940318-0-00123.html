			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, eight major industrial use sectors are covered in this final rule. They are refrigeration and air conditioning, foam blowing, fire suppression and explosion protection, solvents cleaning, adhesives, coatings, and inks, aerosols, sterilization and tobacco expansion. Analysis of substitutes in a ninth sector, pesticides, will be completed, and the resulting decisions will be added to future SNAP determinations published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as part of EPA's quarterly updates to the lists of acceptable and unacceptable substitutes. EPA does not plan to add sectors other than the nine principal sectors listed above to the formal analyses performed under SNAP, unless the Agency receives additional data indicating that inclusion of additional sectors is warranted based on the potential for high risks to human health and the environment due to class I and II alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Small volume use within SNAP sectors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As noted above, most ozone-depleting substances have been or are currently used in large industrial sectors such as refrigeration or fire extinguishing. However, even within these sectors, the potential for adverse effects on human health and the environment is related to the aggregate amount of ozone-depleting material consumed in an end-use. Thus, the Agency is focusing the SNAP determinations on large-volume uses in the major industrial sectors. Given the breadth of EPA's required overall risk assessment, the imposition on small volume uses within any sector of a requirement for a full SNAP submission seems unjustified by the potential for risk posed by these small uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, a key policy interest in the SNAP program is promoting the quickest possible shift from the ODSs into alternatives posing lower overall risk. The speed and orderliness of this shift depends in part on clear early determinations from EPA on the acceptability of key substitutes. Focusing the SNAP program on all possible substitutes in every conceivable use could diminish EPA's ability to provide an early and clear message on those substitutes which can contribute most to solving the problem of general reliance on ozone-depleting chemicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the small volume use exemption is an exemption from the notification requirement only. It does not, for example, authorize the use in any quantity of a substitute otherwise deemed unacceptable under SNAP. Since the responsibility for meeting the notification requirement resides with the person introducing the substitute into interstate commerce, whether manufacturer, formulator, or end-user, this person is also responsible for ascertaining whether annual use of the substitute in its intended sector will exceed 10,000 pounds per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, those introducing substitutes for ozone-depleting compounds in annual quantities of 10,000 pounds per year or less for any given major industrial sector identified in this rule need not notify EPA of their activities under SNAP. The exemption applies regardless of whether the Agency is notified for the same substitute for any conceivable application in the other major sectors covered under SNAP, or whether the introducer's total sales are 10,000 pounds or less for any or all of the other major SNAP sectors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those taking advantage of the exemption for small uses must maintain documentation describing the basis for their view that any substitute being used meets this small use definition. This documentation must include annual production and sales information by sector, and could be necessary in the event the Agency receives a petition to add such substitutes to its evaluations under SNAP, or to assure adequate enforcement of the notification requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Research and development. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Substitutes manufactured or imported solely for research and development are exempt from reporting requirements under section 612. Several commenters, including Federal agencies involved in research on CFC-related substitutes, support this exemption. Amounts used in research are assumed to be the minimum necessary for reasonable scientific experimentation. For new chemicals, the provisions of 720.36 of the PMN rule (40 CFR part 720) are in effect.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

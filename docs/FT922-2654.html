			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / International Company News: HJ Heinz falls 6.6% after charges H. J. HEINZ, the Pittsburgh food group, yesterday turned in a 6.6 per cent decline in fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 145.7m from Dollars 156.1m in spite of a slight rise in sales. The fall reflects higher marketing costs and pre-tax restructuring charges of more than Dollars 50m. Earnings per share in the three months ended April 29 slipped 3.4 per cent to 56 cents from 58 cents on sales which improved 1.6 per cent to Dollars 1.87bn from Dollars 1.83bn. The company said the strength of the US dollar against foreign currencies depressed sales in the quarter by 2.1 per cent. This was offset by a 2.3 per cent improvement in volume in a number of brands including StarKist tuna, baby food and ketchup. Fourth-quarter operating income fell 16 per cent to Dollars 230.5m from Dollars 275.5m. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 5 per cent to Dollars 466.3m from Dollars 443.6m. For the full year, a pre-tax Dollars 221.5m gain on the sale of Heinz's Hubinger subsidiary helped the company post a 12.4 per cent rise in net income to Dollars 638.3m, or Dollars 2.40 a share, from Dollars 568m, or Dollars 2.13, a year earlier. Sales for the year slipped to Dollars 6.58bn from Dollars 4.65bn. Heinz attributed the decline to the divestitures of Hubinger and Caribbean Restaurants, another subsidiary. Volume was essentially flat in the year. Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman, said he was pleased that the results were on target with earlier predictions in spite of turbulent market conditions. 'The replacement of The Hubinger Company by JLFoods took the company out of a commodity business into a value-added food business with excellent growth prospects,' he added. 'The acquisition has performed ahead of expectations.' Heinz also announced the appointment of two new senior vice-presidents yesterday. Mr David Williams, 49, will be based at Heinz's world headquarters in Pittsburgh. Mr Williams is also the company's chief financial officer. Mr Luigi Ribolla, 55, will head Heinz's European operations from Milan. He replaces Mr Paul Corddry, 56, who is retiring after 28 years with the company.</p>

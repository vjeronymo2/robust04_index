			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DOMINIC J. SANCHINI, RETIRED ROCKWELL OFFICIAL  </P> <P> Dominic J. (Dom) Sanchini, a retired Rockwell Corp. vice president who helped  develop the main engines for the space shuttle orbiters, died Saturday at his  home in Thousand Oaks after a long battle with cancer. He was 63.  </P> <P> Sanchini, who was the second-ranking executive at Rockwell's Canoga Park-based  Rocketdyne division until 1986, headed Rockwell's effort to obtain the  government contract to build the shuttle orbiters' main engines, a company  spokesman said. The main engines are attached to the rear of the orbiters to  help guide the craft in space, and are separate from the booster rockets that  launch the shuttle into orbit.  </P> <P> Sanchini retired in August as vice president-major programs at Rockwell's El  Segundo headquarters. He had been employed by Rockwell for 37 years.  </P> <P> A native of Raritan, N. J., Sanchini served in the Navy from 1944 to 1947 and  earned a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering from Lehigh  University in 1951. He also earned a law degree in 1958 from USC and was a  member of the State Bar.  </P> <P> In 1970, Sanchini was named manager of Rockwell's effort to win the government  contract to build the main engines of the shuttle orbiter, then in the planning  stages.  </P> <P> In 1981, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded him its  highest honor for non-federal personnel, the Distinguished Public Service  Medal, for his contributions to the shuttle program. In 1983, Sanchini was  named executive vice president-production for the entire Rocketdyne division.  </P> <P> Sanchini was president of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons production plant in  Colorado from 1986 until last year, when Rockwell's contract with the  Department of Energy was terminated.  </P> <P> Sanchini is survived by his wife, Claire; two daughters and three  grandchildren.  </P> <P> A memorial service will be held at 1 p.m. Tuesday at St. Jude's Catholic Church  in Westlake Village. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be  made to charities.  </P></p>

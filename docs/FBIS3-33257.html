Sergio Caramagna, head CIAV-OAS official in charge of  delivering the 3-80 Northern Front's counterproposal, which  primarily consists of demands for the rearmed group's security  and the withdrawal of EPS forces in the conflict areas as  conditions for holding another meeting with the government  authorities.    A few days ago the government ordered the EPS to halt  operations -- a cease-fire -- as a sign of political willingness  to initiate talks with the 3-80 Northern Front. In addition,  the government's peace proposal explicitly stated that a  political negotiation with the rearmed group is unacceptable.    Despite the presence of EPS special troops in the Quebrada  Negra and El Mapa areas, 10 km northeast of El Rosario,  Commander Esteban, [Salvador Talavera Alaniz] second in command  of the 3-80 Northern Front, deemed "very positive" this first  encounter at the health center.    Nevertheless, "the EPS is setting up a military cordon that  endangers future talks," Esteban noted after reporting that this  is why Commander El Chacal [Jose Angel Talavera], the 3-80  Northern Front's main leader, was not present at the meeting,  which was attended by Commanders Piloto, Chele Gringo, and Musun.    Caramanga delivered to Esteban a letter from General  Humberto  Ortega addressed to El Chacal. The letter proposed to the 3-80  Northern Front an "earnest meeting" between this rebel group and  a broad sector of the government.    EPS delegates also participated in the meeting, sitting down  to talk to an armed group for the first time since the  demobilization of the Nicaraguan Resistance.    Esteban told LA PRENSA that Gen. Ortega's letter "was looked  upon favorably," and that El Chacal will respond with a personal  message in a few days.    Caramanga today will attempt to set up a new meeting with  the  3-80 Northern Front. Yesterday at El Rosario he said that the  CIAV-OAS had fulfilled its objective by delivering Gen. Ortega's  to the 3-80 Northern Front.    On the presence of EPS special troops, Caramagna said that  the CIAV-OAS was investigating to verify the activity of those  troops.    Caramagna did not want to go into detail about the demands  contained in the rebels' counterproposal.</p>

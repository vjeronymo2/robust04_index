			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: BAe in demand A clutch of broker's recommendations drove British Aerospace sharply forward by 22 to 409p in heavy trading of 8.2m shares. The advance placed BAe on the threshold of re-entry into the premier list of FT-SE 100 companies. The stock was also among the most heavily traded in the stock option sector with the equivalent of 1.7m shares dealt. Kleinwort Benson, SG Warburg and Smith New Court all reiterated their buy recommendations on the stock. Mr Chris Tarry at Kleinwort Benson said: 'The impending Paris Air Show will focus attention on the positive developments and the newfound confidence at the company,' a view echoed by rival brokers. The recent advance in the stock began with last week's announcement of the sale of BAe's corporate jets business at a price in excess of market forecasts. It gathered momentum with speculation earlier this week that BAe was likely to win an order for 200 Hawk aircraft with a value of up to Pounds 4bn. Further good news is expected at the Paris Air Show next week.</p>

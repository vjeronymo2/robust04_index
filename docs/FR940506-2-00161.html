			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Authorized at $6 billion for years 1992&hyph;1997, the CMAQ Program provides funds to States for transportation projects and programs that will contribute to attainment of an NAAQS. The Program focuses primarily on reductions in ozone precursors (hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen) and carbon monoxide emissions, but under certain conditions funds may be expended on projects to reduce small particulate matter (PM&hyph;10), as well. Typical projects include: development of HOV lanes, improvements to public transit facilities and equipment, traffic signalization and incident management improvements, bicycle and pedestrian projects, new ridesharing services, and establishment of vehicle inspection and maintenance programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA and the FTA, in consultation with the EPA, issued guidance providing eligibility criteria to govern CMAQ program expenditures on October 16, 1992. A series of questions and answers were also issued subsequent to the program guidance to address specific issues and eligibility questions as they have arisen. The program guidance was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 4, 1993 (58 FR 146) and, with the questions and answers, is available through the Federal Electronic Bulletin Board System (202&hyph;366&hyph;3764). In addition, a brochure, ``A Guide to the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program,'' was issued in January 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three apportionments have been made for fiscal years 1992&hyph;1994, making a total of $2.7 billion available for the States' use. In FY 1992, $340 million was obligated by all States which was 42 percent of the amount available. In FY 1993, $600 million was obligated for a rate of 62 percent. Overall, $940 million was obligated during the program's first two years for a cumulative rate of 53 percent. Unobligated funds under the CMAQ program lapse and are no longer available to the States after four years from the beginning of the fiscal year for which they were apportioned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> (II) Proposed Purpose and Scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with any new program, implementation of the CMAQ program has generated questions about new areas of eligibility, the purpose and effectiveness of funded projects and the coordination processes between transportation and air quality agencies at the Federal, State and local levels. Consequently, a review of CMAQ program implementation will be undertaken, as noted in the FHWA&hyph;FTA program guidance of October 16, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The review has two intended purposes: (1) To determine whether the CMAQ Program is meeting its goals under ISTEA and the CAA to support transportation measures intended to assist nonattainment areas to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, and (2) to identify how the CMAQ program's benefits can be maximized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (B) Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) To evaluate the kinds of projects funded under the CMAQ program, their emission reductions, cost-effectiveness, the length of time the funding process took, and other attributes, and to determine what was not funded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To determine what transportation control measures (TCMs) have been included in the States' Implementation Plans and whether funding sources have been identified for them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) To raise key issues, like the air quality impacts of various TCMs such as traffic flow improvements, possible obstacles to innovative projects, etc., and to evaluate those issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) To identify any barriers or constraints to effective program implementation, especially with respect to coordination processes between transportation and air quality agencies at the Federal, State and local levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) To identify, document and disseminate examples of well-thought-out projects, project development and coordination processes, and transportation/air quality analytical techniques for each of the transportation-related pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) To determine the effectiveness of current guidance, with an eye toward possible mid-course policy adjustments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Karaganov, doctor of history: "Ukraine </F> as an Apple of Discord"]    [Text] It is generally said that election results clarify  a new lineup of forces, pinpoint a new development vector, and  so forth. I suppose that the results of elections in Ukraine  will decide or clarify very little. Everything is clear as it  is.    Ukraine is in a state of half-decay. The information space  has been disrupted; industry is grinding to a halt;  transportation links are being scaled down: Fuel is too  expensive. Living standards are falling rapidly.  Disintegration has also begun to affect the armed forces. The  provinces are moving to a subsistence mode, isolating themselves  from Kiev politically. It would be little exaggeration to say  that Ukraine is held together only by the wish of the majority  of regional elites to preserve the attributes of statehood and  also by Russian natural gas supplies and Ostankino TV  programs....    We are observing many of these processes also in Russia.  There are two substantial differences, however. First, in  Ukraine the situation is exponentially worse. Second, and this  is the main thing, in Russia reform is under way and there are  forces ready to continue it. The question is only about the  pace and methods. In Ukraine, on the other hand, reforms have  practically never begun in the first place. Moreover, there are  no visible forces there yet capable of going through with them  in earnest.    I do not agree with the controversial memorandum by the U.S.  intelligence service or with those in Russia who predict social  chaos and collapse for Ukraine in the very near future. The  Ukrainians are just as patient and maybe even more kind-hearted  than their Russian brothers. Even so -- let me repeat -- I do  not think that these qualities will last us or them for more  than one and a half to two years.    Neither do I share the malice of some of the Russian  politicians who are gleefully rubbing their hands and waiting  for Ukraine to come crawling on its knees. Such malice is  amoral: The Ukrainians are our brothers, in trouble. Malice is  out of place also because the social and political  disintegration of Ukraine is a most serious threat to the  security of Russia and the people of Russia. The imminent  migration problem will aggravate, exacerbating unemployment, and  the increasing drug flow will grow even more. It is terrible to  think about the consequences of a loss of control over nuclear  power stations, nuclear weapons, and chemical production  facilities.    It is almost inevitable that Russia will have to start  pumping colossal resources into Ukraine like into a bottomless  pit. In this connection I would like to ask the advocates of  rapid unification: Do they understand that this will lead to a  sharp fall in living standards in Russia itself? Let these  well-fed politicians, speaking on behalf of the Russian people,  ask the Russians themselves: Do they want to donate half of  their earnings to unification? Especially in view of the fact  that the price of full unification even with parts of Ukraine  can be a social upheaval and collapse of Russia.    There is yet another danger: An anti-Russian mood is growing  in the West. There are not a few reasons for that: irritation  with our state of disarray and a wish to safeguard against it,  the fear of a revived Russian expansionism, and so forth.    If under these conditions Ukraine begins to fall apart, and  Russia will almost inevitably have to intervene in this process,  there will be cause for a new round of "cold war." Whereas the  first "cold war" was a tragedy, the second -- in the early  eighties -- had elements of a tragicomedy; the third, in all  likelihood, will be a farce: After all, there is no more  ideological confrontation, and almost no contradiction between  the fundamental interests of Russia and the West. Nonetheless,  it is clear that Russia, with its present weakness, will have to  pay a high price for it.    Is there a chance to avoid the worst-case scenario? I do  not know. It would be best if Russia and the West by joint  political efforts forced the Ukrainian leadership to undertake  reform in exchange for economic aid. Russia would obviously  gain from Ukraine's economic openness, and the West from its  political independence. Even if the West does not furnish mass  assistance, one should insist on a dialogue with it on Ukraine's  problems: at least to minimize possible damage.    Yet there is also another option: to prevent the  disintegration of Ukraine by demanding the removal of barriers  and participation in privatization programs and at the same time  promoting direct links with regions and cities. It is  beneficial politically: We establish ties with actual people  and actual interests. It is also beneficial economically:  Ukrainian goods are relatively cheap. It is beneficial from  the human point of view: We can help Ukraine survive in these  difficult years. Moreover, one could hope that people  articulating the real interests of Ukraine and the Ukrainians  will be coming to power in Kiev and at the local level. And  they, these interests, consist in ensuring the closest possible  union with Russia.    The abyss into which Ukraine's leadership has plunged it  will  never make it what Russia's foes hoped it would -- its strategic  counterbalance. The very best on which the advocates of  Ukrainian statehood can count is to preserve an independent but  in actual fact economically semidependent state. This is not  the worst possible option for Russia either. With such a  pattern of relations with Ukraine as well as with other CIS  states, we can emerge from the status of a milk cow into a state  relieved of the burdens of empire, but retaining many of the  benefits of its former geostrategic and geo-economic, so to  speak, position.    To achieve this (or any other desirable result), however, a  vigorous, concentrated policy is needed. Which, in my opinion,  does not exist.</p>

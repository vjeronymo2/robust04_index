			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FLA. JACKPOT AT $90 MILLION  </P> <P> Florida's weekly Lotto jackpot was raised to $90 million today as sales  continued at a pace that could send the game past the $100-million mark before  Saturday night's drawing.  </P> <P> Last Saturday there were no winning tickets in a $50-million lottery.  </P> <P> For the jackpot to reach $100 million, lottery officials calculate, the state  will have to sell $98 million in tickets this week. The record is $56 million  in sales in one week.  </P> <P> The national record for a lottery prize is $115 million, which was awarded in  Pennsylvania to 14 ticket-holders, some of them individuals and some groups.  </P> <P> But the U.S. record for the largest single lottery prize goes to Sheelah Ryan  of Winter Springs, Fla., who won a Lotto jackpot of $55.1 million in 1988.  </P></p>

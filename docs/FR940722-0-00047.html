			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded that during the course of coal exploration, roads may be temporarily altered to leave established easements or rights-of-way and that the proposed definition of ``road'' at proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6) includes those roads. North Dakota further stated that the ``surface'' used for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration are subject to regulation, whether those vehicles are traveling within established rights-of-way or outside of them. Based upon the State's explanation, the Director finds that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in its proposed definition of ``road'' is not inconsistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding the differences between the proposed definition of ``road'' in the coal exploration portions of the State program and the already-approved definition of ``road'' in the surface coal mining and reclamation operations portions of the State program (NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;01&hyph;02(92)). Specifically, the approved definition of ``road'' at NDAC 69&hyph;05.2&hyph;01&hyph;02(92), like the Federal counterpart definition, explicitly includes access and haulroads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in operations, including use by coal hauling vehicles to and from transfer, processing, or storage areas. Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), however, does not contain a similar list of various types of roads encompassed by the definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that the proposed definition of ``road'' at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6) includes all rights-of-way used in coal exploration and was not intended to include exhaustive examples of all types of roads. North Dakota also submitted a proposed revision to its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2). The revised regulation would include a new clause clarifying that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A road is altered if it is constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way that causes the changes described in this section. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal regulation defining ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 insofar as it concerns coal exploration, also includes ``[a]ccess and haul roads constructed, used, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in *&blank;*&blank;* coal exploration *&blank;*&blank;* .'' Thus, North Dakota's inclusion of the additional terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), when read in conjunction with the discussion above regarding the proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), effectively defines the term ``road'' to include all rights-of-way used in coal exploration as well as roads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way. The Director finds that North Dakota has clarified OSM's concerns with respect to North Dakota's interpretation of its proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6) to ensure that it is consistent with the interpretation of the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, the Director finds that proposed NDCC 38&hyph;12.1&hyph;03(6), defining the term ``road,'' and proposed NDAC 43&hyph;02&hyph;01&hyph;20.3(c)(2), that includes the additional clarifying terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations, are in accordance and consistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5. Accordingly, the Director is approving the proposed changes and is removing the required program amendment codified at 30 CFR 934.16(l). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "knysz" and "dom": "Perhaps Borowski? Belweder </F> Sends Up Some Trial Balloons"; passage following the subhead  attributed to "knysz" and "pw"]    [Text] As we discovered yesterday from a politician  running in Belweder circles, the president's camp is considering  the possibility of Marek Borowski becoming deputy prime minister  and finance minister for a second time.    By using the mass media, Lech Walesa wants to investigate  how  the coalition looks on the idea.    That is why Lech Falandysz, a minister in the President's  Office, said rather casually yesterday, during the "Breakfast  With Radio Zet" program: "Perhaps Borowski then?" "That is  very interesting," said a surprised Aleksander Kwasniewski, a  leader of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD].    "It is not nonsense," our source from the Belweder tried to  convince us yesterday. "Borowski was a good finance minister."    He also reminded us that the president already signed  Borowski's nomination once in the past, and without any  reservations. "So he can do it a second time," the source says.  According to him, the reason the president signed Borowski's  resignation so fast was that he thought Prime Minister Pawlak  had a good candidate for the post. "But now we know that is not  the case. So perhaps it could be Borowski after all?" This is  the way the Belweder politician spoke about it.    But he is also afraid that such a scenario would be a bitter  pill for the coalition to swallow. "It would have to admit that  it had let go of a competent minister too easily," the Belweder  source speculates. "They would also have to officially give up  Rosati's candidacy, and that is something they, for the moment  at least, find extremely difficult to come to terms with."    SLD Press Spokesman Zbigniew Siemiatkowski has said that the  suggestion constitutes a clear message from the Belweder, but  the SLD has yet to take a position on the issue. "At any rate,  the concerned person [Borowski] is in Japan at the moment," the  spokesman added.    It is also not known how Prime Minister Pawlak will respond  to the proposal. Not so long ago, cooperation between the prime  minister and a former deputy prime minister [Borowski] proved  impossible, which resulted in Borowski's resignation.    Labor Minister Leszek Miller regards the whole thing as a  joke by the Belweder: "It is indeed quite a perfidious kind of  message to send, given the rush with which Lech Walesa signed  Marek Borowski's resignation," Miller said.    According to other SLD politicians, the rush was very  strange. Some expert opinions compiled on the SLD's order say  that the president should not accept a resignation until he is  determined to sign the nomination of a new minister. The Small  Constitution provides that the president "makes changes" in  ministerial posts.    Leszek Miller says that the SLD has a reserve candidate and  that Borowski is not the one. "We will not reveal his name  until the nomination is agreed upon within the prime  minister-president-SLD triangle," Minister Miller adds.  <H5>  Where To Meet? </H5>   The Belweder is gradually abandoning the idea it put forward  on Thursday [7 April] that sessions of the National Defense  Committee [KOK] be the only site for meetings between the  president and the government chief.    "These are two separate issues," Presidential Spokesman  Andrzej Drzycimski explained to us yesterday. "The president  wants KOK sessions to be a permanent place for debates on  strategic issues by the country's most important people.  Spur-of-the-moment meetings with the prime minister are quite  another story."    Let us recall that Drzycimski said on Thursday that a  National Security Council (which has not yet been established)  or KOK sessions should be where the coalition consults the  president. The idea resulted in immediate protests by the  coalition politicians, who perceived a speedy establishment of  the council to be another precondition for talks with the head  of state.</p>

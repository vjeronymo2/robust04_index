Jiang Chunyun said: The provincial political and economic  situation and the social order of the province were good in the  past year. The overall situation of the province was stable.  However, at the time of fully affirming the security work  achievements and the good main stream of the social order, we  should face up to the existing problems and never lower our  guard against the grim situation of social order. We should  persist in the dialectical viewpoints of seeking truth from  facts and dividing one into two and comprehensively and  accurately analyze and judge the current situation of social  order.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Reform, development, and  stability are the main tasks at present and in the foreseeable  future. Reform is motivation. Development is a central link.  Stability is conditions. They are unified with and supplement  one another. The current tasks for reform and development are  extremely heavy, so do the tasks for stability. Thus, the  leading cadres at various levels, particularly the top and  second top leaders, should conscientiously implement the  regulations that all achievements would be negated when social  order is not good and conscientiously undertake the political  responsibility for safeguarding stability. To be concerned with  the political trends, we should study the work relating to  stability. We should pay attention to the work relating to  political and social stability just as what we have paid  attention to the economic work. We should grasp the security  work and the overall management of social order just as what we  have grasped the work regarding to reform and opening up,  consistently and firmly attend to the social stability work, and  ensure the peacefulness of the localities.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: The security work and the overall  management of social order must not be suspended but should only  be developed, and must not be weakened but should be  strengthened. We should exert great efforts to strengthen the  security work; and comprehensively promote the overall  management of social order. In line with the requirements for  safeguarding political and social stability, we should  strengthen the struggle of the concealed front in the political  sphere and deal blows to hostile forces. The economic front  should eliminate economic disputes and deal blows to economic  criminal activities. The social front should mediate the  disputes between the people and accurately handle the internal  contradictions between the people. The public security front  should sternly deal blows to criminal offenders, strengthen the  management of social order, and achieve the overall improvement  of social order. To ensure the overall improvement of social  order, we should persist in the principle of paying equal  attention to dealing blows to and guarding against criminal  activities and the principle of treating a disease by looking  into both its root cause and symptoms with the focus on  eliminating the root cause and comprehensively carry out the  principles of [words indistinct]. The organs especially in  charge of the work in this regard should persist in the mass  line and emphatically [words indistinct].    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The party and government leaders  at various levels should fully understand the importance and  urgency of strengthening the construction of the security front,  realistically regard it as a great matter, and conscientiously  attend to it. In regard to the issue of strengthening the  construction of the security worker contingents, we should first  strengthen the construction of the leading bodies of the  security departments. Only when the officers are strictly  disciplined will the police be sternly administered. We should  exert efforts to upgrade the political quality and professional  abilities of the cadres and policemen and to have each and every  comrade on the security front be competent for his jobs.    To strengthen the construction of the security front, we  should conscientiously implement the principle of sternly  administering the police. The units with serious problems  should be determined to conduct consolidation. The personnel  who are neither qualified nor suitable to work at the security  front should timely be readjusted. Criminals should sternly be  punished according to laws.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: Strengthening the party's leadership  over the security work is an important principle that the party  has consistently persisted in as well as a fundamental guarantee  for achieving the security work. In line with the requirements  of the central authorities and the province, the localities  should sign letters of responsibility with those at the next  lower levels. Through implementation of this measure, we should  have the principal leading comrades at various levels across the  province better take on the political responsibility for  guaranteeing the local peacefulness. In line with the principle  that whoever takes charge of the work should assume  responsibility for the fulfillment of the assigned tasks, all  localities and units should watch over their own doors and well  manage their own personnel. The principal responsible persons  of the localities with problems should be called to accounts.  We should realistically solve the real problems within the  security departments. The general principle governing the input  to the security departments is to take the economic development  [words indistinct].    Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor of the provincial government, also made a  speech at the conference.    Approaching from the angle of the government work, he set  forth specific opinions on how to strengthen the security work.    He said: The 1994 reform measures are more concentrated and  dynamic than those in the past 14 years. Therefore, the  security front is confronted with the extremely arduous tasks.  We would rather overestimate than underestimate the unstable  factors. That is, we must never on any account ignore the  unstable factors. The governments at various levels should  further strengthen the understanding about the importance of  safeguarding social stability, pay high attention to and support  the security work, and try every possible means to ensure the  allocation of the funds for the security work. We should  strengthen the construction of the security workers contingents  and cultivate a rank of security workers who have good ideas and  work style, be faithful to the party and the people, and [words  indistinct]; whom the party and the government trust and the  people love; and who have combat effectiveness so as to ensure  that the construction of the spiritual and material  civilizations will continuously rank the province among the best  in the whole country.    Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, chaired the conference.</p>

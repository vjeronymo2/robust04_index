			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Chief job likely to head Kodak agenda THE search for a new chief executive is expected to top the agenda today when the board of Eastman Kodak, the US photographic products group, holds a regular meeting, writes Martin Dickson. Kodak has been looking for a new leader since August, when it announced that Mr Kay Whitmore, the chairman, would be stepping down at the board's request. Names touted on Wall Street include Mr John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer; Mr Richard Braddock, a Kodak non-executive board member who is chief executive of Medco Containment Services; and Mr Phillip Samper, a former Kodak executive who left the company three years ago after losing out to Mr Whitmore for the chairman's job.</p>

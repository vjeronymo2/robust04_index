			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> GIRL SCOUT COUNCIL TO GET NEW CENTER  </P> <P> A spacious new program center for the Girl Scout Council of Orange County will  be built on the site of a structure that was burned beyond use in a fire a year  and a half ago.  </P> <P> Last week, city and scouting officials joined in the groundbreaking for the new  structure, which will provide meeting and event space for area troops.  </P> <P> "We are finding it more and more difficult to find a place to meet," said Diane  Smith, publicity director for the Girl Scout Council. "As sorry as we are that  the building burned down, it gives us an opportunity to redo it with conference  rooms and space we really need."  </P> <P> Smith estimates there are about 22,000 Girl Scouts in the county, and about  seven troops -- or just more than 100 girls -- will be able to use the new  facility and remaining swimming pool for meetings and programs.  </P> <P> Since the building was destroyed in June, 1989, there has been no North County  facility for the organization. Construction of the new 4,000-square-foot  building on Broadway in Anaheim is under way, and is expected to take six  months to complete. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

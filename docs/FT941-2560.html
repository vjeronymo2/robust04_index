			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Beautiful Swiss wines to yodel about - 'Come downstairs and I'll show you my concentrator.' / Uncovering the secrets of some fine wines made in minute quantities If you go to the trouble of tracking down a bevy of beautiful wines made in minute quantities with impeccable fastidiousness in a building that looks like a Swiss cowshed, you expect an exclusive story. But the longer I spent with Daniel Gantenbein, the more I realised I was treading in the footsteps of wine luminaries by the score. Paul Draper, master winemaker of California's Ridge Vineyards, had apparently visited Daniel in this corner of eastern Switzerland last summer. The pair communicated in Italian, familiar to Daniel from his holidays in Piedmont (he rents a small vineyard to Elio Altare). Gantenbein wines may be difficult to track down, even in Zurich, a few miles to the north-west, but they can be found on the list at Piedmont's famous Da Guido restaurant, as well as in the more notable local restaurants, and those immediately north in Liechtenstein. They may also try to export to the US. When I raved about the quality of his Riesling-Sylvaner 1992, I was told that that was the wine of which Ernst Loosen, whizzkid of the Mosel, had ordered a case. And in Daniel's personal wine cellar, hollowed out of the slate underpinning his native village of Flasch, were all the names one would wish for oneself: Bordeaux's great names, Ponsot 1990 red burgundies, a tranche of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, Guigal, Ridge, and a gaggle of bottles from the Mosel's Grosse Ring aristocracy. Daniel is the only producer of the Grosse Ring's own raw material in his area. 'For me Riesling, with Chardonnay, is the white grape variety.' This small wine region in eastern, German-speaking Switzerland is the vinous heart of Graubunden canton, the Herrschaft, which produces predominantly simple, sweetish Blauburgunder (the Pinot Noir of Burgundy, of which the Mariafeld clone is widely revered here) together with Alsace's white grape varieties, Muller-Thurgau and Completer, an eye-watering local curiosity. The local market (truly local; the wines are almost unknown in French-speaking Switzerland) sustains relatively high prices here. Vines are planted amid pasture and all sorts of crops, but viticulture is the most profitable agricultural activity in this dramatically beautiful corner of Switzerland, through which thousands of skiers hurtle each weekend en route for Klosters and Davos. The twinkling, energetic Daniel was, until relatively recently a mechanic, and is still a meticulous craftsman, whether in winemaking or restoring his ancient farmhouse. After his wife, Martha, had qualified in viticulture, he studied wine-making, both at the local wine school in Wadenswil and nosing around producers he admires. Since 1980 they have farmed a just-manageable total of four hectares (10 acres) of vines, on well-exposed slopes below a vertiginous cliff face that leads the way to the Vorarlberg. The land is dissected by narrow open lanes, a tractor wide. Why are Gantenbein wines such a discernible cut above the rest? There is his infatuation with, and exposure to, the fine wines of the world (last year he and some friends had organised a wine tasting which culminated in an 1899 Montrachet). There is also his practical determination to get things right, bottling, for example, much later than most. The Herrschaft is currently in the grip of barrique worship, not always to the benefit of the resulting wines. Daniel has filled every corner of his winery with top quality French oak casks, but he experimented before deciding that double-sized barriques give the right wood-to-fruit ratio for his grapes. And then there are, of course, the grapes, and, perhaps most importantly, the low yields encouraged by Martha in the vineyard, much lower than the Swiss norm. Gantenbein Blauburgunder tastes like serious red wine with a future, the product of a minimal intervention winemaking policy. It is not surprising that it commands a 50 per cent premium on the going rate for the region of SFr12 (Pounds 5.60) per bottle. But the much rarer white wines are possibly even more distinguished. Daniel's Weissburgunder 1990 was picked with a potential alcohol level of 13 per cent and was fermented cool and long - 'just long enough to make people angry'. It is probably the best Pinot Blanc I have yet tasted. Perhaps it is inevitable that Daniel makes a Chardonnay (SFr25 a bottle) but so does the rest of the world. But no one else I know makes a rich, red wine like the mystery he produced at the end of my tasting in his house. It was very dark and dramatically concentrated, with lovely spicy fruit. Because we had been discussing the new concentrators that are being employed in Bordeaux to make claret more intense, I half-seriously suggested that this was the product of a concentrator. His eyes lit up. 'Come downstairs and I'll show you my concentrator,' he smiled, scampering down a dark staircase to a whitewashed chamber, windows open to the village street. Here were stacked wooden fruit boxes full of Pinot Noir grapes drying and sweetening, in imitation of the Italian passito technique used to produce Recioto and Amarone. This extraordinary hybrid of a wine sells at auction for more than SFr200 a half bottle, which must go some way towards subsidising the Ponsots resting quietly next door.</p>

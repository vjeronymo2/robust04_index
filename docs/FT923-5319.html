			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Labour council tackles Nalgo A LABOUR-led council has for the first time acted against a trade union under Conservative employment laws. The public sector union, Nalgo, was yesterday ordered by a High Court judge to call off a month-long strike involving 1,100 council staff in the London borough of Newham. Mrs Justice Ebsworth granted Newham Council an injunction against the union. The strike followed a ballot at the end of July over compulsory redundancies in the authority's poll tax collection department. Nalgo will appeal today. The judgment is the first to apply Section 7 (3) of the Employment Act 1990 in testing what a union may do in the days preceding a ballot. The judge said it was 'clearly arguable' that the union had promoted the strike call before the ballot and was therefore in breach of union legislation. The act says there must be no call for action or authorisation of such action before the ballot. Counsel for Newham said that before the ballot of the council's Nalgo members, in which about 63 per cent voted for the indefinite stoppage, the union's executive had authorised the escalation of a strike over compulsory redundancies at the council's benefits and housing section. The judge ruled, however, that there was a genuine trade dispute in progress.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Labour party cuts membership fee THE LABOUR party is to cut its annual membership fee next year from Pounds 18 to Pounds 15. Members of affiliated trade unions will have to pay only a further Pounds 3 beyond the unions' 'political levy' to join the party in their own right. The move was decided at yesterday's meeting of Labour's national executive committee.</p>

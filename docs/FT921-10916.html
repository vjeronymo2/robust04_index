			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Berlusconi unveils La Cinq plan MR SILVIO Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate, yesterday unveiled a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 270m) rescue plan for La Cinq, the floundering French television station in which he is one of the largest share-holders. The deadline for rescue bids for La Cinq, which earlier this year filed for bank-ruptcy, closed at 6pm yesterday. Mr Berlusconi presented his proposals to Mr Hubert Lafont, the station's administrator, during the afternoon. Mr Lafont is believed to have received at least one, and possibly two, other bids. He is expected tomorrow to announce if any of the proposals have been accepted. Without a rescuer, La Cinq will close. Mr Berlusconi said he had already identified enough investors to produce the FFr1.5bn needed for his recapitalisation plan. It is not yet known whether the other existing investors in La Cinq - which include Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, the Hersant press group, and Kleinwort Benson, the British bank - will participate. Hachette, the French media group which ran La Cinq until its collapse, is still studying the proposals. Mr Berlusconi said Fininvest, the company through which he owns his La Cinq shares, would participate fully by pumping in enough money to retain its existing holding of 25 per cent - the maximum permitted under French broadcasting law - after the recapitalisation. He refused to elaborate on his plans to solve La Cinq's financial problems - it lost an estimated FFr1.12bn in 1991 - or on his programming policy. Canal Plus, the French pay-TV channel, mustered an estimated 15 per cent increase in net profits, to FFr1.05bn, for 1991, on turnover which rose by just under 15 per cent to FFr7.03bn.</p>

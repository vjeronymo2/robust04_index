			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / International Company News: Shares slide as Digital Equipment disappoints Shares in Digital Equipment fell sharply yesterday when the troubled US computer manufacturer reported a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 72.1m - far worse than Wall Street had expected - and a 12 per cent drop in operating revenues. The red ink, which worked through at 53 cents a share, was little changed from the loss of Dollars 73.8m, or 57 cents a share, reported in the same period of last year. Analysts had been looking for earnings close to break-even. Digital's shares closed at Dollars 32 3/4 , down Dollars 3 5/8 , on the New York Stock Exchange. Digital, like International Business Machines, has been struggling to come to grips with fundamental changes in the computer market. These have shifted demand away from its mini-computers to networks of much cheaper personal computers, and workstations, using 'open systems' rather than proprietary software. Mr Robert Palmer, chief executive since July 1992, is overseeing a restructuring programme which has had mixed results: a return to profits in the three months to last June, followed by worse-than-expected losses in each of the last two quarters. Mr Palmer, expressing dissatisfaction with last quarter's revenues and loss, said Digital continued to work to lower its costs, stabilise and then improve revenues. 'It took several years for the company to get into this situation, and it is taking some time for us to restore profitability and growth,' he said. The revenue decline was attributed mainly to a continued drop in demand for the company's larger VAX computer systems. The company said its personal computer business continued to double in units, year-over-year, and showed strong double-digit revenue growth. The results were hit by unfavourable foreign currency movements, weakness in the European and US economies, and a decline in product margins, due to a shift in the mix of sales to products with lower profits, such as personal computers. For the six months to January 1, Digital reported a net loss of Dollars 155.3m, or Dollars 1.15 a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 334.4m, or Dollars 2.60 a share, last time.

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Donors to draw up plan for aid to CIS WESTERN aid donors and senior officials from the independent states of the former Soviet Union will seek to draw up a structured approach to technical and other assistance during a conference in Lisbon this weekend. The ministerial meeting, organised by the European Community, is a follow-up to the US-organised donors conference held in Washington last January to co-ordinate emergency humanitarian aid. Since the original meeting aid worth another Dollars 9bn has been added to the Dollars 77bn then pledged by over 50 donor countries. Over 70 per cent of the total aid and credit commitment has come from EC countries, with the biggest share from Germany. Since the original meeting the Group of Seven industrial countries, together with the International Monetary Fund and other institutions, has put together a Dollars 24bn aid package for Russia, including a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund and all the former Soviet states have become members of the International monetary Fund and the World Bank. In Washington, donors agreed to set up working groups to co-ordinate technical assistance and provide practical assistance in key areas such as energy, agriculture, health and housing. Priority areas for assistance include help to make safe Soviet-designed nuclear power stations throughout the region. The conference will be an opportunity for the smaller republics in particular to make a pitch for long-term assistance needed to help them re-adjust to life without the subsidies of the former Soviet structure. The atmosphere for this first formal dialogue between former Cold War enemies in their new roles as donors and aid recipients is expected to be further lightened by the signature of a Strategic Arms Reduction (Start) protocol by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, and foreign ministers from the four CIS nuclear states  - Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Sri Lankan business fears poll upset Sri Lankan businessmen are bracing themselves for the possible defeat in next week's general election of the ruling United National party which has governed the country for 17 years. They fear victory next Tuesday for the left-leaning opposition People's Alliance, an eight-party coalition, could bring political and economic uncertainty. 'Uppermost in the minds of most Sri Lankans in this election will undoubtedly be the maintenance of political stability,' says the current issue of the Sri Lanka Exporter, a pro-government business magazine. The opposition parties have given public assurances that they would not abandon the pro-market economic reforms carried out by the UNP over the past three years. Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunge, the opposition leader, has called for 'structural adjustment with a human face'. But businessmen fear her allies, which include the Communist party, will demand more radical shifts in economic policy. Shares on the Colombo Stock Exchange fell sharply earlier this year when Mrs Kumaratunge began attracting huge crowds at rallies. But it has since stabilised. The political uncertainty began in March with the ruling party's defeat in March in provincial polls - the UNP's first electoral setback in 17 years. Mr DB Wijetunga, who succeeded the assassinated president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, last May, tried to win back support with a string of populist financial hand-outs, including tax cuts and food-stamps for schoolchildren. But he failed to take the steam out of the opposition, especially the centrist Sri Lanka Freedom party, headed by Mrs Kumaratunge, the daughter of Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, the former prime minister. The general election was not due to be held until next year, after a presidential poll in November, but Mr Wijetunga has called an early general election in the belief that the UNP will do better in a party-based contest than in a head-to-head presidential battle between himself and Mrs Kumaratunge. The UNP in its campaign is reminding voters that, under Mrs Bandaranaike's leftist government, the pre-UNP 1970s were for Sri Lanka 'an era of ration cards, queues, quotas and shortages'. Mrs Kumaratunge, herself a generation younger than Mr Wijetunga, appeals to voters who are too young to remember the 1970s and who believe that 17 years in power is long enough for any party. Mrs Kumaratunge is also trying to exploit the fact that even though Sri Lanka has successfully opened its economy to international trade and investment, unemployment (standing at 12.6 per cent) and inflation (running at an annual rate of 11.4 per cent) remain persistent problems.</p>

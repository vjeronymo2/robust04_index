			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Scorsese the celluloid crusader - Nigel Andrews asks the director why he has exchanged blood and bullets for Merchant-Ivory finery When people heard that Martin Scorsese was to film Edith Wharton's novel The Age Of Innocence (opening in Britain next week), it was open day for the jokesters. 'Raging bull in a china shop]' cracked some. 'Genteelfellas]' quipped others. We live in a world where directors are typecast as much as film stars: so what was a man famed for spraying audiences with blood and bullets doing making a film for the James Ivory school of fin-de-siecle finery? Scorsese fans have long claimed him as the most inventive and visceral director in modern America: the man who in films like Mean Streets and Taxi Driver turned film grammar on its head and showed that cogent storytelling could go hand-in-hand with dazzling stylistic adventurism. Scorsese in person is a small, manic, dapper man with machine-gun speech patterns. Ask him why he was drawn to Wharton's turn-of-the-century tale of high society and best behaviour - of hearts never allowed to show they are broken - and he quickly shoots holes in the stereotyped image of himself. 'There are different types of film I'm interested in making, and they're not necessarily the kind I made in the 1970s. It's twenty years since I made Mean Streets] Age Of Innocence came out of a reflective period in my life, when I wanted to make a 'romantic' film. At the same time I wanted to find a modern way to tell a period story.' Modern - but let no one rush off to the movie expecting 'F'-words or Robert De Niro crashing through the French windows waving an automatic. By modern Scorsese means - well, what he has always meant. 'You don't just film the material. You re-interpret every scene through the lens. Where do you want the audience to look? How do you begin a sequence? At what point? 'In a scene where Daniel Day-Lewis (as hero Newland Archer) is talking to his lawyer, we start with a gigantic close-up of a cigar being clipped and then puffed on. Then we have a wide angle of the room in which the camera comes flying to an over-the-shoulder shot; then . . .' And so forth. You have to see the disruption of costume-movie camera etiquette in The Age Of Innocence to believe it - and to believe that it can work. But with Scorsese the camera has always been a St Vitus presence. The place where he did change his habits for the new film was in the dialogue and performances. 'What fascinates me about the time Wharton wrote about, that period of New York high society, is that people edited their thoughts before they spoke. In Raging Bull or Mean Streets or even Alice Doesn't Live Here Any More there's no such editing. People come right out with their thoughts, often to the detriment of the person who said it - 'I didn't mean that, I meant this]' With Wharton's people every word is carefully chosen. There's this intensity of restraint.' Hence the casting call to British actors to fill out Wharton's tale of a rich, emotionally repressed New Yorker (Daniel Day-Lewis) whose friends and family (Alec McCowen, Miriam Margolyes, Richard E. Grant . . .) look on aghast as he falls for a divorced Polish countess, played by the film's almost lone American Michelle Pfeiffer. But The Age Of Innocence seems less un-Scorsese-ish a project the more one ponders it. The way people express or fail to express their feelings - in an arc all the way from the cataracts of street gab of De Niro's Johnny Boy in Mean Streets to the lumbering inarticulacy of De Niro again in Raging Bull - is the heart of his cinema. These heroes, or anti-heroes, use words as fists and fists as words. They grow up in a big city milieu where survival requires the interchangeable use of mental wit and physical weaponry. Scorsese to this day does not see his reputation-making film Taxi Driver - a 'vision of Hell' according to some critics - as anything but a realistic picture of New York City. 'All the images seen through the De Niro character's eyes, you could say, yes, they add up to one of the nine circles of Hell. Or to Purgatory. There's a religious element there. 'I'm God's lonely man' Travis (De Niro) says, and Paul Schrader (the scriptwriter) based his script on Dostoevsky's Notes From Underground. 'But for me, I made the film because I knew how this man felt. You have these feelings of exasperation, of helplessness, in a city like New York. Everybody's wrong, nobody's right] Everybody's right, nobody's wrong] There are the racial problems and the injustices . . . it's a city caving in, eating itself up. How do you survive? How do you stop killing yourself and taking people with you?' It is a world Scorsese himself grew up in, and for years he floundered with his own crisis of response and identity. As a teenager he wanted to go into the church, but found that he kept going into cinemas instead. 'It was a refuge, in a way, a dream. Or a 'dream state'. It was a place to go and rest and explore your own emotions through other stories and other characters. It was a catharsis for me, like moving paintings.' And paintings keep coming up during conversation. He gave up the altar to move into the arts; but what kind of artist would he have been if born before the age of cinema? 'A painter.' And why does he find so much inspiration still in old churches? 'Because frescoes were an early form of cinema. You know, 'Here is the resurrection, over there is Hell.' And people would criticise it like a movie. 'Oh it's much too gory, too violent] We don't need that sort of thing in a church]'' As for the longest answer he gives me during our whole conversation, that too is about painting: his search to find the right pictures for people's houses in The Age Of Innocence. It led him, in a pilgrimage towards dramatic truth, all the way from period accuracy - consulting the New York Historical Society to find out what artworks the real-life prototypes for Wharton's characters actually owned - to a sophisticated cinematic symbol-patterning. One example is the character whose staircase is lined with paintings by the Hudson Valley artists. 'I thought that up with the designer Dante Ferretti. As you go up the stairs, you're taking a trip up the Hudson Valley, finally ending on a scalping, which puts everything else in perspective about polite American society at that time]' For Scorsese violence is the subtext of life - or American life - however much the social or cultural surface may camouflage it. He experienced that hidden violence himself three years ago, when good manners in the Bible Belt buckled like an earth tremor over his film The Last Temptation Of Christ. 'I was very surprised,' he says, 'at the level of emotion and confused information that response to the film brought about. In France they burned theatres; in America I had death threats. I knew there'd be controversy, but I hoped that out of that, religious concepts would be discussed intelligently around the world. Not just Christianity but other religions. I think more films should be made in the West about Islam; so people get to understand the lifestyle of Arabs, ancient and modern. It would help to dispel the fears of an isolated country like America.' Scorsese's evangelistic view of movies does not stop here. Indeed it does not stop anywhere. One senses a crusading or religious spirit informing nearly all his perspectives on cinema. Asked what happened to the impulses he once planned to put into the priesthood, he does not hesitate to say they went into his films. 'If you have a gift, the actual working out of that gift is a form of prayer. It's a religious act.' And asked what special power cinema has beyond other arts, he has a missionary answer. 'Imagery is such a powerful thing. I was lecturing on film preservation around the time when the Holocaust exhibition opened in Washington. And all week they'd been showing documentaries of the period, and I said 'Imagine if all this film hadn't been preserved]' In a funny way, you can read all the books you want, but to see one photographic or moving image of what happened  -the famous shot of the Nazi with the riding crop under the chin of the old woman, forcing her to look up - that alone says so much to future generations. That's what the power of film is.'</p>

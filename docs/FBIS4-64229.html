			<p>BFN     [Text] Nuremberg (DPA) -- A Republikaner rally in  Nuremberg's inner city on Saturday [30 April] took place without  the feared clashes. The election campaign rally of the  right-wing extremist party, which was accompanied by massive  protest campaigns, was concluded at noon after about two hours.  Police temporarily arrested about 60 persons, who are supposed  to be released in the course of the day after their identity has  been checked. About 200 demonstrators against the Republikaner  formed a demonstration column through Nuremberg's inner city  after the Republikaner rally.    As a result of the superiority, in terms of numbers, of the  counter-demonstrators, the party's speakers could hardly be  heard. However, according to policy, nothing happened apart from  the throwing of a few eggs. The rally, which had been banned by  the city of Nuremberg by referring to potential riots was  permitted by the Bavarian Administrative Court on Friday after  all. Before the rally almost 40 organizations had announced  that they would stage protests and interference.</p>

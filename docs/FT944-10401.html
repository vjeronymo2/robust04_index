			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: US poll boost for drugs Leading pharmaceuticals companies dominated the business in London as traders reacted enthusiastically to the political changes in the US and the consequent jump in the dollar. The Republican victories were perceived to have removed the threat to pricing and profits posed by the Clinton health care reforms. There was a rush of London buying and some dealers suggested that one heavy-hitting US mutual fund was also piling into the sector via the anonymity of the inter-dealer broker (IDB system). However, analysts commented that the political moves were unlikely to have much impact on an industry which had already been forced to change. Managed care groups, which provide health care to around 55m Americans, have discovered their buying power over the past few years and forced prices down. Mr Paul Krikler of US investment bank Goldman Sachs said: 'It is clear that the political changes have given a sentiment boost to the sector but, for the longer term, we would focus on the changes already in the market place.' SmithKline Beecham was the most heavily traded stock in the market with combined turnover in the 'A' shares and Units hitting 18m. The 'A's rose 12 1/2 to 421 1/2 p and the Units 11 to 382p. Glaxo jumped 19 1/2 to 617p on turnover of 15m shares, although 4m of those represented one side of a tax-related deal. Fisons, up 5 at 121p and continuing to attract bid speculation, saw 8.7m shares dealt in the underlying market and was the most heavily traded stock option on the Liffe. Wellcome rose 20 to 664p and Zeneca 14 to 871p.</p>

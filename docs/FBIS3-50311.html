They are  suspected of having committed the crime of incitement against a  community which is punishable by Par. 269 (1) of the Penal Code."    The impeachment followed a Tuesday rally, at which the  party,  registered with the Budapest Metropolitan Court in October 1993,  defined itself as successor to the Hungarian fascist Arrow Cross  party and its leader, Ferenc Szalasi, who was executed in 1946  for crimes against humanity. The participants in the rally  denied that the holocaust had ever taken place.    As reported earlier, in Thursday's NEPSZABADSAG, government  spokeswoman Judit Juhasz said that the Tuesday rally had  violated constitutional order. She added that the government  found the activity of the party unacceptable.</p>

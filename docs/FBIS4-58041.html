			<p>BFN     [Article by Chief Editor Salah al-Mukhtar: "The Success  and Failure of U.S. Plans in Light of the Leader's Speech"]    [Text] Some might not be aware of the consequences of  promoting confused political views ostensibly grounded in common  sense, but which when subjected to a thorough and serious  examination, turn out to be serious attempts at deception. An  example of this is the argument promoted in various parts of the  world that world events are determined by the decisions of  superpowers, which cannot be conquered by medium-sized and small  powers. Consequently, these humble powers eventually succumb.  This argument is promoted particularly by West-educated  individuals, and among quarters that maintain cultural and  political ties with the West.    This argument gained wide circulation in the aftermath of  the  the collapse of East Europe and the disintegration of the former  Soviet Union. The aim has been to prove that U.S. decisions  always triumph, and that whatever the United States wants, the  United States gets. It is ironic that this argument is being  promoted in this age of decadence by intellectuals and thinkers  who in the past depicted themselves as advocates of liberation  and progress. These people are promoting this argument under  the guise of having to demonstrate "rationality, realism, and  in-depth knowledge." Nonetheless, it has to be remembered that  these very individuals are well aware in their heart of hearts  that a thorough analysis of the current state of affairs would  point to the opposite of what they are promoting.    Given all this, and to dispel any delusions that might be  harbored here or there, we must pose a specific and direct  question, particularly since we are now in the final chapter of  the embargo. This question is as follows: Is it true that U.S.  plans and decisions are fail proof, and that peoples have to  succumb to U.S. hegemony? Well, we will not answer this  question by way of theoretical exposition and analysis. Rather,  we will address the international situations in which the United  States made the crucial decision and went to war to vindicate  that decision.    For example, in World War II, the war was not settled by a  U.S. decision. Indeed, the Soviet Red Army played the crucial  role in defeating Germany. Concerning the European and U.S.  contribution to the war effort in World War II, it comes next to  the Soviet Red Army's contributions. It has to be recalled that  the United States got involved in the war only in the aftermath  of the Pearl Harbor incident.    Similarly, in the early 50's, the United States went to war  on the Korean peninsula to prevent liberation forces there from  reaching power. However, the result was that the United States  was defeated, and the Korean revolutionaries established a base  in the north, which is now called the DPRK, one that has  remained very much alive.    Additionally, the United States experienced abysmal defeat  when it attempted to knock off the Cuban revolution. This  failure is still a hard fact although Cuba is only 90 miles from  Miami Beach. It is to be recalled that the Castro-led Cuban  liberation revolution triumphed 33 years ago. As for Fidel  Castro, he has remained a nationalist and socialist hero. He is  persisting in the fight against U.S. colonialism. This U.S.  defeat acquires greater significance when we realize that the  United States has a huge military base on Cuban territory.    When France fled Vietnam after the Dien Bien Phu battle, the  United States thought that it was in a better position than  France to dominate the Vietnamese. This prompted it to embroil  itself in the Vietnamese mire for several years. Consequently,  it lost 50,000 American lives, and many times this number in  wounded and handicapped Army personnel. The Vietnam war brought  about early recession to the U.S. economy. It is true that the  United States was not defeated in a crucial military battle in  Vietnam, as was the case with France. However, it suffered a  strategic defeat when it lost the will to fight. That is why  its military command fled Vietnam from the rooftop of the U.S.  Embassy in Saigon in a most disgraceful and cowardly act. The  U.S. military command left 1 million South Vietnamese troops to  face their destiny there. Hence, the Vietnam complex that  surfaced in the United States.    What happened in Vietnam also happened in Laos, Cambodia,  and Latin America, where nationalist revolutionaries achieved  victory by force of arms, although they are in the "back yard"  of America. In our homeland, the region has never seen a  colonialist force that is more cowardly than America. The  demolition of the Marines' headquarters in Lebanon and the  killing of more than 200 soldiers showed the fragility of the  U.S. decision. After Ronald Reagan's fiery and strong decisions  to invade Lebanon and to destroy it, the decision was changed  and the Marines withdrew in a humiliating way.    In Africa, America and its agents were defeated in Zimbabwe  -- formerly Rhodesia -- Ethiopia, and elsewhere. In the Arab  homeland, there was also the 17-30 July Revolution in 1968,  which made great changes despite America and its continuous  conspiracies.    These examples prove, without any doubt, that America did  not  achieved any strategic victory until the late eighties. In  fact, it sustained strategic defeats wherever it interfered.  Its decisions were defeated. The "Vietnam complex" was  aggravated in a way that encouraged the American public to exert  pressures to resort to the policy of isolation.    However, some might wonder and say: The collapse of East  Europe, the disintegration of the USSR, and the nineties all  indicate that America has achieved victory. This question is  immaterial. One of the facts revealed in 1993, which were mere  conclusions in 1992, shows that the collapse of the USSR was due  to two essential factors: The first factor is the corrupt  social-economic system and its party tool, which was the factor  that contributed the most to the collapse, because it paved the  way for the emergence of the second factor: The internal  treason represented by the decision of Michail Gorbachev and his  clique to premeditatedly partition the USSR, as Yanayev, who was  Gorbachev's deputy, said.    Here, we can say that the only big strategic victory scored  by America was not military, but an intelligence victory by  which America succeeded in winning over Gorbachev and turning  him into an ideological agent who destroyed the USSR and paved  the way for Soviet intelligence to destroy Communism in East  Europe.    The categorical evidence of the soundness of what we are  saying is the current situation. Apart from America's victory  in the field of intelligence, what is left is a series of  defeats that resulted in the downfall of Bush and a change in  the comprehensive global strategy. America tried to deceive the  world by propagating the prevalence of the American era,  leadership, and model of life. It embodied this ideologically  by presenting Fukiyama's theory of the end of history.  Following all this, America began to face serious challenges  beginning with the severe Iraqi blow in the Mother of Battles  which exposed America's shames and weakness as noted by leader  President Saddam Husayn in his address on 17 April 1994.    Iraq fought, remained steadfast, and triumphed over the most  brutal and most serious military campaign in history, in which  the weapons of the 21st Century, prepared to destroy the Soviet  Union, were used against it. This is despite the fact that all  U.S. officials and writers affirmed that the Saddam Husayn  regime would end within a month. However, years have passed and  Iraq's strength has been doubled and become historic, thereby  forcing U.S. intelligence to admit there is no hope of changing  the Iraqi regime.    The mere survival of Saddam Husayn's Iraq in the face of the  barbaric and fascist onslaught is a great strategic victory that  has shaken the pillars of the evil empire led by Bush. As a  result of Iraq's victory and heroic steadfastness, Russia woke  up from America's morphine and began its struggle against its  hegemony. We are now witnessing Russia's swift return to the  scene of world events in defiance of America, which decided to  divide Russia as it divided the Soviet Union. America, however,  failed in dividing Russia.    Somalia, the small starving state, forced America to  withdraw  with humiliation. This showed once again that it is ready to  withdraw and change stands under the first signs of pressure.    In Haiti, the regime the United States wanted to replace is  still steadfast and is still challenging the United States.  Egypt and Saudi Arabia, which the United States wanted to  dominate the region in cooperation with the Zionist entity, have  become fragile entities on the verge of collapse, especially  Egypt, which is being stormed by an armed national revolution  that is hostile to the United States and Zionism.    In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the republics of the former Soviet  Union, and eastern Europe the situation is plagued with  unprecedented confusion. This has led to the return of  socialists and nationalist forces to their leading role in the  society. Even the United States' closest ally, Japan, has begun  to rebel against paternal U.S. hegemony. Japan strongly said no  to the United States. The European Union is also working  seriously to achieve its independence.    In Asia, the Chinese giant is waking up to teach the United  States lessons in international politics and to keep the United  States from imposing its hegemony over the Korean peninsula and  Chinese decision making. China has stopped bowing to the U.S.  tempest. The most obvious picture of U.S. failure is the  disintegration of the anti-Iraq front at the Security Council  and the United Nations, as well as the emergence of big powers  and other powers demanding an end to the blockade on Iraq in  spite of the United States.    In light of these defeats and this public U.S. failure  throughout the world, the United States can no longer repeat  Bush's silly talk that the world has become stable, that  conflicts have ended, and that peace has prevailed as a result  of U.S. dominance. A new theory emerged called the conflict of  cultures by American Professor Samuel Huntington [name as  published] to replace the theory that is called the end of  history in the U.S. black house. According to this theory, the  world is a dangerous jungle full of wars and ethnic, cultural,  and religious mines. The reasons for wars and clashes have  become cultural rather than ideological or economic.    This theory prevails in the Bill Clinton era just as  Fukiyama's theory prevailed in the Bush era. This clearly shows  the failure of the planned global strategy, as well as the U.S.  failure to dominate the world.    Therefore, leader President Saddam Husayn's conversation  with  the commanders who liberated al-Faw is an ingenious and sound  analysis of one of the world's most important issues pertaining  to the blockade imposed on Iraq. Contrary to what is being  spread by the U.S propaganda machine -- that breaking or  maintaining the blockade should be purely an American decision  and that the other states, including Iraq, cannot affect that  decision -- we say breaking the blockade will be an Iraqi  decision that will be implemented, thanks to the Iraqi people's  will and steadfastness and to President Saddam Husayn's  leadership. Just as it was defeated in Vietnam and other places  and failed in the nineties to invest in the unique opportunity  following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States  will be defeated in the battle of the blockade.    Wellbeing is coming, wellbeing is coming not because the  evil  ones intend to lift the evil, but because we know that the fist  that seizes the sword by its blade will be forced to ease the  grip when the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully.  When the owner of the sword pulls the sword forcefully, the  adversary will find himself compelled to release his grip on the  sword or risk losing his fingers. In either case, he will have  to release the sword. In this ingenious talk, the leader  defines the future of the blockade. The United States will be  compelled to retreat, cancel all its threats and decisions, and  bow in respect to the Iraq of the martyrs and Saddam Husayn,  whose slap to the face of George Bush awoke the world.    The United States is burdened with the factors of collapse.  Month after month, it becomes weaker and weaker. The price it  will pay for its crimes against Iraq will double. Our people,  who achieved the impossible and foiled U.S. decisions during the  Iranian aggression on Iraq, will be able to cut off the fingers  of the United States, which is now seizing Iraq's sword by the  blade. The Iraqi people will adopt decisive decisions and will  push history against the current the United States wants.</p>

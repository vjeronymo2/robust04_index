			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Sharp rise seen in long-term mortgage arrears THE NUMBER of homeowners more than six months in arrears with their mortgage payments has risen sharply to 290,000, according to a survey published today by Roof magazine. Roof is published by Shelter, the housing pressure group. The survey shows that while the level of short-term mortgage debt fell in the year to the end of March, the number of cases over six months in arrears leapt by 38 per cent. Steps taken recently to reduce the number of repossessions are partly responsible for the growth in arrears over six months, according to the researcher who carried out the survey, Ms Janet Ford of Warwick University. Until these moves, lenders began repossession proceedings when arrears exceeded six months. Cases which avoid repossession will increasingly show up in the long-term arrears figures. Ms Ford suggests, however, that lenders may put renewed pressure on borrowers if the housing market revives. At present it does not suit them to evict borrowers who have agreed to make regular payments, because their properties would probably have to be sold at a loss. But once it looks possible for lenders to recover debts more quickly by repossession, some mortgage customers with serious arrears could find themselves losing their homes. The Roof survey provides evidence that short-term arrears have started to decline. The number of loans two months in arrears has dropped 22 per cent, with a 10 per cent drop in three to five month arrears. This drop reflects falling interest rates and house prices which have reduced the number of loans getting into trouble, according to Ms Ford. These 'have helped recent buyers to establish and maintain a more manageable balance between income and housing costs, lessening the risk of over-committing themselves', she says. However some of the drop in short-term arrears reflects borrowers moving into longer-term arrears, she added. Overall, the figures show a slight decline in the number of arrears of two months or more, which still affect one in 13 of the 9.8m outstanding loans for home purchase in the UK. The survey reports that provision for bad debt rose rapidly in 1991, threatening the viability of some lenders. Building societies, for example, must put up new capital equivalent to 10 per cent of arrears. Societies say this obligation is not onerous in practice. Most have already made provision against loans six months in arrears and say that their capital is ample for the levels of business they are doing with the housing market still subdued.</p>

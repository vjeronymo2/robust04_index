According to Prime Minister Klaus, the  document carries a decision on immediate preparation for a  further step toward the liberalization of bilateral trade. This  step should result in an agreement on a free-trade zone between  the Czech Republic and Israel in the very near future.    At the same time, the Czech Republic and Israel have  succeeded in concluding the two-year long discussion on the text  of the bilateral agreement on the protection of investment and  on profit repatriation. At a news conference, Prime Minister  Klaus returned to the possibility of Czech arms exports to the  so-called sensitive countries. He repeated that arms exports  were carried out on the basis of a government license and in  line with the law.</p>

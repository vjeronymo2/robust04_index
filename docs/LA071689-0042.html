			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'CASTLE' CONCERNS  </P> <P> I have just read Art Sandford's "King of Castle Frets Royally Over Remodeling"  (June 11), and I find that the ignorance that many people possess regarding  sensitive remodeling of an older home is not limited to those who are simply  sold a bill of goods by an insensitive or greedy contractor.  </P> <P> I looked at the photo of the Sandford's charming Fillmore home and mentally  compared it to my own 81-year-old home in Highland Park, which happens to be a  Los Angeles City Historic Cultural Monument.  </P> <P> While I have no problems with the Sandford's desire for more living space and  certain modern conveniences, such as a shower and central air conditioning, I  do find fault with the idea of changing the design and character of this house  with stucco and new (most probably aluminum) windows. A second-story addition  on this particular house is another item that has to be looked at very carfully  as to what it will do to the overall feel and architectural integrity of this  home.  </P> <P> The idea we are looking at now is to dig out the basement area and replace the  brick foundation with a modern one covered with a brick veneer to match the  original. This will give us three additional rooms and a third bathroom, as  well as bringing the house up to modern seismic standards, which is a very  important factor in Southern California. I hope that the Sandfords might be  willing to consider this option.  </P> <P> There is also the possibility of adding on to the back of the house, if there  is room to do so, but any addition should be designed to go with the rest of  the house, as in shingle siding and wooden windows.  </P> <P> CHARLES J.

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMELESSNESS OF TRADITIONAL U.S. FURNITURE  </P> <P> The nation's attic -- The Smithsonian Institution -- and antiques stores and  museums around the world inspired many of the designs at the fall furniture  market in High Point, N.C.  </P> <P> At a difficult time for the furniture industry, when business is spotty and  several of the country's top department stores are on the sale block,  manufacturers chose to emphasize traditional pieces that bear a well-known  designer's name or recall another era.  </P> <P> The contemporary styles in wood are warm rather than stark, often embellished  with inlays or a painted surface. In place of shiny chrome, softer bronze and  pewter finishes characterize metal pieces. Rather than glass, natural and faux  unpolished stone materials are used.  </P> <P> Sofas and chairs are clearly made for lounging. Both contemporary and  traditional upholstered pieces are overstuffed and oversized with sausage-like  arms, and they are slathered with deep cushions and extra throw pillows.  </P> <P> The American love affair with a romanticized representation of our past  continues unabated. New American country pieces that borrow from the past but  don't reproduce it were among the most popular at the market.  </P> <P> Copies of styles from the last three centuries of English and American design  are a close second. French themes and neoclassical styles such as Biedermeier  are minor themes.  </P> <P> Indicative of the pragmatic nature of design today, two of the major new  furniture groups combine several English periods (Century and Drexel.) Another  is "contemporary with many references to the past" in designer Charles  Pfister's words (Baker). The Lexington group "combines French, English and  Italian influences in every piece," according to designer Lynn Hollyn.  </P> <P> Henredon copied about 35 antiques from the plantations for its licensed  Historic Natchez (Miss.) Foundation Collection. This group, like Lynn Hollyn's,  includes a variety of coordinating fabrics and accessories.  </P> <P> The new furniture is, above all, designed to go with what most people already  own. Manufacturers have finally learned that the majority of consumers buy  furniture a piece at a time. So there's less stress on large "suites" meant to  furnish an entire room.  </P> <P> A new cedar chest by Lane is a good example of this trend. The chest, decorated  with a silk-screen version of a mid-19th-Century primitive painting, is part of  the 200-piece America Collection licensed by the Museum of American Folk Art.  Yet it is interesting enough to stand on its own.  </P> <P> Another example is the Turkish chair introduced by Century. The opulently  upholstered overstuffed chair, a close copy of the original owned by the  Smithsonian, looks as if it came from a banker's parlor. It's also an example  of the trend toward reproducing 19th-Century rather than 18th-Century antiques.  </P> <P> Those not up to buying even one new piece can update a room with accents in  faux leopard skin. Mark Hampton selected leopard for an entire room display of  his collection for Hickory Chair Co. to which several new pieces were added.  But the fabric showed up as an accent in pillows or chair covers in virtually  every stylish showroom from Drexel to Thayer Coggin. An oversize, fully  upholstered ottoman was another common accent piece.  </P> <P> Upholstery fabrics moved in two main color directions: Jewel-like emerald,  brilliant blue, red and eggplant, and clear bright florals in sunny yellow and  blue or other flower-like colors used with white.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ma.S.: "Trust Toward Establishments and </F> Organizations; Radio In the Lead"; table not included]    [Text] As far as establishments and organizations are  concerned, public radio is enjoying the greatest trust. In  rating support, the government is only slightly ahead of the  Sejm, and trust in the president is the most unsteady.  Evaluations of three of the 15 establishments examined by the  Center for Research on Public Opinion [OBOP] are worse than the  evaluation of the president: "Solidarity '80," "Self-Defense,"  and private banks.    For the first time, the ranking of trust has included public  radio as an independent establishment (before that the  television and the radio were treated as one). Right at the  beginning, it gained a considerable advantage over other  "competitors." A comparison of opinion polls conducted between  May 1993 and May 1994 shows that support for television is the  most stable and at the same time very high.    Between March and May, there was a decrease in trust toward  all establishments, with the exception of public television.  The drop was not great--about 2 or 3 percent--with two  exceptions: Support for the Independent Self-Governing Trade  Union "Solidarity" plummeted by 8 percent, and support for the  government fell by 7 percent. It is worth recalling that, in  April, we witnessed the strongest wave of strikes in recent  times. Thus, both sides lost as a result of this conflict.    Nevertheless, the president is the record holder as far as  the greatest trust decrease is concerned. Within four months,  trust in him went down by 12 percent. The greatest supporters  of Lech Walesa are the inhabitants of rural areas and the  largest towns and cities, believers and churchgoers, and those  who declare that their views are rightist or center rightist.  There are no great differences resulting from age.    In the course of one year, most noticeable is the increase  in  trust toward the Sejm, and, only to a slightly smaller degree,  in trust toward the government. The Sejm, where the coalition  of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party is  in a definite majority, is trusted more than twice as much as  its predecessor.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The OBOP poll was carried out between 10 and 27 May on a  1,107-person sample.</p>

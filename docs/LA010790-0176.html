			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> END LIBYA SANCTIONS, ARAB LEAGUE ASKS U.S.  </P> <P> The Arab League called on the United States on Saturday to lift sanctions  against Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi's government.  </P> <P> It said the restrictions are damaging Arab-American relations.  </P> <P> President Bush notified Congress on Thursday that he would be extending the  existing sanctions for another year, saying Libya continues to support  terrorism.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Tunis-based Arab League said the U.S. perpetuation of the  sanctions "is all the more regrettable because efforts are under way to  substitute an era of peace and security for the tensions known in the Middle  East."  </P></p>

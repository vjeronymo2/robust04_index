			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major undeterred by Maastricht row MR JOHN MAJOR last night underlined his determination to prevent the uncertainty over the Maastricht accord from derailing British plans to place the future enlargement of the Community at the centre of its EC presidency. In talks in Downing Street with Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, Mr Major said he wanted next week's Lisbon summit to give a clear signal that the EC was ready to accelerate negotiations on the entry of the Efta countries. Mr Major plans to use the British presidency to lay the groundwork for enlargement negotiations with Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria in the first half of next year. Assuming that the result today of the Irish referendum on Maastricht is positive, the British prime minister also wants the summit to give the go-ahead for work to more closely define the responsibilities of the Community. Spelling out the implications of the 'subsidiarity' provision is seen as a key element in any deal to allow Denmark a second referendum which might endorse the treaties on political and monetary union. During the British presidency, Mr Major would like to effectively shelve Commission president Jacques Delors' proposals for a large increase in the Community's resources. But despite the clear rejection by EC finance ministers of any increase on the scale recommended by the Commission president, British officials believe that Spain will lead a group of southern countries determined to keep the issue on the agenda. So Mr Major will be looking for a declaration from the 12 leaders signalling that the EC must respect the same budgetary constraints as national governments. In the Commons yesterday Mr Major repeated his insistence that Britain would not be holding a referendum. He said such a vote would fall outside Britain's traditions of parliamentary sovereignty. The cabinet deferred its formal decision to endorse Mr Delors' appointment for another two years. Ministers will now approve the re-appointment just a few hours before Mr Major flies to Lisbon on Thursday evening. The government last night gave its strongest warning yet of how damaging a German decision to leave the Pounds 20bn European Fighter Aircraft project would be for Germany's credibility with its European partners. Winding up a short Lords debate on EFA, Viscount Cranborne, junior defence minister, warned that if Germany withdrew it would be 'very difficult' for its European partners to 'look Chancellor Kohl, his successors or ministers in the eye and say: 'We believe you when you tell us that you are good Europeans.''</p>

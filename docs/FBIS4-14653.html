			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Chisinau April 1 TASS -- The Moldovan Parliament  suspended today a government resolution on certification of  knowledge of the state language due to begin on April 2.    This was done in response to numerous appeals of labor  collectives, who believe that conditions for language studies  were not created in some places, Parliament Vice-Speaker Nikolay  Andronik told ITAR-TASS here today. A parliamentary commission  has been set up to analyze the situation. Collectives who feel  themselves ready for certification can start it tomorrow.    The certification postponement was initiated by the Moldovan  Parliament faction of the Socialist Party and the Unity  International Movement, who think that "the lack of language  knowledge on the part of the Russian-speaking population is  often used to remove people from their posts, especially the  high ones". In the opinion of specialists, one cannot be forced  to study a language.    The Christian-Democratic Popular Front, which stands for  unification with Romania, and the Bloc of Intellectuals and  Farmers did not support the postponement and refused to send  their delegates to the parliamentary commission.</p>

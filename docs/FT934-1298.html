			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Arts: Perfectly suitable for children - Theatre There is much talk presently about educational theatre. Someone said to me at the weekend that the reason why Adrian Noble's new production of Macbeth at the Barbican is so slow is that it is unduly influenced by educational techniques: you have to play every line as if no member of the audience has ever heard it before. And I read in another newspaper that current production of Bertholt Brecht's Mother Courage at the Cottlesloe should never have been included in the Royal National Theatre's educational programme because it is unsuitable for children, although - to be fair - the same critic thought the play was also unsuitable for adults. My own reservations are different and are prompted by watching The Fantastical Legend of Dr Faust at the Shaw Theatre in London last week. This is an adaptation by Michael Bogdanov, artistic director of the English Shakespeare Company, of the famous Faust story. It is described as 'theatre for 8-14-year-olds'. The production will tour the UK in the new year before going to the Middle East. There is nothing particularly wrong with it. Indeed, the huge puppets in the show, designed by James Barton, are rather attractive. What I can't understand is why Faust needs to be rewritten for children. There is nothing in at least the Christopher Marlowe version of Faust that the young are incapable of following, and many elements in Marlowe that are a great deal better than anything devised by Bogdanov: the verse, for example. For no explicable reason, the ESC has changed Marlowe's lines into rhyming couplets. As for the seven deadly sins, they were played just as well and quite as suitably for children, in Marlowe's Dr Faustus at the Greenwich Theatre last month. It is as though Bogdanov is teaching the children to believe in Father Christmas in order to learn that the best is still to come. ***** Sam Wanamaker, who died at the weekend at the age of 74, almost literally gave his life to Shakespeare. An American actor who came to England in the early 1950s, partly to get away from the McCarthy ethos, he dedicated himself to founding a new Globe Theatre based on the original, as close as possible to the initial site. Not everyone was kind to him: local authorities, official arts bodies and the English theatre establishment could have given him more encouragement. Yet Wanamaker pressed on. A wonderful German production of The Merry Wives of Windsor was performed on the foundations of his new Globe early this year. In a year or so the edifice should be complete. It should bear his name: for Wanamaker realised what many English do not - the pull of Shakespeare, and the old Globe Theatre, around the world.</p>

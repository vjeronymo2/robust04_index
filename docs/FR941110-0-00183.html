			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of all remedies is to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents against inadequate care and to motivate providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to promptly comply with the participation requirements so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they may continue to provide quality services. Sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h) and 1919(h) of the Act specify that the State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA may impose multiple sanctions to achieve these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes. Limiting the authority of the Secretary and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State, as suggested by this comment, would reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability of the Secretary and the State to tailor remedies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fit each unique situation of noncompliance, particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those situations in which multiple remedies are warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If HCFA or the State chooses to impose a remedy, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures set forth in &sect;&sect;488.404 and 488.408 of this rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are followed to determine the most appropriate remedy or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 488.432&blank;When Penalty Is Collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters questioned the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of &sect;488.230(b) which stated that HCFA will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the State may not impose a civil money penalty while the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility has a hearing pending on the imposition of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy. A few commenters recommended that the word ``impose''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be changed to ``collect'' at &sect;488.230(b). Commenters wanted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more information about:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;When a fine begins;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether a fine is assessed for the days between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey date and the hearing date, or only for days after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing date;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Whether there is a conflict between &sect;488.230(b) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.230(i) of the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters' recommendations included:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Stop the assessment of civil money penalties on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date that a formal hearing is requested. If the appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcome upholds the remedy then the civil money penalty is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed retroactive to the date that the appeal was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Permit the States and HCFA to impose but not collect a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty during the pendency of any hearing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty would accumulate during the appeal until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency is corrected or the appeal is decided; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Do not stop the clock from running on a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty while the appeal is pending, as this can insulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliant facilities against the imposition of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are revising redesignated &sect;488.432 to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more specific and discuss when penalties are collected. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> say that, when a facility requests a hearing on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance which led to the imposition of the civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty, HCFA or the State will not initiate collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the penalty until a final administrative decision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rendered which upholds the determination of noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a facility does not request a hearing within the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period for requesting a hearing, collection of the penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will begin when the facility achieves substantial compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or is terminated. If a facility waives its right to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing in writing within 60 days of the date of the notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of intent to impose the penalty, collection is initiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the facility achieves substantial compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation requirements or is terminated. This section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now references &sect;488.440, which discusses the accrual of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty and computation and notice of the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due, and &sect;488.442, which discusses when payments for civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties are due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter stated the proposed regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not permit the survey agency to impose a remedy for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second deficiency found as a result of a complaint survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until a pending hearing on a deficiency cited from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous survey is concluded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This regulatory provision does not compromise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability of the Secretary or the State to impose another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy if one is warranted for a second situation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance before a final administrative decision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded on the first situation of noncompliance which has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> led to the pending imposition of a civil money penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if a civil money penalty is the preferred remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the second instance of noncompliance, as it was for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first, it will not be collected until the final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative decision supporting its imposition is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded. In this case, the State or HCFA could increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the civil money penalty amount if the noncompliance found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later creates a situation of immediate jeopardy. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second situation of noncompliance results from repeated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, HCFA or the State would increase the civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty. However, the noncompliance found at a later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time may warrant a remedy other than a civil money penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which could be imposed before there is a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative decision on the first situation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

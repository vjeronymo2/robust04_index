			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BISHOPS BACK SMALLER FARMS, ADOPTION OF BLACK RITES  </P> <P> In separate actions unanimously adopted Wednesday, the nation's Roman Catholic  bishops declared that U.S. agricultural land should be owned by as many small  farmers as possible and that black worship styles should be incorporated into  more Catholic parishes.  </P> <P> The 300 members of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, who will  conclude their four-day fall meeting here today, also overwhelmingly approved a  controversial plan to allow lay men and women to conduct Sunday religious  services in remote areas when priests are unavailable.  </P> <P> In their statement on farms, the bishops said the growing concentration of  agricultural land in the hands of a few corporations had produced "a farm  crisis" and threatened the livelihoods of thousands of U.S. farmers who have  lost their land in recent years.  </P> <P> "We need to return the means of production to the greatest number of people  possible," Bishop Thomas J. Connolly of Baker, Ore., said during discussion of  the 32-page policy paper.  </P> <P> Anticipating the U.S. Congress' plan to draft a comprehensive statement on  agricultural policy next year, the bishops said such a plan should include  "food security as the ultimate goal . . . ensuring that every human being has  access to enough food to maintain a decent human standard of living."  </P> <P> The bishops' farm statement also asks the federal government to restructure tax  and commodity programs to favor small-farm owners, and it urged less dependence  on commercial fertilizers and pesticides that pose risks to farm workers and  the environment.  </P> <P> The bishops' plan to evangelize and guide the nation's 2 million black  Catholics affirms the "rich, cultural dimension" of African-American identity,  heritage and leadership.  </P> <P> At the same time, the document, "Here I Am, Send Me," notes that black church  leaders must daily confront "issues of injustice, institutional racism,  economic oppression, and human exploitation and waste."  </P> <P> Although he pointed out that the action paper had been in preparation for two  years, Auxiliary Bishop John Ricard of Baltimore said "it would be foolish to  deny that Father (George) Stallings was a catalyst" for the bishops'  enthusiastic response to the plan Wednesday.  </P> <P> Last summer, Stallings, a maverick black priest, formed an independent temple  in Washington, D.C., drawing several thousand black Catholics to his  unauthorized weekly services. He has charged that the church hierarchy is  unresponsive to the needs of black Catholics and has accused the church of  "institutional racism."  </P> <P> Stallings was not present at the bishops' meeting here nor was he or his church  a part of conference business.  </P> <P> The measure that will allow nuns and lay church members to conduct Sunday  worship services in the absence of a priest or deacon drew sharp debate. Some  bishops said they were fearful that it would be misinterpreted as giving the  laity permission to celebrate Mass without a priest's being present.  </P> <P> The rites will allow lay persons to lead prayers, preach and distribute  Communion wafers only if a priest has consecrated them beforehand. Consecration  of the host is a sacramental act reserved for priests to perform and it is the  essence of the Catholic Mass.  </P> <P> Although "priestless" Sunday services already occur in 51 dioceses with severe  clergy shortages -- mostly in Alaska, Wyoming, Texas and Utah -- the new rites  would standardize the procedures and prayers for the celebrations, according to  Bishop Joseph P. Delaney of Ft. Worth, chairman of the Committee on Liturgy.  </P> <P> "We keep insisting, however, that the celebration of the Eucharist (Mass) in  every parish every Sunday is our desire," Delaney said at a news conference  before the 225-18 vote favoring the plan was announced.  </P> <P> But retired Bishop William McManus of Ft. Wayne, Ind., was still unhappy. The  new rite, he said, "will bless a monster that could destroy the Sunday Mass  tradition and Sunday Mass obligation" of U.S. Catholics.  </P></p>

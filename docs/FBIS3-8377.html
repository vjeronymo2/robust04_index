			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 8 (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia will not allow the arrival of permanent missions  of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)  in its territory until it is readmitted as a full member of this  organization because this country refuses to be an object which  will only carry out decisions which it has not made, the  Yugoslav Minister for Human Rights and Rights of Minorities,  Margit Savovic, said on Tuesday.    She, however, underscored that this stand does not mean that  certain missions will not be allowed to come, but only on  condition that they announce they are arriving in Yugoslavia,  and not in Kosovo (Serbia's southern province), Vojvodina  (Serbia's northern province) or the Raska region (southeast  region in Serbia, Turkish name Sandzak).    Savovic said that there had been attempts that the  activities  of permanent missions be carried out by the representatives of  several embassies in Yugoslavia, who had even submitted reports  about their findings. They were, however, warned that this is  out of the question.    Yugoslavia also cannot accept the proposal by a Swedish  independent foundation that U.N. civilian rule be imposed in  Kosovo due to the alleged human rights violations in this  Serbian province, because this represents an attempt to  internationalize the situation in Kosovo and impose a U.N.  protectorate in Yugoslavia, the minister said.    The same or similar reasons exist for refusing a permanent  UNESCO representative in Kosovo to help organize the situation  in the province's education system, because this is an internal  affair which should be resolved through talks rather than  internationalization, Savovic said.    For decades the Albanian separatists in Kosovo have been  trying to secede this province from Serbia, i.e. Yugoslavia, and  annex it to neighbouring Albania. The Albanian separatists are  also using classical terrorist tactics of attacking the police  and army.    A letter by the Islamic Organization Conference to the U.N.  Security Council about the violation of the human rights of the  allegedly indigenous 'Bosnian Moslem' population in Raska  (Sandzak), also represents interference in Yugoslavia's internal  affairs together with a statement by Moslem leader Alija  Izetbegovic that the so-called 'Moslem national council of  Sandzak' should be included in the talks on the resolution of  the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, Savovic said.    Raska is a region divided between Montenegro, Serbia and the  ex- Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is mainly  populated by Moslems. Extremist Moslem leaders are persistently  trying to annex this region to the Bosnian Moslem territories.  Throughout the entire war in Bosnia, the Raska Moslems have  supplied the Bosnian Moslems with weapons and manpower.    The Yugoslav human rights minister said that the Yugoslav  government would write to the U.N. Human Rights Commission to  deny a draft resolution by this commission, as well as 84  letters to this international body, about the alleged human  rights violations and ethnic cleansing in Vojvodina and southern  Baranja.    Hungarians are the biggest ethnic majority in the Vojvodina  province and they enjoy the same rights as all Yugoslav citizens.    Asked about the work of the international war crimes  tribunal  in The Hague, Savovic said that this court would be more  acceptable if it had a universal character, and did not deal  solely with war crimes committed in the territory of the former  Yugoslavia.    Savovic said that lists consisting mainly of Serb names are  being compiled for the Hague court and underscored that  Yugoslavia will not extradite its citizens because this is  prohibited by its constitution. All war criminals will be tried  in Yugoslav courts according to Yugoslav laws.</p>

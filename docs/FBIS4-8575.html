			<p>BFN     [Text] Gdansk, April 13 -- The Solidarity Trade Union  National Commission "recognizes as unsatisfactory the reply of  the Cabinet to union's demands, meant to halt further  impoverishment of Polish families in 1994," reads a resolution  adopted in Gdansk on Wednesday.    The resolution stressed that "pressure on the Cabinet is  still indispensable" and recommended the Union Strike  Headquarters to outline a scenario for further activities,  preparing the union to the possible "mass protest action."    Solidarity Leader Marian Krzaklewski told journalists that  the battle can last for months.    Spokesman for the National Commission Piotr Zak explained  that the collection of money for a strike fund and preparations  for at least a several-day long protest are the basic task  facing the union at present.    The government does not care about strikes in plants that  are  anyway on the verge of bankruptcy, he said. He warned that "one  does not need many people to paralyse the life in the country."  He also announced that other forms of protest, namely  demonstrations, pickets in front of the office of the Council of  Ministers and the Parliament and distribution of leaflets, would  be carried out.    The National Commission made amendments to rules governing  the supervisory board of Solidarity Economic Fund and adopted a  schedule for union training. It also resolved that the sixth  national congress of Solidarity delegates would be held in  Mielec, Rzeszow Province, between June 30 and July 2.    The national Commission also examined the main points of a  draft constitution worked out by the Constitutional commission  of the union.</p>

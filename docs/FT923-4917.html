			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Canada rules on partners' benefits Ontario's Human Rights Commission has ruled that homosexuals are entitled to their live-in partners' pension and insurance benefits in the same way as spouses in a heterosexual marriage, writes Bernard Simon from Toronto. The landmark ruling is expected to increase pressure on employers in Canada to give equal access to spousal benefits for homosexuals, possibly leading to increased costs for company-financed pension, insurance and health plans.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Markets: Whatever you do, don't say b**r in public - Wall Street Asked on national news on Wednesday what was wrong with the stock market, the investment analyst smirked at the camera and said: 'It's a four-letter word that begins with a 'b' and ends with an 'r', and we're not allowed to say it in public.' Wall Street may not want to talk about it, but traders and investors are having to confront the possibility that the stock market is in serious trouble. As of midday on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen almost 300 points, or 7.5 per cent, since the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates for the second time on March 22. Over the same period, the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index had dropped 27 points, or six per cent. By midday Thursday, the Dow was trading more than 10 per cent below its all-time high of 3,978.36, which was achieved only as recently as January 31. The most recent declines have come against the background of a disturbing deterioration in investor sentiment - an indefinable, incalculable, but extremely important ingredient in the market mix. While there have been plenty of diversions to unsettle investors lately - new revelations in the Whitewater affair and fresh political unrest in Mexico, Korea, the Middle East and South Africa - no one piece of news has prompted the big sell-off. Some fingers have pointed to the Fed's monetary policy-tightening 10 days ago, but a quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates to the still low level of 3.5 per cent hardly warranted the big decline in share prices seen since the Fed's move. The fact that the heavy selling cannot be blamed on a single news event worries analysts, because the gloom that has descended on investors lately is the sort that cannot easily be lifted. Moreover, the downward spiral in prices is not easily halted. The further prices fall, the more depressed investors become, and the more likely they are to decide to sell stocks so they can put their funds into the relative safety of cash instruments. Two big Wall Street brokerage houses, Smith Barney Shearson and Dean Witter Reynolds, recommended doing just that this week, when they advised clients to lower stock holdings in their portfolios to 50 per cent and raise their cash holdings accordingly. Ultimately, if there is a single factor behind the sharp declines and weakening sentiment it is increasing long-term interest rates. Since hitting a low of just under 5.8 per cent last October, long-term rates, as measured by the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond, have risen to 7.15 per cent. That surge in rates has been driven by growing concern about inflation among bond investors, who believe that although inflation remains low now, the acceleration in economic activity seen since the latter half of last year will push inflation to much higher levels before 1994 ends. Whether these fears are justified or not (and a strong case can be made that, because of productivity improvements and a global disinflationary trend, the US inflation rate, currently at 3 per cent, will remain low over the long-term in spite of the strengthening economy), the impact of rising interest rates on investor sentiment has been profound. The impressive gains in stock prices between 1990 and 1993 were primarily caused by falling interest rates, which persuaded millions of individual investors to take their money out of short-term cash assets, such as certificates of deposit and money market assets, and put it into equities. Share prices, on an upward path throughout that period, only served to encourage further the flow of funds into the stock market. Now that interest rates are rising, and share prices are falling, individual investors are starting to think twice about whether the stock market is the best place for their money. Yet, the latest figures show that while the flow of money into stock mutual funds is slowing from last year's high levels, more money is still going into the stock market via funds than is leaving. This suggests that investors, while rattled by the rise in interest rates, are still keeping faith with the stock market. How long that faith holds, is the big question. So where does the market go from here? No one, of course, really knows, but there are essentially three views. Either, stocks are nearing the end of a 10 per cent 'correction'. Or, they are in the middle of a 15 per cent 'correction'. Or (and this is the bit that Wall Street does not want to think about), share prices are at the start of a long-term b**r market.  --------------------------------------------- Monday        3676.35    -    12.38 Tuesday       3699.02    -    63.33 Wednesday     3626.75    -    72.27 Thursday      3635.96    +     9.21 Friday         Closed  ---------------------------------------------</p>

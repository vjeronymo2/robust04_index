			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEAN TIMES FOR FOREIGN MOVIES  </P> <P> Since Filmex's demise in 1985, (foreign film) pickings have been mighty slim.  </P> <P> My colleagues and I intend to correct this ridiculous state of affairs with the  establishment of the American Cinematheque. Until mid-1993, when we're  scheduled to open the doors of our permanent home, it appears that our weekend  events and the UCLA Archive programs will make up the mainstream of  foreign-language film programming.  </P> <P> Later this year we will be presenting 16 films by the great Japanese masters as  part of the Los Angeles Festival.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, I thank Benson for raising this problem. It is certainly an outrage  that our nation's second city is so culturally deprived due to lackadaisical  distributors.  </P> <P> GARY ESSERT  </P> <P> Artistic director, American  </P> <P> Cinematheque, Hollywood  </P></p>

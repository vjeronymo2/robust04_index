			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their governmental functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites comments on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> 2.

(2) Do the regulations contain technical terms or other wording that interferes with their clarity? (3) Does the format of the regulations (grouping and order of sections, use of headings, paragraphing, etc.) aid or reduce their clarity? Would the regulations be easier to understand if they were divided into more (but shorter) sections? (A ``section'' is preceded by the symbol ``&sect;'' and a numbered heading; for example, &sect;350.3 What regulations apply to these programs?) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (4) Is the description of the regulations in the ``Supplementary Information'' section of this preamble helpful in understanding the regulations? How could this description be more helpful in making regulations easier to understand? (5) What else could the Department do to make the regulations easier to understand?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of any comments that concern how the Department could make these proposed regulations easier to understand should be sent to Stanley M.

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: A time to look ahead and assess the benefits of recession - Now that signs of an industrial recovery in the UK are showing through, Andrew Baxter takes a last look at the FT Six Relief that the UK recession is more or less over and that activity is picking up at a modest pace has been the message accompanying improved results from manufacturers over the past few weeks. That relief is shared by the six engineering companies the FT has been tracking out of the recession since 1992. But this last report in an occasional series demonstrates that the upturn in the UK is not the only thing for which they are thankful. The broad conclusion to emerge from this series is that the six companies have come through the recession in reasonably good shape, albeit somewhat slimmer. An article in tomorrow's FT Ingenuity survey, for example, shows that product development programmes have been maintained and even, occasionally, extended throughout the past three years. Top executives from the six companies met recently for the first time to review progress and reflect on the broader issues relating to manufacturing in the UK. As they look back on three tough years of trading, punctuated by inevitable job cuts in their UK manufacturing operations, several are counting the benefits of having international sales that far exceed their UK business. In 1991 and 1992, it was business in continental Europe that helped offset the gloom at home. But as Germany plunged into recession, dragging the rest of con-tinental Europe with it, many of the FT Six have been looking to the US market to lift their fortunes. More recently, the UK has been picking up too. Bloxwich Engineering At Bloxwich Engineering, which makes vehicle parts and other products, sales to the car industry have picked up, says Mr Peter Burton, chief executive. Overall, he thinks the company's UK business is 'coming on gently,' and points out that its forging business, which covers a broad spectrum of markets, has seen slightly increased demand. Senior Engineering Mr John Bell, chief executive at Senior Engineering, the specialist tubing, ductwork and boilers group, agrees that 'coming on gently' is exactly the right expression to use for conditions in the UK market, with sales to some industries going very well and others not seeing any improve-ment yet. Posiva At Posiva, the Scunthorpe-based importer of gears and drives, business has picked up since about the middle of last year, especially in the textile machine industry, although Mr Reg Bricknell, managing director, notes that the uplift is coming mainly from customers whose equipment is destined for overseas markets. The same applies for gearboxes going into mechanical handling equipment, he says. 600 Group At 600 Group, which manufactures and distributes machine tools and materials handling equipment, there has been some improvement in the UK machine tool market, which always comes late in the cycle, says Mr Colin Gaskell, managing director. 'But I don't like to say recovery is on the way in case the government does something stupid like putting 5 per cent on interest rates,' he says. JC Bamford Mr Martin Coyne, chief executive of JC Bamford, the biggest UK construction equipment producer, says UK business picked up about 20 per cent last year, reflecting the way the plant hirers attenuate trends - they had destocked to such an extent that even a slight increase in business leads to a big demand for new equipment. But in terms of conditions in the construction industry, which JCB serves, with only a slight increase in housebuilding activity Mr Coyne is still fairly pessimistic about the recession being over. Fenner Mr Mark Abrahams, finance director at Fenner, which makes fluid power equipment, industrial conveyor belting and transmission products, makes a slightly different point about the UK recession. 'We've seen quite a significant number of our UK customers disappear. The previous recession took a large slice out and now another slice has gone. It's a slightly worrying trend,' he says. It is no wonder, therefore, that companies are relieved not to be too dependent on the UK. 'British groups which have any businesses in North America are saying 'thank goodness', as you will see when our numbers come out (next week).' says Mr Bell. That is not simply because of current market conditions, he says: the UK's economy still has a see-saw nature, 'and that would worry me about having too big a UK sales base.' Mr Gaskell and Mr Coyne, too, are glad that they only have 25 per cent of their businesses in the UK. JCB is doing extremely well in the US and at 600 Group overseas markets, apart from Europe, are showing quite a strong recovery. On the other hand, there is general agreement that the UK is an attractive base for manufacturing, if not always for selling. 'There's no better place to manufacture than the UK,' says Mr Coyne. 'It's half the cost of Germany.' Mr Bricknell, meanwhile, says he is trying to persuade his German parent company to start manufacturing in the UK. Still, not all the FT Six would make the UK their first choice for any future investment in new factories. Mr Gaskell believes that, although pay rates are higher in the US, 'you can run a leaner operation there'. Mr Abrahams argues that UK manufacturing may have learnt some good lessons through the past two recessions, after it had had it too good for too long, but the cycles have destroyed much of manufacturing. Varying solutions, therefore, are proposed for how the government and the City could help build up the UK's manufacturing base. Old-fashioned intervention is generally ruled out, although Mr Burton believes a government industrial strategy is needed to prevent recurrence of a 'disgrace' such as the collapse of Leyland-DAF. Others, like Mr Gaskell, believe the UK economy would be in better shape if government spending and bureaucratic waste was cut, and both he and Mr Bricknell believe industry should have a much stronger role in controlling how government money on research and development is spent. Mr Coyne says the UK needs to emulate the ability of the Japanese to get finance for new investment into the grass roots of British industry, thus creating an environment where small companies can grow.</p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO CUT VEHICLE USE MOVES AHEAD;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE COUNTY DECIDES TO SUBMIT AN EMPLOYEE RIDE-REDUCTION PLAN  INCLUDING CAR POOLS AND DISCOUNT TRANSIT TICKETS TO THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL  DISTRICT.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday decided to submit a plan to  reduce its employees' use of cars to the Air Pollution Control District.  </P> <P> By launching the county plan, board members overrode a staff recommendation to  delay filing the plan with the district for 60 days.  </P> <P> The plan, to be submitted today, is designed to fight air pollution by reducing  the number of cars driven to work by the county's more than 6,000 employees.  The district is expected to take two months to review the proposal.  </P> <P> The plan includes guaranteed rides home in case of emergency for those who  commute by bus or car pool, discounted transit tickets, subsidized van pools  and preferential parking for car-pool members.  </P> <P> Some county agencies already are taking part in early stages of the program,  such as a "9-80" compressed schedule that allows employees to work 80 hours  over nine days every two weeks.  </P> <P> In choosing to turn down Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg's  request for the postponement, the supervisors at least partially reversed their  July 17 position to give businesses with 100 or more employees another three  months to develop trip-reduction strategies.  </P> <P> That delay, the second for private industry this year, was sought by APCD  Manager Richard H. Baldwin on the grounds that his office needed more time to  inform business executives of their responsibilities under the district's Rule  210.  </P> <P> Originally, large businesses were scheduled to begin taking part in the program  Jan. 1. That date was first set back to Aug. 1, then to Nov. 1.  </P> <P> Rule 210, adopted to bring the county into compliance with state and federal  clean-air laws, sets a first-year goal of 1.35 employees per car for vehicles  arriving at work between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. By 1997, the goal is to be raised  to 1.5 employees per car.  </P> <P> "These will be difficult goals to achieve," Air Pollution Control District  Planning Manager William Mount said. "According to a California Department of  Transportation study, average ridership in the county is about 1.12 or 1.14  persons per car. It won't be easy to reach the higher standards."  </P> <P> In answer to Wittenberg's warning that county department heads, as well as  officials at private firms, need more time to finalize plans, Supervisor James  R. Dougherty asked: "Why not adopt it today? You're going to have problems  today or any other time you get started."  </P> <P> Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, who along with fellow Supervisor Maggie H. Erickson  was named to a committee to oversee the county's ride-reduction efforts, said  the program should be launched immediately so it could serve as a model to  other employers.  </P> <P> Board members voted 4 to 0 to launch the plan, with Chairwoman Madge L.  Schaefer voting yes despite reservations about the first year's cost of at  least $900,000.  </P> <P> The district will review the county's strategies at seven work sites in  Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo.  </P> <P> At the largest of these, County Government Center in Ventura, only 20 of the  2,398 employees now get to work by bus and only 167 by car pool, according to a  county survey.  </P> <P> The trip-reduction plan calls for bus riders to increase to 48 and car poolers  to 337. It also calls for more people to walk, ride bicycles or join partially  subsidized van pools.  </P> <P> County government is the second-largest employer in the county. It ranks behind  the Navy's Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, where 9,700 civilians and  military personnel are on the payroll.  </P></p>

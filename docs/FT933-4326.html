			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Leading Article: First world debt burdens THE extraordinary buoyancy of global bond markets is giving the biggest debtors in the developed world an exceptionally comfortable run for their money. One indication of the benign climate for borrowers is that Italy, with a public sector debt stock of more than 110 per cent of gross domestic product, is preparing to launch a record multi-billion dollar debt issue in the international markets. Another is that the UK Treasury, whose performance on inflation has been conspicuously poor, has already met two-thirds of its funding needs in the first five months of the financial year. Is there a risk that the seeds of a first world debt crisis are now being sown? Certainly debt in the developed world has been creeping ominously upwards. The OECD estimates that in the five years to 1994 net public debt will rise from just over 31 per cent to 39 per cent of GDP. Within these figures the debt burden is heavily biased towards Europe, where the build-up is expected to accelerate sharply over the same period from 41 per cent to 54 per cent of GDP. Yet the bond markets remain enthusiastic; and their enthusiasm is increasingly directed at those countries whose poor past performance in managing public finances results in higher than average yields. Bond yields Convergence in bond yields, a process originally sparked by the push for monetary union in Europe, seems not to have been destroyed by the debacle in the European exchange rate mechanism. Today, 10-year bonds in Britain, France and Germany all trade within the same narrow band of between 6 and 7 per cent, despite these countries' very different experiences of inflation over the past three decades. Countries such as Italy and Belgium, meantime, are diversifying their borrowings into foreign currencies. This provides reassurance to creditors, in the sense that the debtor cannot go down the route of inflation and devaluation without facing a huge increase in the real burden of foreign debt. But it also raises the stakes sharply for a debtor struggling with intractable budgetary problems. The markets are unquestionably right about one thing. Inflation is not a global problem at present. The question is rather whether the risk of default, either directly or through inflation, is adequately discounted in the bond prices of individual countries. Given that real debt yields in the more heavily indebted countries tend still to be above the likely trend of growth in GDP, debt stabilisation will still call for some unpalatable fiscal measures. In other words investors are taking a great deal on trust. Market liberalisation The best reason for thinking that fund managers may not have taken leave of their senses is that the liberalisation of currency and financial markets, as well as making it easier to borrow, has made it harder to default. Governments know that if policy ceases to be credible, international markets will simply switch off the financial tap. In the absence of exchange controls, politicians can no longer rig domestic markets to ensure that investors buy their IOUs. They have little option but to monetise maturing debt by borrowing from domestic banks, the equivalent of printing money. This argument would certainly provide a rationalisation for the narrowness of the range within which bond yields have settled. If there is no middle ground in a world of free capital flows between very low inflation and very high inflation, then the variations in creditworthiness between different countries should indeed have narrowed as a result of this increase in the cost of lax policy. But the bond market's euphoria rests heavily on the borrowers' recognition that freedom comes with increased responsibility. The postponement of politically difficult budgetary decisions simply means that the credit crunch will be more devastating when it comes. A hint of what might happen if policy fails to convince came last week when investors started to panic about Belgium, where net public debt of more than 120 per cent of GDP looks worrying without the support of an ERM with narrow bands and the prospect of monetary union. In the final analysis the crucial judgement is about the politics of the indebted countries. Too few bond investors are looking beyond the short-term financial horizon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] and the  defense force will be involved in combined operations on the  East Rand with immediate effect. This was decided yesterday  evening at a meeting between the peacekeeping force and the  defense force.    A spokesman for the peacekeeping force, Major. Math  Anderson,  has told our Johannesburg news staff that details of the  combined operations will be released today. This follows heavy  fighting in Thokoza earlier this week which claimed several  lives. Reports say that the problem stemmed from a mutiny by  more than 100 peacekeeping force troops. On Tuesday [19 April]  the group allegedly refused to obey orders and locked their  commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Quinton Painter in his  car.</p>

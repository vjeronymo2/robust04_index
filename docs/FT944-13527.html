			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Personal pensions - predictions, incentives, and now a compensation loop? (2) Sir, Lex writes that 'the scale of the UK's personal pensions scandal continues to shock' ('Pensions', October 26). The FT is being too modest; you blew the whistle on personal pensions more than four years ago. Our files show that on January 6 1990, you published the view that Norman Fowler, the minister responsible for the new personal pensions, 'has put the pension clock back half a century'. The article correctly states that people buying personal pensions 'have no idea what benefits their contributions will eventually buy' - and was appropriately headed 'Paying dearly for Norman's knighthood'.

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich higher after cut in Swiss discount rate Bourses were relatively subdued, rate cuts or the absence of them doing little to influence share prices, writes Our Markets Staff. ZURICH gave an initially muted response to the 25 basis point cut in the discount rate but it picked up later in the day, led by the chemicals sector. The SMI index added 17.1 to 2,867.7. Buying of Roche certificates, up SFr50 to SFr6,250, by one small bank triggered demand elsewhere in the sector. Ciba registered rose SFr17 to SFr832. Ascom added SFr90 to SFr1,290 on news that it planned a joint venture, controlled by Germany's Robert Bosch, into which the Swiss group would bring its loss making Radiocom subsidiary. SMH bearers shed SFr31 to SFr950 ahead of news, after the market closed, of a change in shareholder structure. Swissair, which forecast a group profit for the year rose SFr15 to SFr780: in September the group said only that it expected to break even. FRANKFURT was quiet as the market waited for the Bundesbank's decision on key interest rates, turnover easing from DM9.9bn to DM9.2bn as the DAX index closed 26.75 higher at 2,137.45. After hours, with rates unchanged, the Ibis indicated DAX rose another 6.58 to 2,144.03. At corporate level, the engineer and truckmaker, MAN, rose DM8 to DM385.50 although it said that a further deterioration in its results could not be ruled out next year. Volkswagen rose DM8.50 to DM418.50 after an Frankfurt court turned down an appeal by Adam Opel, GM's German unit, for an injunction to prevent seven former employees from working for VW. Metallgesellschaft fell DM12.20, or 4 per cent moreto DM293.00. There were stories of executive resignations in the US, where the drop in the oil price has caused the group embarassment, and confirmation of a supervisory board meeting at the parent company today. MILAN turned easier in the absence of a German rate cut, the real-time Mibtel index finishing 87, or 0.8 per cent lower at 10,464. The market was also depressed post-privatisation profit-taking in Credito Italiano, which fell L85 to L2,237 in the day's highest volume of 26.2m shares. Ferruzzi, which launches its L2,480bn capital increase on Tuesday fell L3,254 or 10.7 per cent, to L27,192 as investors switched to the savings shares, which rose L46.10 or 11 per cent to L465.5. Holders of the savings issues will have the same buying rights for the second and third tranches of the capital increase as holders of the ordinary stock. Alitalia marked its debut on the screen based trading system with a L36 or 5.1 per cent rise to L746 amid reports of a planned restructuring. STOCKHOLM's Affarsvarlden General index closed virtually unchanged, easing just 0.9 to 1,361.0; but the SX 16 index, which tracks the 16 most active issues, dropped 0.46 per cent to 1426.35, due mainly to continued losses for Ericsson, hit by large waves of selling over the session. Ericsson B, a US favourite earlier this year when it hit a high of SKr477, dropped another SKr14, or 4.2 per cent to SKr316 with international investors heavy net sellers and little or no domestic buying interest to cushion the fall; dealers said that the fall accelerated in the last hour of trading, after the opening of US markets. Volume remained heavy, rising from SKr1.58bn to SKr1.77bn. Ericsson was the most active stock, accounting for SKr350m of that. PARIS fell slightly, dealers saying that investors were closing their positions before the year-end. The CAC-40 index fell 2.37 to 2,160.26, turnover dropping from FFr5.67bn to some FFr4.2bn. Thomson-CSF, up FFr2 on Wednesday, rose another FFr1.80 to FFr162.80. Its chairman said that the company should be able to maintain profits in spite of an expected fall in defence electronics activity. Rhone-Poulenc fell another FFr2.30 to FFr141.40. Goldman Sachs rated its Rorer healthcare subsidiary as a poetntial underperformer in the US market, and there was further weakness yesterday in Institut Merieux, its partner in a delayed merger, which fell another FFr42 to FFr2,055. MADRID's cash market followed higher futures prices, the general index rising 2.44 to 307.51. Iberdrola rose Pta21 to Pta948 after Standard &amp; Poors said that it was considering a lift in the utility's long term debt rating. AMSTERDAM climbed 1.5 per cent amid short covering and a lack of sellers. Elsevier rose Fl 2.80 to Fl 165 after news that it had taken a stake in an Italian publisher. WARSAW hit its third consecutive high this week, the WIG index rising 263, or 2.5 per cent to 10,677 in turnover of 1,100bn zloty.

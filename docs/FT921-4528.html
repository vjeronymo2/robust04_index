			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Tecs fear cuts in YT funding CRITICISM of government proposals to cut budgets forYouth Training, the main training scheme for young people, is mounting among Training and Enterprise Councils which administer the scheme. Mr Dick Curry, chief executive of Oldham Tec, whose YT budget is likely to be cut by 9 per cent, said: 'It is disappointing that after such a short life Tecs are suffering cuts at a time when jobs for young people and the unemployed are not available.' Last week a confidential minute of a meeting between Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, and members of the group of Tec chairmen who represent the movement to the government, disclosed criticism of proposed government funding of YT. The minute said the 'very low' offers of funding for YT places had led to the belief that government was deliberately underfunding Tecs. Mr Curry said, that with high unemployment rates in the south of England, funding was being diverted to Tecs in the south. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary said unemployment was rising everywhere and it could not be right to reduce funding in the north because of problems in the south.</p>

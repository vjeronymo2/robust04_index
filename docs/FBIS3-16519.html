			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Mar 15, BNS -- Latvia and Russia completed  the latest round of withdrawal talks Tuesday [15 March] in  Moscow by initialing agreements on troop withdrawal, social  protection of the withdrawing troops and social guarantees for  retired military persons in the Baltic country.    Under the basic withdrawal treaty, Russia must get its  remaining troops out by Aug. 31.    The agreement on the social protection of military  pensioners  refers to those who permanently lived in Latvia by January,  1992, when Russia transferred the Soviet Army in the Baltics to  its own jurisdiction.    The retired military persons are naturalized as Latvian  citizens in compliance with the Latvian law.    The war pensioners are granted the status of permanent  residents and the property use rights.    The delegations also coordinated several paragraphs in the  agreement on the Russian radar at Skrunda, Latvia.    Firstly, Latvia lets Russia operate the radar station for  four years and then dismantle it in 18 months.    Secondly, Latvia allows Russia to keep 500 military persons  and 200 civil persons to service the installation. The Latvians  themselves will perform the outer guarding of the station.    Thirdly, the delegations decided that the early-warning  anti-missile radar is "a Russian military installation under  civil control." Consequently, Skrunda won't be considered a  Russian military base.    The parties still disagree on the amount of rent for the  radar's functioning. Russia's offer of 2 million USD per year  does not satisfy Latvia.    Russia has said it wants to sign the entire package of  documents simultaneously.    The conclusive summit of the presidents, Boris Yeltsin and  Guntis Ulmanis, could take place already in the beginning of  April, chief Russian delegate Sergei Zotov told reporters today.    The completed round of talks was already the 13th since the  beginning of interstate consultations in 1992, the Interfax news  agency reported Monday.    According to estimates, around 12,000 Russian military  persons are still stationed in Latvia and another 3,000 in the  Baltic country of Estonia. Lithuania has completely parted with  the former Soviet Army.</p>

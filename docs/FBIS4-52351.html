			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A senior official in the United States has  forecast the Asia Pacific region and Latin America offer the  greatest potential for free trade. The predictions are made in  a report by the American trade representative, Micky Kantor,  which praises the Asia Pacific economic grouping, APEC.  [passage from correspondent in New York omitted]    Meanwhile, the Australian Government has warned that  regional  countries could suffer a loss of exports because of NAFTA.  Concern about exports is among the main findings of the report  by the Australian Foreign Affairs Department on the implications  of NAFTA. The report said while the agreement could open new  opportunities for Australian companies in North America, its  overall effect will be mixed.    It said the main concern is that the United States, Canada,  and Mexico will try to increase barriers to trade with other  countries.</p>

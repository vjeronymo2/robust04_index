			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Keith Allen and Peter Richardson who have written and directed BBC2's new series of The Comic Strip Presents .. seem to think that the idea of a television programme called 'Gourmet Detective' containing a successful murder inquiry and two great recipes in each show is a joke. Given the current state of television they are likely to see the idea pinched and put into practice within a fortnight. The new series (9.00 BBC2) features all the familiar comedians: Robbie Coltrane, Adrian Edmondson, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Alexei Sayle etc. Last week Sister Gabriel, the nun in Body And Soul, saw the villain having his wicked way with one of the mill girls up against the factory wall after going-home time. Sister G. rushed away covering her ears but those experienced in tosh like this may suspect that the sight and sound could prey on her mind and tempt her to wonder what all this sex business is really like (9.00 ITV). Given that True Stories is 90 minutes long, it had better not be teasing when it undertakes to discover the true outcome of the story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (9.30 C4).</p>

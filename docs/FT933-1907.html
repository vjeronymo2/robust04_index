			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Potent but unhappy force THE FACT that the Russian army, although demoralised, underfunded and in the throes of a sharp reduction, is still a force to be reckoned with was amply demonstrated yesterday to Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the visiting UK defence secretary. Mr Rifkind, who has held extensive talks here with his Russian opposite number, General Pavel Grachev, was treated to displays of paratroop assaults, helicopter and ground fire power and hand-to-hand fighting near the Tula military base south of Moscow. The 106 Guards Airborne Division garrisoned at Tula played a crucial role in the August 1991 coup attempt in Moscow by failing to move in support of the coup leaders. There was no sign of abnormal activity around the base early yesterday afternoon, although journalists were given no access to senior Russian officers attending. The elite division, commanded by Major General Alexander Lebyed, one of the most respected officers in the Russian army, is considered a showcase and betrays little of the troubles affecting other parts of the armed forces. A senior officer complained recently that a large proportion of soldiers had not been paid for two months. Many units are seriously under strength, with only 13 to 15 per cent of conscripts responding to their call-up papers. Troop reduction is taking place faster than planned. Experts consider the army, which has changed its uniforms and insignia from the old Soviet model, is lacking a hard core of competent senior non-commissioned officers, but say it retains the structure of an organised force. President Yeltsin has come under fresh criticism from the military establishment for remarks indicating he would not object to countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic, former members of the Warsaw Pact, joining Nato.</p>

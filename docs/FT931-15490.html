			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises slightly as HK holds on to gains MARKET indices gave a mixed picture of the mood in Tokyo yesterday. The Nikkei average climbed a little after a week of consecutive falls, but the more broadly based Topix index eased slightly, writes Bethan Hutton in Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 91.50 up at 16,681.05, opening at a low for the day of 16,585.53 and reaching a high of 16,734.02 before receding later in the session. Volume continued to be very low, estimated at 150m shares, the same as the previous day. Declining stocks marginally outnumbered gainers by 441 to 421, with 212 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section shares ended 1.95 off at 1,281.98, having remained in a narrow range all day. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.35 to 1,039.97. Mr Chris Newton, at James Capel, described the Nikkei's moderate rally as unconvincing and largely technically based. 'We saw virtual paralysis today. Only a certain amount of investment trust buying was going on,' he said. There was also some buying by small public pension funds. Victor Co of Japan (JVC) climbed Y50 to Y890 in volume of 1.7m shares after Matsushita Electric Industrial said it would adopt JVC's new W-VHS standard for its own high-definition television video recorders. The rest of the sector continued to weaken, with the exception of Pioneer Electronic, which gained Y20 at Y2,580. Matsushita shed Y10 to Y1,100, Sony Y50 to Y4,110 and TDK Y10 to Y3,490. The likelihood of lower profits estimates pushed Tokyo Steel down Y160 to Y2,610. Nippon Housing Loan was traded actively, putting on Y6 at Y295, after a newspaper report suggested that the company's restructuring programme would be more extensive. Gold-related shares continued to do well out of uncertainty in the Middle East, and the expectation that gold commemorative coins will be minted to mark the wedding of the Crown Prince later this year. Sumitomo Metal Mining appreciated Y9 to Y658 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting Y14 to Y471. Shiseido, the cosmetics sector leader, lost Y30 to close at Y1,330 in active trading related to the issue of a warrant bond. Odakyu Electric Railway was the most heavily traded stock, ending Y1 firmer at Y662 after volume of 3.69m shares. In Osaka the OSE index rose 11.45 to 18,321.18 in high volume of 97m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Rim put in a mixed performance yesterday. Bombay remained closed as riots in the city continued. HONG KONG held on to Monday's gains, created by renewed interest from overseas institutions. The Hang Seng index finished just 1.84 down at 5,671.26 in turnover of HKDollars 2.45bn. Hongkong Telecom was unchanged at HKDollars 9.70, HSBC 50 cents lower at HKDollars 58.50 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 1 higher at HKDollars 55. SINGAPORE ended little changed but the underlying tone softened as sellers started to emerge. The Straits Times Industrial index closed at 1,545.02, up 1.06, in volume of 67.2m shares. SIA Foreign was ahead 5 cents at SDollars 9.10, ex a one-for-one scrip issue. SEOUL lost ground for the second day in a technical correction. The composite index closed 5.37 lower at 703.05 in turnover of Won653.95bn, against Won836.66bn. NEW ZEALAND recovered most of what it lost on Monday, the NZSE-40 index ending 20.76 higher at 1,520.71. The market had been worried about prospects following base rate increases by the ANZ and BNZ banks last week, but several banks have declined to follow this lead and sentiment has improved. BANGKOK reported rallies in four major banks and two big property companies, and the SET index climbed a further 6.9 to 933.6 in turnover of Bt8.21bn. The index has risen by 5.2 per cent in the past six trading days and, over the past two days, some traders said that banks were looking overbought. TAIWAN rose on a technical rebound and on hopes of a cut in the stock transaction tax. The weighted index closed 46.31 ahead at 3,217.55 but turnover contracted to TDollars 6.4bn from TDollars 8.3bn. KUALA LUMPUR finished lower on further selling as talk of lower than expected economic growth in the last quarter of 1992 continued to affect sentiment. The composite index fell 5.0 to 616.5 in volume of 63.2m shares. JAKARTA reported active trading at the close after initial lethargy, but prices ended mixed and the official index eased 0.45 to 278.07.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (31): Economist who turned the tide - Profile, Manmohan Singh / India's finance minister has skilfully maintained the momentum of the most radical programme of reform in the country's independent history TO REVITALISE and open up an economy such as India's is a massive task. First, there is its sheer size. Then, there is the scale of inefficiency and corruption resulting from more than 40 years of Nehruvian policies of socialist self-sufficiency. Finally, there is the pressure arising from deep-rooted social problems and fever-pitch politics. Since June 1991, this has been the lot of Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister. A quietly-spoken civil servant who had held top economic posts, he was the only non-politician appointed to Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao's 58-member cabinet. India faced a financial crisis, and as an internationally respected technocrat, Mr Singh was the man to deal with it. His manner of dealing with the crisis, however, was to initiate the most radical programme of economic reform seen in India's independent history. It is still proceeding, and he is still in charge of it. Commentators inside and outside India have been ready throughout Mr Singh's tenure to write the obituary of yet another half-hearted attempt to clean up the economy. But they remain frustrated. Born in 1932 at Gah in the Punjab - now in Pakistan - Mr Singh won the Adam Smith prize at Cambridge in his early twenties. In 1972 he was appointed economic adviser in the finance ministry and in 1982 became the governor of the Reserve Bank of India. His career took an international turn in 1987 when he became secretary-general of the South Commission. By 1991, when Mr Rao selected him to deal with the balance of payments crisis, he had retired to the calm of the University Grants Commission. Mr Singh's career had put him, therefore, in a key executive role enacting government policies of which he must have been at least dubious. According to Professor Jagdish Bhagwati, of Columbia University, Mr Singh had long favoured export promotion as the best means of producing economic growth and efficiency. However, successive governments pursued policies of import substitution, characterised by high tariff barriers, protection for Indian industries, and a large state presence in the economy - overseen by all-powerful ministers and bureaucrats. The potential for inefficiency and corruption in such a system was amply realised. Although it had been devised to protect the poor, they had suffered while the privileged professionals and protected tycoons prospered. Mr Singh, a man of unquestioned integrity, had seen this process at close quarters. At the same time, he had admired the success of countries such as South Korea which had depended upon export growth. When the task fell to him, he was evidently all the more determined to turn the tide. The wind has been behind him. Three factors have been in his favour. When he took over, India was bankrupt, with foreign exchange reserves exhausted and Indian state-owned banks having trouble meeting their commitments in the international money markets. If a Mexico-style debt crunch was to be avoided, drastic and immediate measures were needed. Both Mr Rao and Mr Singh clearly decided India could not afford a debt default. Mr Singh has also enjoyed the support of Mr Rao throughout. Although the tenure of Mr Rao, an experienced party hand appointed to lead the Congress party after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi, has sometimes appeared shaky, he has managed to hold on. Finally, there has been little significant opposition - in spite of nationalist noises made by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party - to the principle of opening up the economy and reversing a malaise which had been generally recognised by the Indian elite. Mr Singh's achievements are considerable. He has abolished the 'license raj' under which virtually every corporate decision needed bureaucratic sanction. He has removed most barriers to foreign investment. He has lowered tariffs and floated the rupee. Much more is under way, including urgently needed reforms of the financial sector and of the tax system. The economic effects of these changes have been slow to come through. Growth has accelerated, although not spectacularly, inflation has come down and the rupee has been remarkably stable since it was freed. But industrial production and exports have been slow to pick up. Foreign investors have been cautious, although signs are emerging of steadily growing interest. Moreover, Mr Singh has been slow to tackle some areas of reform because of entrenched political opposition - principally labour reform and privatisation, both of which would shake up the bloated public sector as well as introducing keener competition in the private sector. Mr Singh's skill, however, has been in never underestimating his task. He has correctly judged the political forces against him, carefully sought to build a consensus for needed reforms, and enacted them as he could. Although this has meant that progress has sometimes been slow, the government has not lost the momentum of reform. This is partly because in some areas, such as the convertibility of the rupee, Mr Singh has been prepared to force the pace. Perhaps most surprisingly, Mr Singh has shown himself an adroit politician. His third budget, unveiled in February after a period of brutal social and political strife, won praise as a political conjuring trick. He managed to cut interest rates and import duties while boosting spending on education, agriculture and infrastructure, without increasing government borrowing. Many economists believe it would be virtually impossible for India to turn back to its old ways, even if reforms suffer setbacks in future years. If this is true, Mr Singh will have played a key role in changing India's destiny.</p>

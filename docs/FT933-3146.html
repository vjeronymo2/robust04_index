			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Goal net profits rise 18% to Pounds 2.8m GOAL Petroleum, the UK independent exploration and production company, reported an 18 per cent jump in net profits to Pounds 2.8m for the first half of the year despite a 13 per cent fall in production. Earnings per share also rose 18 per cent to 2.07p. The decline in output was offset by favourable exchange rate movements which resulted in higher sterling prices for oil. Turnover to the end of June remained unchanged from the same period last year at Pounds 20.9m, according to Mr Roger Bexon, chairman. He said the company would use its financial strength - net borrowings fell Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 16.2m to give a gearing ratio of 18 per cent - to expand reserves, either through successful exploration, acquisition or by boosting output of existing reserves, such as the Wytch Farm and Magnus fields in the UK. Mr Bexon added that the changes made earlier this year to the UK's petroleum tax regime would 'substantially increase' Goal's discretionary income and enhance its flexibility in making any acquisitions. 'While the North Sea still offers many opportunities ..we continually review possible investments in other areas,' he said. The company's average production rate was 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day during the first half of the year (11,500). The fall was due to planned maintainence shutdowns at the Buchan and Wytch Farm fields. There is again no interim dividend.</p>

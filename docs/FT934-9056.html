			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Management: Inward focus on total quality The effect on bottom-line financial performance of total quality programmes in the UK has been shown to be pretty mixed. Much recent academic research has therefore been devoted to finding out why. A survey of TQM in Scotland carried out by Durham University Business School* has concluded that the focus of quality in companies is too often inward looking. For example, while 70 per cent of the 650 organisations which replied have marketing departments, less than a third use them to develop, implement or assess the effects of their quality programmes. 'Quality without the person who experiences the product, the real customer, is like a car without a driver - it just won't go', is how Barry Witcher of the school's Centre for Quality and Organisational Change puts it. Bradford University Management Centre, meanwhile, has come up with a different angle by studying the annual reports of the top 100 European companies and a randomly selected sample of 100 UK businesses.** It found that very few provide relevant information about their mission statements, TQM approach, future intentions or true business performance. Among those to be commended are Cadbury Schweppes, NFC, RTZ, Thorn EMI, Forte and WH Smith. The report recommends that companies 'stop believing in the myth that TQM is only a technique of relevance to the business units and with no corporate value to it'. Business unit performance will improve with 'visible support and commitment from the holding or parent company', while better head office understanding of units' capabilities will lead to more realistic targets. * The adoption of total quality management in Scotland, DUBS, Mill Hill Lane, Durham City DH1 3LB.

			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARK CONCESSIONAIRE FEES CRITICIZED  </P> <P> The largest 14 licensed businesses in the nation's parks sold more than $255  million in goods and services in 1988 but paid only $5.6 million for the  privilege, an Interior Department report found Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The taxpayers are getting a very bad deal.  </P> <P> They're getting gouged," said James R. Richards, the department's inspector  general, in a phone interview.  </P> <P> The audit recommended increasing licensing fees for those who operate stands,  tours and other services in national parks. Failing do so meant that the  government lost $83 million in revenue from 1984 to 1988, the report found, and  would cost the government another $109 million by 1993 if licensing fees are  not raised dramatically.  </P> <P> The government's central contention was that concessionaires are operating as  monopolies inside park grounds, able to earn huge profits while paying low  licensing fees to the National Park Service.  </P> <P> The report, based on audits of 14 of the nation's largest park concessionaires,  indicates the operations are paying an average 2.5% of their gross receipts to  the National Park Service. Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has said that he  hopes to increase fees beyond 20%.  </P></p>

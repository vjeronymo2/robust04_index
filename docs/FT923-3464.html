			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Dealers braced for second Eurobond issue withdrawal THE Eurobond market was yesterday facing its second aborted issue in as many days, as the lead manager to Pta10bn of floating-rate notes from the European Investment Bank came close to calling off the deal. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the lead manager, said it was '90 per cent certain' the issue would be pulled following Wednesday's announcement of the ending of the tax exemption which made the bonds of the EIB and other multilateral agencies particularly attractive to Italian investors. Around 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the bonds placed so far had been sold in Italy, the BBV said, adding that more than half of the total issue had been sold before the Italian announcement. The move to call off the deal was held over, however, after an unexpected report late in the day that the peseta issue might still benefit from the tax exemption. A final decision has been delayed until today, when bankers and the issuer hope to have more information about when the tax change officially comes into effect. BBV said that it had warned banks involved in the Pta10bn deal not to trade the bonds since the issue was likely to be abandoned. Meanwhile, a second EIB issue, to raise Y50bn, was not launched as planned yesterday as the bank and its lead managers, Morgan Stanley and Long Term Credit Bank, awaited further clarification of the Italian tax change. These delays follow Golman Sach's decision on Wednesday to call off a Dollars 384m issue for Osprey Mortgage Services, a rare mortgage-backed deal from Sweden. Turmoil in the Swedish markets was blamed for the postponment, even though the issue was announced some hours after this week's upheaval first hit the Scandinavian markets. The disruption in the Eurobond market left bankers querying the circumstances in which lead managers exercise their powers to call off bond issues under the standard, broadly-worded force majeure clauses contained in most Eurobond documentation. Such powers have been rarely used: proposed issues from BAT when it was under threat of takeover and a Robert Holmes a Court vehicle at the time of the 1987 stock market crash are the only recent examples. Decisions on whether or not to abandon issues have been complicated by the development of the swaps market. Swap transactions do not carry force majeure clauses, meaning that they cannot be abandoned if the underlying bond issue to which they are linked is pulled. In such cases, banks could face a loss when unwinding the swap. Goldman would not say whether the Osprey deal had been swapped before it was postponed. The pulling of deals has reawakened concern over how force majeure clauses are applied. The subject has stirred little interest since the Gulf war but at that time no Eurobond issues were abandoned. A bank close to one of the deals said yesterday: 'It makes sense to pull a deal, rather than try to be macho and carry it off when no one wants it.' The Province of Ontario is preparing to launch its second global bond offering, totalling at least Dollars 1.5bn. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been mandated to arrange the offering of five-year, seven-year or 10-year bonds, which is likely to be launched next week. Ontario launched its first global bond offering, a Dollars 2bn issue of 7 3/4 bonds due 2002, in May. That deal is now trading at a yield spread of 60 basis points, relative to the US Treasury market. However, the spread has widened because the issue is now trading at a premium to par of more than six points. A new global offering would likely be priced at a tighter spread. Ontario, Canada's largest province in terms of economic activity and population, has raised CDollars 5.9bn of its 1992-93 borrowing requirement, expected to total CDollars 9.7bn.</p>

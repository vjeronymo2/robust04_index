			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: British Gas Most of the big questions surrounding British Gas were left unanswered at yesterday's interim results. The company has deferred until the end of the month a full public presentation of dividend policy, international strategy and plans for its domestic business. Even so, those clues that did emerge were positive. Most obviously, by maintaining its dividend at the half-year the company seemingly signalled that it would not carry out earlier threats to cut the payout. A modest increase or, at worst, a frozen dividend for the whole year now looks likely. British Gas is also, after a late start, moving smartly to cut costs in its UK gas supply business. The first 3,000 out of the planned 25,000 job cuts went in the half year. Moreover, the company emphasised yesterday its more constructive approach towards its regulator's plans to abolish its domestic monopoly. That should reassure investors that management will focus on putting the business into shape rather than wasting energy on unproductive squabbles with its regulator. No clues, though, were given about Gas's future international strategy. Following the sale of Consumers Gas and Bow Valley Energy, the group's debt-to-equity ratio has fallen to 24 per cent. The low gearing level gives Gas scope to make further investments overseas. But the company needs first to articulate a credible strategy. Otherwise, it would do better to follow the electricity companies and buy back its shares.</p>

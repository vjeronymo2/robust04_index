			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Nigerian election goes smoothly but turnout low NIGERIA'S military government successfully staged elections for a civilian president on Saturday, after three delays in the last three years, but turnout was low. Results are unlikely to be announced until tomorrow at the earliest. Among those who did not cast a vote were Mr Bashir Tofa, the presidential candidate for the right-of-centre National Republican Convention (NRC), and his vice-presidential running mate, Mr Sylvester Ugoh. Mr Tofa arrived late at his local polling booth in the northern city of Kano, and found that his voter's registration card was out of date. Under Nigerian law, a candidate is barred from winning the presidency if he is not registered to vote in these polls, but the National Electoral Commission has already cleared both parties' candidates to stand for election. Mr Tofa's rival, Mr Moshood Abiola, had no such problems at his polling station, which is in Moshood Abiola Crescent in Lagos, but the turnout, even in such partisan territory, was about a third of the number registered to vote. Of the 38m who are registered, disillusionment with the choice of candidates and the rigid voting schedule helped to keep voters away even in the urban areas where there were shorter travelling distances. Everyone had to be at their polling station by 8am to be accredited and to remain after voting until about midday when the ballot papers were counted. Polling passed off smoothly in most parts of the country. The agents of both parties were able to check the count at each level. One of the foreign observers at these elections will be at the electoral commission headquarters to watch the final count.</p>

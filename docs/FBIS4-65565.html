			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vittoria Sivo: "Trentin Tells Government: `This </F> Will Increase Unemployment'"]    [Text] Rome -- Bruno Trentin called it "empty," "vague,"  and even "worrying." Sergio D'Antoni called it "confused,"  "unrealistic, and "generic." The program presented by Silvio  Berlusconi has been rejected by the trade unions. The CGIL  [Italian General Confederation of Labor] leader demolished it  using with his severe criticism of the prime minister's Senate  speech on Tuesday [17 May]. The CISL [Italian Confederation of  Trade Unions] secretary general was slightly less harsh:  "neither passed nor failed," the government will be judged on  its deeds, but it was given very low grades in several subjects.    All the trade unions have issued their assessments,  nullifying the albeit cautious expressions of favor that  Berlusconi won a fortnight ago when he promised the three  federations full observance of the July 1993 collective  bargaining agreement. Pietro Larizza of the UIL [Italian  Federation of Trade Unions] had already criticized the  government's aims -- "That is not a program; it is merely a  draft of a program" -- because of the number of questions left  unanswered and its excessively vague formulations.    In a crescendo of alarmed comments, Trentin declared himself  "worried and frightened" by the "substantial vagueness" rather  than by the program's gaps and omissions. It reveals both the  difficulty in reconciling the various tendencies within the  coalition and the attempt to "reserve such a broad discretionary  decisionmaking margin as to prompt serious concern about how the  government intends to manage its relations with parliament and  the social partners." This very serious charge is almost  tantamount to one of authoritarianism. The CGIL secretary  general noted "serious ambiguities" concerning foreign policy, a  "surprising methodological contrast" with the programs of all  the other governments of the industrialized countries, and major  inconsistencies left unresolved by the historical assessment of  fascism. A "total" absence of analysis of the Italian economic  crisis, which has led to a complete silence regarding the means  of reviving the economy envisaged by the July agreement.  Trentin also criticized the tax proposals and the way in which  Berlusconi intends to resolve the matter of guarantees regarding  his business interests.    The section concerning unemployment was given a definite  thumbs-down. The CGIL leader accused the government of wanting  to carry out "complete deregulation throughout the labor market,  modifying existing legislation to the extent of promising a  continuation of the Ciampi government's policy, which was itself  very much open to criticism." It would entail making employment  "increasingly unstable," with the result of increasing the  number of unemployed, as in Spain.    The CISL's verdict was a negative one, too, though the tone  and the language used at the press conference that D'Antoni and  his deputy, Raffaele Morese, devoted to Berlusconi's program  were somewhat different from those of the CGIL secretary. Faced  with a government plan that "does not choose and that creates  expectations on all sides," with a considerable "gap" between  the stated objectives and the policies for achieving them, "we  will issue a challenge," placing the emphasis on an incomes  policy, responding "to every point," and defending the trade  unions' role in the policy of consultations, without any  preconceived opposition. Indeed, D'Antoni's reservations did  not extend as far as to make him advocate a no-confidence vote  in the Senate. "At this stage it is better for them to govern."  In other words, if he were a senator, the CISL secretary would  probably choose not to vote, since he could not grant his vote  of confidence."    Though they do not consider the creation of a million jobs  impossible ("who could say they oppose it?"), the CISL leaders  find the proposals for achieving this objective very  unsatisfactory, if not actually counterproductive. It would be  better to implement the measures identified in [European  Commission President] Delors plan, which depend chiefly on  boosting public works and a reorganization of working hours.  The proposals with regard to taxation seem unclear too: Does  the promise of tax exemption for those earning less than 10  million lire affect only employed workers, or self-employed  workers, too? It is a major difference, since according to the  experts consulted, the resulting loss of revenue "would vary  from 600 to 6,000 billion lire." The CISL also wants to know  how this loss of revenue will be compensated.    Even CISNAL's [Italian Confederation of National Trade  Unions] initial enthusiasm has cooled having been given some  "surprises" by Berlusconi's program -- some good, some bad. The  assessment issued by its secretary general, Mauro Nobilia, is  worth quoting, not so much because of his confederation's  influence (very small in numerical terms), but because of the  union's closeness to the MSI [Italian Social Movement]. Nobilia  was reassured by the "reaffirmation of a state presence in the  economy," while he feared a "sharply derestrictive" approach,  and he appreciated the references to solidarity and the family,  the rejection of the patronage system, the boost to the role of  small business, and the intention to "examine" the Maastricht  Treaty. But he believes that the program was "ill-defined" on  the subject of taxation and is "very worried" about the measures  announced affecting the labor market.</p>

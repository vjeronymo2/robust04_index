			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Baghdad-based National Command of </F> the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party on 3 March 1994]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. Children of our mujahid Arab nation; children of  Iraq and Palestine; O Arab strugglers, children of the Ba'th  Party:    The massacre at the Holy Ibrahimi Mosque adds yet another  tragic, bleeding event to the Arabs' wounds in Palestine, the  Arab homeland, and the Muslim world. This was a major wound to  dignity that reminds us of the burning of the al-Aqsa Mosque in  Jerusalem. It reminds us of the unseen reasons behind it, warns  us against its serious consequences, specifies the disease in  the body of the nation, and reveals a painful and depressing  defect in Arab reactions and the contradiction that continues to  expand between the true substance of the nation and its current  reality.    The picture of this event -- the picture of worshipers at  dawn prayer, kneeling to Allah in the mihrab of Ibrahim  [Abraham] -- has entered into the mind of the Arab people and  the Muslim peoples as a clear embodiment of the true nature of  the Zionist entity, the deep wound in the Arab and Muslim  realities, and the dimensions of the conspiracy against the Arab  nation's future.    Such an event symbolizes the substantive meanings that  reveal  the nature and full dimensions of the challenge, which cannot be  dealt with from a classical view or through an immediate  reaction. It requires a daring, thorough thought about one's  self and the event. Those who are today voicing denunciations  and condemnations and showing outrage, as well as those who  pretend to have been outraged, should not only express pain and  outrage. They should ask the basic question: Why was Palestine  usurped? The Ibrahimi Mosque event must make Arabs ask this  question again. It should make them raise their political  analyses to a level that goes beyond the logic of the regimes  that have given in to negative realities and circumstances and  to the schemes of enemies that made the Arab conditions reach  such a position.    Such a major event combines the meanings and images that  remind us of the origins of the Palestinian and Arab national  and pan-Arab tragedies and the conspiracy against the Arab  nation's future and destiny. Therefore, emphasizing the  substantive meanings of the Ibrahimi Mosque event and turning  these feelings into mature action and a (noble?) view of a  genuine strategy to face current challenges is the sound way to  deal with this bloody event, in which a new group of Palestinian  martyrs joined the caravan of Arab struggle.    O valiant sons of Arabism: The massacre of the holy  Ibrahimi Mosque raises several significant questions. The  bloody incident raises the question of the Arab-Israeli  conflict. It reasserts its new dimensions, which were absent  from the plans of those who are working to resolve the Palestine  question and those who are running after crumbs of humiliation  and unfair solutions. These solutions hold an arrogant, usurping  criminal to be the same as a victim whose self-defense  capability, existence, rights, and destiny are restrained by  Western powers and Zionism.    This horrible massacre brings into question anew the root of  the problem, namely, the Zionist occupation. It exposes old and  new Western intentions to encroach on the Arab nation's rights  to progress by continuing a colonialist policy that is permeated  with a Zionist spirit bearing grudges against Arabism and Islam.  The new massacre raises anew the question about the real role  of the Zionist entity, a role that manifests itself in this  barbarous example of terror and collective killing, a role that  holds all values in contempt and whose only aim is to hamper the  Arab nation's cultural and human progress. It embodies an  example of the cultural degeneration that is revealed if we  compare the scene of the worshipers, portraying the meaning of  human faith, and the scene of Zionist treachery that depicts  Zionism's racist nature as well as the hatred and rancor imbibed  by Zionist generations who have made their first aim  annihilating the Arabs.    Thus, the grave incident portrays the contradiction between  the line of the capitulationist settlement on the one hand and  the real nature of the Zionist enemy and the real dimension of  the Arab-Israeli struggle on the other, shedding light on plans  and schemes aimed at opening the door for transforming the Arab  region into a graveyard of its own history and people's rights  and wiping out its national identity and the aspirations of its  masses. The characteristics of jihad as manifested in the  Mother of Battles have thus reasserted their values,  strengthened their principled logic, and renewed the nation's  confidence in facing he challenges, no matter how great and  immense they may be.    The Ibrahimi Mosque incident might have been just a new  wound  in the nation's body had it not been for the spirit of jihad  released by the Mother of Battles which saved this body from  being totally paralyzed, opening new horizons for the Arab  struggle and making clear what is possible and what is not  possible in light of the clarity of the nation's substance, the  level of deception in it and the exposure of the deceivers and  the great distance that separates them from the line of the  mujahidin.    O free Palestinians and Arabs. The factors of the current  Palestinian, Arab, and international situation are interacting  to express the nation's substance and cultural struggle in  facing the aggressive Western colonialist policies and Zionism's  fascist, racist, domineering, and expansionist nature. The  Mother of Battles opened the door for a new phase of mass  struggle. Therefore, despite its grave and disastrous nature,  the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre brought a new powerful shock to the  nation and released the anger of the broad masses in the Arab  homeland against the settlement scheme to liquidate the  Palestinian cause. It reaffirmed the truthfulness of the Mother  of Battle's principled stand of jihad in expressing the nation's  dignity, honor, and the future of Palestine and Arabism.    The time has come for a discussion in this spirit by the  nation's free men in a pan-Arab program, and for emphasizing the  pan-Arab nature of the battle for a comprehensive mass  confrontation of the Zionist challenge and the capitulationist  settlement line.    Now that our Palestinian people have given their opinion on  all the capitulationist formulas, the nation is motivated to  take care of its central cause and to effect a program of  struggle that is farsighted and carefully wrought, which will  transform the revenge for the martyrs blood into profound  motives for entrenching the principled stand for the sake of  liberation, for strengthening the spirit of jihad and the  struggle for unity, and for raising the confrontation to a new  and advanced level on the road to liberation and to the  realization of pan-Arab aims.    The Ibrahimi Mosque incident reveals to those who had  believed that the Gaza-Jericho agreement had ended the  Arab-Zionist struggle and placed the Palestinian cause on the  brink of liquidation that they are deceiving themselves. This  is because this illusion presents a superficial, unrealistic  view of the nature of the struggle and an incorrect picture of  the nature of the enemy. To attach new traits to the Zionist  enemy that do not match its nature is a matter of theorization  in order to justify the retreat from the real principled stand  and the correct revolutionary concept of the nation's resources.    The unprincipled agreements, no matter under what names and  regardless of their descriptions, are an abandonment of the  substance of the nation and the understanding of the enemy's  nature. The chaste blood shed at the Ibrahimi Mosque and the  betrayed blood that will be added to the rivers of blood in  Palestine and the Arab arenas of struggle, coupled with the pain  twisting in our hearts as a nation facing immense dangers, call  upon us to reconsider and contemplate, stop this capitulationist  policy and restore the principled awareness that binds our  nationalist stands in various arenas. Foremost of these arenas  is the one in which the nation expressed its historic readiness  to confront the challenges besieging us and the capitulationist  schemes that contradict our real nature as a mujahid nation  capable of steadfastness in the face of this barbarous and evil  aggression, which assumed the most terrible dimension during the  30-state aggression against Iraq and the most treacherous and  grotesque picture in the attack on the Ibrahimi Mosque and the  worshipping faithful during the month of Ramadan, the symbol of  peace and Islam.    The incident reveals the enemy's brutality in the face of  the  humane Arabism and its contemporary cultural endeavor.    Children of Arabism and Islam: Adhering to the principled  course constitutes the boat of survival for the nation. If the  struggling Arab forces are incapable of engaging in equal,  decisive battles under the current pan-Arab circumstances, this  does not absolve them from standing fast and harassing the  enemies in order to confuse their plans and weaken their  resources and morale, until the day when conditions for decisive  battles become available. Introducing the criteria for what is  correct and what is biased in the current positions is one of  the most important requirements for struggle and jihad in this  circumstance.    Therefore, despite the seeming disequilibrium in the balance  of forces in favor of the imperialist and Zionist camp, the  Ibrahimi Mosque crime reveals the bankruptcy of Zionist methods  in the face of Arab resistance to occupation and usurpation. It  confirms the ability of the militant Arab forces to stand fast  and resist as long as they abide by the principled course, which  sticks to national and pan-Arab rights, as the realistic,  genuine course that understands the nature of the decisive,  cultural conflict the nation is fighting in defense of its right  to life and renaissance.    Consequently, the spirit of resistance, the spirit of the  Mother of Battles and the stone-throwing heroes, must be  maintained. It must continue in the nation and must expand, be  entrenched, and spread in the greater Arab homeland because this  spirit will decide the final outcome of the conflict and the  cultural and humanitarian meanings of the national and pan-Arab  liberation struggle.    Arabs may not be able to regain all of their rights now.  However, by maintaining their principled positions and honor,  they can guarantee the future and create new militant formulas  by siding with the masses to revive militant and jihad popular  action in national and pan-Arab life and transform emerging  events, regardless of how great their challenges may be, and  threats and pains into futuristic phenomena and steady steps on  the path of the future, which the nation and its sacrifices are  worthy of.    If you aid God, he will aid you. [part of a Koranic verse]    Long live Palestine, free and Arab;    Long live the struggle of the people of Palestine and the  stone-throwing children;    Long live the principled, jihad confrontation in the  Mother of Battles;    Long live the mujahid people of Iraq;    Long live the nation of the Arabs, free and glorious.    [Signed] The National Command    [Dated] 21 Ramadan 1414 hegira, corresponding to 3 March  1994</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Muhammad Sharaf: "Christopher's Visit to </F> Cairo and the Aspirations for a Just and Comprehensive Peace in  the Region"]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit  to Egypt to promote the peace process coincides with the  progress made in the Palestinian-Israeli talks on the  implementation of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.  The visit reflects a U.S. appreciation of Egypt and President  Husni Mubarak for his intensive efforts to achieve an honorable  peace providing the firm bases for Egyptian and other Arab  peoples to build themselves and assert their existence in this  changing world.    Christopher's visit to the region reflects U.S. awareness of  the importance of intervention on the level of the U.S.  secretary of state at this phase in the peace process to prevent  any setback that will return the talks to the whirlpool of  Israeli obstacles aimed at extorting the Palestinians and  turning the two self-rule areas into a prison without barbed  wire. The visit reflects a U.S. desire for the success of the  peace process to bypass the stage of wars to a new Middle East  enjoying peace, security, cooperation, and prosperity for all  the region's peoples.    We believe the U.S. secretary of state must convince the  Israelis to respect their pledges and signatures on the  September agreement in Washington. He must also convince them  that the only guarantee for their security is a just and  comprehensive peace through which the Arabs will have their  occupied lands restored and the Palestinians will regain all  their legitimate rights. Israel must realize that regional  peace and security are not its demand alone. Concern for peace  and stability must be reflected in a clear commitment that the  world can see and that the Middle East peoples can experience.  The Middle East peoples are in dire need of peace and stability  in order to devote themselves to development.    Mubarak's Egypt has played a vanguard role for the sake of  peace and stability in this part of the world. It continues to  play this key role for peace, which will provide common security  for all parties. President Mubarak has called on all parties to  work to continue the peace process.    Undoubtedly, accelerating the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement will be a sign of hope in a region whose  people have lived in despair and disappointment for a long time,  especially the Palestinian people. Speeding up the  implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement will give  credibility to the process of a comprehensive peace and  encourage the other Arab parties to sit at the negotiating table.    It is a fact that President Husni Mubarak is playing an  important role in pushing forward the peace process on all  tracks. Egypt is the biggest Arab country and has the first  experience of a permanent peace with Israel.    All parties must realize that Egypt is not prepared to put  any pressure on the Palestinian leadership to compel it to adopt  unacceptable stances or to approve unsatisfactory proposals.  Egypt is not a mediator. It does not play a neutral role  between the Arabs and Israel. Egypt's stance is part of the  Arab stance on interests and rights, including the Palestinian  people's interests and rights.    We are certain that the ship of peace will sail again. The  difficult and complicated negotiations taking place in Cairo and  President Husni Mubarak's continuing contacts with all parties  will ultimately persuade Israel to respond to the Palestinian  demands. Egypt is hosting the talks on the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho accord and President Mubarak is sponsoring these  talks. In view of President Mubarak's personal role for the  sake of a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace, we say that  the peace we desire must include the Palestinians, Syria,  Lebanon, and Jordan and must return to them their legitimate  rights.</p>

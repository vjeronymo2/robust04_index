			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / British Association for the Advancement of Science: Fillings for teeth come unstuck THERE ARE a range of new dentistry materials for filling teeth, but although most of them look better they do not stick well enough to replace old-fashioned amalgam. Dr Tim Watson, of Guy's Hospital, London, is carrying out microscopic investigations of the interface between the filling and the tooth, to trace the distribution of adhesive components within the tooth. 'This will enable us to design better materials, and improve cavity preparation to make fillings last longer,' he said.</p>

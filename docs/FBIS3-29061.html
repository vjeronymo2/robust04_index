The sources said an  additional $260,000 will be granted for various training  programs and donation of equipment to the self-rule government  of Palestinians this year.    The financial support will be studied with the PLO side when  a legitimate recipient body is set up in the autonomous region,  the sources said.    The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) agreed  early this month in Jerusalem to provide $25 million to the  Palestinian Housing Council to build houses for poor families in  the village of Jabalia in the Gaza Strip.    The sources said the government will consult with the PLO  over which projects the fund will be financed when the  Palestinian outlet is formed in the autonomous territory.    The $10 million will come from the Economic Development and  Cooperation Fund (EDCF) which is managed by the government to  help developing nations.    The other $260,000 in aid will be used to train 10  Palestinians in the manufacturing field here, and to send two  Korean experts and construction equipment there this year.    The sources said that set-up of a legitimate body to receive  the financial support will be speeded up as Israel and the PLO  signed an agreement in Cairo last Wednesday on security issues,  including who will monitor the Palestinian border crossing.    The Korean embassy in Jordan has been instructed to closely  watch the development of Palestinian autonomy in connection with  the aid program, the sources said. The embassy in Jordan  handles affairs to the PLO with which Korea has no diplomatic  relations.</p>

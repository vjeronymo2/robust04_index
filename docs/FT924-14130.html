			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Gilts: Hopes of interest rate cut spark advance THE gilt market advanced last week on the back of a stronger pound and indications that Germany may soon ease credit policy, opening the way for a reduction in base rates. With inflationary pressures in the UK likely to stay relatively subdued for some time as a result of the recession, demand for gilts was strong across the spectrum of the yield curve, causing a rise in prices of up to one point on the week. The gains recorded by both short and long-dated gilts made last week the healthiest for the market since Black Wednesday on September 16, when the pound left the exchange rate mechanism. Yields fell slightly, with the 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond maturing in 1997 seeing a fall in yield of about 10 basis points to 8.3 per cent on Friday night. There was a similar reduction in the yield of the 9 per cent Treasury stock due in 2012, which had a yield quoted at 9.27 per cent at the end of the week. Some of the gains in price for stock of the long-dated variety - demand for which had been slack in the previous two weeks - reflected the perception by some investors that the price falls for these bonds had made the securities something of a bargain. Helping the recovery in gilt prices was the healthier tone to sterling, which advanced to more than DM2.50 by Friday night, well up on the levels of around DM2.40 earlier in the week. Some of the gains in sterling were the result of a settling of nerves in the currency markets after the traumas of the pound's devaluation. Perceptions from Germany that the Bundesbank might be getting ready to ease credit rates following signs of an increasingly-serious German economic slow-down helped to push the D-Mark down against sterling as well as other currencies. Assuming sterling continues to perform reasonably strongly and the German central bank cuts rates in the next month or so, the way would probably be clear for a base rate reduction from 9 per cent to around 8 per cent by the end of the year, helping gilt prices at the short end of the market. Expectations that the Bank of England may be preparing the ground for a cut in base rates strengthened slightly on Friday when the Bank announced it would issue Pounds 800m of 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bonds due in 1997 at a price of Pounds 102, available from today. With the Bank's funding needs for this financial year virtually complete, the Bank had no specific requirement to issue this kind of stock. Since issuance of such short-dated securities have in the past presaged a reduction in base rates, some market participants believed the announcement was another pointer towards an easing in short-term borrowing rates fairly soon. The gilts market was little impressed by the announcement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of a new inflation target for Britain. Under Mr Lamont's plan, the Treasury will try and keep underlying inflation - as measured by the year-on-year rise in the retail prices index, excluding mortgage payments - at between 1 and 4 per cent. The level of 4 per cent happens to be what the underlying growth in this measure was in the 12 months to September. However, several market participants said that Mr Lamont was careful to provide an escape clause, with the suggestion that the target could be allowed to be exceeded in the event of unexpected price movements resulting from changes in the terms of trade - such as might result from a devaluation in sterling.</p>

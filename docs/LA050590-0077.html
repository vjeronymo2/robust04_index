			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIRM AWARDED $11.7 MILLION IN PLANT FIRE  </P> <P> A Chatsworth aircraft parts maker was awarded $11.7 million Friday by a  Superior Court jury that supported the company's allegation that a defective  circuit breaker caused a fire that destroyed its manufacturing plant.  </P> <P> The jury sided with Dunlap &amp; Abbott Manufacturing Co. in a suit filed  against Square D Co., which made the circuit breaker.  </P> <P> The award represents damages to cover the costs of the fire and lost profits  but no punitive damages, said Mark Roth, a lawyer who represented Dunlap &amp;  Abbott.  </P> <P> "I feel good. I think it was a fair award," Dunlap &amp; Abbott owner Ted  McCarthy said shortly after the verdict was announced.  </P> <P> Officials of Square D, a major producer of electric products, could not be  reached for comment. The jury's decision was announced after the close of  business hours at Square D's headquarters in Palatine, Ill.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the law firm which represented Square D in the case also could not  be reached.  </P> <P> The flash fire gutted Dunlap &amp; Abbott's plant on Sunburst Street on June 4,  1984, injuring nine people and destroying the company's collection of  computerized lathes and drills. The company, which makes a variety of metal and  hydraulic parts for aircraft and missiles, rebuilt the football-field-size  plant the following year.  </P> <P> Dunlap &amp; Abbott later sued Square D, alleging that the circuit breaker  failed to trip a short circuit in the plant's electrical wiring and thus  started the fire. The trial lasted four months, and the 12-member jury in San  Fernando deliberated 3 1/2 days before reaching its verdict.  </P></p>

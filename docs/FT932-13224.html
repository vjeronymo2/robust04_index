			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Bank of Japan criticises Clinton THE Bank of Japan yesterday joined the rising chorus of Japanese criticism of President Clinton's remarks a week ago which have fuelled the rapid appreciation of the yen over the past few days. A senior bank official said it was highly inappropriate that the foreign exchange market should be moved by improper comments which were not well thought out. The official accused the US administration of toying with exchange rates amid confusion in their ranks about the mix of policies needed to reduce the US trade deficit with Japan. President Clinton suggested a stronger yen was one of several factors working to reduce Japan's trade surplus. 'There are some dangerous signs that there is too much toying around with exchange rates,' the official said. If the purposal is to reduce the international trade imbalance then the policy should be applied more consistently and not undermine the efforts we are making to revive the economy.' He warned that the yen's rise risked stifling the incipient recovery in the Japanese economy. Japanese politicians and officials are torn in their response to the currency's rise. A string of leading politicians has attacked President Clinton's remarks over the past few days. Mr Yoshiro Mori, the trade minister yesterday said he felt 'extremely angry' at the way the US administration had talked up the yen. However, Mr Miyazawa and other senior officials have attempted to mute the criticism for fear of further straining economic relations with the US which threaten to become increasingly fraught.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Science GCSE results welcomed: British Association for the Advancement of Science THE British Association gave an enthusiastic welcome to this week's results of the GCSEs, the main examination for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. The association said it was particularly pleased about the rapid increase in entries to the broadly based science exams, which had risen from 145,000 in 1991 to 240,000 this year. Professor Jeff Thompson, association chairman, said the switch from individual science subjects - biology, chemistry and physics - to 'broad and balanced' science was good news because 'it will provide a better understanding of science as part of a general education for the majority of students'. He denied suggestions that the new GCSE science courses represented any lowering of standards. According to an association statement the science results reflected 'the increasing familiarity of teachers with the demands of the new examination and the hard work which has been going on over the last five years'. Sir David Attenborough, association president, forecast that the upturn in GCSE science results might lead to an improvement in science A-level results in two or three years' time. Peat bogs are being destroyed by drainage and harvesting, the meeting was told. Conservationists said the bogs enable scientists to trace environmental and archaeological changes over thousands of years because the acidic and oxygen-free conditions preserve organic materials. The meeting heard that harvesting particularly affected lowland raised bogs  -those which grow above the mineral water table.</p>

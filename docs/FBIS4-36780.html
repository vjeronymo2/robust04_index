Al-Ghazali Notes Need to Implement `Divine Injunctions'  <H5>  AUTHORITIES CONTINUE DETENTION OF 33 LAWYERS </H5>   An approximately 450-word report on pages 1 and 7 by Mu'tazz  al- Hadidi indicates that the Central Cairo Prosecution Office  has extended for 15 days the detention of 33 lawyers who were  arrested in connection with the Lawyers Association incidents.  It adds that the Prosecution Office released 15 others,  including 6 citizens who were arrested randomly off the streets  during a clash between police and lawyers, and it names the  freed lawyers. Al-Hadidi says the freed lawyers assembled at  the court and protested the continued detention of their  colleagues; meanwhile the security forces surrounded the court.  A number of lawyers who attended the court session held a  meeting at which they called for a expanded conference of  lawyers on Thursday and formed a committee, made up of 24  lawyers, to act as a link between the Bar Association Council  and the lawyers.    The report says that over 250 lawyers who attended the  meeting decided to keep the offices of the detained lawyers  operating. It adds that the lawyers issued a statement after  the conference saying that "we lawyers will not retreat, despite  the bombs and arrests, but will continue the escalation in  continuation of the Egyptian lawyers' awakening and national  uprising, which history will record came after the assassination  of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani." The lawyers affirmed, the report  says, that "the regime" is making "overt" attempts to  "discourage" the lawyers and "bury their revolution" and that  they will not forget their "primary motive," the murder of their  colleague, lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani.  <H5>  HUMAN RIGHTS BODY PROTESTS MILITARY TRIBUNALS, EXECUTIONS </H5>   An approximately 350-word report on pages 1 and 7 says the  Egyptian Human Rights Organization [EHRO] has issued a statement  on the trial of 17 defendants charged with the attempted  assassination of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, The statement  expresses concern over the continued military trials. The  report adds that the EHRO "notes its regret that its repeated  appeals to the Egyptian authorities to stop referring civilians  to military courts and to stop enforcing sentences passed by  these courts have not met response."    The organization appeals to all "civil society institutions"  and all Arab and world human rights organizations to urge the  Egyptian authorities to stop these military tribunals.  <H5>  ARTICLE URGES IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH SUDAN </H5>   An approximately 1,800-word article on page 2 by Major  General Tal'at Musallam discusses the current deterioration of  Egyptian- Sudanese ties, reviewing each side's claims and  accusations against the other. Urging improved relations  between the two countries by consolidating previous bilateral  accords, the author asserts the need to insure Sudan's  territorial integrity and for Egypt not to support any  resolution placing Sudan on the list of countries sponsoring  terrorism. He notes that the contentious points between the two  countries include the Hala'ib border dispute, mutual media  propaganda, and Egypt's refusal in April to extradite the  hijacker of a Sudanese plane.  <H5>  COURT HEARING OF LAWYERS CASE REPORTED </H5>   Page 3 of AL-SHA'B features an approximately 700-word report  by Khalid Yunus on the Southern Cairo Court's session "last  Thursday," in which the court extended the detention of the  lawyers arrested in connection with the Bar Association  demonstration. Yunus says thousands of lawyers as well as the  detainees' families assembled in the court yard and that anger  and enthusiasm gripped everyone, who shouted slogans like "Long  live the Bar Association" and "Prison has never changed a  thought." He adds that hundreds of Central Security Forces  personnel were deployed inside the court equipped with tear gas  bombs and rubber bullets, poised to "repeat the tragedy of  striking against the lawyers inside their association on 17 May."    The reporter says that a defense lawyer moved that the items  seized at the site of the lawyers' arrest are not proof of a  crime. The items included a video cassette of a debate at a book  fair two years ago between Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, Dr.  Muhammad 'Amarah, and Dr. Faraj Fudah, a video cassette on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and another cassette on Afghanistan.    The reporter adds that the doyen of Lawyers Ahmad  al-Khawajah  in his defense statement denied that the Muslim Brotherhood  members of the Bar Association had prompted the lawyers to  demonstrate or that "overzealous" young lawyers had accused the  association of inaction and demanded "serious moves."  <H5>  WRITER CRITICIZES ORGANIZATION OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE </H5>   On page 5, AL-SHA'B publishes an approximately 2,000-word  article by Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad, who criticizes the ruling  National Democratic Party's call for a national dialogue and its  organization of the dialogue. The writer says there is an  intention to "overstep" the role of the preparatory committee of  the dialogue and "jump" directly to convening the conference  without prior agreement among the parties concerned on the tasks  entrusted with them.    He adds that by specifying the "legitimate" national forces  who are to take part in the dialogue, the ruling party  disparages the Muslim Brotherhood as an organization. But, he  continues, it is inconceivable that the ruling party will  exclude from the dialogue all leading personalities in Islamic  thought who act as individuals and intellectuals, or al-Azhar  University in its capacity as a cultural institution with an  Islamic character. Murad notes: "The Constitution, which is  currently intended to be violated, stipulates that Islam is the  national religion and that the Islamic shari'ah principles are  the primary guides for legislation. Naturally, nothing prevents  the participation of anyone who represents the Christian  intellectual trend."  <H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL URGES NO CONFRONTATION </H5>   Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Mustafa Mashhur  writes a 2,000-word article on page 5, noting the "artificial  security and media campaign" against the Muslim Brotherhood and  urging patience. (Text filed as NC1106152694 and adds)  <H5>  OFFICIALS ASSERT AL-GHAZALI NOT BANNED FROM SPEECHES </H5>   A 170-word report on the same page says that after "the  public's overwhelming anger," officials "rushed" to meet Shaykh  Muhammad al- Ghazali to assert to him that he was not banned  from making speeches.    The report adds that the interior minister met Shaykh  al-Ghazali "last week" and affirmed to him before "television  and press cameras" that the Interior Ministry views him with  "every appreciation and respect and that it would be nonsensical  for the ministry to ban his speeches." This week, the report  says, the Awqaf minister visited al-Ghazali at his home and  confirmed to him that his ministry has nothing to do with  banning him from speeches.  <H5>  IRAN'S VELAYATI VIEWS TIES WITH ARABS, TERRORISM, BOSNIA </H5>   Page 6 features a 1,800-word interview with Iranian Foreign  Minister Velayati, who discusses relations with the Arabs,  terrorism, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. (Text filed as NC1006160594  and adds)  <H5>  ARTICLE VIEWS CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISLAMISTS, MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD </H5>   In an approximately 1,000-word article on page 7, the  author,  Dr. Majdi Qarqar, discuses campaign against Muslim Brotherhood  leaders and the "Islamic trend." (Text filed as NC1106181794  and add)  <H5>  WRITER NOTES ANTI-ISLAM POLICY IN TUNISIA </H5>   In an approximately 1,800-word article on page 8, Lutfi  Bin-Ramadan reviews Tunisian-Algerian relations. He notes that  the "ruling secular elite" in Tunisia is aware that its "war of  annihilation" against the Islamic movement cannot end up in its  favor in "an Arab and Islamic environment permeated by Islamic  awakening and in an international environment quickly heading  toward democracy." Therefore, he says, the Tunisian "regime"  took the "fight against fundamentalism as an ideology to all  international forums."    The writer says that the situation in Algeria has confused  the Tunisian regime and made it lose its balance so badly that  it will be difficult to predict the regime's behavior should the  Islamists take power in Algeria. He notes three possibilities:  First, the Tunisian regime may open up to the Islamic  opposition, free its prisoners, and restore democracy. The  author dismisses this possibility because the "ruling elite" is  "indulging in hostility to Islam as a religion." The second  possibility is that it will concentrate on the economic aspect,  the flow of Western financial aid, and turn a blind eye to "the  laundering of drug money." The third option is that Tunisia  might play the same role the "Iraqi regime" played in the  Iranian revolution. This option does not exclude the  possibility of Tunisia turning into a "base where foreign  forces--especially the French who are linked with the Tunisian  regime by a joint defense pact--would assemble."  <H5>  EUROPEAN RACIST POLICIES AGAINST ARAB, MUSLIM MIGRANTS CITED </H5>   An approximately 900-word report on page 8 by Muhammad Jamal  'Arafah discusses European countries' recent measures to  restrict the flow of foreign emigrants, especially Arabs and  Muslims. The reporter cites regulations in many European  countries to reduce the number of Arab and Muslim migrants,  deport some of them, and incorporate others in the "fabric" of  these countries.  <H5>  AL-GHAZALI NOTES NEED TO IMPLEMENT `DIVINE INJUNCTIONS' </H5>   AL-SHA'B publishes on page 12 a 380-word article written by  Muhammad al-Ghazali, who criticizes a television debate by three  intellectuals on the books and views of some late Islamic  intellectuals.    Commenting on the debate, al-Ghazali says that blocking  "God's ruling is a crime" and notes the need to implement  "divine injunctions and curb human whims."</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Spargo for market with Pounds 12m tag Spargo Consulting is coming to the market by way of a placing which values the computer software consultancy based in London's Docklands at about Pounds 11.9m. Some 3.18m shares, approximately 25 per cent of the issued share capital, have been placed by Peel Hunt at 95p each. All the shares were sold by existing shareholders and no money has been raised for the company. Dealings are expected to begin on June 9. Founded in 1989 by Mr Tony Spargo and Mr Bob Morton, chief executive and chairman respectively, the company specialises in the design, implementation and enhancement (maintenance) of software for large companies. Clients include Bank of America, Bupa, Conoco and Elf. In the 1993 year, the company made profits before tax of Pounds 483,000 on turnover of Pounds 4.87m. Directors forecast that, excluding unforeseen circumstances, profits before tax in the six months to end-June 1994 will be not less than Pounds 600,000, giving earnings per share of 3.1p. They anticipate a maiden interim dividend of not less than 1.6p, which would represent a notional gross yield, at the placing price, of more than 2 per cent for the half year. Over the full year, analysts are suggesting a p/e of about 14.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / German Elections: Kohl victory a reassurance for markets - Relief at verdict on FDP The prospect of victory, although narrow, for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative coalition in yesterday's German general election, was welcomed last night by economists and is expected to remove an element of uncertainty from financial markets. Both the bond and stock markets have swung from pessimism about the possibility of an opposition victory to optimism and gains last week as polls showed Mr Kohl's government was likely to be re-elected. Although Mr Kohl's majority was expected to be wafer-thin, there was relief that the Free Democrats (FDP), the junior coalition party, had succeeded in re-entering the Bonn parliament after failing in recent state elections. Because a victory for Mr Kohl, head of the Christian Democratic party (CDU), had been discounted in financial markets, economists did not expect bond and equity markets to show further gains today. Mr Kermit Schoenholtz, senior economist at Salomon Brothers International in London, said that, if expectations of a Kohl victory were borne out, the effect on markets would be rather modest. 'I would not be surprised to see the initial reaction rather muted,' agreed Mr Richard Reid, Frankfurt-based economist with UBS Global Research. Noting that bond markets had been affected by concern over global inflation, he said Mr Kohl's likely victory had now removed any extra worries over political stability in Germany. 'This has got to be good for bonds and stocks,' he added. Even though the majority of the Bonn coalition, also including the Christian Social Union (CSU) of Bavaria, looked thin, he said: 'These coalitions tend to work very closely.' He thought, too, the election result should make easier the Bundesbank's job of controlling the money supply and inflation. 'It removes a big question mark.' Ever since unification in 1990, the year of the last general election, the central bank has been concerned about the impact on prices of the high public spending needed to rebuild the east German economy. Despite the coalition's apparent victory over the Social Democrats (SPD), Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Kidder Peabody's London operation, noted 'it's going to be a very splintered parliament'. The Greens won more seats and the east German-based Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) looked likely to benefit from discontent in the east. Thus she thought that, while markets would react favourably to last night's result, investors and traders might consider Mr Kohl's freedom of manoeuvre  -especially in fiscal policy - to be more limited. As for the Bundesbank, she said the reaction there might be one of caution. If budgetary and tax packages, needed to continue paying the high cost of German integration, took too long to get through parliament, 'the Bundesbank might flex its muscles'. But this did not mean it would immediately put interest rates up. Mr Schoenholtz thought the central bank could take comfort from steady economic growth which did need not need the aid of lower interest rates.</p>

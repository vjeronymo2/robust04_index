			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hadleigh deficit cut to Pounds 187,000 A return to profitable trading enabled Hadleigh Industries, the USM-quoted specialist supplier of transport and storage products and services, to reduce losses from Pounds 1.43m to Pounds 187,000 pre-tax for the year to April 3. The group returned a Pounds 170,000 profit in the second half and benefited from a Pounds 224,000 reduction in full year exceptional provisions to Pounds 98,000 and a Pounds 203,000 fall in interest charges to Pounds 499,000. Turnover slipped from Pounds 29.5m to Pounds 27.3m. However, the forward order book is 'the strongest it has ever been' and the directors looked forward to a 'successful year'. Losses per share were cut to 1p (11.2p). The interim dividend was omitted (1.25p) but a final of 0.5p (nil) is proposed. Year-end gearing was reduced from 73 per cent to 44 per cent. The share price improved by 5p to end the day at 80p.</p>

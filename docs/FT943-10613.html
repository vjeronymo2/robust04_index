			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Cardoso's deputy replaced: Brazilian election Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's former finance minister, has replaced his running-mate for the presidential election on October 3, after allegations of corruption, writes Patrick McCurry in Sao Paulo. The decision came a week after Mr Cardoso's main opponent, left-winger Mr Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, dropped his vice-presidential candidate, also after corruption claims. Leaders of Mr Cardoso's election alliance installed Senator Marco Maciel in place of Senator Guilherme Palmeira on Tuesday night. Both are from the conservative Liberal Front party, the main electoral partner of Mr Cardoso's centrist Brazilian Social Democratic party. The allegations surrounding Mr Palmeira related to the claimed misuse of federal budget funds for public works.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: VSEL bid fever Submarine maker VSEL jumped 25 to 1520p as rumours ran round the market that the expected increased takeover offer from electronics giant GEC was about to be unveiled early next week, possibly topping the present 1491p all-share bid from British Aerospace by more than Pounds 1. GEC itself dipped 3 1/2 to 274p while BAe extended its recent strong run, rising 9 to 452p for a two-day advance of 18. Insurance sector switching sparked a modest run in Commercial Union, pushing the shares up 8 to 530p largely at the expense of General Accident which dipped 4 to 541p after what was thought to be a cautious note from a leading broking house. Sun Alliance was the most active shares in the sector shedding 3 to 314p in 3.3m turnover as a large line of stock - 1.7m shares - passed through the market. A two-way pull in Storehouse, which reported favourable figures on Thursday, saw the shares edge forward a half to 214 1/2 p. NatWest Securities urged investors to buy the shares saying: 'The rating still does not reflect the potential. The predictability of the numbers is now being complemented by management stability and aggressive expansion (but not diversification).' Concern about Christmas trading continued to weaken several retail stocks. Marks &amp; Spencer gave up 6 to 398p and Body Shop lost 3 to 209p. Dixons shed a penny to 185p. Fading bid hopes for Hazelwood Food, and nervous trading ahead of Tuesday's figures, left the shares 3 off at 106p. Profits downgradings in Allied Domecq before and after the group reported interim figures that disappointed the market, continued to overhang the stock. The shares relinquished 2 1/2 to 553p. Analysts at NatWest Securities suggested the shares were 'fully valued' at current levels but added: 'Allied has disappointed the market through failures of form rather than content. It has produced what will probably turn out to be the best performance of its peer group in spirits.' On turnover of 24m shares, freight specialist NFC was yesterday's most actively traded stock as the second leg of a spate of bed and breakfast, or tax-related, deals went through the market. The shares gained 2 to 174p ahead of the company's full-year results, due on December 6. British Airways added 2 to 375p, shaking off worries about an increase in airport tax in next week's Budget and concentrating on the next set of monthly traffic figures. Due December 5, these are expected to show an increase of 5 per cent for November. Footwear maker Pentland Group gained 4 to 103p in turnover of 9.7m with a large line of stock changing hands. There were two deals of more than 4m shares done at 104p and 105p but suggestions of a strategic move of the cash-rich company (it has bank balances worth half its Pounds 370m market capitalisation) were not taken seriously by analysts yesterday. Tobacco group Rothmans International jumped 17 to 440p, after reporting a better than anticipated 18 per cent increase in interim profits to Pounds 275.9m. Favourable press comment boosted giftware group Bullers, helping the shares add 1 1/2 to 20 1/2 p.</p>

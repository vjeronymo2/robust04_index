			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Sport: US falls for all-American German boy and his sport - Soccer IN THE past 10 days, the performance of a German-born, German-raised soccer star who plays in the German professional leagues and who barely speaks a word of English has done more to raise the spirits of soccer fans in the US than anyone since the great Brazilian Pele arrived in New York in the early 1970s. In two games, Thomas Dooley, who was recently awarded US citizenship because of his American GI father, scored three goals for the US national team and led his newly adopted country to an improbable victory over England and a highly creditable 4-3 loss to the world champions, Germany. In the process, Dooley and his team mates turned the US Cup '93 (a four-team contest arranged as a dress rehearsal for next year's World Cup) into a genuinely competitive tournament, and awoke the interest of a surprisingly large number of US sports fans, many of whom at this stage of the year would normally be occupied with baseball, basketball, golf or giant dump-truck racing. The newspapers and weekly magazines afforded the tournament considerable coverage, highlights were shown on the evening sports news broadcasts, and the historic victory over the English earned an editorial in the Wall Street Journal, cheekily entitled 'College Boys Shame England'. The size of the audience for the only US Cup game that was shown live on network television (US against Germany on ABC) surprised everyone: roughly 2.6m households watched the game, an audience larger than for some regular-season baseball and ice hockey games. Although the game was only up against a repeat of a National Geographic show and an 'infomercial' on the other two networks, the ABC figures delighted the organisers of next year's World Cup. Alan Rothenberg, head of World Cup USA 1994, described the numbers as 'spectacular,' adding, 'I don't think anybody dreamed we would get that.' More importantly, the game itself won rave reviews. Hank Steinbrecher, executive director of the US soccer federation, said that 'seven goals is a pretty good advertisement for ABC and for soccer.' Yet, in spite of the healthy audience, some critics still believe that Americans will not turn on to World Cup soccer in large numbers next year. In an acerbic column in the New York Times, Richard Sandomir, who writes regularly on TV sports, insisted that soccer and television do not mix. Soccer, he said, was a game played on too large a field to offer the intimacy that makes sport attractive viewing. Sandomir also argued that watching a 90-minute game with commercial breaks only at half-time was too exhausting for the average US sports fan. (In a revolutionary move, ABC broadcast the game commercial-free.) Although Sandomir was writing clearly with his tongue in his cheek (soccer, he said, 'takes place across enough tundra for a Dr Zhivago remake'), he has a point. Americans are used to consuming their sport in easily digested, bite-sized pieces - there have to be long enough gaps between each period, quarter, inning, or whatever, to crack open another can of Budweiser, wolf down another hot dog, visit the toilet and still have enough time before the game resumes to curse your team. Televised World Cup football is going to remain a hard sell, even though the coverage of the US Cup games was surprisingly alert and sophisticated, considering ABC had never done this kind of thing before. The coverage on the cable station Sportschannel America, however, was less successful, primarily because play was regularly broken up by commercials. This was extremely disconcerting: 'Snackers, a chocolate bar that really satisfies' cut back to the game 'Oooooh, England almost scored there.' Fortunately, the attendances at the World Cup games should be impressive. If 250,000 people turn up for six games in a 'friendly' tournament such as the US Cup, there will be plenty of enthusiasm when the real thing comes around. Demand for domestically-available World Cup tickets has already proved voracious and almost the entire allocation for US-based fans has been sold. Last Sunday, Rothenberg said it was 'absolutely incredible' that stadiums in New York and other big cities that morning had sold tens of thousands of group tickets (costing anywhere between Dollars 140 and Dollars 400 for five games) in the space of just a few hours. The promise Rothenberg made two and a half years ago to sell every ticket for every game (a promise which at the time drew cynical laughs from European journalists) looks as if it will be kept. Print and television commercials advertising World Cup 1994 have also begun to appear, as the organising committee fires the first shots of a year-long marketing campaign. The slogan for the commercials, 'Don't Miss It For The World', is clearly aimed at feeding on the American enthusiasm for events staged on the grandest of scales. The nine stadiums, many of which will put their European counterparts (okay, their English counterparts) to shame, will all be ready on time. Some of them, such as Giants Stadium outside New York and the indoor Silverdome near Detroit, where England and Germany will play tonight in the first indoor international, will prove spectacular showcases for the game's premier tournament. All in all, the organisers are pleased with the progress of their preparations, especially the success of the US Cup. 'We've had huge attendances, a good television rating and a tournament that has come off without any significant hitch . . . We're over the moon,' said Jim Trecker, senior vice president of World Cup '94, a man who has clearly learned one of the most important elements of the game of soccer - know your cliches.</p>

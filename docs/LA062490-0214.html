			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILI HAS A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, BUT LOSS TO THE TIGERS SPOILS IT  </P> <P> It was a game Angel designated hitter Chili Davis should have been able to  savor.  </P> <P> Saturday night, Davis hit two home runs, including one that landed deep into  the right-center field bleachers in the sixth inning. He showed some offensive  versatility, bunting for a single in the second inning and scoring three runs  on the night.  </P> <P> But in the clubhouse afterward, Davis had the same blank look on his face as  his teammates had following the Angels' 9-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers before  50,527 in Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> "It feels good to hit the ball hard a couple of times, but I wish we could have  won the game," said Davis, whose team failed to capitalize on an opportunity to  move within 7 1/2 games of the first-place Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> "But the way I look at it, these guys have been carrying me most of the year,  Lance (Parrish) and Wally (Joyner). Someone else has got to do something  eventually."  </P> <P> It was Fireworks Night at Anaheim Stadium, but most of the Angels, with the  exception of Davis, were firing duds against Tiger starter Jeff Robinson.  </P> <P> Robinson, who played at Azusa Pacific College and El Cajon Christian High  School, had a career 3-0 record and 1.59 earned-run average against the Angels  entering the game.  </P> <P> Robinson wasn't as spectacular as he was in 1988, when he registered 10-1, 6-1  and 6-0 victories against the Angels, but the right-hander still got the  victory, allowing seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. Jerry Don Gleaton and Mike  Henneman allowed three hits in the remaining 3 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> "Historically, I don't ever remember hitting Robinson well -- he's the toughest  pitcher on their staff for me to hit," said Davis, who had two hits in 10  previous at-bats against Robinson. "He has good stuff -- a decent fastball and  good off-speed pitches to go with it."  </P> <P> But Davis had Robinson's number Saturday night. He surprised him in the second  inning, laying a bunt toward third base for a single.  </P> <P> "I used to lead off when I was a rookie," Davis said. "I've always been able to  bunt."  </P> <P> In the fourth, Davis hit a home run over the center field fence off Robinson.  </P> <P> And then Davis hit a Robinson pitch deep into the right-field bleachers in the  sixth inning. One batter later, Robinson came out of the game.  </P> <P> It marked the 13th time in his nine-year, major league career that Davis has  hit two home runs in a game and the fifth time he has accomplished the feat as  an Angel. Davis last hit two home runs in a game Aug. 4, 1989 against the  Milwaukee Brewers.  </P> <P> The three-for-four performance Saturday night also helped Davis snap out of a  slump in which he had just five hits in his last 34 at-bats (.147) going into  Friday night's game.  </P> <P> But Davis walked and doubled in two-at bats Friday, and lifted his average to  .272 with Saturday night's performance. He has nine home runs and 34 RBIs.  </P> <P> "I didn't even know I was in a slump," Davis said. "I think I've been swinging  the bat pretty well. I haven't been striking out and I've been walking a lot.  Hits just haven't been falling in. For me, it was nothing to worry about. It  was just a matter of time."  </P></p>

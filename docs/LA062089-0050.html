			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ESCROW FIRM'S CLIENTS TO GET PARTIAL REFUNDS;  </P> <P> 10% OF FUNDS TO BE HELD FOR 'POSSIBLE SHORTAGES'  </P> <P> Three months after state officials seized an Encino escrow firm, the Escrow  Shoppe, and froze $5.5 million of customers' money, the customers are finally  getting their money back -- but not all of it.  </P> <P> Last week, Russell A. Greenwood, a court-appointed receiver examining the  Escrow Shoppe's books, unfroze most of the money but withheld 10% of each  customer's amount. Why? Judy Hartley, a senior lawyer with the state Department  of Corporations, which licenses escrow firms, said up to $450,000 of the money  might still be missing.  </P> <P> The Escrow Shoppe had about 350 pending transactions when it was seized.  </P> <P> One customer, David Fein, said he was glad that he was finally getting his  cash, but "annoyed" that 10% of his money is being withheld because of  continuing confusion over the Escrow Shoppe mess.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Should Be Cleared Up'  </P> <P> "I would think by now it should be cleared up whether there are missing funds  or not," said Fein, who had sold his house in Woodland Hills just as the Escrow  Shoppe was seized and whose five-figure profit on the sale was frozen.  </P> <P> Firms such as the Escrow Shoppe help ensure that buyers and sellers of real  estate meet certain conditions, such as obtaining a title search, and hold  documents and cash transferred between the parties until the sale is completed.  </P> <P> When the Department of Corporations seized the Escrow Shoppe in mid-March, it  alleged that the firm had made $3 million in unauthorized payments and that  about $200,000 of customers' funds might be missing. The agency alleged, among  other things, that the firm had shifted money from some pending escrow accounts  to pay customers closing other escrow accounts -- all without customer  authorization. The state also froze the customers' money to get an accurate  accounting of the Escrow Shoppe's assets.  </P> <P> But as the state investigated, customers grew furious. With their money frozen,  they could not complete their transactions unless they put up more money. Their  financial and housing plans were thrown into chaos, and authorities could not  predict when the money would become available.  </P> <P> Hartley said 10% of customers' money is still being withheld "to cover possible  shortages" but said she had no additional details. Susan Allison, a lawyer for  Greenwood's office, would say only that "we have to pursue what are some  unexplained transactions."  </P> <P> Sandra Bianco is the owner of the Escrow Shoppe and one of her attorneys,  Thomas Warden, said he was aware of the state's concern about the possible  shortages but that he had no details. He also noted that there is no criminal  action pending against Bianco, nor is she facing any formal proceedings.  </P> <P> The indications of further shortages appear to be at least partly related to a  civil suit filed May 1 in Los Angeles Superior Court by Los Angeles Martinique  Investments, a real-estate partnership, against the Escrow Shoppe, Bianco and  another firm owned by Bianco named Encino Equity Services.  </P> <P> Encino Equity is a so-called accommodator firm used in commercial real estate  deals. Specifically, when a group wants to sell one property at a profit and  reinvest that profit in another property without paying taxes on the profit in  the meantime, it must use an accommodator to hold the profit as a third party  until the money is reinvested.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Los Angeles Martinique pursued such a deal. According to its  suit, the partnership sold a Hollywood apartment complex in February for a  $451,000 profit, using the Escrow Shoppe as its escrow firm. Then it turned  over the profit to Encino Equity -- which had been recommended by the Escrow  Shoppe as its accommodator -- as it searched for a new property in which to  invest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Escrow Shoppe Seized  </P> <P> On March 16, it found a new apartment building to buy and asked Encino Equity  to deposit the partnership's $451,000 for its purchase of the new property. But  Encino Equity never turned over the money, the suit alleged.  </P> <P> Four days later, the Department of Corporations seized the Escrow Shoppe. The  partnership's lawsuit accuses the defendants of fraud, breach of contract and  negligence, among other things, and asserts that the Escrow Shoppe and Encino  Equity were insolvent and that the defendants' "secret intent" was not to  complete the transaction, "but rather to close both businesses and to retain  the sale proceeds for their own use." The two firms and Bianco denied the  suit's allegations.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Martinique is not among the Escrow Shoppe customers getting 90% of  their money back. Los Angeles Martinique's attorney Howard Grady explained that  technically it was out of escrow, it had closed the sale of the first apartment  building and its money was not part of the $5.5 million in the Escrow Shoppe's  trust fund that was frozen.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the major players in the Escrow Shoppe mess are spreading the blame  for why the customers' money had to remain frozen for three months.  </P> <P> Hartley of the Department of Corporations said her agency had to go to court to  get the necessary records because of delays by the Escrow Shoppe, Encino Equity  and their lawyers.  </P> <P> But Warden said his people did cooperate, that the state's court action was  unnecessary and that the delay was caused by Greenwood, who was "very slow in  doing his accounting."  </P></p>

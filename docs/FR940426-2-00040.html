In addition, contaminated sediments can have impacts on water quality even when additional pollutants are no longer being added by any other source. It is intended that sediment quality criteria be protective of benthic organisms and be used to: Assess the extent of sediment contamination, aid in implementing measures that limit or prevent additional contamination, and identify when appropriate remediation activities are needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 304 (a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1314(a)(1)), directs EPA to develop and publish criteria reflecting the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic life, wildlife and recreation. EPA has periodically issued ambient water quality criteria guidance, beginning with the publication of ``Water Quality Criteria 1972''. All criteria guidance through late 1986 was summarized in an EPA document entitled ``Quality Criteria for Water, 1986.'' EPA has subsequently published, from time to time, new ambient water quality criteria guidance for additional pollutants or revised existing criteria guidance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's criteria documents are intended to provide a comprehensive toxicological evaluation of each chemical addressed therein, based on available information. For toxic pollutants, the documents tabulate the numeric acute and chronic toxicity information for aquatic life and, where sufficient information is available, derive the numeric criteria maximum concentrations (acute criteria) and the numeric criteria continuous concentrations (chronic criteria) that the Agency recommends to protect aquatic life resources. The documents also provide recommended criteria to protect human health. EPA has published numeric aquatic life criteria for 30 priority pollutants and human health criteria for 91 priority pollutants. Aquatic life criteria address potential water column impacts only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is now proposing sediment quality criteria for five priority pollutant chemicals (endrin, dieldrin, fluoranthene, phenanthrene, and acenaphthene) that EPA has determined are present in the sediment of the Nation's waters and cause or have the potential to cause adverse effects to the water column and benthic assemblages and their hierarchical foodchains including humans. Pursuant to Section 104 of the Clean Water Act, the Agency has conducted research, experiments and demonstrations and has studied the effects of contaminated sediment on freshwater, marine, and estuarine aquatic life. EPA used this information to develop the proposed sediment quality criteria, which represent EPA's first effort to develop sediment quality criteria. These five chemicals were selected because of their known toxicity, hydrophobicity, and persistence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA developed the proposed sediment quality criteria using a methodology called the Equilibrium Partitioning Approach which was selected after considering a variety of approaches that could be used to assess sediment contamination. Technical reviews of the methodology and supporting science was conducted by the EPA Science Advisory Board (SAB) in February 1989 and June 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data collected in support of the ambient aquatic life water quality criteria or an equivalent data base were also used to derive the proposed sediment quality criteria. Sediment criteria concentrations are expressed as micrograms chemical per gram organic carbon and apply to sediments with >/=0.2% organic carbon.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Robert Perciasepe,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Administrator for Water.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10055 Filed 4&hyph;25&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (23): Ways to cut call failure rates - Cordless Phones Ever since the first telephone was demonstrated by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, telephony has been associated with the office and workplace. The traditional PABX (private automatic branch exchange) and the hard-wired extension still plays a pivotal role in most offices but in recent years a new breed of cordless telephone equipment has begun to appear. Cordless telephones have been available for use in the home for more than a decade. Generally these simple systems include a portable handset which communicates by radio with a fixed base-station which is connected to the public telephone system. However, in recent years technical advances, particularly the switch from analogue to digital radio transmission, has greatly increased the scope of cordless systems enabling high-capacity systems, capable of serving hundreds or even thousands of business users, to be built. The advantages of cordless business systems are easy to appreciate. In particular, workers are no longer tied to the desk where the hard-wired telephone sits and incoming calls have a much better chance of reaching their intended recipient. Surveys have shown that up to two-thirds of all business calls fail to reach their target, in about half these cases the person called is somewhere in the building, but can not be found - European industry spends about Pounds 10m a year on on-site paging and PA systems in an attempt to alleviate the problem. Cordless systems can reduce the call failure rate substantially, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction while cutting the cost of returned calls. Ericsson, the telecommunications equipment manufacturer, claims that cordless business system customers can save up to 30 per cent of their bills as a result. In addition, cordless systems can save on running costs. Most organisations running medium-sized or large PABX systems spend around 10 per cent of the capital cosy of the system on rewiring and other reconfiguration operations. Market analysts have predicted that these advantages will help cordless business systems capture between 20 and 30 per cent of the market by the turn of the century - equivalent to between 15m and 20m telephone extensions. In Europe, alone it is estimated that the market could be worth Dollars 15bn. Systems manufacturers such as GPT Communications Systems, a joint venture between Germany's Siemens group and Britain's GPT, tend to be more cautious suggesting that cordless systems could take between 10 and 15 per cent of the market by the year 2000. Either way, there are several obstacles to overcome - in particular there are two main competing cordless business system technologies, CT2 (Cordless Telephony 2) and Dect (Digital European Cordless Telecommunications.) CT2 was the first digital cordless technology to be developed in the UK during the 1980s and has been adopted as an interim European standard. It is the same technology used for Telepoint services in Europe and elsewhere. GPT Communications Systems and Canada's Northern Telecom have been supplying cordless office systems based upon CT2 digital technology - BT also supplies re-badged Northern Telecom systems. Northern Telecom, which is also developing a Dect system for up to 1,000-users in conjunction with Olivetti, launched its Companion CT2 cordless business systems in Europe in March last year and has sold over 900 systems in 13 European countries and the Middle East since then and over 2,000 systems worldwide. 'We believe that cordless will be a key differentiator in future PBX markets,' said Mr Chris Wade, director of personal communications systems for Northern Telecom Europe. Among recent customers for the Companion system has been Boehringer Ingelheim's French subsidiary. The pharmaceuticals group installed a companion system at its Reims site which houses 350 employees in a dozen buildings in December. The system, which has replaced pagers and walkie-talkies for mobile employees, has since been expanded and will cover 60 extensions by the end of this year. CT2's supporters claim it is a proven cost-effective technology ideally suited to small and medium sized offices or sites. Mr David Wright, International Marketing manager for GPT, claims that for most customers the technology itself is irrelevant - 'the issue is: which is going to be cheaper?' he says, and that will mostly depend on volumes. For the moment, CT2 handsets cost around a third of the price of their Dect rivals. And Mr Wright believes CT2 will continue to have a price advantage, in part because of the adoption of the technology outside Europe, for example in the Far East. Mr Wright says that perhaps surprisingly, customers so far for GPT's iSDX 100 cordless system in Britain have mainly been in the retail and manufacturing sectors, rather than offices. For example, one High Street retailer has installed cordless systems to enable its managers to return to the shop floor, rather than be stuck in the back office. Meanwhile, Axis Holdings, a Liverpool-based manufacturer of extruded polythene film and PVC profiles, has installed a cordless system to enable staff to respond quickly to customers. Systems based on the rival Dect standard, which is backed by ETSI (the European Telecoms Standards Institute) and was designed to solve the problem of providing cordless telephones in high-density business environments such as offices, begun to appear last year. The Dect standard has been adopted by five of Europe's largest telecommunications equipment suppliers - Alcatel, Ericsson, Nokia, Philips and Siemens - which between them represent nearly 70 per cent of the European PABX market. They argue that Dect systems have significant advantages over CT2, particularly for heavy use within large office buildings or for mixed voice and high speed data traffic. Ericsson has been one of the most active promotors of Dect systems and launched its Freeset system in Europe last autumn although it has been selling similar systems outside Europe for some time. The Freeset system works as an 'add-on' to a company's existing phone network and comprises three main components: a radio exchange which connects to the host PABX or key-system - or directly to the local telephone exchange in the case of a company using a centrex service; a number of low-powered radio base stations each of which can support up to 12 simultaneous calls, and up to 600 cordless handsets. For larger systems, a number of radio exchanges can be networked together. Freeset systems have been installed in manufacturing factories, hospitals and 'offices of the future' such as Digital Equipment's futuristic headquarters in Stockholm. A 160-extension Freeset system has been installed in Digital's 'Natural Office' where staff do not have permanent working positions. The system will be expanded to handle 600 extensions this year.</p>

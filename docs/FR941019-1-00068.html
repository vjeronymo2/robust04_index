			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters have sought clarification of various statutory limitations on liability, including the ceilings set forth in section 107(c) of CERCLA and the provision in section 107(f)(1) that excludes natural resource damages if those damages and the release that caused those damages occurred wholly before the enactment of CERCLA. The Department's regulations incorporate the statutory limitations on liability but do not provide any clarification of those limitations. 43 CFR 11.15(b) and 11.24(b)(1). The Department will consider the development of additional guidance if commenters identify specific areas of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Double Recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters have sought clarification of the prohibition against ``double recovery'' of damages contained in section 107(f)(1) of CERCLA. The Department's regulations incorporate this prohibition. 43 CFR &sect;&sect;11.15(d) and 11.84(c). Double recovery refers to the recovery of two or more damage amounts to restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or acquire the equivalent of the same injured resource or lost service or to compensate for the same lost public value. The Department will consider the development of additional guidance if commenters identify specific areas of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Threatened Releases and Discharges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another area of discussion has been the recovery of natural resource damages caused by the threat of a release or discharge. Section 107(a)(4) of CERCLA refers to liability for ``a release or a threatened release.'' However, section 107(a)(4)(C) refers to damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources ``resulting from such a release.'' Also, section 301(c) of CERCLA authorizes the Department to develop regulations for assessment of ``damages for injury to, destruction of, or loss of natural resources resulting from a release of oil or a hazardous substance.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's regulations address only damages resulting from an actual release or discharge. NOAA's proposed rule, relying on section 1002(a) of OPA, would allow for the assessment of diminished use of a resource resulting from the threat of a discharge. 59 FR 1169. The Department solicits comment on whether CERCLA allows for recovery of damages resulting from a threatened release and whether the Department's regulations should be revised to allow for the assessment of damages resulting from a threatened release or discharge. The Department also solicits examples of the types of damages that might be assessed in the case of a threatened discharge or release.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Archaeological and Cultural Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters have questioned whether CERCLA authorizes the recovery of damages for injury of archaeological and cultural resources. The Department believes that ``archaeological'' and ``cultural'' resources do not constitute ``natural resources'' as defined by CERCLA. However, the Department's regulations do permit trustee officials to include the loss of archaeological and cultural services provided by a natural resource in a natural resource damage assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Unused Damage Awards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters have suggested that the statutory requirement that damages be spent to restore, rehabilitate, replace, and/or acquire the equivalent of the injured resources dictates that any sums not used in this manner be returned to the PRPs. The Department's regulations provide that collected damages may only be used to fund actions described in the Restoration Plan and do not address the disposition of any ``excess'' funds. See 43 CFR 11.92(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that CERCLA requires all collected damages to be spent on restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources, which includes mitigation of the public loss of services during the recovery period. Therefore, all funds should be used for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. NEPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters sought clarification of whether the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) applies to assessments or restorations performed in accordance with the regulations. The Department does not anticipate addressing the applicability of NEPA in the damage assessment regulations. However, the Department believes that the information needed for the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan should fulfill the requirements of NEPA, with equivalent opportunities for public input. Thus if NEPA were applicable to an assessment or restoration activity, the Department believes that appropriate and timely information would be available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Consideration of Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters stated that the Department's regulations should be revised to require trustee officials to offset any damages resulting from the discharge or release with any benefits produced by the discharge or release. The Department solicits additional comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Tribal Trustees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters have sought to ensure that the interests of tribal entities are adequately addressed in the Department's regulations. A number of commenters expressed concern over the treatment of tribal values, including the values associated with tribal cultural resources. As noted above, the Department believes that ``cultural'' resources, including tribal cultural resources, do not constitute ``natural resources'' as defined by CERCLA. However, the Department's regulations do permit trustee officials to include the loss of cultural services provided by a natural resource in a natural resource damage assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters suggested that the Department's fiduciary responsibility to Indian tribes extends to financing natural resource damage assessments involving tribal resources. Although the Department exercises a fiduciary responsibility as trustee for Indian resources, the Department believes that discussion of funding mechanisms for damage assessment activities conducted by Indian tribes is not appropriate for this rulemaking, except as addressed in the law and regulation regarding the liability of PRPs and use of recovered sums.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that CERCLA grants a rebuttable presumption to assessments performed by tribal trustee officials. This commenter stated that when CERCLA was amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), Congress intended to grant tribes the same authority as States in the area of natural resource trustee activities. The commenter further noted that under established case law concerning the Federal government's fiduciary responsibility to tribes, any ambiguity in the statute concerning tribes' right to the rebuttable presumption must be construed in favor of the tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that the regulations were revised in 1988 to reflect the SARA amendment to CERCLA granting a rebuttable presumption to natural resource damage assessments performed by State trustee officials. See 43 CFR 11.91(c). At that time and in subsequent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices, the Department has taken the position that SARA did not extend the rebuttable presumption to assessments performed by tribal trustee officials and that granting a rebuttable presumption to tribes will require a legislative change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Restoration, Rehabilitation, Replacement, and/or Acquisition of Equivalent Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Types of Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters have suggested that the regulations should encourage trustee officials to select restoration and rehabilitation alternatives rather than replacement or acquisition alternatives. The Department's regulations do not indicate a preference for any particular type of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition alternative. The Department solicits comment on whether it has the authority, and whether it is appropriate, to develop and require adherence to a priority system for selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's regulations provide that Federal trustee officials may not select an alternative that requires acquisition of land for Federal management, unless restoration, rehabilitation and replacement are not possible. 43 CFR 11.82(e), as amended by 59 FR 14285. Some commenters supported this restriction and requested that it be extended to State and tribal natural resource trustees. Other commenters thought that the restriction should be eliminated altogether. The Department is interested in comments on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters stated that the regulations should clearly authorize trustee officials to choose a natural recovery alternative when selecting a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. The Department believes that the regulations already authorize trustee officials to select a natural recovery alternative when appropriate. The Department's regulations explicitly require trustee officials to consider a ``No Action-Natural Recovery'' alternative. 43 CFR 11.82(c)(2), as amended by 59 FR 14284.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Guidance on Selection of an Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters have requested guidance on selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. In particular, some commenters thought that the Department should provide guidance on how trustee officials could maximize the opportunities for natural recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's regulations already provide some guidance on the selection of a restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative. See 43 CFR 11.82, as amended by 59 FR 14284&hyph;85. The Department's regulations require trustee officials to evaluate a reasonable number of restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternatives, including natural recovery. The Department's regulations also provide a number of factors that trustee officials must consider when selecting an alternative. NOAA's proposed OPA rule includes a similar list of factors and contains guidance on determining when to select an alternative that relies on natural recovery. 59 FR 1181. NOAA has developed a draft guidance document on restoration activities. 59 FR 1065.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department notes that developing guidance requires balancing increased predictability against reduced flexibility to respond to the unique features of the broad range of potential natural resource damage cases. Thus, there is a limit to the level of specificity that can be appropriately provided in the regulations. With this in mind, the Department solicits comment on specific aspects of the selection process that warrant additional guidance. The Department solicits comment on whether the guidance should be incorporated in the regulations or in a separate guidance document. The Department also intends to consider the appropriateness of offering guidance on available restoration and rehabilitation techniques and would appreciate information on appropriate case studies demonstrating successful application of restoration and rehabilitation measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Specific Selection Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

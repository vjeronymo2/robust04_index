			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: DREAM HOUSE CAN IRON OUT HASSLES  </P> <P> Family Circle magazine recently surveyed 22 million female readers to find out  what features they wanted most in a dream house. Their ideas are incorporated  in a house being built in suburban Atlanta.  </P> <P> Most of the things the women suggested, I held out for in a home we built seven  years ago. Our utility room is not off the kitchen; it's near the bedrooms so I  can "dunk shot" my sheets into the washer. There is a walk-in pantry where you  walk in at your own risk, but my kitchen looks great. No doors cover my  cabinets. I always felt like a game contestant standing in front of my old  ones, wondering which door held the brown sugar and which one the ant traps.  </P> <P> There are no draperies in the house and no shower curtains. All I ever did  anyway was to cut off the mildew periodically until all I had was a valance.  </P> <P> My ironing board is attached to the wall of the utility room and is up all the  time. This way I can tell people, "I'd take my ironing board down, but it's  attached to the wall."  </P> <P> I had a greenhouse window installed in the kitchen for "sick" plants that need  TLC and more sun. It holds every live plant in the house.  </P> <P> Sounds like an enchanted cottage, doesn't it? Wrong!  </P> <P> Given a second chance, I'd make a lot of major changes. I don't mean just the  doggie door we cut through an eight-inch wall and the dog ran away from home. I  mean more technology.  </P> <P> The kitchen table would go. In its place I'd have a trough centered over a  drain that you would just hose down between meals.  </P> <P> I'd install a conveyor belt from the garage to the pantry so I'd never again  have to make eight trips on grocery day.  </P> <P> There would be a timer in the bathroom; at the end of an hour, the water would  shut off, the lights, blow dryers and curling irons would go dead, and the door  would swing open.  </P> <P> I haven't worked out all the bugs on this one, but I'd like a chute off the  utility room for hand-washables. Anything left in the chute for three years  would drop into a compost, and when broken down with a chemical, would turn  into mulch for roses.  </P> <P> The trouble with most homes is that men design them and women clean them. I'll  never forget the first time I visited Monticello, the Virginia home of Thomas  Jefferson. The greatest statesman of all time, who had one of the most creative  minds in the world, was a do-it-your-selfer. He introduced bunk beds to America  (did God give us orangutan arms?), a dumbwaiter for wine (the food came from a  kitchen a mile away), and just inside the hallway, he built a clock that  measured time by a weight that went down the other side of the door. There is a  hole in the floor because he misjudged the minutes.  </P> <P> I'm years ahead of my time.  </P></p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses settle for gentle profit-taking After notching up a big midweek contribution to their year-end rally, bourses settled for gentle profit-taking yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT incorporated Thursday's post-bourse losses to close with the DAX index 14.67 lower at 2,161.13, still 1.9 per cent higher on the week. Traders said that the downside yesterday was limited by firmer futures prices, the December DAX futures contract rising 8.0 to 2,170.5. Turnover fell from DM11.8bn to DM9.1bn. Falls of around 1 per cent were commonplace, but in engineering and steels, Deutsche Babcock, Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch gained on chart technical factors and small buy orders, rising DM3.20 to DM231.80, DM5.50 to DM259.50 and DM6.50 to DM159 respectively. Metallgesellschaft closed another DM28 lower at DM323, a week's loss of DM69.50 or 17.7 per cent. This followed reports that it had to secure additional credit lines after having to pay large margin payments for its hedge positions on petroleum contracts; the group has also passed its 1993 dividend, and announced a number of asset sales this week. PARIS saw the CAC-40 index end 13.27 lower at 2,198.13, up 0.4 per cent on the week in turnover of FFr3.75bn, gains attracting more comment than losses. Rhone Poulenc rose FFr2 to FFr152.10 in 2.3m shares on good fundamentals, and on buying from institutions which wanted to top up packets of shares they received during the company's privatisation. Eurotunnel put on FFr1.25 to FFr42.10, its followers reassured that the Channel tunnel would come into operation after the handing over of the tunnel by builders yesterday. Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez lost FFr8 at FFr532 on rumours of a sizeable share placing, denied by the company. AMSTERDAM's early advance was wiped out, the CBS Tendency index ending 0.4 lower at 140.0, 0.7 per cent higher on the week. Shares in tank storage companies were hit by a report that the Netherlands was moving more than a third of its strategic oil reserves from Rotterdam port to German salt caves. Van Ommeren shed Fl 1.70 to Fl 41.50 in spite of a denial that it would be affected because it did not store crude oil, the only type to be stored in the German caves. Pakhoed fell Fl 1.20 to Fl 47.60. Financial stocks were firm on hopes of lower interest rates. Aegon gained Fl 1.40 to Fl 105.30, ING rose 50 cents to Fl 89.30 and Amev climbed 60 cents to Fl 87.50. A Fl 2.70 or 6 per cent rise to Fl 47.50 in Begemann, the engineering company, was attributed to favourable press comment on its recent restructuring. ZURICH extended its gains with the SMI index up 2.8 to 2,861.2, up 1.5 per cent on a week in which records were set on every day but Tuesday. The annual monetary statement from the Swiss National Bank held no surprises: the bank said it was adhering to its medium-term target of 1 per cent growth in money supply. Nestle rose SFr4 to SFr1,250 as Credit Suisse said the share, still a market underperformer, could climb as far as SFr1,480. Ascom, the troubled telecommunications group, shed SFr40 to SFr1,130: the shares surged SFr90 on Thursday ahead of the announcement that the chief executive, Mr Leonardo Vannotti, had resigned and the company was being reorganised into three divisions. MILAN paused after its recent gains. The Comit index dipped 1.16 to 583.11, still 6.1 per cent higher on the week. Turnover was reported to have dropped sharply from Thursday's heavy L800m. A L99 rise to L8,328 in Rinascente was attributed to a reassessment of the outlook for the stock: a public buy offer for 33 per cent of the company by Ifil ended last month and two new shareholders have emerged, Arab Banking Corporation with 9 per cent and Pictet, the Swiss bank, with 3 per cent. Among heavily traded blue chips, Sip was L37 lower at L3,351 and Stet lost L20 to L3,919. Credito Italiano slipped L47 to L2,388 after this week's successful privatisation offer. STOCKHOLM was hit by American selling, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 9.80 lower at 1,350.60, 1.1 per cent up on the week with Ericsson B another SKr11 lower at SKr320. In HELSINKI, Nokia reflected the Ericsson drop with a FM16 fall of its own to FM286 as the Hex index lost 16.9 at 1,550.0, 0.4 per cent better on the week.

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH DUKES' FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT  </P> <P> The Newport Beach Dukes made their debut Tuesday at the John Wayne Tennis Club  where:  </P> <P>  -- A light rain fell, a dubious beginning if ever there was one.  </P> <P>  -- Marty Davis, the Dukes' most experienced player, was seen chomping potato  chips while watching the women's doubles set.  </P> <P>  -- A crowd of about 1,200 was entertained by Roger Smith's 6-5 victory over  Mike Briggs in the men's singles set.  </P> <P>  -- The Dukes defeated an alumni team from UC Irvine in an exhibition, 30-16.  </P> <P> The Dukes begin the regular season against the Raleigh Edge at 7:30 p.m.  Thursday at the John Wayne Tennis Club.  </P> <P> It's difficult to base much on Tuesday's exhibition, but the Dukes appear to  have a strong lineup.  </P> <P> There remains much to be determined, however. Who plays with whom, for  instance.  </P> <P> Coach Greg Patton decided on Tuesday's lineup on a whim. Now, he has something  to go by for Thursday's opener.  </P> <P> He is, to say the least, impressed with his team.  </P> <P> "All the chapters are in the book," Patton said. "It's going to be a great  novel."  </P> <P> Translation: The Dukes have depth, talent, strong singles and doubles. And they  could be one of the league's top teams.  </P> <P> The women -- Sophie Amiach and Amy Frazier -- overpowered Karin Behring and  Colleen Patton, 6-0, to begin the match.  </P> <P> Frazier then beat Mary Beth Young, granted honorary alumni status by virtue of  her work this week at the UCI tennis camp, 6-4. Young is a two-time  All-American from Brigham Young.  </P> <P> The Smith-Briggs set was the highlight of the match, going to a tiebreaker  after it was tied, 5-5. (Team Tennis scoring differs greatly from standard tour  scoring).  </P> <P> Smith won the nine-point (another difference) tiebreaker, 5-1.  </P> <P> That match tested Patton's allegiance.  </P> <P> "It's just like I adopted some children, but on the other side of the river are  all my other children," he said. "I felt like running over and cheering for  Mike Briggs."  </P> <P> The Dukes' victory marked Team Tennis' return to Orange County after a  seven-year absence.  </P> <P> Two previous teams folded after disappointing results on the court and at the  box office. The Anaheim Oranges folded in 1978 and the California Oranges in  1983.  </P></p>

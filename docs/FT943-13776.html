			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Italian trust launch postponed Carnegie International, the securities firm, has postponed the launch of the Italian Renaissance Investment Trust, despite raising more than the minimum fund size of Pounds 20m. The trust, to be managed by Fondigest, the Italian mutual fund manager, would have been the UK's first single-country investment trust specialising in Italy. Carnegie said that the placing had raised Pounds 25m. The offer had been capped at Pounds 100m, but it was realistically expecting to raise between Pounds 35m and Pounds 50m in all. It cited 'adverse market conditions' as the main reason for postponing the launch. But the trust's directors 'were especially concerned that the initial price at which the new shares would trade would not fairly reflect the prospects for Italian medium and smaller sized companies', in which the trust was to have specialised. Records were set earlier this year for the amount of money raised by new investment trust issues, but markets have been more nervous since the first rise in US interest rates in February. The average discount to net asset value hit its narrowest point in January, but has since widened. In May, Murray Johnstone, the UK fund management company, postponed the launch of a UK smaller company investment trust because of doubts over the level of investor demand. However, Schroder's new Japanese investment trust was oversubscribed earlier this month. Carnegie said that 'provided that interest in investment trust new issues recovers' the trust would be launched in the autumn.</p>

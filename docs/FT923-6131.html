			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Graseby down 10% as defence side falls A COLLAPSE in Graseby's defence earnings resulted in a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30. The medical products and controls group, formerly known as Cambridge Electronic Industries, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 4.6m on sales of Pounds 51m (Pounds 49.4m). However, Tace, the environmental monitoring company, and Goring Kerr the instruments business, acquired earlier this year, partly offset the fall in defence earnings. The new businesses accounted for half of the group's pre-tax profits. Defence, which last year contributed about 60 per cent of profits, accounted for less than 10 per cent. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive, said: 'The fall-off in the defence market has resulted from the peace dividend. We did not expect its demise so quickly.' Graseby Security, the defence division which had been included in instruments, is now part of environmental and defence. That sector showed a fall in trading profits from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 2m. Instruments' trading profits rose from Pounds 24,000 to Pounds 2.45m because of a strong performance from Goring Kerr. The medical business edged ahead to Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 1.56m). In June the group bought 80 per cent of Intertest, which develops x-ray techniques to detect foreign bodies in foods, for Pounds 2.7m, as a bolt-on acquisition. Mr Lester said he was planning to sell many of the smaller non-core businesses and property over the next 18 months which could raise about Pounds 20m. Borrowings by the year end are expected to be about Pounds 20m, representing gearing of 70 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 8.2p to 5.5p. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.3p. An extraordinary charge of Pounds 280,000 related to the costs of disposals.</p>

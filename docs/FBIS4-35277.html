			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Before his departure from the  fraternal state of Kuwait, Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas held a news conference in which he accused the Sanaa  regime of aiming at controlling the oilfields in the Democratic  Republic of Yemen. He pointed out that some Arab countries such  as Iraq and Sudan are directly involved in the northern forces'  war against our country.    The brother prime minister said that the northern forces'  war  against our country is exactly similar to Iraq's invasion of the  fraternal state of Kuwait in 1990. In both cases there are  misplaced ideas claiming the annexation of a part to the  motherland. The brother prime minister confirmed that the  objective behind the declaration of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen was to prevent the breakup of Yemen into numerous smaller  states.</p>

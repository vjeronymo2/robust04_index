Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> CLIMBER RESCUED IN CHATSWORTH  </P> <P> A 21-year-old rock climber was rescued by Los Angeles firefighters after she  became stranded after dark on a high hillside ledge at Chatsworth Park,  authorities said today.  </P> <P> The woman, whose name was not released, had climbed with a companion Monday up  the side of the rocky hill that rims the park but became too frightened to  climb down when it grew dark, Fire Department spokesman Alan Barrios said.  </P> <P> About 8:30 p.m. after the companion climbed down and alerted authorities, two  Fire Department helicopters hovered above the rugged hillside and aimed  spotlights on the woman, who was on a ledge near the top, Barrios said.  </P> <P> A group of firefighters climbed up and led her down, Barrios said. The woman  was uninjured.  </P> <P> "She was all right," Barrios said. "She had just been afraid."  </P></p>

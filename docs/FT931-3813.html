			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Composers in person - David Murray on an interesting series from EMI IN ITS NEW, expanded form, EMI holds the copyright to many recordings of distinguished composers conducting and/or playing their own works: from Lehar, Saint-Saens, Medtner and Holst to Hindemith and Messiaen. Its 'Composers in Person' series is going to represent more than 30 of them on CDs, with the original recordings carefully re-mastered. That should whet many appetites. On these first releases, there is occasional hiss and crackle - and the odd passage where a regular, faulty swish is audibly carried over from ancient 78rpm discs. Only aficionados will really want some of these releases: the stamp of authenticity may sometimes be faint, the musical polish of some performances inferior to some modern ones, the CD programmes constrained by what this or that composer happened to put on record. That said, here are quick notes on these first entries in the series. Richard Strauss (CDC 7 54610 2) - his conducting of the pit-music, mostly arranged by another hand, for a silent-film version of Der Rosenkavalier in the mid-1920s (seen recently on TV) is illuminating about pace and emphasis. In old age, Strauss used rightly to complain that his operas were being subjected to ever slower, more languishing tempi. His performance of An Alpine Symphony is almost a revelation: for once, none of its candidly pictorial vignettes is allowed to outlast its welcome. The curse of fake-symphonic pretentiousness is lifted, and whatever exactly the 'symphony' amounts to - it sounds thoroughly taking, original, even moving. I am not sure that any modern recording has captured its contrasted effects so vividly, or rather any modern conductor; Strauss knew not only precisely what he intended, but how to extract it from a sympathetic band like the Bayerische Staatskapelle. The Stravinsky double album (CDC 7 54607 2) must count only as a supplementary volume to the huge, all-but-compendious Sony collection I reviewed here a while ago. As soloist in the Capriccio, the composer sounds tame, careful, studio-bound where extrovert dash should be the order of the day. Yet the album boasts notable attractions among its 1930s recordings. To the great Symphony of Psalms the Alexis Vlassov Choir, whose members must have been Russian expatriates, brought a passionate instinct for ecclesiastical chant that I have not heard equalled in a modern concert. The Octet had a team of crack French wind-players led by the flautist Marcel Moyse, and their dry, nervy brilliance is still exciting. We also hear Stravinsky with his long-term concert partner, the splendid violinist Samuel Dushkin, in several of the transcriptions they devised together for their recitals. Milhaud (CDC 7 54604 2): the jovial composer features mostly as conductor, with the benefit of characterful orchestral playing in tones that could barely be imitated now. Those sounds - lean, pungent, often shrill - were nonetheless what he wrote for, from the 1919 Boeuf sur le toit to the 1936 version of his Suite Provencale; and his own sense for treading a thin line between cramped popular pastiche and unbuttoned vulgarity was unerring. So it was too in his and Marcelle Meyer's account of the evergreen duo-piano Scaramouche, rumba-finale and all. Shostakovich (CDC 7 54606 2) is split between his 1958 recordings as soloist in his two piano concerti, which now sound remarkably immediate, commanding models (good trumpeter in no. 1), and some very uneven solo pieces. The early 3 Fantastic Dances sound dreadful, as if he were tired of bothering with them. The first four of the Preludes &amp; Fugues are thoughtful, withdrawn, very much not concert-performances; better to hear Madame Nikolaieva in them. The curdled recording of no. 24, the last pair, is of uncertain provenance, but Shostakovich's playing there is far more vital and communicative than in any of the others. It should have been a good idea to pair Poulenc and Britten (CDC 7 54605 2) on a disc with their long-term tenor partners, but the choice of works makes them a queasy combination. Pierre Bernac (in his prime in 1946) addressed Poulenc's wide-ranging, deeply felt Eluard cycle Tel jour, telle nuit with heart-seizing insights. He did no less for other songs to lighter, teasing verse by Apollinaire, Aragon and Louise de Vilmorin - always with the composer's inspired prompting from the piano. After those, Britten's 7 Michelangelo Sonnets and his 'Holy Sonnets of John Donne' for the voice of Peter Pears sound abstractly intense, intricate, crabbed by their fascination with ostinato patterns and other such. What seems to be the nub of the problem is exposed in the Michelangelo songs: how many Italians would even recognise the tight, dry Pears/Britten settings as Italian, let alone as answering to Michelangelo's brave, unconstrained feeling?</p>

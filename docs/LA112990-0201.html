			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> USX Chief in No Hurry to Meet Icahn Group: Chairman Charles A. Corry is in no  hurry to meet with a committee formed by Carl C. Icahn to press the financier's  case that the company should separate its steel and energy businesses. Two  professors heading the "USX Shareholders Enhancement Committee" wrote a letter  to Corry on Nov. 15 requesting that he meet with them to discuss the company's  future.  </P> <P> Corry, in a letter dated Tuesday, requested a detailed agenda of the proposed  meeting. "I have difficulty understanding the purpose of having a meeting as  you suggest," Corry said in the letter. "It is difficult to imagine that the  views and demands of your committee would be any different than those of Mr.  Icahn." Icahn is USX's largest shareholder with a 13.3% stake.  </P></p>

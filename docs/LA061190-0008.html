			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Miriam Makeba Home at Last: Miriam Makeba, the South African-born singer hailed  as "Mama Africa" for her passion and popularity, sang on home soil for the  first time in 31 years Sunday after returning from political exile to visit  family and her mother's grave in Johannesburg. The 57-year-old Makeba joined  relatives, local entertainers and supporters in singing the black liberation  anthem "Nkosi Sikele i'Afrika," or "God Bless Africa." She told reporters that  she did not "sleep for a week" in anticipation of getting an entry visa, which  was refused her until Friday. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE BUZZ: TODAY'S NEWS TOMORROW'S TELEVISION  </P> <P> SERIES  </P> <P> "Law and Order," a one-hour drama series for NBC, starring Michael Moriarty and  George Dzundza, has begun filming in New York City. The new episodic series,  which is scheduled for the 1990-91 season, is about cops and lawyers. The  continuing stories will cover the entire legal process, from the commission of  a crime on the street to its resolution in court. Other cast members for the  series include Chris Noth and Richard Brooks.  </P> <P> MINISERIES  </P> <P> TBS has acquired U.S. broadcast rights to the French miniseries "For Those I  Love," starring Michael York as Nazi war camp survivor Martin Gray. Adapted  from his autobiography, the miniseries depicts Gray's survival as a prisoner in  Treblinka, his arrival and financial success in America and the ultimate loss  of his wife and children to a forest fire. The miniseries is scheduled for  June.  </P> <P> MOVIES  </P> <P> NBC's movie "Last Flight Out," a fact-based drama about a small group of heroic  Americans who risked their lives to take 500 Vietnamese civilians and American  citizens to safety aboard the last commercial flight out of Saigon in 1975, has  received an air date on May 20. The movie stars James Earl Jones, Richard  Crenna, Haing S. Ngor, Arliss Howard, Eric Bogosian and Elizabeth Lindsey.  </P> <P> James Woods and John Lithgow will headline "The Boys," an ABC movie about two  men, lifelong friends and writing partners, who are suddenly confronted with  terminal illness. Lithgow portrays an obsessive chain-smoker with a family.  Woods plays a loner with a penchant for trendy health foods who is diagnosed  with lung cancer-an illness that may be due to breathing his partner's  cigarette smoke for 20 years. The two-hour ABC movie will air in May or next  season.  </P> <P> After screening an early cut of "Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story,"  executives of the NBC programming department "were so impressed" that they  decided to push back the air date of the fantasy TV movie starring John Ritter  from its scheduled fall premiere to December. The network said that the holiday  season is more appropriate for the special effects-packed family drama, about  the author of "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz." The movie co-stars Rue McClanahan,  Annette O'Toole, Charles Haid, David Schram and Jerry Marin, one of the  original Munchkins from the 1939 movie classic.  </P> <P> HBO Picture's "Josephine Baker," a biographical drama-musical about the  controversial 1920s entertainer, starring Lynn Whitfield, begins production in  April. The project reunites director Brian Gibson, producer John Kemeny and  writer Ron Hutchinson, who collaborated on the award-winning cable movie  "Murderers Among 's: The Simon Wiesenthal Story."  </P> <P> SPECIALS  </P> <P> The "Mrs. America Pageant" will be going to Moscow this Christmas, where the  "Mrs. America" and "Mrs. U.S.S.R." pageants will be produced as a two-hour  television special for the holidays. "The Mrs. America/Mrs. U.S.S.R. Christmas  Pageant" will feature separate competitions between 50 housewives from each  country and celebrate Christmas in both countries. Creator David Marmel is now  in network negotiations.  </P> <P> Mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade will star in "Flicka and Friends: From  Rossini to 'Show Boat' With Jerry Hadley and Samuel Ramey" in a nationally  televised "Live From Lincoln Center" presentation April 18 on PBS. The singing  trio will begin with a concert of arias and ensembles from a repertory of great  French and Italian opera and progress through musical selections from the  American musical "Show Boat."  </P> <P> Dinah Shore will return to her Tennessee roots for a live, star-studded music  and comedy special from Nashville's Grand Ole Opry House. Some of the scheduled  guests for "Dinah Comes Home Again," which airs April 17 on TNN, are singers  Glen Campbell and Joe Williams and comedian Norm Crosby.  </P> <P> Jean-Michel Cousteau continues his circumnavigation of the planet with "Out  West Down Under," in which the Cousteau team explores the vast coastline of  western Australia, laden with valuable rock lobsters and some of the largest  pearls in the world. Aussie Mel Gibson narrates the TBS special, which debuts  April 29.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Jacques Cousteau took six children-from North America, South  America, Europe, Australia, Africa and Asia-to Antarctica. Their expedition,  captured on film in "Lilliput Conquers Antarctica," is designed to show future  generations the beauty of an untouched land. The special premieres on Earth  Day, April 22, on TBS.  </P> <P> CABLE  </P> <P> Movietime will change its name to E! Entertainment Television when the basic  cable network service is re-launched June 1. The network is expanding its  coverage from movies to include general entertainment, such as television,  music, books, magazines, theater, fashion and art. The advertiser-supported  basic service provides viewers with news and feature segments highlighting  celebrities and the entertainment industry. The network will be known as  Movietime on air and for administrative purposes until the re-launch.  </P> <P> USA Network is developing plans to produce a multipart, anti-drug course to be  seen by high school and junior high school students across the United States  via a national cable feed. The program is part of "Operation CableCares: A  Commitment to a Drug-Free USA," an aggressive public service campaign that will  eventually enlist the resources of 10,100 cable systems across America.  </P> <P> SOAPS  </P> <P> The conniving new couple that joined the Port Charles cast last week on ABC's  daytime drama, "General Hospital," are both Hollywood newcomers. In their  American television debuts, Danish actor Anders T. Hove plays the diabolical  Faison, and Eurasian actress Chi-en Telemaque portrays the sinister Desiree.  Also new to the show: Bradley Lockerman as a mysterious stranger who must  assume a false identity. Daniel Cerone  </P></p>

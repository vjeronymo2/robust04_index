			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Letter: American sees Tories as lacking courage to use legislative power Sir, It is with some bemusement that I sit here in New York and watch the continuing decline of the Conservative party in the UK. Having spent nearly five years living and working in London, I had grown envious of the English parliamentary system where a government has the power of immediate legislative action. I am somewhat dumbfounded by the Tories' refusal to have used this very authority to do something for the struggling UK economy and in turn improve their standing with the electorate. Instead of addressing the problems of Britain's high unemployment, a severely weakened property market, low consumer confidence and high interest rates, John Major and his party have wooed voters with small, piecemeal budget giveaways and a message to voters somehow to trust in government to turn things around. Not surprisingly, Mr Major has found it difficult to explain to British workers why they are being priced out of jobs by high German interest rates. Indeed, the real message coming through seems to be to let the Bundesbank and ERM work their magic and everything will be fine. I seriously doubt that the average UK worker cares much about the ERM, Ecu, Emu, or the grand strategies put forth at Maastricht. He does, however, understand the relationship between the cost of money and his mortgage payments and the restraint that high interest rates impose on his own economy. I would also suspect that voters in the UK sense that the government's intransigent adherence to a weak economic theory as the basis for public policy is sign enough of a confused cabinet. Even if one accepts that the UK's entry into the ERM was appropriate (and I feel that it was) there is little empirical evidence to support an argument that high interest rates should be the sole tool for maintaining a 'correct' level of sterling exchange rates. The value of any country's currency is usually a reflection of its overall economic well being - and sterling sits at the bottom of the ERM because the economy is so weak. Many wise pundits staked their reputations on the notion that the UK, with its high rates, upon entering the ERM, would be forced to lower interest rates to keep sterling from moving through the top of its upper band. The upward push in sterling never occurred, and it is puzzling to witness a government stymied by the equally specious view that lowering rates now as a part of a responsible growth package would destroy confidence in sterling. If the Tories lose power on April 9, it may well be because Mr Major has not taken a more courageous stand on the economy.

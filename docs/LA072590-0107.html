			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: HEART MEDICATION  </P> <P> Question: My father is taking nitroglycerin for angina. I know that it's been  around a long time.  </P> <P> Isn't there anything newer and better? New drugs are being developed every day.  </P> <P> Answer: Medication must be determined by the patient's own physician. I have no  basis for saying that one medication is better than another for a patient I  have never seen.  </P> <P> Having said that, I should add that nitroglycerin is a preferred medication for  many patients with stable angina pectoris. A patient can take it after symptoms  develop, or as a preventive. Moreover, side effects associated with  nitroglycerin, for the most part, are acceptable. Another advantage is that the  drug is inexpensive.  </P></p>

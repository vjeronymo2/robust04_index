			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] The Angolan peace talks resumed today. The  government and National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] negotiating teams today approved 18 points  regarding specific principles for national reconciliation. The  negotiating teams today revised the document point by point  because UNITA is always recanting. Thus, after verifying the  document, government chief negotiator Faustino Muteka and UNITA  chief negotiator Eugenio Manuvakola signed it in the presence of  UN special representative Alioune Blondin Beye and the observers.    The negotiating teams will now begin discussing the  modalities ?ad implementation of the dossier of national  reconciliation. The special representative of the UN secretary  general in Angola has already delivered to the government and  UNITA negotiating teams the intermediary document on the  modalities and its implementation. The government and UNITA  will have to react to it by 29 June.    Meanwhile, the issue regarding the modalities and its  implementation includes Jonas Savimbi's special status which was  scheduled to be discussed in the specific principles, but at  UNITA's request the document was postponed until the end. Now  UNITA wants to withdraw the issue from the agenda, claiming that  it is not necessary to discuss a special status for its leader,  because the document on the accommodation and security of UNITA  and its high officials includes Jonas Savimbi.    The government has rejected this, saying that on point eight  the issue only related to UNITA leaders -- that is, deputies,  members of the political commission, and those who will  eventually take administrative and military posts at a higher  level, but Jonas Savimbi was not included. To avoid future  obstacles, the government wants Jonas Savimbi's status to be  discussed, because UNITA is always recanting, and one cannot  withdraw a point from an agenda of negotiations as delicate as  this, as UNITA intends to.</p>

He pointed out the role played by the LDP in the adoption of  the resolution on amnesty and regretted the continuing  confrontation between the White and the Red. He proposed that  this period be completed and everyone be forgiven. "The best  victory is the one at the elections than on barricades,"  Zhirinovsky believes.    Commenting on the alteration of the Russian foreign policy,  he remarked that the crisis in Sarajevo had been resolved due to  the LDP position in the State Duma. The LDP had stated that  "bombardment of Serb positions would mean a war against Russia."  "Thousands of Serbs were saved from inevitable death thanks to  me and our party," Zhirinovskiy affirmed.    However, the LDP leader continues to insist on resignation  of  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev saying that Kozyrev  could not "radically change the foreign policy."    Zhirinovskiy demanded once again that the economic sanctions  against Serbia be lifted. "They can dress and feed us. Russia  can station there its servicemen withdrawn from Germany. Our  soldiers and officers will not leave [as received] in camps like  now," he suggested.    Speaking on the enlarged meeting of the government on  Friday,  Zhirinovskiy pointed out that Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin had  shown that he intended to alter the policy and was against  "those ministers who hampered the move forward." According to  the LDP leader, there are 4 such ministers in the present  government -- Vice Premiers Aleksandr Shokhin and Anatoliy  Chubays, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Minister for  Nationalities and Regional Policies Sergey Shakhray.    Zhirinovskiy also demanded that the military industrial  complex be completely restored since military production sold  abroad could ensure "years of good life for Russians." He said  Philippines had been ready to acquire the MIG-29 military planes  and officials had concealed the documents and were waiting for  bribes.    About 1000 people were listening to Zhirinovskiy at the  rally  near the metro.</p>

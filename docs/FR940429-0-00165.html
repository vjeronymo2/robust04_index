			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary recognizes that the approach to significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased gatekeeping activity outlined in the statute for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three members of the triad is a new one. This approach will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require leadership in both implementation and evaluation if it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to achieve the effectiveness that Congress intended. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary will take steps to assure that the various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities of the triad members are carried out in a manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, in fact, results in the identification of institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis of either the quality of education they offer or their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inability to handle program funds. At the same time, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary is committed to carrying out the responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coordinating the activities of the triad members that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inherent in the statute in a manner that causes the least burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To these ends, the Secretary is committed to effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management of the gatekeeping function. The Secretary will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review carefully the applications of accrediting bodies and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards and operating plans proposed by State Postsecondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Review Entities (SPREs) under the State Postsecondary Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program to insure that they meet the requirements of the statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and these regulations and will enable these triad agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfill their statutory purposes. The Secretary will also place  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a priority on the completion of the ``Postsecondary Education  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participation System,'' the Department's new integrated data base,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which will contain the information that the Secretary generates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the course of the Secretary's oversight of institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary will use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the data base to inform accrediting bodies and SPREs of actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken by the Secretary so that they may in turn carry out their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities. This expanded data base is also critical to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary's effective selection of institutions for program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monitoring the results of the gatekeeping process is a very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important key to effective management. The Secretary will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate the activities of accrediting agencies, SPREs, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department to determine their effectiveness in improving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of institutions participating in Title IV programs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will take such steps as may be indicated to improve the results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, as provided in the statute, the Secretary will seek the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advice and counsel of the National Advisory Committee on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutional Quality and Integrity in evaluating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of the triad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the approach best suited to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieving the objectives of the statute is a complementary one,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with each member of the triad focusing its evaluation on its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations within the context of the HEA. Thus, the focus for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agencies is the quality of education or training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by the institutions or programs they accredit. States,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in addition to providing the legal authority to operate within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the state required for participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, will review institutions that meet certain statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review criteria related to institutional performance in the Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA programs. The focus of the Secretary's evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions is on the administrative and financial capacity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those institutions to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the functions and responsibilities of each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triad members are generally different, the statute does require,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in some instances, that all members of the triad evaluate similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. For the most part, the principle of complementary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions will lead to the members evaluating those same areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from different perspectives for different purposes. For example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all three of the triad members are required to examine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finances of an institution. If each looks at financial strength  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a perspective complementary to that of the others,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agencies would focus principally on the capacity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution to continue to offer programs at a level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality sufficient to meet accrediting agency standards and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fulfill the institution's mission over a 5&hyph;10 year period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accreditation. The emphasis of a review by a SPRE would be on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether or not the institution possesses the full range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resources needed to serve students currently attending the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. The Secretary's responsibilities focus on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's finances in light of its ability to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services described in its official publications and statements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its Title IV, HEA program responsibilities, and to meet all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its financial obligations, including, but not limited to, refunds of institutional charges and repayments to the Secretary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities and debts incurred in programs administered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite the Secretary's efforts to encourage complementary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> functions for each of the triad members, it is theoretically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible that, in some instances, an institution could be subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to three different standards regulating the same area of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation. For this reason, where a Title IV standard has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated at the Federal level, the Secretary expects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agencies and States to take this into account in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing their own standards to insure that varying standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not pose an unnecessary burden on institutions. It is also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important that accrediting agencies and States do not impose any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard that is weaker than comparable Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. The Secretary believes coordination of this is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> federal responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the complementary approach to the functions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the triad members, the Secretary believes, for example, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions should not have to develop different methodologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide data that the three members of the triad may require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also believes that, to the extent feasible, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other requests for data about the institution, its students, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its graduates should rely on information already in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's possession. To that end, the Secretary expects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accrediting agencies and States either to accept student data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the methodology that will be specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations governing ``Student Right to Know,'' also mandated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, or, where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution may have other methodologies for calculating data,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as a system designed to provide data to a State higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education commission or other State agency, to accept data in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> format already being used by the institution. Similarly, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary expects accrediting agencies and SPREs to use the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audited financial statements institutions are now required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide to the Secretary on an annual basis to the extent those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements are compatible with the nature of the reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted under their respective standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also recognizes that other Federal agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as the Department of Labor and the Veterans Administration,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also regulate institutions in some areas that are similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those included in part H. The suggestion has been made that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary should promulgate Federal standards in the areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overlap so that institutions would not be subject to varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards developed by other Federal agencies and the triad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members. However, the Secretary interprets part H as permitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States and accrediting agencies to establish their own standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as opposed to using a Federal standard, and also believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this is the most effective approach. In addition, it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear how the requirements of the different agencies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compatible with the requirements of part H. The purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these programs administered by other agencies may be very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different. As a result, the Secretary has not pursued this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative. The Secretary does believe that it would be useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to explore how the varying requirements of other Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are similar to those of part H might be coordinated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce any burden on institutions and will initiate such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exploration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that, where possible, data developed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the national level should be made available to institutions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as to States and accrediting agencies to assist them in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrying out their responsibilities under part H. In particular,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data concerning labor markets and compensation for specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fields and information concerning graduation and withdrawal rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at various types of institutions may be helpful to both triad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members and institutions. The Secretary will facilitate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of this type of information and, where possible under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the auspices of the Department, will coordinate the development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of data that will be helpful to institutions and the triad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Top-quality furniture proves irresistible: Saleroom CHRISTIE'S held a successful sale of important English furniture yesterday. The top lots were far from fresh to the market but were of a quality, interest and condition that proved irresistible. Most spectacular was an Etruscan-style satinwood and marquetry bow-fronted commode designed by Robert Adam for Derby House in Grosvenor Square, London, and supplied by Mayhew and Ince in 1775 for Pounds 84. This richly ornamented piece, embellished further with painted ovals of Venus and Cupid, was consigned by Mrs Barbara Piasecka Johnson, who had bought it in 1988 for Pounds 140,000. It attracted numerous bidders before selling way above target to another collector for Pounds 660,000. Also on offer was a group of pieces sold in 1986 from Harewood House, near Leeds, which gave Thomas Chippendale one of his most celebrated and valuable commissions. Of particular note was the pair of 'Exceeding neat &amp; Rich carv'd Gerandoles finished in burnished silver', supplied for the yellow damask sitting room. These silvered, wall-mounted oval mirrors, originally with candle branches, are the only ones of there kind that Chippendale made. Lord Harewood paid Pounds 40 for them in 1775, and in 1986 they fetched Pounds 280,800. Christie's sold them yesterday for Pounds 319,000. A pair of oval giltwood mirrors, almost certainly supplied by Chippendale for the dining room at Harewood, realised Pounds 104,500.</p>

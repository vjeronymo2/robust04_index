			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dumping" published in English throughout item] </F>   [Text] "We are 14 very different countries, but we have  some common interests. We acknowledge that after the GATT's  Uruguay Round we have achieved a certain progress, but it is not  enough. Therefore, from now on we will redouble efforts in order  to obtain other advantages with less subsidies and a freer and  more clear-cut agricultural trade. And we are optimistic  because we are now in a better position than when the Uruguay  Round began."    With these words Australian Bob McMullan, president of the  Cairns Group, summed up what was accomplished at the 14th  meeting, which closed on 20 May in Montevideo after two days of  debates.    Answering a battery of questions after he made the final  declaration known, McMullan was able to explain future  objectives: "We want free competition. The market does not  matter as long as the principles of free and fair trade are  respected. We are not attacking competition; we are defending  it while pushing for a world without trade barriers."    McMullan, who is minister of trade and administrative  services for his country, flatly denied Australia obtained  benefits from Europe while the GATT negotiations were being  held, and he indicated that the Cairns Group will evaluate the  types of dumping that some nations carry out. "We are not  referees," he said, "but we will be ready to revise every type  of unfair practice that is carried out in order to be able to  fight it."    The Canadian and Argentine representatives were obliged to  speak due to the sale of Canadian wheat to Brazil that is an  Argentine concern. The Canadian representative [not further  identified] said: "The price of our wheat is the same as other  market prices. We do not carry out unfair trade and there is  nothing irregular or illegal in our procedures." Argentine  Agriculture Secretary Felipe Sola said: "The Cairns Group is not  a referee that has to decide bilateral situations, and we have  not come here to ask for explanations. What we have proposed is  that from now on the group will study the dumping situations,  and then it will fight them if it considers them unfair."    Asked about this point, Uruguayan Agriculture and Fishing  Minister Pedro Saravia stated that from now on, the Cairns Group  must look into matters that could influence free trade in the  future, such as the social aspects of labor and environmental  topics.    Regarding the group's functioning, it will continue its  annual meetings, and it has been agreed that the next meeting of  ministers will be held in the Philippines in May or June 1995,  "although if circumstances demand it, we will meet before that  date," McMullan said.    It has been agreed that from now on some of the countries  will have the responsibility of closely following some matters  and they will draft reports to submit to the other countries.  In this respect, Argentina will evaluate matters pertaining to  dumping, Chile will do the same regarding world trade in fruit  and vegetables, the Philippines will evaluate the fishing  industry, and Australia will look into the matter of  agricultural subsidies and try to evaluate them in precise terms.</p>

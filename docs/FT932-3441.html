			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Risk and Reward: Futures fund managers reassess the cash implications WHEN investors consider which futures funds to buy, they are faced with an almost infinite array of trading systems and analytical techniques for investing in the futures markets. But the structure of futures funds means that often only a relatively small portion of the fund is actually invested in margins on futures contracts or option premiums: the remainder is invested in the money markets. The performance of this part of the fund has often tended to be ignored. However increasing competition in the futures fund business has encouraged greater care to be taken in the management of the cash portion of the fund. In particular, the decline of short-term interest rates has forced fund managers to reassess their approach. Some smaller futures fund managers, particularly in the US, are starting to farm out the management of the cash portion of their funds. 'People concentrate on the things that they are interested in,' says Ms Diane Mix, of Horizon Cash Management, which is now trying to market its services to European futures funds. '(Futures fund managers) are very keen on the futures side and tend not to concentrate on the rest of the money, which consequently doesn't earn as much as it should.' In the US, many fund managers have simply invested the cash portion of funds in Treasury bills or in an interest-bearing account, according to Ms Mix. In fact, once a large pool of cash is available, better returns can be earned from commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit. According to one large futures fund management group, which manages its own funds' cash, it is difficult for funds with less than Pounds 5m in cash to get attractive rates. In the CP and CD markets, bid/offer spreads are uncompetitive in small sizes. Term deposits can also be unattractive, because of the penalties imposed for early redemption, which means that potentially better margins can easily be lost. Ms Mix says her company is looking to offer returns equal to or better than prevailing T-bill rates. Historically, she says, futures fund managers have achieved less than bill rates, partly because of the relatively high fees subtracted from returns.                      *      *      * WHILE derivatives may still be giving regulators some sleepless nights, credit rating agencies seem to be rather less perturbed. Moody's, one of the leading US credit rating agencies, has completed a report on the credit risk implications of derivatives activities which concludes that few of the financial institutions it rates have been materially affected by their derivatives activities. 'There will be losses at individual entities from bad risk analysis, bad controls, or plain bad luck, but derivatives are not a ticking time-bomb for banks and securities houses,' according to Mr Douglas Lucas, assistant vice-president of Moody's financial institutions group. Moody's found that the risk-adjusted returns to derivative dealers have generally been high, and that losses, so far, have not resulted in significant credit implications. Mr Lucas believes it is the 'large numbers, cryptic nature and opaque disclosure' of the derivative markets which have fuelled fears about the risks involved. He noted that Moody's has never changed an institution's rating solely on the basis of derivative operations. 'Typically, the factors arguing in favour of an adjustment in our ratings cut across an institution's balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities,' he said. Moody's divides its overview of derivatives risk at a financial institution into four main areas - the purposes of the activity, market risk, credit risk and operating risk. Mr Lucas takes the view that derivatives are usually used by financial institutions to assume risks similar to those already taken in other ways. But it is an issue the agency explores with both financial institutions and industrial companies: 'It does have the potential to be a negative in the credit picture,' he said.</p>

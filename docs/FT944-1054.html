			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The follies of the macho manager I have not been able to find the Biblical adage which says that your 'yea' should be a 'yea' and your 'nay' a 'nay'. In any case it apparently forms little part in the training of the English businessman. This omission is the focus of the first article in the January 1995 issue, now available, of Business Ethics.* The author, Malene Djursaa, has carried out 55 interviews (in depth of course) in recent research on cultural factors in Anglo-Danish business relations. She places the findings in the framework of low-context and high-context cultures. In low-context cultures, information is explicit and 'vested in words of precise and unambiguous meanings'. Low-context people predominate in the US, Germany, Switzerland and Scandinavia. What such cultures lack in subtlety, they gain in precision. A low-context person is to the point and may even 'over-inform'. By contrast, high-context cultures rely on implicit communications 'vested in shared experience and assumptions and conveyed through verbal and non-verbal codes'. Well-known high-context cultures are the Japanese and the Arabian. Professor Djursaa's point is that English business practices are nearer the Japanese and Arabic models than generally supposed. For instance, a Danish paint manufacturing company wanted a large English firm to represent it in Britain. Having received encouraging signals on a first visit, the Danish managers came over a second time and were surprised by the complete lack of interest. Yet they were still not turned down. The British 'no' was finally received in a telex of three lines after a total of three visits and much wasted advance planning from the Danish end. Why didn't the English say 'no' at the start?                             *       *       * This is all great fun and contains a moral. But I doubt, however, if it should be dignified by the title of business ethics. Indeed I doubt the existence of business ethics as a subject. If I ever write another book after the one due to come out early in the new year, it will not be on business ethics, but on modern managerialism. The central slogans of modern managerialism consist of words such as 'down-sizing' and other terms which mean closures and sackings. These are occasionally necessary, as economic progress can take the form of substituting new jobs for old. But the knee-jerk new-style managers regard cutting staff as a sign of virility and do not have the imagination to ask whether it might pay them to take on more workers at modest rates of pay. Hence the idiotic snubs with which some business organisations treated the employment incentives in last month's UK Budget. Much of this modern managerialism is based on the simple fallacy that labour is the scarce factor of production. Yet the signs are all around us that labour is now plentiful in the English-speaking countries and much cheaper in real terms than it used to be. If you add the non-employed to the registered unemployed, you get a very large reserve army indeed - many of whom would be admirably suited to the tasks given over to computers. The macho-managers who want to save labour, above all, are responding to a historical situation of overpriced labour which no longer exists or is fast disappearing - despite the efforts of the European Commission and the UK law lords to bring it back. A proper study will have to separate the wheat from the chaff in modern management. It will have to explain how well-intentioned reforms of health and education have led to professionals spending half their waking hours writing reports to uncomprehending accountants. Let me content myself with a few trivial but tell-tale manifestations. The most superficial manifestation is the flip-chart, which is basically only a modern version of the school blackboard, but on which slogans and platitudes of the most astounding banality are written. Organisations that like flip-charts normally invite one to give 'presentations' rather than talks or lectures. A proper study will have to cover some of the follies appearing in the early stages of rail privatisation. A small but revealing example is the disappearance of the useful pamphlet on British Rail Inter-City services. Previously you could get it at any main station. This year I was told that I had to apply for it in writing; and still it has not materialised. Only a mad managerialist could think of dividing the rail network into dozens and dozens of separate groups for privatisation. The whole point of a transport network is to get you from one part of the country to another. So extreme decentralisation makes no sense. Indeed the network will have to be recreated through interchangeable tickets and dovetailed timetables, all involving much time, effort and negotiation, and inconvenience to the traveller. A primary feature of modern managerialism is that, despite all the advantages of computerised information that the organisation has, the individual customer sitting amid the confusion of his own home is meant to do all the work. Computerised reminders of charges or appeals for funds come from businesses and charities alike. But their compilers have not even had the courtesy to check whether the recipient has already paid, or has signed a debit instruction. For that would involve the bother of an individual (or as they would say 'individualised') letter which would be beyond the ken of the management expert. One of the main features of computerised communication is that it is not really efficient or cost-saving. My own bank discovered this when I was sent extremely unpleasant threats for the non-payment of a trivial sum of money on a credit card which I had not in fact used. But the frustrating thing about a computer is that there is no one at the other end; and if you do not comply with precise and often misconceived instructions, ever-more threatening letters will emerge at prescribed intervals. Minor manifestations of managerialism occur in the expressions that modern-minded companies tell their employees to use. How many telephone calls have you had answered by 'How can I help you?' in a not very helpful voice? If you come in person you are told to 'take a seat' - usually a low couch from which it is difficult to rise and where you are made to sit out of harm's way until they are ready to deal with you. Such forms of words combine a superficial courtesy with the reality of a put-down. It almost makes me prefer the older expression 'he's in a meeting', designed to make all communication impossible. A new horror consists of voice mail. The old telephone answering machine, which simply recorded a message if someone was not in or was too busy, was very useful. But now before you can even leave a message you have to hold on for about 10 minutes while a large number of alternative options are read out; and you have to wait for a tone at the end of it all which is sometimes inaudible. It is very tempting to use all one's guile to find a non-listed telephone number on which a human being will actually reply. Lesser examples of modern management include the replacement of tea-trolleys by machines which give a very restricted choice and are often jammed. The waste of highly-paid employees' time in trying to get these compartments to disgorge their contents far outweighs the payment of a part-time lady. We are told that we live in an information age where the most valuable commodity is information. In fact most of the people who talk about this revolution are interested only in the technical means of communication and have not the faintest idea of what it is they wish to communicate. * Blackwell, 108 Cowley Rd, Oxford OX4 1JF.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 26 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk on  Tuesday encouraged people to vote, saying polling stations were  perhaps the safest places in South Africa with "tremendous"  safety measures taken by security forces. He promised a  clampdown by government on those responsible for the spate of  bombings linked to the elections.    He was speaking at the Karmel old age home in Pretoria where  he had taken his mother, Mrs Corrie de Klerk, aged 89, to cast  her special vote.    Mr de Klerk told journalists that the government and the new  government of national unity would act sternly against those  responsible for the bombings, thought to be a "lunatic fringe on  the right".    He said no conclusions could be reached from voting patterns  so far, adding that he expected a high average percentage. He  was glad that technical hitches experienced at some polling  stations on Tuesday morning had been ironed out.</p>

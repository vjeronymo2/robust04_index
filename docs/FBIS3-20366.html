The decision should  be an independent one, entirely independent of how Sweden and  Norway act.    The official resolution from the joint meeting of the party  executive committee, the party board, and the party's Eduskunta  group did not specify a date, but judging from party chairman  Pertti Salolainen's remarks, sights have been set on September.    "If the present European Parliament succeeds in scrutinizing  the agreement this spring, September would be a very suitable  date for the referendum," he said, adding that the National  Coalition Party cannot accept any "clever party political  tactical maneuvering" on this issue. Nor should there be any  unnecessary delays or anything else that could jeopardize the  decision on EU membership at home.    The possibility of simultaneous referendums on EU membership  in the three Nordic applicant countries -- something to which  Prime Minister Esko Aho seems to have given thought -- was not  mentioned during the discussion, either by Salolainen or anyone  else.    The pressure for a rapid and emphatic yes to the EU is very  strong in the National Coalition Party. The whole matter was  even described as "the National Coalition Party's project."

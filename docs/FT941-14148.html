			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Insurers report strong single premium business Continued strong sales of single premium products over policies with annual premiums were reflected in figures for new business in 1993 from two of the UK's largest life companies. Prudential Corporation said that within the UK its single premium sales had risen by 24 per cent to Pounds 2.44bn (Pounds 1.97bn), while annual premium sales fell by 12 per cent to Pounds 286m (Pounds 325m). Within those totals there was an increase of 29 per cent in sales of single premium individual pensions to Pounds 403m. Annual premium sales of individual pensions fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 124m. Meanwhile, Legal &amp; General said that UK single premium business rose to Pounds 1bn (Pounds 736m). Annual premium business fell slightly to Pounds 142m (Pounds 143m). The continuing interest in single premium products is seen as further evidence that people are more reluctant than previously to make long-term savings commitments, given the recent recession and economic uncertainties. Both companies reported higher levels of business through independent financial advisers, one of the distribution channels available to them, along with direct sales forces and tied agents. Prudential said that IFAs now accounted for more than one third of UK new business, while for Legal &amp; General premium income from IFAs rose from 28 per cent to 34 per cent. L&amp;G highlighted in particular the growth of single premium product sales through IFAs. Prudential said the growth in its single premium life products came largely from sales of the Prudence Bond, which amounted to just over Pounds 1bn. Other life companies showed a different pattern of business. Commercial Union said that its new UK life and pensions business in 1993 contained an increase in annual premiums of 12 per cent, taking them to Pounds 63.1m, though its single premium new business fell by 31 per cent to Pounds 295m. It pointed out, however, that worldwide single premium business had reached a record level in 1992. Sun Alliance said similarly that while UK single premium new business was Pounds 264m, compared with Pounds 562m in 1992, the 1992 level represented an increase of just over 70 per cent on the previous year. Its annual premium new business in the UK rose by 5 per cent to Pounds 82m. Mr Trevor May, an analyst at BZW, said that the Prudential figures showed a fall in annual premiums slightly worse than the market had been expecting. Prudential shares closed down 12p at 364p. London and Manchester reported an overall increase in single premium business of 8 per cent to Pounds 238m, but annual premium business fell by almost a quarter to Pounds 31.5m. The group said that this fall reflected the restructuring which it had completed in 1993. Its shares fell by 23p to close at 413p.</p>

The Azerbaijani Army formations shelled Sotk  (former Zod) in Vardenisskiy Rayon with Grad rockets at 1730  today.    At the same time, two SU-25 warplanes belonging to the  Azerbaijani Air Force violated our Republic's airspace and  dropped two bombs around Sotk.    Our border guards took countermeasures and silenced the  enemy, shooting down one of the two SU-25 planes.    There are no casualties but there is destruction on our  side.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Identify pensions payments Sir, Observer's comments ('Director's tonic', September 28) about the size of payments to Glaxo's directors miss one important point. At least the total burden on Glaxo's present and future income is quantified. The contribution to Sir Paul Girolami's pension schemes is stated to have been Pounds 696,000. Contrast this with the typical company report. There it will be stated that the company's pension contributions for directors is whatever the average contribution rate is across the company multiplied by the directors' salaries. In Sir Paul's case, this would presumably be less than Pounds 200,000. The difference is between earmarking specific funds to pay for an individual's pension and assuming that it can be paid out of a general pot. The burden is the same; the accounting treatment is different. Perhaps it is time that company reports were obliged to show by how much the actuarial value of directors' pension benefits had increased from one year to the next. And in the event of insolvency of a pension scheme, to relate benefits directly to contributions actually made. That could do wonders to ensure schemes' solvency.

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Environment debate 'ignores plight of poor': World Bank's annual development report claims poverty alleviation is a moral imperative THE GLOBAL environmental debate has largely ignored the most serious problems facing developing countries, the World Bank says in its annual world development report, published today. The focus on threats such as global warming has diverted attention from the plight of poor countries where more than a billion people lack basic amenities such as clean water, adequate sanitation and clean air. Such problems are mainly the result of too little, rather than too much, economic development. 'Alleviating poverty is a moral imperative and a prerequisite for environmental sustainability,' it says. Ahead of next month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, the bank calls on rich countries to increase financial transfers to poor countries to help meet the cost of essential environmental reforms. Assistance for programmes that curb population growth should be doubled in real terms during the 1990s. The report says rapid economic growth can be compatible with an improved environment, but only if developing countries commit themselves to radical reforms costing 2-3 per cent of annual gross domestic product (GDP). In the absence of reforms, 'appalling environmental damage' is likely. Over the next 40 years the bank expects the world's population, now at 5.3bn, to grow by more than two-thirds to about 9bn. About 90 per cent of the increase will occur in developing countries. Food demand is expected nearly to double while global industrial output and energy consumption will more than triple. Green lobbyists may wonder at the bank's arithmetic: how can environmentally sound growth be bought at the price of a few per cent of GDP a year? The bank's answer is to attribute no intrinsic value to the environment as such: destruction of natural capital is not counted as a charge against current production. It then claims that the level of output is only one of several factors influencing pollution. Clean technologies can reduce the environmental damage inflicted per unit of raw material consumed and improved economic efficiency can reduce the inputs required for a given level of output. Changes in prices can reduce demand for environmentally-damaging products. The reassuring conclusion is that rapid growth need not threaten the environment. Dozens of colourful graphs reinforce the message. Divergent lines show how the environmental outlook can be good, mediocre or awful - depending on the policies of developing countries. If nothing is done, for example, vehicle emissions will rise more than fivefold by 2030; with tough reforms, they could fall. Experience in rich countries shows that growth and pollution can sometimes be 'delinked'. Since 1970 the output of rich countries has risen by 80 per cent yet lead emissions, for example, have fallen by 50 per cent in Europe. Air quality has improved, yet the annual cost of anti-pollution measures has been less than 1.5 per cent of GDP. The bank's ranking of environmental priorities sharply diverges from conventional wisdom. In order of importance the third world's problems are: Lack of clean water and sanitation. Some 1.7bn poor people lack access to sanitation while 1bn lack clean water. This causes 900m cases of diarrhoeal diseases a year and more than 3m children die. Air pollution. Some 1.3bn people live in urban areas where output of particulates (for example, dust and smoke) far exceed safe levels. Between 300m and 700m people, especially women and children, experience chronic indoor air pollution from cooking fires. Soil degradation. The loss of productive potential in rural areas due to soil erosion depletes GDP by as much as 1.5 per cent a year. The problems reflect poor farming methods and inefficient irrigation as well as advancing deserts. The bank says the way to tackle these chronic problems is by reducing poverty. The single most important step is better female education, which would sharply reduce family size and promote sounder agricultural policies as women are usually the 'principal managers of natural resources'. Some environmental problems are side-effects of growth. The loss of natural habitats and biodiversity is one example. Tropical forests are being depleted at a rate of just under 1 per cent a year. Animal species are also being destroyed at an accelerating pace. Global warming is a second example. The build up of carbon dioxide is expected to raise average temperatures by 3 degrees Celsius within a century  -and perhaps by more than 5 degrees Celsius. The bank advocates two kinds of green reforms. The first are 'win-win' policies offering benefits without negative effects on growth. The most important include: The removal of economic distortions. Developing countries encourage pollution by spending Dollars 230bn (Pounds 130bn) a year on energy subsidies. Deforestation is also encouraged by the charging of logging fees covering less than a third of the cost of replanting trees. Clarification of property rights. Resources such as forests are being depleted because people have open access to them. Where ownership rights are firmly established, as for metals and minerals, demand is rationed by rising prices which also encourage the use of substitutes. The bank concedes, however, that 'win-win' policies alone will not suffice. Some 'win-lose' policies restraining growth to achieve environmental goals are inevitable. It urges the use of market-based policies, such as taxes on polluters or tradeable pollution permits. US studies indicate flexible policies can sharply reduce the overall cost of pollution curbs by encouraging the producers least disrupted to shoulder the greatest burden. In some cases, however, market-based policies will have to be bolstered by direct 'command-and-control' regulation. The report says developing countries should bear most of the costs of local environmental programmes. These could amount to 2-3 per cent of GDP a year, but would be reflected mainly in higher prices for consumers rather than in government outlays. However, as the world's worst polluters, industrial countries should bear much of the burden of meeting global challenges, such as preservation of forests and animal species and the curbing of global warming. Such transfers should be seen as imports or 'payments for services rendered' rather than aid. Indeed, the bank points out that, if 'rights' to carbon emissions were based on population density, industrial countries would already have exceeded their quota and ought to pay compensation for their current emissions. Such compensation would roughly equal current development finance. The bank's underlying message is positive; some would say too good to be true. If governments can muster the political will to make rational - yet relatively inexpensive - reforms an extra 3.7bn people can enjoy rapid growth without threatening the environment.

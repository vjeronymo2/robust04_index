			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Biocompatibles considers offer despite imminent flotation Biocompatibles International, the research company aiming to raise Pounds 40m from its imminent flotation, was yesterday said to be discussing a possible takeover offer. The loss-making company, which has developed a new type of contact lens, was expected shortly to announce the pricing for its shares as part of a placing and intermediaries offer. Directors of the company, however, have recently been considering proposals for a joint venture, merger or sale. The bid is thought to have emerged only after the publication last month of its pathfinder prospectus. That showed that Biocompatibles, which describes itself as a manufacturer of medical devices rather than a biotechnology business, had accumulated losses of Pounds 9.77m at the end of June, and warned that investment in the company involved a higher than normal degree of risk. Robert Fleming, sponsors to the issue, said impact day had not been delayed, adding that 'there had never been a fixed timetable for the pricing'. If the flotation goes ahead, the group is expected to have a market value of about Pounds 80m. Of the Pounds 40m which is being raised, Pounds 25m will be placed firm, with the balance available to meet retail demand through intermediaries.</p>

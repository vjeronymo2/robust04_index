			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Technology: On the move, but still in touch - Pan-European mobile telephones are becoming increasingly popular Are pan-European mobile telephones a business necessity or the ultimate executive toy? Whatever the answer, we shall soon be hearing more about them. James Ross, telecommunications analyst at Hoare Govett, says Vodafone will be promoting its EuroDigital service more heavily this summer and Cellnet has launched a rival service this month. Friedman Wagner-Dobler, a computer consultant at Clasma Software, bought his Vodafone GSM telephone because 'our marketplace is Europe, so it's useful to be contactable on the numerous occasions I escape to Sweden or Germany'. GSM (Global System for Mobile) is a digital cellular technology which is becoming the standard for new European digital mobile telephone services. British Nuclear Fuels bought a number of Cellnet GSM telephones from Securicor Cellular Services to comply with European regulations for the transportation of hazardous goods. It uses the telephones to keep in touch with trucks carrying fuel rods and to inform the authorities of the position of its vehicles. The benefits are clear enough, but what are the choices if a telephone is needed that works on the Continent? In the UK, Vodafone and Cellnet offer GSM cellular services which can be used in continental Europe through so-called roaming agreements with national service providers. Although Cellnet's service is officially launched this month, it has been available for some time to customers who request it. The two GSM services are separate from the analogue services offered by Vodafone and Cellnet. This means would-be users will have to buy expensive new handsets costing around Pounds 200-Pounds 500, whereas the analogue equivalent can be bought for as little as Pounds 50-Pounds 100. However, because any GSM telephone will work with any GSM network, it is possible to shop around for telephones and even services, according to Peter Coates, marketing director of Multinational Automated Clearing House, a company which helps to simplify cross-charging between a number of European mobile telephone operators. 'Phone prices vary from country to country and you may pay different prices depending on whether you buy the phone with or without airtime,' says Coates. Tariffs for services also vary. 'Switzerland is one of the cheapest places to get GSM from, as is Sweden.' In addition to the GSM options, two UK mobile services, Mercury's One-2-One and Hutchison Microtel's Orange, are signing roaming agreements with other European operators whose services are also based on PCN (Personal Communications Network) digital technology, a variant of GSM. At present, there are few of these, but One-2-One and Orange users should eventually be able to use their telephones in Germany, where PCN operator E-Plus is offering services in Leipzig and Berlin. Whatever service is chosen, a pan-European mobile telephone is unlikely to be cheap. This is not because registration charges or monthly subscription charges are particularly high; a Vodafone or Cellnet GSM user pays about the same for UK calls and for registration and subscription as a business customer of its analogue services. The reason is that the mark-up on calls between countries can be vast. Yet despite this, most customers feel they receive value for money when using their GSM telephones in Europe. Would-be GSM users should be aware that if they receive a call when they are away from their home country, they must pay for the international leg of the call at BT rates. The caller pays the usual UK charge for dialling a cellular phone and may not even know the person being called is abroad. Using the voice mail services provided by cellular operators can also prove expensive. Wagner-Dobler says: 'If you use your phone in, say, Sweden, any unanswered calls will be redirected to Vodafone Recall (voice messaging). The calls will first be bounced from the UK to Sweden and then bounced back to the UK and you will pay for both international calls.' One way of avoiding this expense, according to Vodafone, is to pre-program the telephone to 'call forward unconditional' before leaving the UK. All calls will go straight to Vodafone Recall and can still be checked from Sweden or elsewhere. GSM coverage in Europe is still patchy. Mike Caldwell, a Vodafone spokesman, says it is very good in Germany and Scandinavia, good in Italy and the UK and virtually non-existent in Spain. Service in France is limited. Using an overseas GSM network is easy. Provided a credit-card sized Subscriber-Identity-Module Card (with built-in computer chip) is inserted into the telephone, it will select a local GSM network automatically. The local GSM network will also notify the home network where you are so it can transfer calls. Call quality is better in some countries than others, and mountainous areas are particularly subject to difficulty. Despite such teething problems, Wagner-Dobler is not alone when he says: 'It's a miracle that this kind of thing works at all.'</p>

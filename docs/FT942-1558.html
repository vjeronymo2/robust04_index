			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar above its yen low The dollar bounced off its post-war low against the yen yesterday as markets hoped that comments from US Treasury Secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen would give an indication of central bank intentions, writes Motoko Rich. As the US Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan refrained from commenting directly on the dollar in his testimony to the House budget committee, the dollar held above the Y100 level, closing in London at Y100.695, from Y101.225. Against the D-Mark, it ended at DM1.6006, down from DM1.6009. In New York the US currency improved to end at Y101.00 and DM1.6053. Sterling turned in a gloomy performance, shadowing the dollar's downward trend against the D-Mark and responding negatively to the publication of the minutes of the May 4 meeting between the UK chancellor and the Bank of England Governor. The dollar was fluctuating close to its post-1945 low, around Y100.70, after Mr Bentsen said he was 'concerned by recent movements in the exchange markets' and that the G7 partners were 'prepared to act as appropriate'. After overnight intervention from the Bank of Japan, the dollar had retrieved some of its Tuesday losses. The markets were hesitant to drive the dollar back down as they watched Mr Greenspan's testimony for clues about the Fed's intervention plans. The US currency was not on the agenda, however, and the Fed chairman kept largely to his script. The dollar skipped up when Mr Greenspan said he and Mr Bentsen were 'following currency movements'. Although inflationary pressures were subdued, he warned of a future re-emergence of inflation. Publication of the Fed's beige book, which helps the Fed evaluate the state of the US economy, gave the dollar a boost. It showed the US economy still expanding but at an easier pace. Analysts predicted that the dollar's bounce would not hold, however. 'I do not think there has been any convincing strength,' commented Mr Brian Hilliard, economist at SGST. 'I would expect the markets to have another go at the dollar to test the resolve of the central banks, but I do think a half per cent rise from the Fed would be neither here nor there.' The US currency's recent slide against the yen has been helped by strength in the Japanese currency. Ms Jane Edwards, economist at Lehman Brothers, said good export figures, and worries that a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's government will set back trade talks between the US and Japan, have driven the yen up against the dollar. Sterling was near its eight-month low against the D-Mark after the minutes of the May 4 meeting between UK chancellor Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George revealed a neutral stance on UK interest rate policy. Although both Mr Clarke and Mr George appeared to have abandoned their 'bias towards easing' rates, the minutes showed that an interest rate rise is not imminent. The pound was hit by traders who were hoping for a near-term rise. Sterling closed in London at DM2.4579 from DM2.4612, and against the dollar at Dollars 1.5356 from Dollars 1.5374. Analysts said that while the minutes helped to push the pound down, it was mainly trading on the dollar's weakness. 'The pound's performance against the D-Mark is just a reflection of the dollar's fall against the D-Mark,' said Mr Mark Geddes, economist at Midland Global Markets. The Bank of England provided the UK money markets with Pounds 340m liquidity at established interest rates and late assistance of Pounds 90m after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 600m. Overnight lending rates traded between 6 and 4 3/4 per cent. As attention was focused on the fragile dollar, the D-Mark ended little changed against most of the European crosses. In London, it closed against the French franc at FFr3.422 from FFr3.418, against the Belgian franc at BFr20.58 from BFr20.59, and against the lira at L983.3 from L987.4. The Bundesbank's five basis- point cut in the repo rate to 5.00 per cent was largely expected and had little effect on the markets. German call money remained at 5 per cent, largely unchanged from Tuesday's levels. The futures market was characterised by volatility as rumours of a no-confidence vote in Mr Hata's government in Japan sparked off selling of yen and helped the long end of the markets in bunds, gilts and futures contracts. 'We have seen a dramatic change in what has been a bearish market,' said Mr Richard Phillips, broker at GNI. The December Euromark contract traded 44,000 lots and rose to 94.87 from 94.78, discounting the short-term interest rate at 5.13 per cent. The short-term sterling contract for December was trading at thin volumes of 19,000 lots. 'Short-sterling has seen a reasonable rally very much led by the longer end of the yield and the gilts market,' added Mr Phillips. The December contract closed at 93.74 from 93.68.</p>

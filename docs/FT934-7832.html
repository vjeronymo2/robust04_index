			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Simpson move to Lucas confirmed LUCAS Industries, the UK automotive and aerospace components group, yesterday confirmed that its next chief executive would be Mr George Simpson, currently deputy chief executive of British Aerospace and chairman of Rover Group, BAe's vehicles subsidiary. The Midlands-based group has been trying for months to secure the services of Mr Simpson, 51, who is given much of the credit for the revival in Rover's fortunes. His appointment will go a long way to allaying City concerns over Lucas's protracted choosing of new management. Lucas would not reveal Mr Simpson's salary, but dismissed industry talk of his being offered Pounds 1m a year and a Pounds 3m bonus as 'ridiculously out of line'. There was some surprise that Mr Simpson would not be joining Lucas until May 1 and that Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of Lucas since 1987, would continue as non-executive chairman. However, it is expected that Sir Anthony, 63, will only stay on for as long as it takes to choose a new chairman, in whose appointment Mr Simpson will be fully involved. Mr Simpson's official statement left no doubt as to who would be in charge. He said: 'I am delighted to be joining the successful Lucas team and to be taking over its leadership from Tony Gill. My experience at Rover and British Aerospace tells me that there are few more competitive business sectors and I fully understand the magnitude of my new challenge.' Sir Anthony was asked last year to postpone his retirement until the succession was resolved. The group's finance director and head of aerospace had both left after failing to get the job of chief executive. Lucas was cited as a possible takeover target after recession caused profits to slump and its shares touched a five-year low of 78p in September last year. They have since recovered to 177p as the group has cut thousands of jobs and sold several businesses. The restructuring helped pre-tax profits double to Pounds 50.3m this year, but that is still a tiny return on sales of Pounds 2.56bn. In addition to Rover, Mr Simpson has responsibilities for some of BAe's problem areas, such as property development, construction and space systems. Rover analysis, Page 24 Lex, Page 22</p>

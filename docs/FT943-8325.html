			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Israelis hail fewer currency curbs: Shekel heads towards convertibility Israel's financial reforms are a step towards the shekel's full international convertibility and bring closer the integration of its capital market into the global economy. But the changes announced on Tuesday, allowing companies greater freedom to invest in property, foreign securities and bank deposits, still leave in place a range of controls. Restrictions will remain on the right of Israeli citizens to buy overseas property, or open foreign exchange bank accounts freely in Israel, or abroad. Israeli banks and economists welcomed the Bank of Israel's reforms yesterday as a long overdue step in the right direction, following changes in July which abolished central bank daily fixing of the exchange rate. While some analysts feel they do not go far enough, the bank says it is determined to move gradually in the direction of full convertibility, avoiding the experience of other countries which removed controls and then forced to put them back in place. 'We want to move consistently towards full convertibility of our currency and we want to make sure we don't take any steps that may cause a retreat or the tango principle of two steps forward one step back,' said Mr Jacob Frenkel, the bank governor. 'We want complete integration of Israel into world capital markets and complete competition in our financial system.' The main reform elements are: Israeli companies will be able to make unlimited non-financial investments abroad such as purchases of land or private companies. The move abolishes from October 1 a previous limit restricting investments to a maximum of 40 per cent of capital. Local companies will also be able, from October 1, to invest up to 10 per cent of their equity or 5 per cent of sales - whichever is the largest - in foreign securities or deposit the amount in foreign bank accounts. At present only exporting companies may deposit up to 10 per cent of export proceeds abroad and all businesses could only invest in Israeli stocks abroad such as those listed in New York. Institutional investors including provident funds, insurance funds and pension funds will be able to invest up to 2 per cent of their assets abroad from November 1. These investments will be subject to a 35 per cent tax on returns. Foreign companies will, for the first time, be permitted to raise money on the Israeli market and convert it in Israel into foreign currency. The move is subject to parliamentary approval. At present foreign companies can only raise money in Israel if they invest 80 per cent of the funds raised in Israel. The move reciprocates Israel's access to global markets. Mr David Klein, head of the Bank of Israel's monetary and foreign exchange department, said he was cautious about further moves towards convertibility given the Dollars 150bn of financial assets held by the Israeli public. 'We don't want to wake up one morning and find all our foreign exchange shifted overseas,' he said. 'We want to let companies do as much as they need to do with the minimum of interference while being sure we have a lid on the total amount that can be moved abroad.' However he said that within the next two years Israel could move as close to full convertibility as many other developed countries without removing all curbs on foreign investments by institutional investors. 'You don't have to let every shekel move freely to have international convertibility,' said Mr Klein. Further moves by Israel towards convertibility will, however, depend on control over inflation and continued fiscal discipline. Israel has had solid achievements in the past five years in budget deficit reduction limiting the deficit this year to 3 per cent with a target of 2.75 per cent of GDP for 1995. Performance on inflation has been more disappointing. The Bank of Israel managed to wrestle inflation down to 10 per cent last year but prices have risen this year by around 13-14 per cent. Israel is unlikely to take bolder measures towards convertibility without bringing inflation down towards levels of developed countries. However, in preparation for surrendering exchange controls further Israel also announced reforms in the policy instruments available to the Bank of Israel. The government increased by 50 per cent the bank's ceiling on issuing short-term treasury bills from Shk10bn (Pounds 2.1bn) to Shk15bn and said in future the ceiling would be increased automatically with the money supply. The government also permitted the bank to intervene in the bond market.</p>

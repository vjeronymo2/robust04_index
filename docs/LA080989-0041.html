			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> U.S. STILL BALKS AT LINKING IRAN FUNDS, HOSTAGES  </P> <P> The Bush Administration on Tuesday brushed aside an Iranian hint of help in  freeing American hostages in exchange for the release of Iranian funds that  were frozen in the United States after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in  Tehran a decade ago.  </P> <P> "Our position is the same as it's always been, that we are not willing to link  the Iranian assets questions to the hostage question," White House Press  Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. "That fits within the definition of our policy  of not trading arms or money or whatever for hostages and of not paying ransom  for hostages."  </P> <P> The Tehran Times, in a report distributed by the Islamic Republic News Agency,  called on Washington to guarantee the return the Iranian assets -- estimated  variously at $2 billion to $4 billion -- as the first step in a process that  could lead to the release of the American hostages being held by Islamic  militants in Lebanon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sure of Husband's Death  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, wife of hostage William R. Higgins, told  reporters at the Pentagon that it is no longer possible to doubt that her  husband was killed by his kidnapers.  </P> <P> In a stoic statement, she pledged her support to President Bush "as he tries to  save the living and end the suffering."  </P> <P> The Tehran Times quoted what it described as a source close to President  Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying: "The first step should be taken by the United  States, and if Tehran gets satisfied that its assets will certainly be  unfrozen, then the second step will definitely come from Iran."  </P> <P> The Iranian assets, including arms purchased by the late Shah Mohammed Reza  Pahlavi but not delivered, were frozen when Washington broke relations with  Tehran over the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in 1979. Iran long has demanded the  return of the assets as its price for improved relations with the United  States.  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the Iranian assets issue will  be resolved by the special Iran-U.S. tribunal that is evaluating competing  claims to the funds. The panel earlier decided to allocate as much of the money  as is needed to satisfy valid claims by Americans against the Iranian  government and to return the rest of the funds to Tehran.  </P> <P> There is no possibility that Iran would get the arms purchased by the shah,  although the value of the weapons has been added to the frozen bank accounts  and other assets.  </P> <P> "These issues and the process of resolving the questions of the assets have no  connection or linkage whatsoever with the hostage issue," Boucher said.  </P> <P> Fitzwater acknowledged that a "good many messages" have been sent between the  United States and Iran through intermediaries in recent days, but he refused to  say whether any messages mentioned the assets.  </P> <P> Despite the Administration's rejection of the Iranian overture on assets,  Fitzwater said he sees "room for improvement in relations" with Iran.  </P> <P> One possibility for a hostage release remains a deal involving the Islamic  radicals and Israel. However, a senior leader of Hezbollah, the  Iranian-sponsored group thought to be an umbrella for hostage holders, said the  organization will refuse to negotiate with Israel unless the Jerusalem  government first releases Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, a Shiite Muslim clergyman  seized by Israeli commandos on July 28.  </P> <P> Sheik Sobhi Tofaili said in a statement distributed Tuesday in Beirut that  "there shall be no contacts and no negotiations" as long as Obeid remains in  captivity.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeal to Israel  </P> <P> U.N. Undersecretary General Marrack Goulding, completing a visit to Israel,  appealed to Israel to release Obeid without conditions. However, Defense  Minister Yitzhak Rabin said that Israel would only free the clergyman in  exchange for hostages including three Israeli soldiers.  </P> <P> Higgins' wife said that the Marine Corps commandant had told her it is  virtually certain that Higgins, a Marine lieutenant colonel seized in February,  1988, while on U.N. peacekeeping duty, is dead. The militants last week  released a videotape showing a man who resembled Higgins hanging from the end  of a rope.  </P> <P> Referring to her husband by his nickname, she said, "Rich went to Lebanon in  the service of the United Nations because he believed he could be useful, that  he could help and that he was needed.  </P> <P> "To those who would suggest that our concern for Rich should somehow be  mitigated because he was in a dangerous business or because his act of  volunteering was supposedly foolish, Rich himself would have the appropriate  reply: 'When you're out front, people will shoot at you,' " she said.  </P> <P> "Now is not the time for anger and bitterness, for recriminations and blame.  Now is the time for calm reflection, for kind thoughts of the man who has  brought us together. Now is the time to tell Rich Higgins that we love him and  we miss him."  </P> <P> Times staff writer James Gerstenzang contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Hogg Robinson slips to Pounds 10m HOGG ROBINSON, the travel, transport and financial services group, experienced a slight fall in interim profits reflecting weakness in the business and leisure travel markets. Pre-tax profits slipped from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 10.1m in the six months to September 30. Turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 57.1m helped by acquisitions. 'In the circumstances, this is a pretty good set of results,' said Mr Chris Brown, finance director. Operating profits from travel fell from Pounds 5.53m to Pounds 4.34m. Business travel, which accounts for about 60 per cent of the division's turnover, was affected by the recession and companies' tight control of travel budgets. The transport division, which covers commercial freight operations in Europe and the Falklands, increased profits 50 per cent to Pounds 3.17m. Net cash fell Pounds 1m to Pounds 28m and interest earnings were lower at Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 1.81m). Earnings fell to 9.35p (10.03p) but the interim dividend is increased to 2.6p (2.5p). COMMENT Times obviously remain tough in travel. While price cutting on the high street grabs the headlines, the downturn in corporate travel budgets - initiated ahead of the Gulf war - is more damaging. Business travel will also be affected by sterling's fall in value. Companies will have another reason to stop executives upgrading to business class. But Hogg's performance elsewhere was encouraging, especially at Dens, giving grounds for optimism in the longer term. Before then, Hogg is looking to spend some of its cash pile on acquisitions, probably in the travel division. Full year forecasts of Pounds 15m put the shares on just over 12 times, suggesting there is room for growth once consumer and corporate confidence returns to the travel market.</p>

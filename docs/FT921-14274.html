			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / International Company News: Citicorp to shed Ambac holding CITICORP, the biggest US bank that has been struggling to bolster its capital and contain loan losses, last night began preparing for the possible sale of its remaining 49.7 per cent shareholding in Ambac, the municipal bond insurance business, writes Alan Friedman. Citicorp said Ambac had lodged a filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) saying it may offer all or part of the 17.4m shares now owned by Citicorp. At yesterday's share price of Dollars 32 3/4 , that would place a market value of Dollars 569.9m on Citicorp's 49.7 per cent of Ambac. Last July, Citicorp sold 50.3 per cent of Ambac, once a crown jewel in the bank's portfolio, for Dollars 352m.</p>

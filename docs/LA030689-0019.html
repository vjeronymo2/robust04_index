			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BAD SCENE IN SOUTH TEXAS'  </P> <P> "Bad scene in South Texas" has the INS and the refugees from Nicaragua between  a "rock and a hard place." Members of Congress, above all, must be held  responsible for their procrastination and ineptitude in developing a logical  immigration policy. Their lack of prescience in the "on again, off again"  penurious funding of the Contras would have made a difference in the lives of  their citizens had they funded the Contras properly.  </P> <P> Not unlike a plague, the Nicaraguans, now considered refugees, are joined by  the people of El Salvador and Guatemala inundating our ports of entry on our  southern border.  </P> <P> Until the political, socioeconomic conditions improve they shall continue to  deluge our borders.  </P> <P> "We inherit the wind!"  </P> <P> SAMUEL S. SHERWIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

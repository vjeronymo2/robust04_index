			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: WestLB down 7% after provisions Operating profits at WestLB, the German state-owned bank, fell 7 per cent to DM290m (Dollars 184.7m) after risk provisions in the six months to the end of June. WestLB, which is in effect the financial services provider to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, set aside DM565m to cover bad and doubtful debts, up from DM550m in the comparable period of last year. The bank group would achieve a satisfactory result for the full 12 months, Mr Friedel Neuber, chairman, said in a statement issued yesterday. Results reported in the statement were presented according to the traditional German system, under which figures for the first six months are compared with 50 per cent of the previous year's totals. On a direct comparison, not provided by WestLB, operating profits rose slightly from DM281m in the first half of last year, while provisions climbed sharply from DM469m. On the traditional basis, operating income before provisions was virtually unchanged at DM856m. In common with other banks, WestLB's earnings from own-account trading suffered badly in the early-year turbulence in financial markets, dropping from DM198m to DM33m. Net interest earnings rose 5.5 per cent to DM1.6bn, while commission income from financial and other services for customers stagnated at DM264m. Reduced pensions provisioning and tight cost management reduced administration costs 5 per cent to DM1.1bn. The figures included the first-time consolidation of a 39.9 per cent stake in Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein, which contributed to a 13.5 per cent rise in the group's total assets to DM328bn. Excluding this factor, they increased 4.6 per cent. No other effects of the consolidation were reported.</p>

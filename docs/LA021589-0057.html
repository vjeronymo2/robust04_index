			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : NIEHAUS MOVES FROM 'BIRD' TO 'HOT MEN'; PIANIST DAVID BENOIT GETS  STAMP OF APPROVAL  </P> <P> Lennie Niehaus, musical director for Clint Eastwood's "Bird," has been signed  to supervise the sound track for "The Hot Men," a film about the "love-hate"  relationship between clarinetist Benny Goodman and drummer Gene Krupa scheduled  to begin shooting in May.  </P> <P> The film -- to be produced by Philip A. Waxman ("The Gene Krupa Story," "Tell  Them Willie Boy Is Here") and to be directed from his original script by Bob  Boris ("Steele Justice," "Oxford Blues") -- will spotlight four Los Angeles  musicians handpicked by Niehaus to recreate music played by Goodman's quartet  in the '30s.  </P> <P> Clarinetist Abe Most, drummer Jack Sperling, vibist Charlie Shoemake and  pianist Mike Lang will respectively play the musical roles of Goodman, Krupa,  vibist Lionel Hampton and pianist Teddy Wilson, a unit that was noted both for  its artistry and as the jazz world's first integrated foursome.  </P> <P> All the music for "The Hot Men" will be newly recorded by Niehaus.  </P> <P> CHASING A GRAMMY: Pianist-composer David Benoit, 35, sees his Grammy nomination  for best jazz fusion performance for "Every Step of the Way" (GRP) as a solid  stamp of approval. "Being from the South Bay and hanging in with local bands,  working my way up, it's truly exciting to get this kind of recognition from the  industry," the Redondo Beach resident said.  </P> <P> The nomination came as a surprise, Benoit said. "Actually, when I did 'This  Side Up' (Spindletop, 1985), I thought that one would get a nomination, but it  didn't, and neither did 'Freedom at Midnight' (GRP, 1987), so I said 'To hell  with it.' So I had no expectations, but when I found out, I was thrilled."  </P> <P> Benoit is up against saxman Tom Scott ("Amaretto" from "Streamlines," GRP);  bassist John Patitucci ("John Patitucci," GRP); the Yellowjackets ("Politics,"  MCA); and keyboardist Lyle Mays ("Street Dreams," Geffen).  </P> <P> "If I were up against Miles Davis or George Benson, it would be tougher, but  the way it is, it's pretty even," he said. "Lyle, the Yellowjackets, John,  we're all contemporaries of each other. Tom Scott has more experience, so he  may be favored, but the balance is nice."  </P> <P> Benoit is currently at work on his new LP, "Urban Daydreams," "which includes  some contemporary things in an orchestral setting that Don Grusin's producing,"  he said, "and I just did a straight-ahead date with Emily Remler and Luther  Hughes, both for GRP."  </P> <P> The pianist's next Los Angeles appearance will be at the Greek Theatre in June.  </P> <P> RECORDED BEST BET: Trombonist Ray Anderson's "Blues Bred in the Bone"  (Gramavision) is a mad mixture of blues, funk, swing and sentiment that teems  with musical life. Anderson, possessing a gargantuan tone, is sassy and biting  on the title track, alternately raucous and tender on "A Flower Is a Lovesome  Thing," and simply a delight on the rhumba-ish "Mona Lisa." The strong cast,  including guitarist John Scofield and pianist Anthony Davis, shines throughout.  </P></p>

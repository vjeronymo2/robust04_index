			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Age of Financial Statements of Significant Foreign Equity Investees or Foreign Acquirees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the amendments adopted today, the financial statements of significant foreign equity investees and acquired foreign businesses furnished in filings by domestic issuers can be updated on the same time schedule as foreign private issuers. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  Registration statements of foreign private issuers need not include audited financial statements of the most recently completed fiscal year until six months after the year-end; unaudited interim financial statements are required only to the extent necessary to bring the most recent financial statements included in the filing to a date within ten months of effectiveness. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If the acquired business or investee does not meet the definition of a foreign business, financial statements would need to be updated pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;12 of Regulation S&hyph;X. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 210.3&hyph;19. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although two commenters doubted that there was significant additional cost or difficulty associated with updating foreign investees and acquiree financial statements on the same basis as domestic issuers, most commenters felt that financial reporting practices outside the U.S. varied to such a degree as to present significant obstacles to the preparation of separate financial statements on as timely a basis as is required for U.S. companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Streamlining of Required Financial Statement Schedules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments adopted today eliminate the following six schedules that had previously been eliminated for foreign private issuers: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Rule 12&hyph;02_Marketable Securities_Other Investments including Schedule XIII <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Rule 12&hyph;03_Amounts Receivable from Related Parties and Underwriters, Promoters and Employees Other Than Related Parties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Rule 12&hyph;05_Indebtedness of and to Related Parties_Not Current. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Rule 12&hyph;06_Property, Plant and Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Rule 12&hyph;07_Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization of Property, Plant and Equipment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Rule 12&hyph;08_Guarantees of Securities of Other Issuers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two additional schedules previously required for both foreign and domestic issuers also will be eliminated: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Rule 12&hyph;10_Short-term Borrowings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Rule 12&hyph;11_Supplementary Income Statement Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Schedules Previously Eliminated From Foreign Issuer Filings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Marketable Securities_Other Investments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rules adopted today eliminate this schedule. All of the issuers and accountants supported elimination of this schedule, but several financial analyst commenters did not favor elimination because they believed that the schedule provided information facilitating comparisons among companies whose accounting is affected by the classification of investments as either current or noncurrent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elimination of this schedule was proposed because much of its information is required to be disclosed in financial statements by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities'' (``SFAS 115''), issued in May 1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (``FASB'') and effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. Under SFAS 115, the designation as current or noncurrent no longer affects the carrying value of a security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters favored retention of the schedule's requirement for identification of securities of individual issuers exceeding 2% of the registrant's total assets. The Commission believes retention of the specific disclosure is unnecessary because other rules applicable to filings by public companies should lead to appropriate disclosure if a particular investment is material. Disclosures required by Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K, ``Management's Discussion and Analysis,'' include discussion of the material effects and uncertainties associated with concentrations and risks in the investment portfolio. <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  In addition,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 105,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Disclosure of Information about Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentrations of Credit Risk,'' (``SFAS 105'') requires disclosure of all significant concentrations of credit risk arising from an individual counterparty or groups of counterparties that would be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Act Release No. 6835 (May 18, 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Amounts Receivable From Related Parties and Underwriters, Promoters and Employees Other Than Related Parties and Indebtedness of and to Related Parties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has eliminated these schedules as proposed. None of the commenters cited the need to retain these schedules, as similar information is required to be furnished pursuant to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 57,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Related Party Transactions'' (``SFAS 57'') and Regulation S&hyph;K, Item 404 ``Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Critical Decision on Baghdad"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The question of Syria is the  third point in Turkey's foreign policy that has aroused concern.  Developments in domestic politics have overshadowed that  problem. In view of that, little attention has been focused on  whether or not President Clinton was able to influence President  al-Asad when they met some time ago. A high-ranking official  has said that President Clinton was able to do so. Intelligence  reports Turkey has recently received indicate that Syria has  seriously restricted Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leader Abdullah  Ocalan's activities in that country.  <H5>  Restrictions on Ocalan </H5>   There are various rumors about Ocalan's whereabouts. He is  reported to be living in a village between Syria and Lebanon.  He has been informed that he must remain indoors during the day  and avoid holding political talks. There are reports that the  PKK camps in Syria have been closed down and the movement of PKK  militants has been restricted. In short, Turkey's pressure  seems to have achieved a certain degree of success.    Meanwhile, the Turkish Foreign Ministry is worried that  Turkey may be subjected to intensive pressure by Western  countries on matters related to the Kurdish problem. It seems  that the first signs of that pressure have come from the United  States.    In Germany, a motion on the Kurdish problem has recently  been  blocked in the Bundestag. Undoubtedly, it will be looked at  again if a message is received from the United States. [passage  omitted]</p>

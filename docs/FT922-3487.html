			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Directors quit over WestLB sale plan THREE of the five main board directors of Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein resigned yesterday in protest at plans for the sale of a stake in the publicly-owned institution to Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB). Despite denials from Mr Bjorn Engholm, head of the Kiel-based bank's administrative council, Mr Gerd Lausen, chairman, suggested a deal had already been struck, even though negotiations are not due to start until July. Mr Engholm, who is also leader of the federal Social Democrat (SPD) opposition party, and prime minister of Schleswig-Holstein, is a close associate of Mr Johannes Rau, SPD, prime minister of North-Rhine Westphalia, the state which owns WestLB. The boardroom walk-out marks another extraordinary turn in the evolution of the regional public banking industry in Germany, and highlights the mounting resentment against the aggressive WestLB and its chairman, Mr Friedel Neuber. WestLB, heading for operating profits of DM1bn (Dollars 632m) this year, is the biggest of the regional banks and the third-largest bank in the country. Since the Hesse state bank, Helaba, rejected its approaches in 1988, WestLB has linked up with SudwestLB in Stuttgart, set up DIHB specialising in industrial banking services in east Germany, and expanded its WestLB Europa subsidiary into 13 European countries. Mr Neuber, who is regularly accused of over-stepping the boundaries of what is correct for a state bank, has also built up a substantial presence in industry by buying minority stakes in local companies such as Preussag, the steel and engineering group. The traditional role of the state banks is to act as umbrella organisations for regional government-run savings banks and as financing conduits for local authorities in their home states.</p>

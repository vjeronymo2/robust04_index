			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UK markets A stronger pound and the realisation that lower base rates were not an official priority for the new year proved only limited discouragement to the equity market. After an initial wobble, the FT-SE 100 resumed its upward course, due partly to buying from the US. Assuming Dixons' disappointing Christmas was not a general reflection of the consumer mood, the conclusion might be that the economy is strong enough to sustain equities without the prop of a further interest rate cut. Certainly the strength of sterling should not yet be a cause for concern. The currency has some way to go to recoup the 1992 devaluation. Since then, productivity gains and falling unit-labour costs have increased UK competitiveness. Even a rise over DM2.60 need not force the authorities' hand. Perhaps with hindsight the pre-budget cut of just half a point should be seen as a sign of government determination to measure out the monetary largesse. At least the authorities are conserving room to cut rates if tax rises do upset the recovery, though it may take until summer to be sure. While that is some comfort for equities, the prospect of a prolonged period of stable and low rates should be better for sentiment than a deep but short-lived trough.</p>

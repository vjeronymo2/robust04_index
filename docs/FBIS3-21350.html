			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ahmad Abu-al-Hasan Zard, Information Bureau: </F> "New Budget Announced; Legacy of Previous Budgets: A Solid  Economy and A Comprehensive Developmental Renaissance"]    [Text] The announced budget for the new Hijra [H] year  1414/1415 [1993/94] underscores the solidity and viability of  the Saudi economy, despite world developments and conditions  that envelop it. The most important such developments are lower  oil prices, the difficulties that the world economy in general  is encountering that have impacted international economic  conditions, and the increase in petroleum supply and its  imports, which accounted this past year for 75 percent of the  Kingdom's total revenues. That decline in revenues has  negatively influenced the GNP rate of growth in all sectors of  the domestic economy whose growth this past year is put at 1  percent (preliminary estimate).    Meanwhile, the private sector grew by a comfortable 5.1  percent. This rate emphasizes clearly indicates that the private  sector continues to expand as a basic and strong bulwark of the  development process. It is also an indication of the continued  growth of the absorptive capacity of the national economy thanks  to private investments undertaken in the past few years.    It is common knowledge that the Kingdom is undergoing a  comprehensive developmental and cultural renaissance in all  sectors, with an equilibrium that reflects the genius of  planning and the thoroughness of performance at all levels  continues day after day. The factors of goodness and development  never cease diligent action, and the forces of habilitation are  tireless.    The general budget, with its facts and figures, embodies the  sincere efforts of the government of the Custodian of the Two  Holy Mosques to boost the advancement and improve the quality of  life of the citizenry; [so much so that] the Kingdom leads the  countries of the world in citizens' standard of living.    It goes without saying that the budget will be implemented  in  the form of tangible developmental and cultural accomplishments  such as those monuments and fortresses of industry and the high  standards of health, educational, social, cultural, and other  services. All of this crystallizes in the form of economic  stability, which is the reality of life in the Kingdom, that  creates a proper and fitting environment and is one of the  factors in attracting foreign investment.    This study, therefore, focuses on the following points:     -  the development of the state budget    -  a careful review of previous budgets    -  developmental accomplishments    -  the role of financing institutions    -  economic stability as a factor in attracting foreign  investments.   <H5>    Budgetary Development in the Kingdom </H5>   The Kingdom's interest in fiscal matters began early. The  Directorate of Finance was created in 1346H [1927], was renamed  a year later to be the Finance Agency, then became the Ministry  of Finance by virtue of a Royal Decree issued on 3/4/1351H  [1932]. The first budget ever was issued that year, during the  reign of the late King 'Abd-al-'Aziz. The budget's term ran from  1 Sha'ban to 30 Rajab. The first budget had a value of  106,442,544 Amiri piasters or the then equivalent of 10 million  silver riyals. The Kingdom's revenues were then derived from  pilgrimage, customs, alms, and Amiri land holdings.    Revenues and expenditures, as dual budgetary components,  were  first used in 1367H [1948] and [when the budget] covered the  period from Muharram to the end of Zul-Hijjah. The budget has  been issued regularly since then, even though its timing varied  every now and again. Later, Royal Decree No. 8 of 15  Jamadi-al-Awwal 1378H [1959], based on Council of Minister's  Decree No.48 dated 10/5/1378H [1959], mandated that the budget  be issued on the first of Rajab, spanning the period to the end  of Jamadi-al-A'khirah.    The state's budget was tied to the development plan from the  year 1390/1391H [1970/71] when the first five-year plan began.  Budget instructions [then] mandated that it be drafted in tandem  with the development plan already approved by the Council of  Ministers by virtue of Decree No.812 of 1390H [1970].    The Kingdom, in accordance with a decree of the Council of  Ministers in 1407/1408H [1987/88], adopted a fiscal year that  begins on 10 al-Jaddi (31 December) and ends on 9 al-Jaddi (30  December). In 1405/1406H [1985/86], the fiscal year used to  begin in the middle of one Hijra year and end in the middle of  the following Hijra year.  <H5>  A Review of Budgetary Figures in Past Years </H5>   It is common knowledge that revenues and expenditures are  major indicators that reflect the economy's condition and  strength. It is no secret that the Kingdom's budget has  undergone remarkable and tangible changes reflected in  increasing revenues and escalating expenditures amounting to  R3,485 billion for the period from 1390H to 1413H [1970-92].    It is be noted that public expenditures have grown  noticeably  from R6 billion in [fiscal] year 1389/90H [1969/70] to R298  billion in the year 1401/1402H [1980/81] and to R196.95 billion  in 1413/1414H [1992/93]. They stand at R160 billion in the  budget of the new 1414/1415H [1993/94] year.    Revenues, on the other hand, climbed from R6 billion to R340  billion by 1401/1402H [1980/81] and amounted to R169.150 billion  in 1413/1414H [1992/93].    It may be said that outlays for various services and sectors  have continued to rise over the past ywo years despite the  circumstances experienced by the region, as indicated by the  [following] cursory review of major budgetary allocations.    Defense and security appropriations rose from R54.300  billion  in 1412/1413H [1991/92] to R61.636 billion in 1413/1414H  [1992/93]. Education received R31.100 billion in 1412/1413H  [1991/92]; rising to R34.093 billion in last year's budget.  Allocations for health and social development climbed from  R12.200 billion in the 1412/1413H [1991/92] budget to R14.087  billion in last year's budget. Allocations for transportation  and telecommunications grew from R8.300 billion in 1412/1413H  [1991/92] to R9.078 billion last year. Allocations for economic  resource development expanded from R8.000 billion to R8.930  billion; local subsidies from R7.100 billion to R9.176 billion;  municipal services and water utilities from R6.300 billion to  R6.980 billion; and infrastructure allocations from R2.100  billion to R2.095 billion. Other allocations [dropped] from  R51.600 billion to R50.884 billion.    Expenditures for secretariats, municipalities, and water  utilities are estimated at R5,52698 billion in the fiscal year  1414/1415H [1993/94]. Allocations for maintenance and management  contracts and approved construction projects are estimated at  R43.000 billion. The 22 general organizations authorities are to  receive R28.000 billion and R387.413 million [as published].    Figures, as they say, are not cut and dry. Rather, they  reflect the economic state, including the various and numerous  accomplishments in all fields, sectors, and agencies as the  following facts would indicate:     -  The government extended some $70 billion in long-term soft  loans to citizens and to companies in order to support domestic  investments in agriculture, industry, housing, and the  construction of private hospitals and hotels. Development funds  will likewise make available some R7.870 billion in  interest-free soft loans. [as published]    -  The hard currency balances of commercial banks in the Kingdom  exceed $15 billion.    -  The Saudi riyal is stable in value and is covered by special  hard currency reserves of more than $30 billion.    -  The Kingdom's foreign assets are valued at $72 billion by the  end of 1417H [1996], according to IMF sources.  <H5>  Accomplishments in Development </H5> <H5>  Industry. </H5>   The number of operating licensed factories increased from  199  in 1390H [1970] to 2,036 in 1413H [1992], in which R138.5  billion has been invested.    The number of food industries multiplied during the  1401-1413H [1980-92] period from 150 to 320. These industries  produce milk and milk products, cereal and olive products,  fodder and carbonated water products, drinking water, meats,  fish, sweets, and dates.    Food processing plants account for 16 percent of all  factories in the Kingdom. Investments in that sector are  estimated at about R7.5 billion.    The volume [value] of Saudi exports amounted to R3.700  billion [as published] by the end of 1413H [1992].    The Kingdom has eight industrial cities, covering a total  area of 54.387 million square meters. Construction of those  cities began in 1390H [1970]. Three of them were initially  constructed at Riyadh, Dammam, and Jeddah followed by others at  al-Qasim, Ahsa', Mekkah, and Baridah. The cost of those cities  exceeded R1 billion.  <H5>  Agriculture. </H5>   The state encourages citizens to plant the reclaimed land it  has disbributed to farmers over the years--an amount of 1.8  million hectares of farm land. This helped increase the size of  cultivated land from five million hectares to 1.4 million  hectares by the year 1412/1413H [1991/92].    That strategy has produced outstanding results. The  production of wheat set a record of 4 million tons. The number  of wheat farms has increased by 37 percent since 1407H [1986].  The standard of crops delivered to the Granary Grinding  Authority--which is responsible for purchasing the crops--has  improved at the rate of more than one-half [as published].    Self-sufficiency has been reached in fish and most  vegetables, fruits, eggs, birds, poultry, and dates. The Kingdom  is one of the major date producers, with an annual production of  600,000 tons, most of which is exported to Muslim countries and  the remainder consumed domestically.  <H5>  The Desalination Station </H5>   The daily capacity of water desalination stations expanded  from 5.1 million gallons to 502 million gallons by 1413H [1992]  in order to supply the water needs of the citizenry. The volume  of water used for irrigation is estimated at 12,322 cubic meters  annually. The Kingdom's output of desalinated water accounts for  30 percent of world production and ranks first world-wide.  <H5>  Telephones </H5>   The number of operating telephone lines increased from  39,000  in 1390H [1970] to about 1.45 million in 1413H [1992]. The cost  of local calls, amounting to R500 million annually, is absorbed  by the state now that such fees have been abolished by a  resolution of the Council of Ministers at its meeting on  20/9/1412H, coinciding with 23/3/1992 AD.  <H5>  Electricity </H5>   Power generating capacity expanded from 418 megawatts,  serving 316,000 subscribers, to about 21,000 megawatts, serving  some 15 million beneficiaries throughout the Kingdom.  <H5>  Education </H5>    The number of schools and colleges increased from 3,107 in  1390H [1970] to 19,631 in 1413H [1992]. The total number of male  and female students at all levels of education in the Kingdom  grew at the annual rate of 8.7 [percent], from 547,000 in 1390H  [1970] to about 2.5 million in 1413H [1992].    The number of non-university students increased from 528,000  males and females in 1390H [1970] to 3.397 million in 1413H  [1992]. The number of male and female university students rose  from 8,000 in 1390H [1970] to 140,000 in 1413H [1992]. The  number of universities increased from three in 1390H [1970] to  seven universities and 14 girls' colleges in 1413H [1992].  <H5>  Health </H5>   The number of hospitals increased from 74 hospitals and 591  primary health care centers in 1390H [1970] to 272 hospitals and  3,154 primary health care centers in 1413H [1992]. The number of  hospital beds in the Kingdom increased from 9,000 to more than  41,000 in 1413H [1992]. This figure includes Ministry of Health  hospitals, whose beds increased from 7,165 to about 26,900. The  number of physicians rose from 1,172 to 26,153 and the number of  nursing staff members likewise increased from 3,261 to 53,871  male nurses. The number of technical assistants rose during the  same period from 1,741 to 29,758.  <H5>  Athletics </H5>   They say that a sound body begets a sound mind, prompting  the  Kingdom's government to provide all kinds of incentives and  encouragement for athletes and athletics. As a result, the  number of gymnasiums increased from 53 in 1390H [1970] to 164 in  1413H [1992]. Athletic federations increased from five to 20.  Nineteen youth houses, five neighborhood playgrounds, 17  athletic and cultural centers, nine literary clubs, nine  stadiums, two permanent youth camps, and 24 club athletic  facilities have been constructed and were operational by the end  of 1413H.  <H5>  Road and Telecommunications Networks </H5>   The network of paved roads grew from 8,021 km in 1390H  [1970]  to more than 41,000 km in 1412H [1991], thereby connecting all  cities and most villages in the Kingdom with a network of two-  or multi-lane paved roads. The network of dirt roads likewise  grew 25-fold from 2,500 to about 93,000 square km. The number of  quays at Saudi ports increased from 27 in 1395H [1975] to 179 by  1413H [1992]--of these, industrial ports account for 45 quays.  <H5>  The Role of Financing Institutions </H5>   Numerous financing institutions play a developmental role in  order to fulfill the desires of residents and raise the standard  of services by supporting and energizing construction,  installation, and housing habilitation. Those institutions are  the Agricultural Bank, the Lending Bank, the Real Estate  Development Fund, and the Industrial Development Fund.    As an example: The Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank has  distributed as grants a total of R5 million since it was founded  in 1384H [1964] through the year 1410/1411H [1989/90]. The  cumulative aggregate of bank grants to farmers amounts to about  R9.1 billion for the period from 1393/1394H [1973/74] to  1410/1411H [1990/91].    From its foundation until the year 1412H [1991], the Lending  Bank has extended more than 155,500 loans for marriage purposes  as well as R3.964 billion in general loans to 278,186  beneficiaries.    The cumulative aggregate value of loans extended by the Real  Estate Development Bank since it was established in 1395H [1975]  until the year 1412H [1991] amounted to R103.277 billion to  finance the construction of 483,475 housing units.    The Industrial Development Fund, since its creation in 1394H  [1974] and until the end of the fiscal year 1411/1412H  [1991/92], made available more than R13.9 billion. The Fund is  primarily concerned with industrial development in the private  sector.  <H3>  Economic Stability As A Factor in Attracting Foreign  Investment </H3>   The Kingdom enjoys the advantages of a vibrant domestic  market and notable economic prosperity, making it an attractive  destination for foreign investments. That, in itself, indicates  that the Saudi economy enjoys world confidence. International  reports show that $20 billion in investments has flowed into the  Kingdom in recent years. It is common knowledge that the  Kingdom's economic climate is what encouraged investors to boost  their investments. Inducement incentives include the potential  for obtaining Industrial Development Fund loans amounting to as  much as 50 percent of project costs, not to mention the  availability of economic, technical, and managerial assistance  from the Fund. Imports required for industrial projects are  totally free from customs duties. Such imports include  machinery, tools, equipment, apparatuses, spare parts, and  semi-manufactured primary raw materials. Foreign capital enjoys  all the privileges of domestic capital in order to protect and  support domestic industries. Furthermore, industrial and  agricultural projects financed [in part] by foreign capital are  forgiven certain income taxes for a period of 10 years provided  that domestic capital accounts for no less than 25 percent of  the [joint] venture.    There are numerous advantages, incentives, and facilities  aimed at promoting investment in the Kingdom.    The new budget therefore underscores the absorptive capacity  of the Saudi national economy and proves to all that the  faithful sons of this land are capable of overcoming obstacles  with profound faith and deep determination to achieve desired  goals.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Development of State Budget Allocations                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year                     |Revenues (million riyals)|Expenditures (million ri-|  |                         |                         |yals)                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1389/1390H[1969-70]      |5,966                    |5,966                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1390/91                  |6,380                    |6,380                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1391/92                  |10,782                   |10,782                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1392/93                  |13,200                   |13,200                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1393/94                  |22,810                   |22,810                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1394/95                  |98,246                   |45,743                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1395/96                  |95,847                   |100,935                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1396/97                  |100,935                  |131,296                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1397/98                  |146,493                  |134,254                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1398/99                  |130,000                  |144,558                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1399/1400                |160,000                  |180,259                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1400/01                  |261,516                  |245,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1401/02                  |340,000                  |298,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1402/03                  |313,400                  |313,400                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1403/04                  |260,000                  |260,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1404/05                  |260,000                  |260,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1405/06                  |200,000                  |200,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1406/07                  |200,000                  |200,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1407/08                  |117,280                  |170,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1408/09                  |10,300[sic]              |141,200 need text        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1409/10                  |116,000                  |141,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1410/11                  |118,000                  |143,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1411/12                  |118,000                  |143,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1412/13                  |151,000                  |181,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1413/14                  |169,050                  |196,950                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1414/15                  |160,000                  |160,000                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Carlota Araujo, Evanildo da Silveira, Ilimar </F> Franco, Jose Mitchell, and Roselena Nicolau: "Voters Have  Already Drawn New President's Profile"]    [Text] The honesty of Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, the  authority of Paulo Maluf, the confidence of Jarbas Passarinho,  and the administrative experience of Antonio Britto: with the  first round of balloting nine months away, the voters are  beginning to define their electoral preferences by means of  polls.    In immediate response to the accusations made by the CPI  [Congressional Investigating Committee] on the Budget,  Brazilians are demanding honesty. To offset Itamar Franco's  "vacillating" image, the voters want confidence and authority.  Tired and frustrated by the failure of the economic plans, they  are dreaming of someone capable of applying immediate solutions  to the country's crisis. But is there room for surprises? Yes. A  military candidate might be able to make the voters' fingers  itch on election day.    A profile of the new president of the republic--in the minds  of voters--was put together last November and defined by  political analysts for the Center for Research, Analysis, and  Communication (Cepac) in Sao Paulo on the basis of various  opinion polls. It has every chance of actually corresponding to  the expectations that will greet the candidates who begin their  race for Planalto Palace this coming April.    In the files of political scientist Rubens Figueiredo of  Cepac, who coordinated the project, is an almost prophetic  makeup of the profile of the winner in the presidential election  of 1989. It was put together four months before Fernando Collor  appeared on the scene as a dark horse.    At the time--in January 1989--Figueiredo drew the profile of  a candidate who was young, identified with the future, free of  any ties with old politicians, spoke the people's language, and  conveyed an image of honesty and competence.    Demanding--In April of that year, the beneficiary of that  movement was candidate Fernando Collor de Mello, the former  governor of Alagoas. He was young, spoke the language of  modernity, was nicknamed "hunter of the high and mighty" by the  media, was a relentless accuser of the Sarney administration,  and addressed himself to the least privileged class with the  expression "my people." He made a qualitative leap in the polls,  and his popularity rose steadily.    "But voters now are more vigilant and demanding," Figueiredo  says. He believes that the purge now under way in Congress as  the result of charges of corruption will lead to a high turnover  in Congress. "In the last election, only one-third of Congress  was reelected," he recalls. He believes that the same thing will  happen again.    It is also possible that someone unexpected will be  reelected, seeing that age, color, and political party will not  be essential for winning the election, in the opinion of Paulo  Tafner of the Databrasil Research Institute in Rio de Janeiro.  He also feels that campaigning on such major issues as the fight  against inflation, the creation of jobs, and a more flexible  economy will make a bigger impression than minor issues. "If  inflation remains high, the scapegoats will be the speculators  and the bankers," says Tafner.    Tafner also believes that the voters want their elected  president to be someone who is balanced, firm, courageous, and  willing to "pick fights" on important issues, chiefly with the  firmly entrenched politico-economic structures that are  preventing real changes in the country. "However, what the  voters want is not a troublemaker who will pick fights  unnecessarily--someone controversial--but someone decisive who  will state the names of those he is accusing."    The analysis made by statistician Marco Antonio de Souza  Aguiar, director of the Methods Consulting firm in Rio de  Janeiro, reaffirms the conclusions drawn by the professionals in  the other two firms. He points out that certain qualities may  become more important, depending on the political situation.  "Honesty has always been a basic characteristic, but because of  the scandals, it is being given even more weight today."  <H5>  Corruption Engenders Wave of Morality </H5>   Brasilia--The CPI looking into budget  corruption--established  following the wave of morality brought on by the CPI on P.C.  Farias--is going to cause a change in the behavior of voters and  candidates in the October 1994 elections. That is the opinion of  experienced politicians in Congress, where it is widely believed  that the voters, immunized by so many scandals since Collor's  impeachment, are going to vote with an eye on the candidates'  biographies and favor those who have a clean record and are  known to the public. "Moralistic talk alone is not going to  help; the memory of Collor is still very alive," says Senator  Jose Fogaca (PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], Rio  Grande do Sul). "The candidate will have to convey the certainty  that he is not a thief and neither are his friends," agrees  Senator Mario Covas (PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party],  Sao Paulo). Senator Elcio Alvares (PFL [Liberal Front Party],  Espirito Santo) says: "The voters will choose those whose public  life is almost spotless."    Congressmen expect the clamor for morality to result in less  campaign spending as well. "There will be more caution in  spending money; the current law does not deter the abuse of  economic power, but events will prevent excesses," says Deputy  Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB, Federal District). Deputy Nelson Trad  (PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], Mato Grosso do Sul) says  sarcastically: "The CPI will make politicians look for ways to  propagate ideas rather than bank accounts."    The discoveries by the CPI on the Budget have created fear  that even the innocent will wind up ruined. In the opinion of  Senator Elcio Alvares, the people will make a collective  condemnation: "There is a burning desire for justice; the people  will want to punish, not acquit." Senator Ney Maranhao (PRN  [National Reconstruction Party], Pernambuco) agrees with that  assessment: "Anyone who sits in the dock is going to take a  beating even if he is declared innocent." But there is not  unanimous agreement on that point.    Senator Fogaca feels that the usual "voter roundups" will  occur in the country's backward interior: "It is very possible  that Joao Alves' voters are not at all unhappy with the work he  has done."    Congressmen also feel that the voters will be split between  those voting for new congressmen and those casting protest  ballots. The vice president of the CPI, Deputy Odacir Klein  (PMDB, Rio Grande do Sul), supports the protest thesis and  predicts an increase in the number of blank and void ballots.  Robson Tuma (PL [Liberal Party], Sao Paulo) disagrees, saying:  "The impetus is in the direction of a general rout of the  current Congress." Senator Francisco Rolemberg (PFL, Sergipe)  feels that the percentage of new congressmen will be high, as in  previous elections, but that this time voters will favor  candidates who prove their credibility. He adds that the voters  will also choose candidates who are able to sell hope: "Lindberg  (former president of the UNE [National Union of Students]) has a  message of hope."  <H5>  New Faces May Be Slightly Delayed </H5>   Belo Horizonte--Historian and political scientist Lucilia de  Almeida Neves, the niece of former President Tancredo Neves,  does not think there will be an immediate replacement of  congressmen in political terms. "The trend is toward morality,  toward electing more ethical people, but that by itself is not  enough to result in a new Congress," she says, emphasizing that  higher moral standards in party politics are what may lead to a  new profile for Brazilian politicians.    Lucilia Neves points out that politics is more than just  ethics: it is also a matter of intention: "What is taking place  is a leap in quality: the leap toward transparency," she claims.  But on the other hand, she says the switching between parties  that we have seen recently, as the deadline for changing parties  arrived, shows that there is still plenty of room for  personalism. "I feel that the election of new congressmen ought  to be more institutional in form," she adds.    The historian explains that what seems to signify major  chaos  may actually signify a major advance. "Clearly stating the  problems is a big step forward in itself," she says. In  Lucilia's opinion, such things as ethics and honesty will be  influential factors for some voters, but they will be especially  important to the middle-class voter, who has been looking for a  new kind of politician longer than anyone else.  <H5>  One Cycle Follows Another </H5>   Sao Paulo--The profile of the new politician who will  probably emerge from the ballot box in the upcoming elections,  as drawn by Gaudencio Torquato, professor of political marketing  at the Sao Paulo University School of Communication and Arts  (ECA-USP), combines authority, honesty, and other condiments  such as culture, administrative ability, and modernity.    While admitting that that is the profile of the ideal  politician, not of most of them, the professor is optimistic  about the new crop that will come out of the upcoming elections.  "We are reaching the end of one cycle and starting another," he  explains. "The co-opting cycle, based on patronage and cronyism,  is fading away because of the wave of morality that is sweeping  through society." In Torquato's opinion, the phenomenon in  question will occur not only in the big cities but also in the  country's interior. "Thanks to television, the moral sweep is  also reaching the deep hinterland," he says.    Torquato, who is also a political consultant, does not put  much faith in polls indicating that 80 percent of the present  Congress will be swept out of office. "I feel that it will not  be that high," he says. "Probably about 60 percent will lose  their seats." Most of the new faces will fit the profile of the  politician who is more directly involved in his region's  problems, free of ties with past political formulas, ethical,  transparent, clean-living, and experienced in administration. He  will not be just a man making promises on the stump.    While Torquato is somewhat optimistic about the changes in  the profile of Brazilian politicians that will emerge from the  upcoming elections, the same cannot be said of another expert in  political marketing, Carlos Brickmann. The coordinator of Paulo  Maluf's campaign, Brickmann does not think that Brazilian  politicians are all that bad. "The pattern among Brazil's  prominent politicians is good," he says. "Most of those involved  in corruption are completely insignificant people."    Reflections--Brickmann does not think that far-reaching  changes will result from the elections. "Politicians reflect the  country," he explains. "They are the result of the country and  its legislation, which makes unacceptable things such as  campaign contributions in the millions completely acceptable  because they are necessary. The politicians will change only  when the country and its legislation change."    More hopeful than Brickmann is advertising man Mauro Salles,  who coordinated Tancredo Neves' campaign in the Electoral  College. He believes that the wave of morality sweeping the  country will bring to the fore many honest politicians who  already exist. "The increased emphasis on ethical principles is  going to cast the spotlight on a number of competent politicians  who at some point became ashamed of being honest," he says.  <H5>  Honesty and Machismo </H5>   Porto Alegre--Like all Brazilians, the 56,000 voters in the  border town of Santana do Livramento in Rio Grande do Sul are  concerned to elect honest politicians, but they also take into  account a cultural trait that is still extremely strong when it  comes to election campaigns: that represented by the macho  gaucho. For example, lawyer and former Mayor Glenio Lemos (PDT  [Democratic Labor Party]) will probably be elected state deputy  because he combines the image of a good and honest administrator  with a fiery temperament that gets him into violent scrapes with  rivals and makes him take action with the help of a .765 or 9mm  pistol that sends his opponents scurrying for cover.    Lemos is expected to pull in a big vote in this town, which  is unique in Brazil because of its geography: it adjoins the  Uruguayan town of Rivera, and the two of them form a single city  with a population of 200,000. With about 100,000 residents on  the Brazilian side and a budget of $9 million, Santana do  Livramento is currently dominated by the PDT, thanks in  particular to Glenio Lemos.    Hang the municipal councilors--Glenio was elected mayor as  an  aftereffect of the shots which, as lawyer for the mayor of  neighboring Quarai, he had fired in the Municipal Chamber. The  bullets did not hit anyone, but they earned him the 17,000 votes  that made him mayor. He used the budget of $13 million--made  fatter by the Collor Plan, which gave money to the municipal  governments--for hundreds of public works. He earned the image  of an effective administrator--he got his successor elected with  63 percent of the vote--without abandoning his penchant for  valorous deeds.    The public loved it when, during a political squabble with  the Municipal Chamber, Lemos suggested hanging the municipal  councilors from the tree on the main square. And when, being  ecological, he demanded that an individual get down out of a  tree and, upon being ignored, drew his revolver out of his belt,  sending the person scurrying for cover. Even after completing  his term as mayor and returning to his law practice, he has  continued to attract attention. Once, while representing a woman  whose small farm had been invaded by landless settlers, he set  fire to their tents. The settlers continued to hold out, but  they finally left when Glenio returned to the site on horseback  with a court order in one hand and his revolver in the other.</p>

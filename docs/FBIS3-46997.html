			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Frank Longid Jr. and Nelson Bagaforo] </F>   [Text] The Philippine National Police (PNP) is offering a  P500,000 [Philippine pesos] reward for any information that will  help solve the bombings in Davao City or lead to the arrest of  the bombers.    Director Pantaleon Dumlao, PNP deputy chief for operations,  said the reward hopefully would encourage reluctant witnesses to  cooperate fully with the police.    The witnesses could even request anonymity, according to PNP  Director General Umberto Rodriguez.    A senior police officer said the reward was put up because  the PNP still cannot clearly establish which group or groups  carried out the bombing of the San Pedro Cathedral in Davao City  and the subsequent explosions at three mosques.    The police announced on Wednesday the arrest of two suspects  in the cathedral attack.    Intelligence reports indicated the two suspects, Abdul Munib  and a man identified only as Jacob, belong to the Abu Sayaf, a  Muslim extremist group. This has led police to deduce the Abu  Sayaf is behind the bombing of the cathedral.    But the police official said the police is "still looking"  for more solid evidence against Munib and Jacob. So far,  investigators are going by intelligence reports which said that  the two arrived in Davao City from Jolo via Basilan on the last  week of November along with 23 other Abu Sayaf members.    "Even if the Abu Sayaf really is responsible for the attack  on the cathedral," the source said, "there is still the matter  of solving the bombing of the mosques."    One police official in Davao is certain both the attacks on  the cathedral and on the mosques were made by only one group.    This group, according to Senior Superintendent Teddy Carian,  police regional director, is out to sow chaos in Mindanao.    "There exists a group that is out to create chaos between  our  Muslim brothers and Christians. Their targets are religious  structures," Carian said.    During the joint meeting yesterday of the Regional Peace and  Order Council and the Regional Development Council, Carian said  the bombers have only one objective: "Open a rift and create  animosities that will open hostilities between Christians and  Muslims in Mindanao."    Carian and Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte also denied two  Muslim  men have been arrested as suspects in the cathedral bombing.    "So far, there are no apprehensions made. No one is under  our custody," Carian said.    "We are not in a hurry. We haven't arrested a single  suspect," Duterte said.    It was Senior Inspector Tadgiro Ainin, the Santa Ana police  chief, who announced the arrest of Munib and Jacob, who was  positively identified by at least five witnesses.    Carian said, "The same criminal groups which initiated these  bombings in the first place," and a so-called "New Christian  Democratic Army," which claimed responsibility for the attack on  the three mosques, was part of this group.    "I should not wonder if later on, there will be another  group  claiming to be anti-Christian group," he added.</p>

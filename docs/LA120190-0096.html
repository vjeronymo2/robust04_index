			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIBSON REPORTEDLY JOINS ROYALS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: FREE AGENT EXPECTED TO SIGN A TWO-YEAR CONTRACT WORTH $3.3 MILLION  TODAY.  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson, who led the Dodgers to the 1988 World Championship with the most  dramatic home run in Los Angeles history, will quietly end his three-year  association with the team today by signing a two-year, $3.3-million contract  with the Kansas City Royals.  </P> <P> According to a report in today's Kansas City Star, Gibson will join the Royals  as an outfielder and designated hitter, with the announcement being made in a  news conference today.  </P> <P> Doug Baldwin, Gibson's agent, did not deny the report late Friday. "I can just  have no comment," Baldwin said.  </P> <P> Gibson, 33, spent a stormy three seasons with the Dodgers after being signed as  a free agent on Feb. 1, 1988.  </P> <P> His departure was a foregone conclusion after he asked to be traded during the  middle of last season.  </P> <P> Because of frustrations over not being traded or moved from center field where  he was unfamiliar, Gibson later engaged in a shouting match with Fred Claire,  Dodger vice president. After Gibson declared free agency in October, the  Dodgers made no attempt to sign him.  </P> <P> Gibson's tenure with the Dodgers was highlighted by his first season, when he  had 25 home runs and 76 runs batted in and was named the National League's most  valuable player.  </P> <P> The season both began and ended in typically stormy Gibson fashion.  </P> <P> In his first appearance in a game for the Dodgers in spring training, he ran  off the field in anger after teammate Jesse Orosco played a practical joke by  placing eye black in his cap. Many Dodgers felt that incident set the tone for  the successful season.  </P> <P> Then in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series against Oakland, Gibson ended his  season by cementing his place in baseball history. He hobbled to home plate on  a bad left leg with two out in the ninth inning and hit a two-run homer off  Dennis Eckersley to give the Dodgers a 5-4 victory that led to a stunning  four-games-to-one Series win.  </P> <P> He spent much of that year playing in pain because of hamstring and knee  problems, injuries that quickly caught up with him. After 1988, he had a total  of 17 homers and 66 RBIs in his final two seasons with Los Angeles. His .213  batting average in 1989 was the lowest by a returning MVP since Dodger pitcher  Sandy Koufax in 1964.  </P> <P> After undergoing knee surgery on Aug. 29, 1989, Gibson did not return last  season until June 2. After hitting .337 in July to lead the start of the  Dodgers' late-season surge, he slumped in September, batting .159 with no  homers and four RBIs in the season's final full month.  </P> <P> "If he goes, it will be sad, really," teammate Orel Hershiser said earlier  Friday when discussing the likelihood of Gibson's departure. "Gibby was one of  the main parts that turned this organization around."  </P> <P> Hershiser agreed, though, that Gibson's injuries hurt not just his playing  time, but his ability to be the leader that he was in 1988.  </P> <P> "When you are hurt, it is hard to lead a team," Hershiser said. "It is hard to  go out there and be energetic and think about leading everyone when you have to  be worried about yourself."  </P></p>

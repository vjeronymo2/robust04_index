			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia allows sugar imports BOLIVIA HAS opened its doors to sugar imports in response to pressure from soft drinks manufacturers hard hit by high domestic sugar prices. Mr Fernando Campero, the exports minister, said in future the price of sugar would be set solely by market forces. The Bolivian sugar industry, based mostly in the eastern region of Santa Cruz, claims the decision will lead to bankruptcies. However, bottling plants are said to be gearing up to take advantage of cheaper sugar. Mr Campero said the move was prompted by recent 'unjustified' price increases by domestic producers. In the past month alone prices increased by some 20 per cent to about Dollars 17.75 a cwt in Santa Cruz and Dollars 20.38 in La Paz.</p>

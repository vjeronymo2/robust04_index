			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Kim Il-sung funeral 'draws 2m' North Korea claimed that 2m people, almost a tenth of the country's population, attended funeral services yesterday in Pyongyang for President Kim Il-sung. The ceremony reflected the huge cult of personality that Mr Kim had created during his 46 years of autocratic rule as Great Leader. A hearse carrying Mr Kim's black coffin, partially covered by the red flag of the ruling Korean Workers' party, paraded through the normally empty boulevards of the capital during a 40km, five-hour journey in the afternoon as mourners paid their last respects. The hearse was preceded by a phalanx of motorcycle policemen and a huge portrait of a broadly smiling Mr Kim and followed by a long double row of black limousines carrying senior officials. The body of the president was removed in the morning from the Kumsusan presidential palace, where he had been lying in state in a glass coffin since last Monday. A funeral rite was held in front of the palace, attended by a sombre Mr Kim Jong-il, the eldest son and designated successor of the president, and other members of the political elite. Another service was then conducted in Kim Il-sung Square in central Pyongyang, but the junior Mr Kim did not appear at this ceremony and other senior party officials present did not make speeches. Mr Kim junior may officially succeed his father during another memorial ceremony scheduled for today. But it is unclear whether Mr Kim will assume both positions of party general secretary and president left vacant by his father's death, in addition to his role as head of the armed forces. The state-controlled Radio Pyongyang yesterday referred to the junior Mr Kim as: 'The great leader of our party and our people who is national defence committee chairman and concurrently the supreme commander of the armed forces.' Although the statement suggests that Mr Kim will become head of the party, it left doubts whether he will acquire the nominal post of president as well. The appointment of another official as president could indicate that Mr Kim still faces opposition among conservative leaders to his rule.</p>

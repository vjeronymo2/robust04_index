Born in 1941 at the Parfin station of the  Leningrad oblast. In 1965 he graduated from the Novosibirsk  Electrotechnical Institute, and was sent to the aviation plant  im. Yu.A. Gagarin at Komsomolsk-na-Amure. Today the Su-27, the  pride of Russia, is built there.    He is married and has two children, a daughter who is  an aviation engineer, and a son in the tenth grade.    [Andryushkov] Anatoliy Mikhaylovich! It is more than two  years since our last talk about the fate of the plant. What has  changed in this time, and how goes it with one of the leading  giants of the defense industry, which produces the  world-renowned multipurpose Su-27 fighter?    [Petrov] How have we been doing these two years? I should  say  at once that we have not suffered particularly. The plant had  orders from the Defense Ministry for some modifications of the  Su-27 (naval variant), plus there was the sale of some fighters  to China. Owing to the Chinese order, we met our plan last year,  and we have the chance to keep on making planes.    Still, in 1993 we were forced to change over to a four-day  work week. The reason for this was the lack of a firm state plan  for the coming year. The plant could not waste electricity,  material, and manpower and there was no assurance that our labor  would be utilized. The plant cannot run idly. But this did not  have an effect on the pay of our people. With the switch to the  four-day work week, we raised their pay rates by 25 percent.    But since everything can change tomorrow, we are looking for  untapped reserves, so to speak, in getting out of the crisis.    [Andryushkov] You mean production of consumer goods within  the framework of conversion?    [Petrov] Yes. We have contacted the "Lucky Goldstar" which  specializes in the production of household electronic items. We  purchased an assembly line for the production of "Goldstar"  televisions and the component parts for 25,000 sets. In all we  will produce 50,000 televisions with foreign technology. We have  already made around 200.    The second direction is the production of electric motors.  In  Russia today we produce hardly any vacuum cleaners or washing  machines. There are no electric motors. We have studied the  foreign technology for their production, and it suits us.  Electrical steel is scarce in our country, but this technology  allows us to make electric motors out of ordinary steel. We are  looking for a serious supplier of electrical wire and are  opening an assembly shop.    [Andryushkov] I have heard that they have mastered the  production of complex medical equipment at your plant.    [Petrov] We are ready to begin production of medical  pressure  chambers of our own design. Our pressure chamber was rated as  one of the best models at a medical exhibition in Novosibirsk.    We are involved in the production of yet another medical  device, a Reich's chamber. This makes it possible to protect a  person from the action of solar radiation, and has undergone  testing at our medical center.    We are forced to struggle for survival under the conditions  of conversion and the market. But whatever secondary production  we get for the plant, the main product must always be there. It  is practically impossible to fully support our plant with orders  without producing the Su-27 aircraft. But the directorate of the  Defense Ministry from which we get our orders has already warned  us that there is no money for a single modification of the Su-27.    [Andryushkov] How will the cruiser "Admiral Kuznetsov" be  supplied with carrier planes then?    [Petrov] We have already delivered the first lot of fighters  for naval pilots, although it is not much. This was a good job  for the plant, and we relied upon it, but who knows what lies  ahead? We will try to get a clearer picture from the naval  command.    Here is something else that is a heavy burden on the plant.  In 1991, the Defense Ministry ordered one lot of Su-27s. A  plane, like a human being, takes about a year to be "born." The  plant has practically filled the order. The fighters are on its  grounds, in various stages of finishing touches. They remain  unclaimed. Their prices are still the old ones, the stipulated  ones, but this apparently does not interest the client. In order  to keep the engines from rusting and to make sure the aggregates  did not become unusable, I was forced to issue instruction that  they be removed from finished aircraft and be mounted for  testing on newly produced ones, those which are being sold to  China, for instance. This is not the state approach, but it  isn't my fault. Let the Defense Ministry think about how to  solve this problem, my job is to preserve the plant.    [Andryushkov] But as a state official, what would you  propose  as a way out of this situation?    [Petrov] They could have found different ways of paying for  the order. For example, by government decision, they could make  a 50 percent prepayment without assessing tax from the plant.  And the Defense Ministry could pay off the remainder in a year.  We would make planes for the army on credit, so to speak. And  this would suit the plant. The Russian flyers would have Su-27  fighters in their armament, and the plant would have money for  their further production and a carefree existence. And in this  way state resources would only be immobilized.    [Andryushkov] Tell me, were many Su-27s sent to the line  units in 1993?    [Petrov] This year not a single plane, except for the  carrier  variant, went to the units. The people at the plant ask in  puzzlement: Why are we working, for whom are we accumulating  this stockpile of planes? But I know there is a need for new  fighters, and even more so for spare parts for them. If the  state had decided to disarm in this way, then it would be better  to close down our plant all at once.    [Andryushkov] But if planes like these, which any state  would  be proud to have, are not needed by Russia now, why don't we  sell them to other countries? Not only China is interested in  acquiring the Su-27.    [Petrov] For me the hardest thing to understand is why the  Russian "Oboroneksport" [Defense Export office], with offers  from some countries, perhaps non-traditional buyers of our  weapons, is not showing any initiative. These countries are  prepared to order our planes and to pay immediately. But the  solution to this question depends on the impenetrable wall of  bureaucrats from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They offer  unconvincing arguments that America objects to the sale of this  plane to one country, England objects [to the sale] to another.  It is irritating that Russia recently has virtually been living  by foreign dictate, and does not have its own opinion. I fear  where this might lead, if we are so afraid of breaking our ties  with our new "friends."    [Andryushkov] Also, we must remember that if Russia does not  take its place in the international aircraft market today,  tomorrow will be too late. They won't let anyone else in.    [Petrov] Quite right. You can't escape economic laws in any  form, whatever their "ism." For instance, when I talk with  American businessmen, this is what I hear from them: "Do you  really think we are interested in the Russian worker working,  being employed in production? We are interested in the American  worker having constant work."    Today, a battle for markets is being fought. And we have to  admit that the Americans are driving us out everywhere. For  example, I have heard that the U.S. vetoed the sale of the Su-27  aircraft to Libya, although we had already established contacts  with it, and the signing of the contracts would have saved  several Russian defense plants from crisis. So Russia is not  allowed, and the Americans themselves are holding talks with  Libya to provide it with F-16 fighters.    Here is what I think. Since we have reached the market  economy mode, we must earn money without a feeling of false  shame. The market must be the market. A real one, and not one  made from pleasant dreams.    [Andryushkov] Anatoliy Mikhaylovich, your pain for your  native fatherland is understandable. It is even more intense  when you think about the fate of the plant. Still, while  constantly pondering how to survive under current conditions,  you still retain optimism and faith in better days. . .    [Petrov] You know, Russians have an inborn capacity to stand  up under difficulties. This year, for instance, I took no  credits from the state. It is slavery to take credit at 200 or  more percent! The plant will soon be stripped naked, excuse the  expression. We owe our suppliers a lot of money because of this,  and you don't build a machine like the Su-27 without partners.    [Andryushkov] How much freedom of action does the general  director have, or does everything still depend on higher  authorities?    [Petrov] I would answer that the attitude that the Committee  for the Defense Sectors has toward to us is quite realistic. Let  us say that twenty years ago, the force ministries dictated work  conditions to the plant. Today the picture is different. There  is a group of central ministries which determine all economic  policy, including in the defense industry. The plant is the  executor. Relations must be organized like this: Give me an  order and I will work. There is no need to tell me how to do it.  In the years of perestroyka and conversion, we have learned how  to get by. The plant itself can organize relations with  subcontractors and other republics as well as the bureaucrats  from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can. Today we are  successfully working with "Azovstal," Belarusian enterprises,  and Tajikistan, and to this point still have ties with Moldova.  Thus, the "assistance" of the ministries has been reduced to a  minimum.    But here is a problem -- a lot of our planes are in Ukraine  and Belarus. They sit on the airfields without spare parts. I  see potential work for the plant in this, and the air force  commands of the republics come to us for assistance. Alas, we  are forced to refuse. There is no government permission. I don't  think that Ukraine or Belarus will ever use their planes against  Russia, but we can't see beyond our own noses.    [Andryushkov] Your production association is also working  hard inside the country, and is a member of the Russian  "Aviabank." What is the benefit from this?    [Petrov] We have come up against the following problem: When  we have money, we don't get it for 2 or 3 months from Moscow,  and then the same amount goes back to the capital. But our  suppliers say you can't work like that, high and dry.    Knowing that the "Aviabank" had been formed and that all the  aviation enterprises of Russia were participating in it, we  requested membership. This allowed us to efficiently settle up  with the entire western zone of the county: Moscow, St.  Petersburg, Samara, and Nizhgorod plants, as well as others.    Besides that, we have very limited credit resources in the  Far East. There was a time when we did not have any ready cash  at all. Our people did not get paid for three months. In such a  situation, the plant goes to the "Aviabank," a plane is sent to  Moscow, and within a day or two we have sacks of money. So the  benefit is obvious.    [Andryushkov] Recently we have not had the sort of mass  media  to agitate among the Russians for privatization of anything.  Your opinion about this?    [Petrov] A privatization commission has been formed at the  plant, to figure out all the pluses and minuses of this measure.  My personal opinion is that if there is a stable state order,  then a privatized plant would operate smoothly, would make a  profit, would share it with all stockholders, and everything  would be fine.    But when a plant is on the brink of collapse due to a lack  of  orders, and if the state simply abandons it to its fate, then  privatization would lead to utter collapse of production. Thus,  I am very cautious about privatization. I am not against it, for  I acknowledge all forms of ownership, but I would not rush  headlong into it.    I would proceed like this. I would try out this  privatization  in small enterprises, say in our "Metallist" plant, where they  make cups and spoons and employ around 200 people, rather than  several tens of thousands. Accumulate around five years of  experience, study the successes and failures, acquaint all the  country's enterprises with them, and give them the chance to  decide to privatize or not. Those who want to can. But what are  we doing now? They're just about driving us into privatization,  as they once drove us into the collective farms.    [Andryushkov] Perhaps the government wants to avoid  responsibility for the state of the country's economy in this  way?    [Petrov] Perhaps. If it works, hurrah. If not, then excuse  me, you yourself wanted to privatize. Enough experimenting with  the country. Today there is no worker who does not want to work.  Life itself forces us to work and earn money, otherwise it's  chaos for a person.    [Andryushkov] What is the pay at the plant?    [Petrov] The average is a little more than 100,000 (rubles).  This is with allowance for the coefficient and the northern  supplements. An experienced specialist earns up to 170,000.    [Andryushkov] Anatoliy Mikhaylovich, what do you see as your  most urgent task today?    [Petrov] To supply the plant with work. During my vacation,  my first since 1988, I have already flown three times to Moscow  to resolve this question. Why did I have to go myself? Because  the government for some reason doesn't want to speak with anyone  but the head man. So I have turned over the leadership of the  plant to my assistants, and I myself am on the go. Luckily, my  assistants are able and reliable. I feel the responsibility for  the fate of our collective constantly, and for that reason I am  firmly resolved to see it through to the end. There can be two  outcomes: Either we taste the joy of victory, for which we are  struggling today, or we learn the bitterness of defeat. But  everyone else will too.    P.S. When the material was prepared for press it was  learned that the Amur aircraft builders had decided to reject  privatization of the KnAAPO.</p>

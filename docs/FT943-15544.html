			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Burtonwood shows 11% advance to top Pounds 3m Burtonwood, the Cheshire-based real ale brewer, reported an 11 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits, from a restated Pounds 2.77m to Pounds 3.07m, for the 12 months to March 31. The increase, struck after losses of Pounds 353,000 (Pounds 399,000) on asset disposals, was achieved despite minimal growth in turnover; sales totalled Pounds 50.6m (Pounds 50.3m), including Pounds 3m (Pounds 3.8m) from the small off-licence chain, now sold. Mr John Dutton-Forshaw, chairman, said retail profits from managed houses 'improved significantly' while 'selective expansion' in the tenanted estate also contributed to the performance. Beer volumes in the tied estate - now comprising 462 houses owned or leased against 424 at end-March 1993 - increased by 5 per cent. The ongoing withdrawal from low margin free trade business, however, resulted in a 3 per cent fall in overall volumes. A revaluation of group properties undertaken during the second half showed a small increase on previous book values. When the review was announced at the interim stage the company said that a slight overall decline was likely. Earnings emerged at 9.9p (8.5p), or 11.6p (10.4p) excluding the disposals. A final of 4.3p makes a total of 5p (4.68p).</p>

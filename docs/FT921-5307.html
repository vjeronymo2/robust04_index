			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US and Canada declare war on gypsy moth invaders PEST-CONTROL authorities in the US and Canada next month will start spraying insecticide over large parts of three west coast cities, including Vancouver's central business district, in the hope of controlling an influx of Asian gypsy moths. The moths, which have arrived on Russian grain vessels over the past few years, are voracious foliage eaters, especially of coniferous plant species found in British Columbia and the north-west US. Apart from the the threat posed to forests, Canadian authorities are concerned that Washington may try to contain the moths by imposing a certification requirement or some other non-tariff barrier on British Columbia lumber exports. Aerial and ground spraying is expected to start in Vancouver and the US cities of Portland, Oregon, and Tacoma, Washington, in the second half of April. The programme is scheduled for completion in early June. The Vancouver programme, covering 43,000 acres, has already been approved. US Department of Agriculture officials are still awaiting funding for the Dollars 20m budget to spray almost 140,000 acres in Tacoma and Portland. The US programme also provides for surveys at other high-risk ports used by vessels from eastern Russia. The spraying will be done with a bacterial insecticide, known as bacillus thuringiensis, which is specifically designed to exterminate caterpillars and has no known effects on humans, large animals or fish. Mr Gordon Powell, the Canadian official in charge of the Vancouver project, said that discomfort to humans is expected to be minimal. Helicopters will spray three applications of the insecticide over Vancouver's downtown area between sunrise and 7am when few people are on the streets. The Asian moths were first noticed in substantial numbers in the winter of 1990-91.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Olivetti warns of losses far higher than expected MR Carlo De Benedetti, chairman and controlling shareholder of Olivetti, the troubled Italian computers and office equipment group, warned yesterday that losses for last year would be much bigger than expected. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he forecast a loss of around L380bn (Dollars 317m) in 1991. That is almost double analysts' previous estimates and reflects the crisis in the world computer industry. Mr Benedetti said losses last year would amount to around 4.4 per cent of sales. Last year, Olivetti's turnover slipped by about 5 per cent to L8,600bn. A formal 1991 earnings statement is not expected until late April. He predicted the company could break even or make a small profit for this year thanks to cost-savings and an upturn in the world economy. Olivetti has already announced a big restructuring programme aimed at saving around L400bn a year. Mr De Benedetti's remarks came just as Olivetti executives met union leaders and government ministers in Rome to discuss the group's latest cost-cutting drive to lay off 2,500 workers in Italy this year and close two plants. The proposals have triggered a series of strikes and received a cool response from the government, which would partly finance 2,200 of the redundancies. However, with a general election looming, chances of greater co-operation with the public sector may have increased. Last week's accord between Bull and IBM in France and recent overtures by senior Italian IBM executives towards Olivetti have led to a new focus on the idea, originally raised by Mr De Benedetti, of closer co-operation with the state. Olivetti's public position has been to seek state help in the form of more public sector orders and greater assistance with research and development spending. The company's latest three-year plan called for L4,500bn in public sector contracts, of which L1,000bn should be spent this year. Growing international collaboration in the computer industry has also rekindled discussion about a link between Olivetti Information Services (OIS), the group's software subsidiary, and Finsiel, the much bigger state-owned software house which is part of the IRI group.</p>

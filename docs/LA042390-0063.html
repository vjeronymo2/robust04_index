			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER YOUTH KILLED IN DRIVE-BY ATTACK;  </P> <P> SHOOTINGS: A 15-YEAR-OLD DIED AND HIS COMPANION WAS WOUNDED IN THE SECOND  INCIDENT WITHIN TWO DAYS IN SANTA ANA. BOTH ARE BELIEVED TO BE GANG-RELATED.  </P> <P> Little more than 24 hours after a teen-ager was shot to death by suspected gang  members at a party, a 15-year-old boy attending another party a few blocks away  was fatally shot and his companion wounded in a drive-by attack Sunday that  police say also had gang ties.  </P> <P> Youths identified by family members as Cesar Salgado, 15, and companion Javier  Torres, 18, were shot about 12:50 a.m. near a birthday party they were  attending in the 600 block of East Walnut Street.  </P> <P> One or more people in a passing vehicle opened fire on the two as they walked  on a sidewalk in the 100 block of South Hickory Street, Police Sgt. Randy  Eldridge said. Salgado, shot three times in the side, was pronounced dead at  UCI Medical Center in Orange at 3:10 a.m. Sunday. Torres, shot once in the  back, was in stable condition Sunday at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Friday night, 17-year-old Roger Ochoa died after being shot four times in the  back during a fight with suspected gang members at a party in the 1200 block of  East 3rd Street, about nine blocks away from the Sunday morning shooting site.  </P> <P> While investigators tried to determine whether there were any links between the  two shootings, residents of the crime-ridden barrio neighborhoods where the  parties took place decried the continuing gang violence.  </P> <P> "It's not an uncommon thing to hear that another young person has been shot or  killed," said Yolanda Gaodamez, 43, Ochoa's aunt. "It's getting worse every  day. It is senseless."  </P> <P> Mayor Daniel H. Young repeated his concern Sunday over continuing gang violence  in Santa Ana, and called on parents to try to help steer their children away  from gangs.  </P> <P> "We have to let them know (that) the consequences of allowing their son or  daughter to be involved in a gang is to be killed," Young said.  </P> <P> The mayor added that he was not surprised to hear of one gang-related shooting  in Santa Ana following another so closely.  </P> <P> "When the shooting starts, it sets off a chain reaction," Young said. "Our  experience is that one shooting leads to a number of shootings because it's  gangs retaliating against one another."  </P> <P> The motive for the Sunday morning attack remained under investigation Sunday.  Eldridge said detectives were looking at all possibilities, including any  connection to Friday's attack.  </P> <P> "There's no rhyme or reason to these shootings," said Mike Alvarado, a  detective at the scene of Sunday's attack. "Anybody can drive through here and  start shooting."  </P> <P> Witnesses said the shots were fired from a blue van containing several people.  Police recovered an abandoned vehicle matching the description of the van but  have not identified any suspects, Eldridge said.  </P> <P> Officers Saturday had arrested three suspected gang members in connection with  Friday's shooting. In a separate gang-related incident early Saturday in  Anaheim, police were still looking Sunday for suspects in a knifing attack on  three young men.  </P> <P> One of the wounded men in that incident was airlifted to Long Beach Memorial  Medical Center, and the others were taken to the UCI Medical Center, a fire  department spokeswoman said. Police have declined to give names of the victims  or update their conditions. Police said the men were stabbed when a  gang-related fight broke out between separate groups of young men at a party.  </P> <P> The Sunday shooting took place in a neighborhood known by police and residents  as territory controlled by the Lopers street gang. Friday's shooting occurred  in what Gaodamez and other residents described as Eastside gang territory.  </P> <P> The Lopers have had running feuds with the Eastside gang, as well as other  Santa Ana gangs, said Jose Munoz, 26, a longtime resident of East Walnut Street  in the Lopers' neighborhood. The Sunday birthday party was held behind an  apartment complex by members of the Lopers, Munoz said. Several Lopers  interviewed said they had no idea who was behind the Sunday attack.  </P> <P> "Every time we have a party, we get shot at," said one professed Lopers member  who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We don't ever start fights. We just kick  back, and they come and shoot us. We don't even have guns. We'd rather settle  things with our fists."  </P> <P> The gang member, along with two other professed Lopers who also did not want to  be named, identified Torres as a longtime Lopers member whose gang name is  "Shorty." Salgado, whose street name is "Night Owl," was a member of the nearby  Middleside gang and was invited to the party along with a group of other  Middleside gang members, the three Lopers said.  </P> <P> Salgado and Torres had stepped away from the party for a walk when the shooting  started. Neighbors reported hearing from five to 10 shots, possibly from two  pistols. Angel Barrios, 13, who also attended the party, said the van was  driving west on East Walnut Street when the shots rang out.  </P> <P> The people in the van "didn't say nothing," Barrios said. "They just drove  away."  </P></p>

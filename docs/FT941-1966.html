			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: On time - but only if you move the goal posts Sir, As William Waldegrave (Personal View, March 17) should know, there are lies, damned lies, statistics and white lies. The passenger's charter of which he is so proud falls into the latter category. InterCity, with which I estimate I have travelled 300,000 miles in the last six years, has achieved its targets only by moving the goal posts. Whereas six years ago the journey time between Newark and London averaged less than 85 minutes, it is now almost 95 minutes on the new 'faster' trains. These increases coincided with the imposition of the charter. Regular commuters now smile when BR tells us we are arriving two minutes early. Six years ago this would have been eight minutes late. Mr Waldegrave's glass may be half full, but sadly he now drinks from a pitcher instead of a pint glass. Andrew W N Banks, 4 Pine Close, Newark NG24 2AU</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Technology: A question of numbers - The difficulties with demographic data If anyone at the Cairo conference on population and development needed to be reminded that the world's population is growing, a 'clock' in the centre of the exhibition hall kept ticking, registering more than one birth every second. Projections by the United Nations - that the total will nearly double from 5.7bn to 10bn by the middle of the next century - were the only part of the conference text which was not debated, as 180 countries wrestled to agree on family planning policy. Yet how reliable are the projections? It is not just UN initiatives which depend on the figures' accuracy. The International Development Association, an arm of the World Bank, employs economic criteria such as per capita income when deciding whether to grant a country concessional loans. Joseph Chamie, director of the UN's population division, adds that many businesses are affected by demographic trends. 'If I were a car manufacturer I'd be busy now designing cars so that older people could get into them,' he says, referring to the ageing populations of industrialised countries. But demographers face formidable obstacles in gathering accurate data on population size. Governments sometimes distort figures to influence elections, they say. Some countries in the Middle East have not always counted births and deaths among their immigrant worker populations. In some societies 'people don't know how old they are', says Tom Merrick, senior population adviser for the World Bank, which runs separate models from those of the UN. In some regions, age distribution data can be distorted because girls are categorised according to whether or not they have reached puberty. However, both Merrick and Chamie argue that the quality of the raw data on current population size has greatly improved in recent years. According to Merrick, the estimate of 5.7bn is accurate 'to within tens of millions'. Past census data from some African countries, in particular Nigeria, have been unreliable, he says, although Nigeria's 1991 census, which yielded a lower total than expected, is now regarded by demographers as sound. Countries with large populations such as China and India have 'pretty good' censuses, says Merrick. Because the data are improving, demographers have found the predictive power of demographic models to be good so far. In 1950 the UN estimated that the world's population would be 6.3bn in 2000; its latest figures suggest around 6bn. But all acknowledge the difficulties in predicting the future. The models are sensitive to assumptions about whether family sizes will continue to fall as they have been doing in most countries for the last 15 years. The UN projections for 2050 range from 7.8bn to 12.5bn on only tiny variations in those assumptions. However, delegates at the conference, which ended this week, advanced many competing theories about why parents choose to have smaller families. Twenty years ago, the slogan 'development is the best contraception' was the favourite theory, but at Cairo demographers emphasised ease of access to contraception or better education for women. Moreover, the models cannot take account of future development of new contraceptive techniques. According to Chamie, 'the Pill made a tremendous difference on fertility, as did the intra-uterine device and injectible contraceptives. They separate the act of sex from the decision to use a contraceptive, unlike condoms for example'. Demographers' models have spelled out to governments that they have reason to worry about population growth, and to move fast on improving family planning services. The best tribute to the demographers' efforts will be if governments act so quickly that predictions of the world's population in the next century prove too high.</p>

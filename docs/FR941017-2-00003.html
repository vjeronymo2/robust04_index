Specifically, section 359b(a)(1) of the 1938 Act requires that the Secretary make estimates of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) the quantity of sugar that will be consumed in the United States during the fiscal year (other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in refined form or in sugar containing products) and the quantity of sugar that would provide for reasonable carryover stocks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) the quantity of sugar that will be available from carry-in stocks or from domestically produced sugarcane and sugar beets for consumption in the United States during the year; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) the quantity of sugar that will be imported for consumption in the United States during the year (other than sugar imported for the production of polyhydric alcohol or to be refined and reexported in refined form or in sugar-containing products), based on the difference between the sum of the quantity of estimated consumption and reasonable carryover stocks and the quantity of sugar estimated to be available from domestically produced sugarcane and sugar beets and from carry-in stocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 359b(b)(1) of the 1938 Act provides for the establishment of marketing allotments for domestically processed sugar for a fiscal year, if imports of sugar, based upon these estimates, will be less than 1,250,000 short tons, raw value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimate of the quantity of sugar that ``would provide for reasonable carryover stocks'' differs from the estimates of production, consumption, and beginning stocks and from the estimate of actual ending stocks, which are conventional predictions of supply and use parameters, in that it is not a straightforward estimate of the quantity of sugar that actually will be carried over at the end of the fiscal year. By contrast, the estimate of ``reasonable'' ending stocks is a policy determination of the quantity of unrestrained stocks that is expected to result in market prices at least high enough to achieve the goals of the no-cost price-support program for sugar beets and sugarcane. Accordingly, the level of ending stocks which would be ``reasonable'' must reflect that quantity that is necessary to achieve the price-support objectives of section 206 of the 1949 Act as well as the ``no cost'' mandate of section 902(a) of the 1985 Act, without reducing import access below 1.25 million short tons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the estimate of imports is not an estimate of the quantity of sugar expected to actually be entered into the U.S. customs territory during the fiscal year but rather the level of imports that would be required to achieve the determined quantity of reasonable ending stocks, based upon the statutory formula. Accordingly, the import estimate indicates whether, in the absence of domestic marketing allotments, the Secretary would be required to reduce the tariff-rate quota amount to a quantity less than 1.25 million short tons in order to achieve the desired level of reasonable ending stocks for maintaining the price-support program at no cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Estimates of Sugar Consumption, Stocks, Production, and Imports for Fiscal Year 1995  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 359b(a)(1) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary has estimated the quantities of sugar consumption, stocks, production, and imports in the United States (including Puerto Rico) for fiscal year 1995 as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,8 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1TST, raw value <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Consumption  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 9,247  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reasonable ending (carryover) stocks  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,278  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Production  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 7,890  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beginning (carry-in) stocks  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,386  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Imports  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,249 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

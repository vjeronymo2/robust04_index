			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Pentagon warns on C-17 project A TOP Pentagon official yesterday warned McDonnell Douglas, the defence contractor, that unless it improved its development of the C-17 transport aircraft, the programme would be cancelled, writes Martin Dickson. The company had been hoping for a 120-aircraft order, worth up to Dollars 40bn or more. However, the project has been subject to delays and cost overruns. Mr John Deutch, under-secretary of defence for acquisition, said in a letter to the company that 'unless there is strong resolve on the part of McDonnell Douglas corporate management to meet contract requirements, particularly schedule specifications and testing requirements, the C-17 cannot be continued.' McDonnell said it was confident the programme was viable and would result in production of the aircraft.</p>

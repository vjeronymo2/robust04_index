			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Chretien warns of break-up Canada could fall apart as a country if Quebec votes for independence in a referendum next year, according to Prime Minister Jean Chretien. Mr Chretien has in the past tried to minimise the potential fallout if the separatist government in French-speaking Quebec wins a referendum on independence from Canada promised before the end of next year. 'Canada will have a big problem to survive,' Mr Chretien, a native French speaker, said in an interview broadcast late on Wednesday from Vancouver. The separatist Parti Quebecois won the provincial election in Quebec in September, but with less than half of the popular vote. In the interview, Mr Chretien also repeated his often stated belief Quebeckers will vote to stay in Canada. Former prime minister Joe Clark also warned recently that the rest of Canada could break up if Quebec separates.</p>

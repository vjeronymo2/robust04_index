			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Turkish Foreign Ministry has described as  ridiculous claims by Greek Cypriot authorities on the killing of  Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, member of the Committee for Solidarity  with the illegal PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization.    Speaking at his weekly news conference today, Foreign  Ministry deputy spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that the accusatory  language used in the statements made by Greek Cypriot  authorities following the killing of Yeoryiadhis has caused  shock and amazement. He noted that those who know Turkey are  well aware that it is against any manifestation of terror,  whatever the reason. Ataman added that it is the responsibility  of those who make such provocative allegations -- the goals  which they serve being very clear -- to prove them.    In reply to a question, Ataman described the conclusion of a  series of military cooperation agreements during the sudden  visit by the Greek defense minister to south Cyprus as goals and  intentions that threaten stability.</p>

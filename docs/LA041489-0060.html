			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADE DISPUTE WITH INDIA BRINGS ECONOMIC CRISIS;  </P> <P> NEPALESE BRACING FOR A 'GRIM YEAR'  </P> <P> The menu was the simplest in more than two centuries at the royal banquet  Thursday night as His Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev and his deeply  troubled Himalayan kingdom ushered in the Nepalese New Year.  </P> <P> Few guests drove to the traditionally lavish function; most had to walk,  because this year there has been no gasoline even for their limousines.  </P> <P> "We are taking it as a very grim year ahead of us -- not an auspicious one at  all," said a senior official close to the king. "In fact, we were going to  cancel all New Year's Day functions this year, but the astrologers felt it was  very unlucky to make such total sacrifices on the first day of the year."  </P> <P> Astrology aside, the beginning of the year 2046 on the Nepalese calendar is not  one of celebration for Nepal's 17 million citizens. A trade dispute with India  that began March 23 has closed 13 of 15 land routes into the country and  touched off critical shortages of gasoline, cooking oil, medicine, baby food  and such staples as salt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Struggle for Survival  </P> <P> For Nepal, a nation the size of North Carolina that ranks as the world's sixth  poorest, the crisis has ballooned into a struggle for survival against what it  pictures as an insensitive regional power that once was its closest ally.  </P> <P> It has fueled a burgeoning nationalist movement here and provided propaganda  material for some of India's other neighbors, whose media accuse South Asia's  most powerful country of bullying.  </P> <P> As the crisis deepens -- with peasants stoically waiting in lines for a few  quarts of kerosene for cooking, and with heart and diabetes patients nearing  death for lack of vital drugs -- independent economic analysts and many  Nepalese are beginning to ask, "At what price?"  </P> <P> "The Nepalese are saying, 'We're going into a period of intense discomfort.  Yes, the economy will decline -- but we can emerge from that stronger both  politically and economically at the end of the ride,' " said one independent  economic expert here.  </P> <P> "They may be stronger in the political sense," he added, "but in the economic  sense, I am not so sure."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Economic Depression Foreseen  </P> <P> The Nepalese are suffering severe shortages of many goods. But that is only the  beginning.  </P> <P> Experts say the trade stoppage initially will thrust Nepal into a near-total  economic depression. This year's growth rate, which had been expected to be as  high as 5%, could now be as low as zero. Inflation will probably soar from a  projected 8% to as high as 20%. And government revenues will drop sharply. All  this in a nation where the average annual income is $160 a person.  </P> <P> Some of Katmandu's banking community privately fear bank runs, and businessmen  are worrying about bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The long-term picture is even bleaker: Nepal, which is self-sufficient only in  beer, cigarettes and a handful of food items, had hoped to earn its economic  independence through hydroelectric power, its greatest national resource.  </P> <P> But the projects that are planned to harness it for export will not be  completed until early next century, and the only obvious market for the  electricity is India.  </P> <P> "Hydroelectric export to India is Nepal's only real way to achieve economic  independence," one Western economist in Nepal said. "The potential earnings run  into several hundred million dollars a year. But for that to materialize, there  has to be a strong, close relationship with India.  </P> <P> "A badly ruptured relationship could well be a short-term statement of  sovereignty, but a long-term disaster."  </P> <P> Echoing that theme, officials in India have warned that Nepal has far more to  lose than India, whose $200 million in annual exports here represents just 2%  of its exports.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Theater of the Absurd'  </P> <P> "What the hell are they trying to prove?" demanded one senior Indian official.  "If it's sovereignty you want . . . well, if you destroy yourself in the  process, what kind of sovereignty is that? It's the theater of the absurd, if  in the process of asserting your independence, you destroy your entire nation."  </P> <P> In an effort to prevent that from happening, Nepal is rallying global support  for its position. When the crisis began, King Birendra hired a Washington-based  public relations firm as an adviser. Foreign journalists have been welcomed and  senior Cabinet ministers have been made available for interviews.  </P> <P> This week, the royal government announced a policy that reduces tariffs on  essential imports from all nations to make them equal to the terms it offers  India, which had been Nepal's largest and most favored trading partner.  </P> <P> The background to the Indo-Nepalese dispute is complex: On the surface, it  revolves around two recently expired treaties in which Nepal and India had, for  decades, granted each other highly preferential trade terms, and India had  agreed to provide transit access for goods going in and out of Nepal.  </P> <P> But the trade issue is only the climax to the larger, long-simmering dispute,  in which Nepal fears that it could be simply co-opted someday by India, in the  same manner as nearby Sikkim, a former protectorate pressured by New Delhi into  giving up its last vestiges of independence in 1974.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arms Purchase Worries India  </P> <P> For its part, India's principal concern has been Nepal's purchase last year of  troop trucks and anti-aircraft guns from China, with which India has fought one  war and remains estranged despite recent attempts at normalization.  </P> <P> "If the Himalayas were to the south of Nepal, rather than to the north,  everything would be different," the Indian official said. "It is a fact of  geography that India's security interests necessarily involve Nepal's security  relationship with China."  </P> <P> Nepal has insisted that the arms purchases were strictly for defensive  purposes, that it had the right to acquire the arms "to guard against terrorist  attacks from within" and that it never imagined the purchase would anger the  Indians.  </P> <P> But several Nepalese officials and diplomats privately conceded that it was  meant as a signal to New Delhi that Nepal also must remain close with its huge  northern neighbor, with which it has had a history of good relations.  </P> <P> Nepal's position was perhaps best stated by its first king, Prithvinarayan  Shah, when he founded the kingdom in 1762.  </P> <P> "This kingdom," he declared, "is like a yam sandwiched between two stones.  Maintain very friendly relations with the Chinese emperor. Also maintain  friendly relations with the emperor of the sea of the south. But remember, he  is very shrewd."  </P> <P> In an interview this week, Foreign Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya  indicated that Nepal is still walking a diplomatic high wire between the two  big powers.  </P> <P> But his comments on India were among the strongest ever for a high-ranking  Nepalese official. "Nepal is not only a landlocked country, it is an  India-locked country," he said. "And if there are some people in India who  think the muscle-flexing will create a positive image for India, they are  mistaken. Even a small country . . . will resist a policy based on  muscle-flexing."  </P> <P> Although the Nepalese crisis has provided valuable fodder for India's enemies  and a rallying point for King Birendra to build nationalist support, Nepalese  concede that the price inevitably will be high -- far higher than simply  cutting back on this week's New Year celebrations.  </P> <P> "The public so far has been so forthcoming in their support, but the question  is, how long will that last?" asked a palace aide. "There is no doubt the  government must be careful about this. There is a lunatic fringe out there."  </P> <P> He referred to radical Maoist student groups that rioted in Katmandu last week.  As a precaution, the government closed all universities for two months and in  some cases even supplied the students with bus fare back to their villages.  </P> <P> Reflecting on his nation's crisis, one Nepalese restaurant owner said,  "Clearly, the nationalism and emotionalism are there. At the moment, they are  all largely pro-government and anti-India. But whoever comes along to harness  that -- including the student radicals -- wins all.  </P> <P> "Are the risks worth it? I'm not so sure. If you live with reality, it means  you have to live with India."  </P></p>

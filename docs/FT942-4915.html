			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei continues downward technical correction Equities fell for the third consecutive session yesterday, but market sentiment remained upbeat, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average lost 227.54 at 20,726.65. Although the index opened above Friday's high at 20,954.19, prices drifted lower throughout the morning. Early declines were limited by overseas buying from both foreign and domestic brokerage firms. But in the afternoon, index-linked selling brought the market down, pushing it to a day's low of 20,707.54 just before the close. Declines were well ahead of advances by 765 to 266, with 152 stocks unchanged. The Nikkei 300 slipped 3.14 to 303.66 and the first section Topix index shed 15.10 to 1,664.52. Volume, estimated at 260m shares, was down sharply from the 382.8m that changed hands on Friday. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 2.45 to 1,369.72. Many investors were waiting for Friday's release of the tankan, a quarterly survey of business sentiment by the Bank of Japan, and trading volume was likely to remain relatively light until then. Although there were reports that North Korea had threatened war if economic sanctions were imposed, analysts did not believe that this was a significant factor in the day's decline. Most felt that the market was simply going through an overdue correction after rising 3 per cent in recent weeks and topping 21,000 for the first time in eight months. Minibea, a leading miniature bearing manufacturer, rose for the third consecutive day and hit a new high for the year of Y812 before closing Y17 up at Y807 after 4.2m shares traded, the third highest volume of the day. In the face of the strong currency, Minibea's expansion into south east Asia, with production bases in Thailand and Singapore, brokers said, made the company attractive to investors. Many of last week's high-technology and large-capital winners fell back, some on very active trading. Volume leader Hitachi slipped Y20 to Y1070 with 6.2m shares changing hands. Oki Electric closed at Y864, down Y6, and Fujitsu was off Y10 at Y1100. Second most active stock Mitsubishi Heavy Industries eased Y3 to Y763 with 5m shares dealt. Kawasaki Heavy Industries shed Y8 to Y375 and Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding declined Y7 to Y375. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 117.52 off at 23,082.60 in volume of 56.2m shares. Roundup The region was mixed yesterday. Seoul and New Zealand were closed for holidays. HONG KONG put aside worries that a government package to cool the housing market, to be announced tomorrow, would push commercial property prices lower as well. The Hang Seng index improved 148.76, or 1.6 per cent, to 9,383.03. Among property issues, out of favour last week, Cheung Kong moved forward HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 39, Henderson Land gained HKDollars 1.25 at HKDollars 41.25 and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 52.50. China's state-run Dongfang Electrical Machinery made a solid debut, ending at HKDollars 3.175, against its HKDollars 2.83 issue price. HSBC picked up 50 cents to HKDollars 86.50 after being sold last week on concern over the dilution from an enhanced scrip dividend. KUALA LUMPUR was firmer after a session marked by active buying interest in second and third line counters. The composite index gained 4.57 at 970.06. Among heavily traded issues, Granite Industries rose 95 cents to MDollars 5.15, while Golden Hope put on 36 cents at MDollars 4.24 amid reports that it would gain from a large government project. SINGAPORE edged ahead, the Straits Times Industrial index adding 3.21 at 2,271.91 in volume of 98.8m shares. Hotels found favour amid expectations that property groups were considering redevelopment projects. Hotel Negara led the gains, jumping SDollars 1.00 to SDollars 19.23, followed by Seaview Hotel with a 90-cent rise to SDollars 11.10 on an upward revision of its net asset value, traders said. TAIPEI finished off the session's high, with brokers forecasting that the market was heading for a period of consolidation. The weighted index was ahead 37.92 at 6,077.25 after seeing a high of 6,118.69. Turnover rose to TDollars 73.8bn. MANILA dropped sharply on profit-taking in a number of issues. The composite index slipped 38.12 to 3,022.06 in turnover down to 633m pesos from Friday's 820m pesos. SYDNEY was deflated by a decline in the gold shares index, leading the All Ordinaries index off 6.1 at 2,072.5. Brokers said that gold stocks were undermined by weaker bullion prices and Papua New Guinea's suspension of new mining projects. Turnover amounted to ADollars 328.6m. Newcrest Mining fell 28 cents to ADollars 6.52, Dome Resources 7 cents to 45 cents and Highlands 4 cents to ADollars 1.40. BANGKOK firmed in low volume, the SET index closing 5.01 up at 1,363.01. Turnover was down to Bt4.5bn. The finance sector was the day's biggest gainer, up 1 per cent, with Asia Securities Trading adding Bt1 at Bt99.</p>

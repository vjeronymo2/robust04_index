			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Conran loan to Fitch approved An extraordinary meeting of Fitch, the design company, yesterday approved the provision of a loan facility of Pounds 325,000 from Sir Terence Conran to the company, and granted him options to subscribe for up to 2.5m ordinary shares - 7 per cent of the issued capital. Sir Terence already holds 25 per cent, while the French Brand Trust owns 35 per cent. Senior managers will also have the option to purchase up to 30 per cent of the company from Sir Terence and the Brand Trust. The move was in order to 'foster a spirit of partnership between shareholders and key individuals', directors said. Fitch cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 3.98m to Pounds 3.18m for 1993.</p>

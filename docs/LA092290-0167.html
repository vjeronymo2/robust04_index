			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> CITY GETS AWARD FOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION  </P> <P> When Councilwoman Clarice A. Blamer arrived at a recent convention of the  International Downtown Assn., few of the participants had ever heard of Brea.  </P> <P> But by the time the affair closed, the small city had claimed its share of the  spotlight, earning one of 15 association awards.  </P> <P> Brea was recognized for the design and planning process it employed in  redeveloping its downtown area.  </P> <P> Chosen from more than 65 entries, the city was one of just two small cities  recognized, the other being Escondido. Other winning cities included Los  Angeles, Orlando, Baltimore, St. Paul and Phoenix. Blamer presented the award  to Mayor Carrey J. Nelson this week.  </P> <P> Brea was chosen for its Downtown Charette, a citizens' group appointed by the  council to help plan and design the new downtown. The word charette means a  time-limited process that brings outside planning, design and architectural  professionals to a particular site to work on a design problem. Working in  small groups, the 150 members made numerous recommendations to architects,  planners and others hired by the city to develop the master plan for the new  downtown.  </P> <P> Some of the ideas presented by the charette and incorporated into the plan  include providing a pedestrian environment, housing in the downtown area, and  round-the-clock entertainment and recreational areas for people of all ages.  The International Downtown Assn. is made up of cities from the United States  and Canada. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE  </P></p>

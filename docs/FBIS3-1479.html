			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Media statement issued by the Office of the State President </F> on the SAPA PR Wire Service on 28 March]    [Text] The state president, Mr F. W. de Klerk, has  expressed his extreme concern over the incidents in Johannesburg  this morning in which a number of people were killed and  injured. According to present information insufficient care was  taken by the organisers of today's march to prevent violence and  to discipline participants. He has requested a full criminal  investigation into the incidents with a view to ensuring  prosecution of anybody who has acted in conflict with the law.    There can be no excuse at this critical stage in the  political process for provocative and potentially violent  actions such as we have seen today. It not only endangers the  election and reform process, but also the very fabric of society.    He has issued an urgent appeal to the leaders of all parties  and organisations to exercise maximum control and restraint over  their followers, to ensure that there is no repetition of this  kind of incident and to avoid any action or strategies which can  lead to violence.    The time has arrived for the urgent consideration -- by the  government, the TEC [Transitional Executive Council], the IEC  [Independent Electoral Commission] and others -- of additional  measures or steps which can prevent a repetition of what has  happened today and on recent similar occasions. The government  intends to discuss this question with the relevant institutions.  Obviously such measures or steps should not prevent political  parties from campaigning peacefully and democratically.    The state president has expressed his condolences to the  families of all those who have been killed.</p>

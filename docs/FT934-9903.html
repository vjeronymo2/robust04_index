			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Ukraine fears economic collapse THE Ukrainian parliament meets today to discuss an electoral law to allow early parliamentary elections next March, in the wake of a series of draconian presidential decrees. However, the real issue of debate, and the impetus behind the new elections, is the economic crisis. Ukraine is reeling under hyper-inflation of more than 100 per cent a month and a worthless currency which has lost more than 80 per cent of its value in the last three months. Fearing monetary collapse and potential social unrest, the Ukrainian president, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, signed a series of decrees last week to establish authoritarian control, throwing the economy back into the communist era and overturning the few new economic freedoms granted to Ukrainians over the past year. These included: closing the Kiev currency auction, which determines the market rate for the Ukrainian currency, the karbovanets; shutting down money exchange bureaux throughout the country; permitting currency exchange transactions only for government-authorised imports and exports at fixed central bank exchange rate; setting wholesale and retail price controls. Prices are to rise with energy cost increases only. Profits are strictly limited; re-instituting the state order system, which requires most enterprises to sell a portion of their production to the state at fixed prices. But, in defiance of the president's decrees, the Kiev currency auction took place every day last week. Businessmen and currency traders have privately vowed to continue their work even if it is illegal. Unlike Russia, Ukraine has not begun to institute market reforms. There is no large-scale privatisation programme. With the lack of market incentives, widespread industrial shortages and severed trading links, GDP is falling at about 20 per cent annually. Nor has Ukraine begun to practise budgetary or fiscal discipline. Unable to establish priorities, Ukraine's government of Soviet-style industrialists continues to subsidise ailing industries and welfare programmes. The budget deficit, about 40 per cent of GDP, is financed by the printing presses.</p>

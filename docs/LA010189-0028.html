			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ULL-TIMATUM  </P> <P> I find it very disappointing that The Times would refer to someone as  close-minded and ridiculous as Tracey Ullman as a "tastemaker" (Taste Makers,  Dec. 25).  </P> <P> Anyone who lives, (and very well I might add!) in this city and feels that  theater here does not merit her very valuable time has not looked very far. I'm  sure that Ms. Ullman could find something to satisfy her superior taste.  </P> <P> If she finds Los Angeles and this country in fact to be a cultural or artistic  desert, then perhaps she should move back to London and have her tea there, or  would that hit here where it hurts, her pocketbook!  </P> <P> STACEY I. LEVINE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

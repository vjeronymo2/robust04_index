Under Secretary Socorro Diaz Palacios has said that during  the last few months of 1993 there was information about illegal  activities by small groups in that border area, but the special  circumstances of the region's underdevelopment forced the  authorities to act with special prudence and caution;  nevertheless, Socorro Diaz Palacios added, the situation is  returning to normal in Chiapas State. Here is what she said:    [Begin Diaz recording] In San Cristobal de las Casas and  Ocosingo, two of the four municipal capitals that were violently  attacked, the situation is of greater calm now. They are free  of the aggressor groups, and civilian authorities are on the way  to fully assuming their duties. These events have not produced  any disturbances in the other states of the Republic. [end  recording]    Diaz said also that the local authorities' response was to  protect the civilian population and that the Mexican Army, with  great prudence, did not act the first day. The authorities did  not execute actions whose consequences might have led to the  loss of more civilian lives in these towns. Diaz said something  interesting; she said the violent groups that are acting in  Chiapas State present a mixture of both national and foreign  interests and individuals. They show an affinity toward other  violent factions that operate in brother countries of Central  America. Some Indians, Diaz said, have been recruited and  pressured by the leaders of these groups, and their historic  demands, which must continue to be heard, have undoubtedly been  manipulated. The Federal Government, she said, has affirmed  that its conduct will continue to be based on the law and in the  defense of the people's security. It has also reiterated to all  the inhabitants of the region the proposal for dialogue to  further advance in providing attention to the needs of that and  other state regions.</p>

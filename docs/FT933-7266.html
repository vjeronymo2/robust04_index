			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Management: Searching for a healthy salary structure - Trust hospitals are now trying to put paid to collective bargaining IS the work of a nurse comparable to that of a physiotherapist? Can they do bits of each other's jobs? Should they be paid the same? If so, can hospitals afford to make the necessary adjustments to salaries without going bankrupt? These issues have been engrossing the personnel department at Central Manchester Health Care Trust (CMHT) since the trust was set up in April 1991. Staff costs account for 70 per cent of the trust's Pounds 140m budget; effective management of the workforce is therefore crucial to its financial health. The challenge facing Richard Sugden, director of personnel at CMHT, will be familiar to many in the private sector. It is also shared by hundreds of his peers in other trust hospitals who are groping for an appropriate local pay structure to replace the nationally determined pay and conditions that cover more than 4m NHS workers. Job evaluation is at the heart of the changes that trusts are seeking to make on pay. They argue that if they are going to set local rates they need to take a fresh and comprehensive look at what medical and non-medical staff are doing, and pay them in a fair way. With this in mind CMHT, in partnership with trade unions and KPMG, the management consultants, have developed Medequate, claimed to be the first healthcare-specific job evaluation system in the UK. The emphasis on evaluation is particularly important because of the number of new jobs, such as the new health care assistant role, which are emerging as trust managers examine the range of skills they need and their cost-effectiveness. An entitlement to set locally determined terms and conditions of employment for new staff - but not those transferring from the health service - was seen by the government as a core role of the new NHS trusts, the first wave of which were set-up in 1990. Medequate enables these new jobs to be broken down into their component parts - apportioning to each a specific financial worth. As yet only a handful of trusts have set their local pay terms, although more have established some new local terms of employment. CMHT, for example, has negotiated a number of new agreements on non-pay issues, such as common terms of compassionate leave. Trusts give a variety of reasons for not yet having established local pay structures - not least that such changes take a low priority at a time when most of them are struggling to balance budgets and reduce hospital waiting lists. Sugden cites other substantial reasons - cost and complexity. Some smaller trusts, such as ambulance trusts, have made more progress than big teaching hospitals. For many large teaching hospitals employing a wide range of staff, adjustments in salaries relative to each other are highly sensitive. Adjustments could also have a substantial knock-on effect on the pay bill at a time when the government has put a 1.5 per cent ceiling on public sector rises. CMHT is trying to get away from the present system of collective bargaining at national level by 40 different unions and staff organisations on the Whitley councils - the traditional negotiating forums in the NHS. All have different salary structures. On some, employees start at the minimum and move up, on others they can be appointed at something more than the minimum, on others there are additional pay elements for taking on those with slightly more responsibility. All staff, excluding senior managers, progress because of time served. Senior managers have a basic salary and are then entitled to receive performance related pay. In devising Medequate, 15 factors were agreed upon as characterising, to some degree, all NHS jobs - from qualifications and formal training to clinical skills. Each factor is ascribed a weighting, so that the Medequate computer software is geared to produce a job hierarchy. Not surprisingly consultants come near the top. Sugden says: 'The hierarchy does not tell us how much we should be paying our staff. The trust's main board will decide what the highest level of pay will be and the lowest.' Sugden is coy about whether some groups may win out financially, and others lose, in the new evaluation. But, the balance is critical if the pay bill is not to explode. In any re-grading some salaries are likely to go up immediately, but those which are to be reduced have to be brought down over a period of time. The revolutionary aspect for Sugden is that as and when new job categories are created the formula can be used to set new pay levels. At present, for example the hospital is looking at whether it is possible to introduce multi-skilled teams of professionals. If this happened, the skills a team member may have to acquire would have to be costed. Sugden says: 'At the moment we are working in an environment where there are clear professional demarcation lines. But in the future we may be moving towards describing jobs in terms of the jobs people do, not their professional grouping. 'But, part of the inertia at present in the NHS is a recognition of the sensitivity of making changes. 'But we now have a tool that enables us to say that if we change this or that activity this is the price we will have to pay.'</p>

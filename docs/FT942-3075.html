			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Glaxo Glaxo's market capitalisation has increased forty-fold since Sir Paul Girolami stepped into the chief executive's shoes in 1980. Yet the Pounds 10bn decline in the company's value over the past two and a half years reflects a tougher environment than the free-wheeling 1980s. Margins are under pressure and volume growth is harder to come by. Sir Paul's decision to retire as chairman is therefore timely. His instinctive dislike of acquisitions does not sit comfortably with Glaxo's need to position itself in a changing market, or its prodigious accumulation of cash. A large acquisition in US healthcare is not the only answer. But shareholders will give Sir Paul a double vote of thanks if the company he built now finds it easier to adapt.</p>

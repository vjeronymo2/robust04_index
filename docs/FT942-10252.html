			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Aerospatiale pins hopes on Europe - French aerospace group is seeking new alliances Aerospatiale, the French state-controlled aerospace group, is stepping up its efforts to forge European alliances in both its defence and commercial activities as part of its strategy to return to profit. After reducing net losses to FFr1.42bn (Dollars 250m) last year from FFr2.38bn in 1992, Mr Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's chairman, said the group was on target to break-even this year. Like the rest of the aerospace industry, the French group has been hit by the prolonged slump in the civil aircraft sector and the decline in the defence market. However, Aerospatiale is more vulnerable than other European aerospace groups to the problems of the civil rather than the defence side of the business, because it relies on civil aerospace for about 70 per cent of its FFr50bn annual consolidated turnover. 'After Boeing of the US, we are probably the most civil aerospace company in the world, but we don't have the same substantial 60 per cent market share of the civil market as Boeing,' Mr Gallois explained. He added that he did not expect any sustained recovery in the civil aircraft sector before 1996 or 1997. To consolidate his company's financial recovery, Mr Gallois said a priority was to reduce the production break-even point of the group's principal civil aerospace products. Aerospatiale holds a 37.9 per cent stake in the European Airbus consortium and a 50 per cent stake in the Franco-Italian ATR regional turbo-propeller aircraft group. The big Airbus investments made over the last 10 years to compete against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US were based on an average French franc-US dollar exchange rate of FFr5.80 and Airbus annual aircraft deliveries of around 200 airliners a year. In the regional turbo-prop market, the annual production break-even point for ATR aircraft was estimated at around 60 aircraft, explained Mr Yves Michot, Aerospatiale's managing director. The problem for Aerospatiale is that Airbus production has now dropped to around 130 airliners a year while ATR production is down to 42 aircraft. 'We simply must adjust the European industry to manufacture profitably Airbus aircraft at a rate of around 130 aircraft a year,' Mr Gallois stressed. At the same time, Airbus is facing increasing competition from Boeing, which is seeking to reduce its production costs by 25 per cent. 'We have also reduced our production cycle times for narrow-body airliners to around nine months, but the problem is that Boeing wants to bring them down to six months,' said Mr Claude Terrazzoni, head of Aerospatiale's civil aircraft division. 'In the wide-body sector, Boeing cycle times are down to 10.5 months while Airbus is around 12.5 months, but we plan to come down to 10.5 months as well,' he added. Both Mr Gallois and Mr Terrazzoni also stressed Airbus's intention to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the jumbo airliner market. 'We simply can't afford not to be part of that market,' Mr Terrazzoni said, explaining that aircraft of 400 seats or more will account for an increasing share of the market during the next 20 years. In the turbo-prop sector, it is vital to rationalise the European industry suffering from over-capacity and competing products. 'You now need to produce about 70 to 80 aircraft a year to break even in this sector: there's therefore no other way out but to regroup the industry in Europe,' Mr Gallois said. Aerospatiale is continuing discussions with British Aerospace in an effort to merge BAe's Jetstream turbo-prop activities based in Prestwick, Scotland, with those of ATR. Aerospatiale has proposed to combine the two groups around a new project, the development of a larger 82-seat turbo-propeller aircraft, the ATR 82. There are still doubts on whether there is a niche in the market for an 82-seat turbo-prop competing against smaller regional jets, but Aerospatiale believes if ATR and BAe can combine forces in this sector, other European manufacturers will join. Aerospatiale also hopes to complete by the end of this year its long negotiations to merge its guided weapons and satellite activities with those of Deutsche Aerospace in separate joint ventures. (Aerospatiale already has a joint helicopter venture with Deutsche Aerospace, called Eurocopter.) These joint ventures could lead to wider European alliances in both missiles and satellites. 'We need to achieve a much deeper integration of our European defence industries to compete with the US, where consolidation is taking place at a very rapid pace,' Mr Gallois said. 'The difficulty in Europe is that consolidation in the defence sector is bound to take much longer. You need a balance between partners, for no country will allow its defence industry to pass under foreign control. You must create real joint ventures, which is much harder than simply buying out another company as our US competitors are doing in their domestic market,' he added.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hobson continues CWS rationalisation with further sales Hobson, the homecare and food products group, yesterday announced a further series of rationalisations of the food manufacturing business of the Co-operative Wholesale Society it bought for Pounds 111m in April. The group will receive some Pounds 11.1m cash, but costs, including write-offs, will amount to Pounds 7.5m. It has sold, to HL Foods, the plant and machinery of FE Barber's cannery operations in Lowestoft, Suffolk, for Pounds 200,000, and its contracts and stock for Pounds 9m cash. It has also sold - to Pura Food Products, a subsidiary of Acatos &amp; Hutcheson, the edible oils group - the plant and machinery of its oils and fats operation for Pounds 950,000. Pura has paid Pounds 2.08m for the contracts and stock. As already announced, Hobson has closed the Lowestoft cannery with the loss of 350 jobs. Its oils and fats operation in Irlam, Greater Manchester, is also to be closed and relocated to London with the loss of a further 120 jobs. This will take the CWS jobs lost since the acquisition to 600, or about 40 per cent of the ex-CWS workforce. In the year to January 8, the cannery made losses before interest and tax of Pounds 691,000 on sales of Pounds 39.5m. Net assets at that date were Pounds 15.8m. The operation has continued to be lossmaking. The oils and fats operations, which had assets of Pounds 2.1m at the year end, incurred losses of Pounds 235,000 before interest and tax.</p>

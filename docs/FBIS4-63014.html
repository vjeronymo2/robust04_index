			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Chuyko, president of the "Aircraft </F> Engine Builders' Union" Association, with ITAR-TASS  correspondent Yevgeniy Nikitin specially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA:  date, place not given: "We Make High-Class Engines. But We Are  Unable To Sell Them"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Nikitin] What is aircraft  engine manufacturing doing to maintain the state's lofty status?    [Chuyko] Aeroengine manufacturing is enabling us to make  scientific developments. The developments used in a military  engine are used five years later in a passenger aircraft and in  another five years in gas-turbine engines, in nuclear power  engineering, shipbuilding, gas pumping, etc. Aviation science  gives rise to new areas of industry and agriculture. More  precise calculations are used along with new methods of  technological processing and new equipment. And all that  provides work for metallurgists, instrument manufacturers....  We are currently manufacturing around 200,000 mini-tractors and  cultivators for agriculture.    [Nikitin] What do you consider the main conditions for the  development of aircraft engine manufacturing?    [Chuyko] The main thing for us today is to formulate a  national aviation policy. We need to secure state backing for  science and for aircraft production and operation, focus efforts  on ensuring flight safety, and bear in mind all the features  involved in the privatization of defense complex enterprises.  We must make up our minds what we actually want.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Juan Esteban Aguirre, Paraguayan ambassador </F> to the United States, by reporter Andres Dario Cardozo  Hohn--place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Cardozo] Ambassador Aguirre,  it would seem that the United States still distrusts us as far  as drug trafficking is concerned.    [Aguirre] The United States has given top priority to the  drug problem. We need a precise diagnosis of drug trafficking  in Paraguay. There is a problem and we need to know how bad it  is to be able to implement the appropriate corrective measures.    I believe that at present we do not have the diagnosis of  the  situation that we need.    As to the request to allow U.S. troops into Paraguay, I do  not believe it has anything to do with drug trafficking. I do  not believe the U.S. military is coming to fight drug  trafficking in Paraguay. As far as I am concerned, the two  issues are not connected because we handle drug trafficking at  another level, working with the United States through the  National Antidrug Secretariat (Senad).    [Cardozo] Then what would be the point of these troops  coming  to Paraguay?    [Aguirre] I believe the United States looks for friendly,  safe countries to train their troops.    If we bear in mind the role the United States plays in the  world, where they deploy and use their Armed Forces to resolve  problems, we will realize that there are few places in the world  where they can send their soldiers without fear that they might  be attacked.    [Cardozo] Would our country benefit from the presence of  these soldiers?    [Aguirre] In addition to what they are promising to build,  we  also would benefit from being able to watch the deployment of  the world's most advanced military technology.</p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Nadir airline grounded NOBLE AIR, the airline owned by Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck International, has suspended all flights. The Department of Trade and Industry said the airline had stopped flying after a strike by its pilots. A spokesman for Mr Nadir said that the airline had not ceased trading, but that there would be a break in its operations until mid-March when the tourism season got under way. Noble Air, registered in Istanbul, was set up in 1988 to serve passengers travelling between western Europe and Turkey and northern Cyprus. Its ownership has never been entirely clear but yesterday Mr Nadir's spokesman said that it belonged to Mr Nadir and had been pledged as security with his creditors. In November Mr Nadir was declared bankrupt with debts of some Pounds 80m. Many of them were owed to security houses from which he bought Polly Peck shares in the final weeks before the fruit and electronics group slid into administration. Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish Cypriot cemetery-owner and distant relative of Mr Nadir, and who put up Pounds 1m surety for his bail in December 1990, has been named in the Turkish press as a possible buyer for the airline. Mr Nadir's spokesman was unable to confirm that Mr Guney had stepped in.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Nissan Motor at record deficit Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest carmaker, plunged to a record consolidated pre-tax loss of Y202.4bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in the year to March, its worst financial performance since it became a public company. However, Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK stayed in the black, albeit at a greatly reduced Pounds 2.1m, against Pounds 29.6m. Nissan Motor (GB), the UK sales and marketing subsidiary, managed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 731,000 following a loss of Pounds 16.8m in 1992, its first full year of operation. The Nissan group, which has been hit by the appreciation of the yen and recession in the Japanese and the European new car markets, warned yesterday that it would suffer a third consecutive year of losses in 1994-95. The group pre-tax loss almost doubled last year from Y108.1bn. Operating losses jumped to Y144bn from Y7.2bn a year earlier, while its net loss rose to Y86.9bn from Y56bn. In Europe the company suffered heavy losses at Nissan Motor Iberica, in Spain. Nissan's worldwide vehicle production fell 7.4 per cent last year to 2.74m. Domestic production declined by 14.1 per cent to 1.75m while production overseas increased 7.2 per cent to 993,000. Group turnover fell 6.4 per cent to Y5,801bn. Nissan performed strongly in the US with a 15 per cent increase in sales volume, but this failed to offset the decline in Europe and in the domestic market. Overall new car sales have fallen for three years in succession in Japan, while in western Europe new car sales dropped by more than 15 per cent last year. Nissan said that group losses reflected chiefly the drop in sales volumes in Japan and in Europe, its costly restructuring in Spain, heavy depreciation charges in Mexico, and the sharp appreciation of the yen. The Nissan parent company announced a small net profit of Y7.6bn (Pounds 48.4m) as a result of gains from the heavy sale of securities, and will pay a dividend of Y7 per share. Mr Heiichi Hamaoka, managing director, warned that Nissan was being forced to accelerate its restructuring and cost-cutting. 'We will do what we can to return to the black.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "President's Directive Signed </F> But Still No Clarity. Appointments of 20 Russian Ambassadors  Delayed"]    [Text] According to informed sources, the other day  President Boris Yeltsin signed an internal directive on the  procedure for appointing and approving Russian ambassadors  abroad.    This process came to a standstill without even starting,  literally after the entry into effect of the new Russian  Federation Constitution, whose provisions regarding the  procedure for appointing ambassadors caused friction in  relations between the Foreign Ministry and the Federal  Assembly's international committees, which aspire to the role of  active participants rather than passive observers of the  consideration and solution of questions of this kind. The  Constitution prescribes that appointments are made by the  president by agreement with the appropriate parliamentary  committees. The term "by agreement" has become a stumbling  block: Does it mean that, for example, committees can block a  particular nomination proposed by the head of state, or is it  merely the case that the president will acquaint himself with  the opinion of the committee members but will make the final  decision exclusively at his own discretion?    Behind-the-scenes disputes have turned into a situation  whereby for the last five months or so not a single nomination  has been submitted to parliament for agreement. Consequently, a  number of key ambassadorial posts -- first and foremost in the  United States -- remain unfilled. On the whole, according to  information from informed sources, around 20 appointments are  currently "pending."    Without going into the substance of the president's  directive  in detail, in conversation with IZVESTIYA Deputy Foreign  Minister Sergey Krylov gave an approximate outline of what the  appointment process will be: Submitted nominations will be  discussed in closed parliamentary hearings and only in closed  hearings so that, the deputy minister said, "ethics are not  violated and future ambassadors' names are not publicized before  these ambassadors have received the host country's agreement."  The Constitution, Krylov stressed, does not place limitations  on the president in his final choice of a particular ambassador.  In other words, even if the nomination is rejected by  parliamentary committees the president is nonetheless fully  entitled to approve it.    Similarly citing diplomatic ethics, Krylov refused to say in  which specific countries changes will take place in the near  future, merely observing that, because a Russian ambassador had  recently died in a Latin American state, there would naturally  be a new appointment there.    Meanwhile, in the State Duma I was informed that there could  be talk only of open hearings, which will be closed to  unauthorized persons only when it is necessary to consider  confidential information. But the parliamentary committees'  decisions, submitted directly to the president, will in fact be  secret.    "Can the president," I enquired, "insist that the hearings  be  closed?"    "No," the Duma sources replied, "because the nature of the  hearings is determined by internal parliamentary regulations  which have already been approved."    After talking to representatives of the Duma, Foreign  Ministry, and presidential staff you are unlikely to conclude  that even now, with the signing of the directive, all problems  have finally been solved and the process of filling vacancies  and "rotating" ambassadors will get into full swing, although  this is what Russia's foreign policy interests demand.</p>

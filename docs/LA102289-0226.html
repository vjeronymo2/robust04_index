But if negotiations over the environmental cleanup drag on, he  said, it might be too expensive for Todd to keep the team in place.  </P> <P> The other potential buyer of the yard said his company, Intercontinental  Logistics Inc., had hoped to purchase the shipyard assets and begin operations  Nov. 1.  </P> <P> Jim Dobson, a principal in the Agoura-based investment group, said  Intercontinental proposes to take over the entire Todd property, possibly in a  joint venture with the union that represents shipyard workers. In addition to  operating a scaled-down ship repair business, he said, Intercontinental hopes  to establish a training school that would teach trades used in ship repair and  other industries, such as aircraft manufacturing, to as many as 1,800  apprentices.  </P> <P> But neither the Intercontinental plan, nor that of the Todd managers, can be  presented to the bankruptcy court for approval until the environmental issue is  resolved.  </P> <P> Although the environmental problems are not likely to keep a new owner from  moving into the yard, the prospective buyers want assurances that they will not  be liable for the contamination.  </P> <P> Said Dobson: "I think the problem is between the Harbor Department and Todd,  and we are sort of stuck in the middle."  </P> <P> The dispute between Todd and the port revolves around the shipyard's lease for  its facility. The lease has a so-called restoration clause that requires Todd  to return the property to its condition in 1970, when the agreement was  negotiated.  </P> <P> In part, that means a physical restoration. Todd is required to remove  buildings and equipment that it built after 1970, a requirement that may become  moot if a new owner continues to operate the entire 112 acres as a shipyard.  </P> <P> But the lease also calls for environmental restoration -- removal of toxins  that may have contaminated the soil or the sediment in the waters where Todd  built and repaired hundreds of ships since the 1940s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Source Hard to Determine  </P> <P> Chris Foley, the port environmental scientist who is supervising testing at the  Todd site, said consultants are checking for petroleum hydrocarbons, perhaps  from underground fuel tanks that may have leaked, and for heavy metals, such as  lead, zinc and mercury.  </P> <P> But in Todd's case, determining responsibility for such contamination is  complicated because the site has been home to a shipyard since World War I.  Thus, consultants are reviewing Todd's records, as well as those of state and  county agencies, to check for possible toxic spills or accidents for which Todd  has liability.  </P> <P> "Even if you find contamination, how do you determine what was as a result of  Todd's operation or was it a result of a previous operation?" asked Lillian  Kawasaki, director of environmental management for the port. "We're trying to  determine how you allocate those responsibilities."  </P> <P> So far, Todd and the port have disagreed not only on the extent of the  contamination but also on how heavy a burden the shipyard must bear for  cleaning it up. Todd has also hired consultants to do testing, and its test  results conflict with those of the port.  </P> <P> In a recent interview, Todd Shipyards President Hans Schaefer said that during  a meeting last month, port officials handed company representatives a report  that estimated Todd's cost for the restoration would be $35 million, with $20  million devoted to environmental cleanup.  </P> <P> Asked about his response, Schaefer said: "What could we say? We terminated the  meeting."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Last Resort Procedure  </P> <P> And on Oct. 4, Todd said in a press release that the port had threatened to  file a claim for that amount with the bankruptcy court. The release said "any  allowance of a claim of this magnitude could" ruin the reorganization plan.  </P> <P> Port officials did not acknowledge the $35-million figure, but said they would  file a claim with the bankruptcy court as a last resort, if Todd and the Harbor  Department cannot come to an agreement. "If everything breaks down we would  have a very significant claim," said Winston Tyler, the senior assistant city  attorney who handles port legal matters.  </P> <P> According to Schaefer, the reorganization plan calls for Todd to pay its  creditors in full, in part by selling off the San Pedro assets as well as the  highly profitable Aro Corp., a Todd subsidiary that manufactures air-powered  machinery and lifesaving equipment. The bankruptcy judge has approved the  proposed sale of Aro.  </P> <P> Schaefer said that although paying creditors 100 cents on the dollar is unusual  in a bankruptcy proceeding, Todd officials feel that is necessary for the  company "to survive outside of bankruptcy as an ongoing business."  </P> <P> Although he said a $35-million claim would put a serious dent in that plan,  Schaefer declined to say how much Todd is willing to pay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Tests Ordered  </P> <P> As part of the continuing negotiations, the port recently authorized its  consultant, Ebasco Environmental of Santa Ana, to conduct a second round of  testing at Todd.  </P> <P> Kawasaki said those tests covered only certain areas where contamination is  suspected, and will be used to establish a short-term cleanup plan and to draft  an agreement that is acceptable to both sides.  </P></p>

A Cuban  delegation led by Carlos Lage -- the regime's number three --  has been in Madrid since Monday [28 March] in order, according  to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, to discuss "the measures  which will serve to transform that system, liberalize the  economy, and surmount the crisis situation."    State Finance Committee Chairman Lage is accompanied by  State  Council Vice President Jose Luis Rodriguez. Their main  interlocutor in Madrid has been former Economy Minister Carlos  Solchaga, who is supervising a team of experts comprising Bank  of Spain officials and Argentaria executives, who are advising  Cuba.    The two Cuban officials also met Tuesday with Gonzalez and  with Economy Minister Pedro Solbes. Yesterday, they met in turn  with Foreign Minister Javier Solana and with European Commission  Vice President Manuel Marin, and, before returning to Havana,  they have a meeting arranged today with Trade Minister Javier  Gomez Navarro.    At a joint press conference with Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev, Gonzalez did not analyze in detail the differences  between the Cubans and their advisers on the path which the  regime should take. However, he explained that the Spanish side  "insists that the measures should be internally consistent."  "They should not be disconnected from each other in such a way  that the system is inconsistent." One of the Cubans'  interlocutors specified that Lage, who is in effect Fidel  Castro's prime minister, has not set himself overall economic  aims steps to be taken accordingly, in accordance with a  detailed timetable [sentence as published]. "They are tending to  undertake uncoordinated initiatives in order to alleviate the  situation," the same source added.    The new measures submitted by Lage to his hosts include, for  instance, the introduction of taxation in a country devoid of  taxes, and a greater opening up of the island to the outside  world by facilitating air and telephone communications.  According to Gonzalez, "greater freedom of movement outward and  into the island itself" will be granted. He also wishes to  encourage the setting up of small- and medium-sized enterprises.  Some initial liberalizing measures were put into practice last  summer. The liberalization process is being conducted very  slowly. "On the Cuban side, they are trying to do this with the  least social cost," Gonzalez explained. "They are concerned  about the rate of the reform," he added.    The [Spanish] prime minister expressed once more yesterday  his desire for the economic reform to bring about political  change eventually. "A free economy calls for a society with a  greater degree of freedom," he emphasized, although he  acknowledged that there are exceptions such as Franco's Spain  and, more recently, General Pinochet's Chile.    Nevertheless, he highlighted "signs of interest" on the part  of the Cuban regime, such as the meeting which Robaina will hold  in April with part of the moderate opposition. However, Lage  did not announce any political change to his interlocutors.    For his part, Solana offered his services to the Cuban  number  three in order to inform U.S Secretary of State Warren  Christopher of the economic changes which Cuba intends to set  under way.</p>

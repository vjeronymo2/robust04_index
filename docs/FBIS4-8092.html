			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] At 0615 this morning the enemy moved into a  ferocious tank-infantry attack on Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line,  which was supported substantially by the artillery. Almost  simultaneously, the aggressor struck at civilian targets on the  free Brcko territory with tanks, howitzers, and 120-mm mortars.    All of last night the enemy shelled the entire defense line  of the 108th Motorized Brigade. [passage omitted]    The enemy is concentrating great amounts of manpower and  military hardware on the first lines of the front, especially on  Omerbegovaca [word indistinct] line and in the central part of  the Brcko battlefield.    In the area of [word indistinct], where two Gazela  helicopters attacked our positions yesterday, we have observed  the arrival of another enemy combat helicopter.    The arrival of enemy reinforcements continues.</p>

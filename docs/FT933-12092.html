			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due ON Thursday, Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest chemical group, reports its first interim results without its bioscience business, Zeneca. Industry analysts' forecasts reckon pre-tax profits will be down from last year's Pounds 159m (excluding exceptionals) to about Pounds 140m. Figures will also be given for the old ICI, which included Zeneca. Cost-cutting should yield some significant savings and the results will have benefited from a weak pound. The performance of the industrial chemicals division will also be closely watched. Its titanium dioxide and caustic businesses are struggling but chemicals and polymers are expected to post significant improvements. Zeneca, ICI's former bioscience business, also reports its half-year results on Thursday. Analysts expect it to report pre-tax profits at between Pounds 330m and Pounds 340m. Of particular interest will be the performance of the pharmaceuticals division. The extent of the decline of Tenormin, once Zeneca's best- selling drug before its patents expired in the US, will be watched carefully, as will the growth of the four growth products - Zestril, a heart drug, the cancer products Zoladex and Nolvadex, and the anaesthetic Diprivan. Some analysts are predicting an unexpected upturn in the agrochemicals division, after Monsanto this week reported a significant increase in sales of its herbicide Roundup in the US. Reuters, the international information and news group, is expected to report an increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 187m to about Pounds 210m tomorrow. Interest will centre on whether the group plans to distribute some of its Pounds 710m cash pile to shareholshareholders - and on the progress of new dealing systems such as Globex, which serves financial futures and options markets, and Dealing 2000-2, the group's automated foreign exchange product. BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance conglomerate, is expected to show increased interim pre-tax profits on Wednesday. Despite concerns about the prospects for the group's US tobacco business, profits are predicted to rise to Pounds 710m-Pounds 780m (Pounds 672m a year earlier). Eagle Star, the non-life insurance subsidiary, is gradually recovering profitability. The interim reporting season for clearing banks starts on Friday with Lloyds, which is expected to show less of a rebound in profits than other banks because of greater consistency in earnings in the past two years. Lloyds is also expected to be under some pressure in its net interest income because its UK loan book has been contracting. But analysts expect it to benefit from around Pounds 100m of release of less developed country debt. Analysts expect a rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 450m-Pounds 560m (Pounds 369m). Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are expected to fall to between Pounds 250m and Pounds 270m from Pounds 347m. British Telecommunications is reporting first quarter results on Wednesday. Pre-tax profits will be around Pounds 780m (Pounds 731m), according to our forecast.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Liberal hopes MR PADDY ASHDOWN is right to ignore those who would have him declare that the Liberal Democrats will support a future Labour government but not a Conservative one. The role of his party is still what that of British centre parties has been for most of the century: to prevent the parties of the left and the right from moving towards the extreme. To do that it is necessary to keep them guessing, at least between elections. There would also be no political advantage in promising a post-election pact with Labour now. The effect might be to deprive the Lib Dems of their most precious current asset, the anti-Conservative protest vote. It would anyway reduce Mr Ashdown's party to that of an appendage. That said, the Liberal Democrats profess views that are virtually indistinguishable from those of the 'modernisers' in the Labour party. At the Lib Dem conference in Torquay this week nothing was proposed by anybody, including Mr Ashdown himself, that Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, could easily quarrel with. The Liberal Democrats stressed individualism, within a community framework, overseen by an active government; at its conference next week Labour is expected to favour an active government, community values, and room for individual expression. Mr Ashdown's party favours a Scottish assembly, regional parliaments, reform of the House of Lords and proportional representation; Mr Smith's a referendum on the latter and a version of all of the other proposed constitutional changes. Both parties are pro-European, Mr Ashdown's the more strongly of the two, but in the Liberal Democrats' case there has been some retreat, as in their leader's speech yesterday, from the notion that Brussels knows best. The two opposition parties would both propound full employment and greater government expenditure, Labour while limiting tax increases, the Liberal Democrats while attempting to explain them. More to the point the growth in support for Mr Ashdown's party is largely explicable by the unpopularity of the government. The Lib Dems have established a base as the principal challenger to the Conservatives in the west of England; they are no such threat to Labour in the north. This is in line with the historic experience of the Liberals since 1945: when the Conservatives are in power but out of favour, the non-socialist alternative party does well. At this stage there is little point in picking holes in this or that Liberal Democrat policy document. They are far from power, and their best chance might be, willy-nilly, to vote with a Labour government, assuming one is elected. It may be, however, that the present increase in support for the Lib Dems is no mere blip - that, as Mr Ashdown intimated yesterday, further hard work by the party will bring further advances in public support. This is possible, but it is not entirely for Mr Ashdown to determine. If Labour is seen at its conference next week to be on the way to true modernisation, it may begin to attract voters in natural Liberal Democratic territory. If not, the reverse could be the case. Again, if the Conservatives trip themselves up for another year or more, Mr Ashdown will reap a rich harvest; if the Tories recover their sense of purpose, they may begin to recover their electorate. It is the fate of British centre parties thus to be at the mercy of Labour and the Conservatives. Much was said in Torquay about the feel of things being different this time. Mr Ashdown has projected himself as an anti-politician, a British Ross Perot. It has taken him, and his party, a long way. He is more popular than either Mr Smith or the prime minister. He can do little other than carry on as an independent force, waiting to see what turns up.</p>

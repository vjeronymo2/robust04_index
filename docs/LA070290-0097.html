			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THERAPISTS USE BIBLE AND PSYCHOLOGY ON TALK SHOW;  </P> <P> RADIO: 'JOURNEY OF THE HEART' JOINS THE RECENT AND CONTROVERSIAL MOVEMENT THAT  BRINGS TOGETHER FREUD AND THE SCRIPTURES.  </P> <P> In many regards, "Journey of the Heart" is like other radio psychology shows.  Peter Robbins and Kevin Downing, the hosts, begin each program by discussing  topics such as depression, child abuse and alcoholism. After that, they take  calls from listeners.  </P> <P> But Robbins and Downing differ fundamentally from broadcast therapists such as  KABC's David Viscott or KFI's Barbara de Angelis. The two men discuss  psychological problems in terms of Freud and the Bible. Halfway through a  recent show, Robbins states that child abuse is Satan's strategy to keep  youngsters from coming to know the Lord.  </P> <P> "We try to blend the art of psychology with the philosophy of Christianity,"  said Robbins, an ordained minister with a Ph.D. in psychology from Cambridge  Graduate School of Psychology in Los Angeles. "There are plenty of tools of  psychology that are consistent with the Scriptures."  </P> <P> Not everyone in the Christian community agrees. "Journey of the Heart," which  airs from 5 to 6 p.m. every Sunday on KKLA (99.5-FM), is the latest in a recent  spate of local and nationally syndicated radio shows that deal in Christian  psychology. Many Christians accept a judicious mix of behavioral science and  Scripture, but fundamentalists and others equate psychology with a wrongful  attempt by man to assume the duties of God.  </P> <P> "It's a long debate going back to the days of Freud and Jung," said Mary  Garascia, an assistant professor of theology at Loyola Marymount University.  "The conservative theologians find the use of psychology obnoxious. They see it  as being much too much anthropomorphic."  </P> <P> Yet call-in psychology shows have met growing acceptance on Christian radio  over the last five years, according to National Religious Broadcasters, a New  Jersey-based trade association. KKLA, a Christian station in North Hollywood,  carries five such shows, including the well-known "Minirth-Meier Clinic," which  is syndicated to hundreds of stations nationwide.  </P> <P> Downing, a licensed marriage and family counselor, says Christian therapy --  Jung delivered with a religious twist -- differs in important ways from secular  counseling. A Christian therapist will advise a married couple to separate only  if the relationship is abusive or if divorce appears unavoidable. A Christian  therapist will likely suggest prayer to accompany behavior modification.  </P> <P> During a program on "Sexual Addiction: The Unquenchable Lust," Downing told  listeners, "Through all the shame and through all the isolation, Christ really  loves the person who is in this addictive process. He's not put off by it. He's  not embarrassed by it."  </P> <P> "It doesn't blow the Lord away," Robbins said.  </P> <P> Later in the show, a woman called to say that she was trying to end a lesbian  affair. "I know it's wrong because God forbids that kind of relationship," she  said.  </P> <P> "I'm glad you see that," Downing said.  </P> <P> "This is a real tough area," Robbins said. "We deal with a lot of people who  are homosexuals and want to restrain from those behaviors because of their  Christian beliefs. I would really encourage you to get in with" a therapist  "who works with people who have your kinds of struggles."  </P> <P> Robbins and Downing asked the woman about her past. She said she'd been  molested by her mother's boyfriend many years ago and has since had a series of  unsatisfying relationships with men. The therapists repeated that she should  seek counseling.  </P> <P> "We'd like to thank you for your call," Robbins said. "And we'll be praying for  you."  </P> <P> Robbins began doing such work at his father-in-law's La Habra church. In 1983,  he and Downing opened a nonprofit counseling service in Diamond Bar. They saw a  need that was going unmet in the Christian community.  </P> <P> "I went to seminary, and I know that the training for pastoral counseling is  minimal," Robbins said. "If you have a pastor who is talking to a lady with an  eating disorder, it's very unlikely that eating disorders were handled in  seminary training."  </P> <P> There was, and still is, opposition to what Robbins and Downing do.  </P> <P> "Some ministers are afraid that we are bringing a philosophy that undermines  the church," Robbins said. "They tell their people, 'well, you just have to  pray.' "  </P> <P> "Some ministers refer their people to us with great joy because they realize  that their training is inadequate."  </P> <P> Robbins and Downing met with KKLA management last year to talk about doing a  weekly show. The station decided to add the Diamond Bar therapists to its  line-up and "Journey of the Heart" has drawn numerous calls each week from  listeners.  </P> <P> "They add a different flavor -- a little more pastoral, not just clinical  counseling," said station manager Dennis Worden of Robbins and Downing. "They  are able to share the Gospel as well as doing the psychological work at hand."  </P></p>

Final  </P> <P> FANTASTIC FIND PUTS END TO FAPPABURST'S PERFECT TRACK RECORD  </P> <P> Ogden Phipps' Fantastic Find put an end to favored Fappaburst's perfect record,  coming from off the pace under Craig Perret to score by three lengths in the  $47,200 Finely Stakes at Belmont Park on Monday.  </P> <P> Fappaburst, a 3-year-old unbeaten in four starts but taking on older fillies  and mares for the first time, was hounded on the lead by Divine Answer, with  Fantastic Find poised just behind. Fantastic Find first put away Divine Answer,  then drew even with Fappaburst passing the eighth pole and won going away.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, we are proposing to amend 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(ii) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that housing assistance provided to a third party on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behalf of a household by a State or local GA program or another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basic assistance program comparable to GA (as defined in &sect;271.2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be counted as income, unless the assistance is one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Assistance provided for utility costs. The exclusion is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not limited to the costs identified in 7 CFR 273.9(d)(5) as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable costs for the purposes of the excess shelter deduction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Energy assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Assistance provided by a State or local housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Emergency assistance for migrant or seasonal farmworker  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households in the job stream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Transitional housing assistance for the homeless.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Emergency or special assistance over and above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Assistance provided under a GA program if no payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are made under the program in cash.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(ii) address both PA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GA vendor payments. The Food Stamp Program regulations at 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 271.2 define GA as assistance financed by State or local funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``as part of a program which provides assistance to cover living  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses or other basic needs intended to promote the health or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well-being of recipients.'' PA is defined in that section to mean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain specified programs authorized under the Social Security  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1935, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (AFDC) and aid to the aged, blind and disabled. The 1993 Leland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act did not make any changes in the provisions of section 5(k) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act concerning treatment of PA vendor payments. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PA and GA vendor payments must be treated differently, and we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing in this rule to separate the provisions for treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of PA and GA vendor payments. Because of the need to reorganize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) to distinguish between treatment of GA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and PA payments, we are proposing to take advantage of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to restructure 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1) in its entirety. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are proposing this reorganization to make specific vendor payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusions easier to locate in the regulations. We are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing any changes in the requirements of the section except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those required by the 1993 Leland Act related to the GA vendor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments. We are proposing minor changes in the language of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section for clarity. We are also proposing to remove the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference in current 7 CFR 273.9(c)(1)(iii) to the experimental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing allowance programs in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bend, Indiana, because the programs are no longer in existence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed reorganization of &sect;273.9(c)(1), the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for excluding vendor payments would be divided into seven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

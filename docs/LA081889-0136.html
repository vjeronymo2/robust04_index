			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> More Unions to Fight BAT Takeover: Labor leaders condemned the  multibillion-dollar hostile takeover bid for Britain's BAT Industries PLC and  its U.S. affiliates, pledging to enlist public opinion plus state and federal  lawmakers in their fight. An investment group headed by Anglo-French financier  Sir James Goldsmith, British merchant banker Jacob Rothschild and Austrian  investor Kerry Packer made an offer for BAT in July that it valued at about  $21.6 billion. "Such a takeover would jeopardize the livelihoods of 55,000  American workers, including nearly 6,000 union members," said John DeConcini,  international president of the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers  International Union. The group has said it intends to sell the non-tobacco  businesses of BAT, the world's largest tobacco company. BAT also has  significant interests in financial services, retailing and the Farmers  Insurance Group.  </P></p>

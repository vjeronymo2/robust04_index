			<p>941108 FT  08 NOV 94 / Surge in output strengthens UK economic upturn: Inflation fears depress equities and bonds The government is expected to revise upwards its estimate of third-quarter economic growth after official figures yesterday showed that industrial production grew unexpectedly in the three months to September. The output figures, which highlight the strong economic platform from which Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will launch his second Budget in three weeks' time, were well above City expectations. With other official data showing third-quarter growth in consumer credit demand to record levels, fears that the economy might be slowing in a delayed reaction to tax increases were allayed. The good economic news contributed to a generally weaker tone on financial markets. Brokerage houses argued that the figures provided further evidence of a diminishing amount of spare capacity in the economy, although the consequent fears of inflation and further base rate rises were only two of several factors depressing equity and bond prices. In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed 31.8 points down at 3,065.8, while gilt-edged government bonds lost about  1/2 point. The Central Statistical Office reported that output of the production industries, including manufacturing, oil and mineral extraction and electricity, gas and water supply, jumped a seasonally adjusted 1.1 per cent between August and September. It also revised upwards statistics for July and August, estimating the present annual 'trend' rate of growth for production industry output at 6 per cent. Manufacturing output, which accounts for just over 84 per cent of industrial production, rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 per cent in September compared with August. The CSO said manufacturing output was now growing at a trend rate of 5.5 per cent. The Treasury welcomed yesterday's production figures, although it declined to comment on the policy implications. Officials said growth was broadly based and noted that the growth of output of investment goods, at 1.8 per cent between the second and third quarters, was stronger than that of the consumer or intermediate-goods sectors. September's surge in industrial activity brought output of the production industries to a new high. But it restored manufacturing output only to the level of July 1990, on the eve of the last recession. Production industry output has been buoyed by exceptionally strong oil and gas production since the beginning of last year. Oil and gas output now stands at a high after increasing by 3.5 per cent between August and September as several fields returned to normal production after maintenance closures in August. As overall industrial production accounts for some 28 per cent of gross domestic product, yesterday's figures are expected to boost third-quarter GDP growth by at least 0.1 percentage points. If there are no substantial downward revisions in other areas of economic activity, some economists believe the UK may have grown at about 3.8 per cent in the year to the third quarter compared with the provisional 3.6 per cent growth reported last month. The Confederation of British Industry, which will today hear a speech from Mr Clarke at its annual conference in Birmingham, warned yesterday there was no need for UK rates to rise.

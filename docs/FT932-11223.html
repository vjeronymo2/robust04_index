			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Both knights fall during the extended battle for Trafalgar - Roland Rudd details the boardroom manoeuvrings with a Far Eastern twist which culminated in yesterday's changes THE PURGE of the board of Trafalgar House was completed yesterday, at the behest of Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land. But the decision to clear out the top posts was taken well before Hongkong Land emerged with a 25 per cent stake in the construction, engineering and property group. In the spring of last year Sir Nigel Broackes, the former chairman and founder, set in motion a chain of events that culminated in the blood-letting. At a meeting of his non-executives Sir Nigel presented a plan in favour of what he called an orderly succession. Both he and Sir Eric Parker, chief executive since 1983, would step down on their 60th birthdays. Sir Nigel, however, would remain with the group in a consultancy basis as honorary president. Since Sir Eric was a year older than Sir Nigel and had in effect run the group for four years, the non-executives saw the plan as an attempt by Sir Nigel to remove Sir Eric early when he reached his 60th birthday in June 1993, one of the directors said. Sir Nigel complained that Sir Eric was dragging his feet over implementing the change in group strategy agreed in January 1991. There was unanimity among the directors then that with the fall in property prices Trafalgar should be repositioned as a construction and engineering group. It no longer wanted the conglomerate tag. Yet the only significant sale, of its Ellerman container shipping interests to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company for Pounds 42.5m, was dwarfed by the acquisition of the ill-fated Davy Corporation, hit by a Pounds 114m loss on an oil rig conversion. After listening to Sir Nigel the non-executives agreed to review possible management changes later last year. But the three non-executives, Mr Alan Clements, former finance director of Imperial Chemical Industries, Mr Tony Ryan, chairman and founder of GPA, the aircraft leasing company and Mr David Howell, the Conservative MP, refused to back Sir Nigel's call for Sir Eric's departure. They decided Sir Eric should remain until he was 62, when they thought he would want to retire at his own volition. There then followed a series of leaked reports that Trafalgar had decided to sell its hotels, including the Ritz, and the Cunard Shipping Line. Sir Eric denied the reports when the group reported its half year results in May, infuriating Sir Nigel. The following week Sir Eric organised a seminar in the City aimed at convincing the market that Trafalgar was no longer a conglomerate, but a world class construction and engineering group. Investors and analysts were sceptical, though, about the group's presentation. With shareholder discontent mounting Sir Nigel went back to the non-executives in September to force Sir Eric's departure. The chief executive's position was further undermined when the Financial Reporting Review Panel told Trafalgar that the property write-downs at the end of 1991 should have been taken through the profit and loss account and not through reserves. Although in September the board had not yet agreed to accept the panel's finding, the questioning of its accounting methods proved too much for the three non-executives who reversed their earlier decision. They agreed Sir Eric would have to go early to be replaced by Mr Allan Gormly, the current chief executive, who was then head of the successful engineering division. However, Sir Eric, who had a good relationship with many of his executive directors, made it clear to some of his colleagues that he was only prepared to go early if Sir Nigel went with him. He received an unexpected boost when a report in The Observer on September 20 said he was being forced to depart after losing the confidence of his board. A number of directors, believing Sir Nigel leaked the information, rallied round Sir Eric. Although Sir Nigel told colleagues he had nothing to do with article, it galvanised the executive directors into taking action. At board meeting later in September they took the lead from the non-executives in pressing for management changes. Sir Eric and Sir Nigel were asked to leave the meeting. The rest of the directors decided that both the chief executive and chairman would retire in 1993. Less than a week later, on October 1, Hongkong Land took a 14.99 per cent stake and demanded boardroom representation. Trafalgar reacted by bringing forward its management changes. Mr Alan Clements became non-executive chairman as a temporary measure. Meanwhile, Hongkong Land, which tightened its grip by gradually taking its stake up to 25 per cent, had two of its directors, Mr Rodney Leach and Sir Charles Powell, appointed as non-executives. Hongkong Land considered having Sir Charles take over as chairman but decided instead on Mr Keswick, who with his brother Henry in effect runs the Jardine Matheson empire. A question mark remained over Mr John Ansdell, the finance director. As one executive put it: 'His crime was not standing up to Parker over the accounting fiasco.' However one of the group's advisers said Mr Ansdell just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. If the row over the accounts was a good enough reason for the non-executives to seek an early replacement for Sir Eric, then, according to a financier close to Hongkong Land, it was good enough for the Keswicks to seek a new finance director.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Signal for Expansion of Railway </F> Transit"]    [Text] One week after the conclusion of the accession  talks with the European Union [EU], the Federal Government  adopted a decision of principle on Tuesday [8 March] to "offer  support to those lines of business that would be directly facing  adaptation problems in the event of EU membership." Talks with  the industries affected and the social partners should be  initiated as soon as possible.    At a joint news conference after the cabinet meeting,  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek  stressed that the most important thing is to make it clear to  the citizens that all required measures are being introduced at  full speed. Vranitzky spoke of a "clear signal," and Busek  described this signal as the precondition for making use of the  economic opportunities that the European Union offers.    Both Vranitzky and Busek spoke in favor of making available  the required financial funds to accelerate restructuring, even  though this would result in a higher budget deficit. For  Vranitzky, this is a kind of "payment on account" for an  improvement of the economy and for a higher tax revenue expected  to result therefrom. Busek clearly prefers "using the funds for  measures that promote developments instead of financing  unemployment."    The government's declaration of principle explicitly notes  that the "integration of Austria's agriculture into the Common  Agricultural Policy will by no means be a shock because measures  will be taken--financed by the European Union, the provinces,  and the government--which will, in the long run, ensure the  existence of the farmers and the processing industry."    The government also stressed the special significance of a  solution to the transit problem. Thus, the declaration of  principle mentions Austria's intention "to ensure the  environmental goals of the transit agreement on a permanent  basis beyond the duration of the agreement by shifting quickly  and to a greater extent traffic from the roads to the railways.  For this reason, the Austrian Government advocates the  expansion of railway lines on the transit routes. In this  respect, the quick expansion of the railway line in the  Unterinntal valley and the construction of the Brenner tunnel,  for which the European Union has promised funds, assumes great  significance."    The government's goal is to strengthen Austria's  competitiveness with a view to entry into the European Union.  The declaration of principle was jointly presented to the  cabinet by Vranitzky and Busek.    The head of government and his deputy proposed shifting  freight traffic quickly from the roads to the railways,  particularly in Tirol. Even without membership in the European  Union, Austria would have had to tackle this problem. It is now  important to make use of the promised funds of the European  Union.    Referring to the Unterinntal valley railway tunnel,  Vranitzky  expressed the conviction that the government formed after the  provincial elections will accept his governments's offer for  early talks. In fact, Governor Wendelin Weingartner threatened  to reject the European Union unless Tirol's interests are taken  into consideration. Yet he, Vranitzky, considered it more  useful to respond to this statement with an offer for talks.  Since the Austrian railways are currently in the process of  planning the Unterinntal valley line, details of the tunnel  should be coordinated with Tirolean authorities as soon as  possible.    Busek stressed that these railway projects are very  labor-intensive and will ensure jobs. Moreover, Weingartner has  also made it clear that EU membership also offers numerous  opportunities for Tirol. The possibilities of a transit  solution are "closer than ever before." As a result of EU  membership, the border between north and south Tirol will  "largely be removed." Busek is convinced that, also from  Weingartner's point of view, the advantages of EU membership  outweigh the disadvantages.    Busek also emphasized the fact that various foreign  companies make investments dependent on Austria's EU membership.  This will provide additional stimulus for the economy.    According to Vranitzky, the exact date of the referendum on  the European Union cannot be determined at this point because it  also depends on talks within the European Union -- on the  blocking minority, for example. Whether it will be held on 12  or 19 June will also depend on the parliamentary schedule.  Transportation Minister Klima stated that, even without the  Brenner tunnel, a four-track railway line is required in the  Unterinntal valley because short-distance traffic is already  creating problems at this point. The section between Woergl and  Innsbruck is particularly critical where two railway lines meet  -- the Inntal valley line and the line to Bischofshofen.    The financing procedure will ultimately depend on the  estimated costs, and these in turn will depend on the wishes of  the neighboring communes concerning the route. In individual  sections, deviations form the planned route would double the  costs. The railway head office in Innsbruck has for months been  holding talks on the route with the neighboring communes.    The feasibility study of the Brenner tunnel, which is being  prepared under the leadership of a general consultant, will be  completed by June this year, Klima stated. A decision will be  made in October when, how fast, and whether the Brenner tunnel  will be built at all. In the spirit of the agreement with the  European Union, the project will be financed out of the federal  budget and EU funds. During a short visit to Tirol, Foreign  Minister Alois Mock announced on Tuesday that he will support  the provision of EU funds for the railway tunnel in the  Unterinntal valley. Mock was "optimistic" that he will be able  to achieve the same kind of support that was promised for the  Brenner tunnel. Tirol Governor Wendelin Weingartner stressed  once more that Tirol's "yes" to the European Union will depend  on binding promises concerning the financing of the Unterinntal  valley railway line. He welcomed the cabinet's decision on the  expansion of the railway network as a step in the right  direction. His deputy Hans Tanzer described Weingartner's  threatening gestures as superfluous. Tirol can rely on  Chancellor Vranitzky and the Federal Government. Joerg Haider,  chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], criticized  Weingartner's talks with the government as a "spectacle" and a  "political maneuver designed to deceive the citizens." Whereas  the government headed by Vranitzky has adopted another  "halfhearted declaration of principle" without presenting  specific plans and figures concerning the expansion of the  railway network, Tirol is being increasingly neglected, the  opposition leader pointed out. The FPOe will hold a special  conference on the European Union in Villach on 8 April.    Catholic Action has published a memorandum as an aid for the  decision on the European Union but did not recommend a specific  position.</p>

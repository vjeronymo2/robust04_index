			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Failed company's pension fund cash used to back loan ABOUT Pounds 2m belonging to the pension fund of Burlington International, the footwear manufacturer which went into receivership in March with debts estimated at Pounds 10m, was used as collateral for a loan to the company from a branch of Barclays Bank some months before it failed. Law Debenture Corporation, appointed as independent trustee for the pension fund, is looking into transactions of more than Pounds 11m between the company and its pension fund which began in December 1989. The collateral enabled Burlington to obtain an increased overdraft at Barclays Bank and was intended to generate a fee for the pension scheme. The former trustees for the pension scheme agreed to the transaction, according to Law Debenture Corporation. However, Law Debenture Corporation believes the market value of the Burlington buildings and land purchased by the pension scheme in December 1989 is now about half of the Pounds 6.2m paid. Also, the value of Burlington machinery, purchased by the pension scheme for Pounds 1.5m, may now be only Pounds 300,000, Law Debenture Corporation said. The pension scheme also loaned a further Pounds 1.5m to the company last year which has not been repaid. Law Debenture said it believed the pension scheme, which had assets of Pounds 35m when it was last valued, may still have enough funds to meet its obligations. Separately, it emerged yesterday that cooker manufacturer Belling, which is now in receivership, sold one of its subsidiaries to its pension scheme for Pounds 5.5m just six months ago. Law Debenture Corporation, which is also an independent trustee to the Belling scheme, said the investment accounted for more than a quarter of the scheme's Pounds 25m assets. However, Law Debenture believes that there will be sufficient assets to meet all the liabilities because the scheme's accounts for last year showed a surplus. Law Debenture said it believes the subsidiary may now be worth 'somewhat less' than was paid for it because its single biggest customer was Belling itself, which accounted for between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of its total sales.</p>

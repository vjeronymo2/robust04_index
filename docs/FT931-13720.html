			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Japan's ruling party wins a royal respite: Charles Leadbeater finds all eyes are on the imperial wedding THE ruling Liberal Democratic party in Japan has found a highly potent secret weapon to restore its popularity. This addition to its armoury is 164cm tall, 29 years old, speaks five languages, used to be a high flying diplomat and is about to become a Crown Princess. The media and public fascination with Masako Owada, who this week was officially engaged to Prince Naruhito, the next Emperor, is unalloyed good news for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the hard-pressed prime minister. It is not just that the royal wedding has taken minds off the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin gangsters, money and politics scandal which dominated the news in the autumn. Japan's royal family still commands great deference as well as exciting gossip. From now until the wedding in June everyone will be on their best behaviour; no one will want to risk the shame of sullying the wedding preparations by putting political dirty linen on the line. As the Japanese parliament reconvenes today, the government believes the worst may be over. It has survived an autumn of scandal when its popularity plummeted and a vicious power struggle threatened to split the party. Last month Mr Miyazawa cleared the decks with a cabinet reshuffle which has restored order at the top of the party. The supplementary budget to revive the flagging economy was passed and the government has set up a task force to consider further measures. The government has weathered the worst of the Sagawa scandal. It is unlikely there will be further significant revelations, the public appetite may be satisfied and Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister at the heart of the affair, has successfully resisted resignation. The breakaway LDP faction led by Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, will not split the party as once thought. It is burrowing its way into a comfortable position within the established hierarchy. The refound stability at the top of the LDP is matched by a clear political timetable for the rest of the year. In February and March, there will be bad economic news. Profits forecasts will be cut, wage talks will yield low rises and the stock market will remain vulnerable to a renewed collapse. That will be the time for the government to unveil plans for another bumper package to stimulate the economy, with a mix of public works spending and tax cuts. Such a package is already being planned. By May there will be a political truce to clear the way for the royal wedding which will consume the nation in early June. Then in early July Tokyo will want to present a calm, united front to the outside world when it hosts the G7 summit. By the time people return from their August holidays the economy should be on the mend, paving the way for Mr Miyazawa to be re-elected in September for a second term as LDP president and prime minister. That should allow the LDP to set the seal on a successful year with a general election victory in the autumn. At least that is the timetable which the LDP is hoping to keep to. It may not be that simple. The LDP's authority rests upon its record for economic growth. That is facing its greatest challenge for 20 years from an intractable downturn, which could yet prompt the collapse of the fragile stock market. The economy is a long way from recovery; until then the LDP's popular support will be wobbly. The uncertain international environment could throw up issues which the government will find difficult to resolve. The Clinton administration may take a tougher line over trade, according to comments on Tuesday by Mr Mickey Kantor, the new US trade representative, who said tariffs on minivan imports could rise sharply, there would be a row over the US-Japan semi-conductor agreement if the US share of the Japanese market did not reach 20 per cent and the controversial Super 301 trade sanctions may be reintroduced. Japan's farmers know the rice market is almost certain to be opened to imports to help secure a Gatt deal. However they will want to extract the maximum political price for going along with the government's plans. The LDP could also face a more effective opposition after Mr Makato Tanabe's resignation as chairman of the Social Democratic party. The new SDP leadership seems prepared to consider reform of the so-called peace constitution and the international role of Japan's self-defence forces in an effort to modernise the party's image. Although the Sagawa scandal may have passed its peak, the shadow it has cast over the political system has not lifted. Mr Miyazawa's popularity is yet to recover. If his ratings are still depressed in the autumn, the party will grow alarmed that he may damage its election chances. That could spark off a power struggle between at least four senior LDP figures to replace him. After an awful autumn, Japan's political leadership has won a respite. But it may be short-lived and once the secret weapon of the royal marriage is launched into imperial orbit the earthly sense of political crisis may return.</p>

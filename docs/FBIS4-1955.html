			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 16 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's  Liaoning Province last year poured in huge amounts of funds to  bolster the transportation and telecommunications industries,  which grew 60.3 percent from 1992.    Investment in the development of transportation and  telecommunications in 1993 reached 1.87 billion yuan, accounting  for seven percent of the province's total capital construction  funds.    These fast-growing industries boosted the province's gross  national product and financial revenue by 28 percent last year.    The Shenyang Railway Bureau, the biggest of its kind in  China, pooled 448 million yuan in 1993 to back the construction  of major projects within and outside the province. A  147-million-yuan project, the Dayaowan Line, was completed at  the end of 1993.    It also invested 5.25 billion yuan last year in a joint  effort to renovate the Harbin-Dalian line.    In addition, the province put about 1.37 billion yuan in  1993  into fixed assets for highway construction, an 82.1 percent rise  from the previous year. The total investment in highway  building hit more than 1.19 billion yuan.    The 43.3-km expressway of the south section ring road around  the capital city of Shenyang has now opened to traffic, and the  construction of the north section of the ring and another  expressway from Shenyang to Tieling, a grain-producing city in  northern Liaoning, has started.    The province now has highways and expressways totalling  41,638 km.    In 1993 it earmarked a total of 229 million yuan to boost  port development, up 46 percent over the planned investment. To  quicken the pace of port construction, it also attracted a  record 83 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment.    The construction of China's biggest ship repair center,  which  was built jointly by the Dalian Ocean Shipping Company and a  Hong Kong firm, has started at Dalian Bay. Four berths of the  first phase have already been put into operation, and another  six such berths are well under way.    In Jinzhou city a new management system, the joint stock  system, has been introduced since early 1993 to invigorate port  construction. One 10,000-dwt [deadweight tons] bulk cargo berth  has been built, boosting the handling capacity of the port to  300,000 dwt.    In Dandong the building of another three 10,000-dwt berths  has been completed, and they are expected to go into operation  soon.    Meanwhile, the provincial postal department invested 2.18  billion yuan in the sector in 1993, up 135.4 percent from the  previous year. The foreign investment in this field amounted to  93 million U.S. dollars.    The province added a total telephone exchange capacity of  562,700 lines last year. The annual postal and  telecommunications business volume and income jumped by 55.7  percent and 51 percent, respectively in the same year.</p>

In order to make its industrial development stable and  sound,  the local government has divided the city's 145 industrial  enterprises into four categories: rapid development, stable  development, little development and serious predicament.    Apart from macro-control of industry, the local government  has applied different policies and measures to the four  categories of enterprises.    Priority has been given to the first two categories of  well-run enterprises, which are usually big profit-earners, in  allocation of funds, and supplies of electricity and  transportation, to guarantee the production of popular products  and exports.    For enterprises with the potential to eliminate losses and  earn profits, on the one hand assistance has been provided to  solve their problems in capital, transportation and marketing,  and on the other pressure has been brought to bear on them to  improve their management and operation mechanism.

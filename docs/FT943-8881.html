			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Media Futures: System to block fraud on stolen mobile phones Hot weather invites open car windows and sunroofs. Sadly, natural ventilation also makes it simple for the thief to make off with the car owner's mobile phone. When other kinds of portable phone thefts are added in, the numbers become startling; the Federation of Communication Services estimates around 15,000 phones are stolen each month in the UK alone. The Metropolitan Police has set up a special unit to tackle the problem. Portable phones can be 'hot' in more than one way, however. More insidious than the hand through the sunroof is electronic fiddling with the phone's identity, making it possible for a fraudster to run up huge telephone bills which are then charged to somebody else's account. The phone does not have to be stolen; a legally purchased phone can be altered so that calls made on it are charged elsewhere. Called 'rechipping', changing the electrical identity of a cellular phone is not illegal in the UK, although the FCS is calling for urgent changes in the law to act as a deterrent. The problem is more acute for earlier analogue phones than the more recent digital versions. Now the Dutch telephone authority has developed a technology which it suggests is one way to solve the problem. The Anglo Dutch computer services company CMG has recently installed the system in Scandinavia where the mobile phone systems are linked. In the UK and Scandinavia, it seems that mobile phones are recognised by a registration number rather than an electronic identity check. The essential difficulty is that there are perfectly good reasons why a mobile phone may need to be programmed with a new registration so the manufacturers leave open an electronic channel to the heart of the system. Fraudsters take advantage of this channel to create 'clones' of existing phones. The genuine subscriber only realises what is going on when a huge bill arrives. The operator closes down both genuine phone and clone but by then, of course, the fraudster has moved on. The Dutch solution makes use of secret keys stored both in the phone - either a microchip or smart card - and in the local exchange. A system of linked computers manages the distribution of the keys. If an exchange identifies a phone as genuine, it allows the call; otherwise use of the phone is blocked. If the subscriber is 'roaming' or using the phone outside the local exchange area, key information is transmitted over the network to identify the phone.</p>

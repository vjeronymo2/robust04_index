			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KEATING QUITS AFTER STINGING LEGAL SETBACKS;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: THE FORMER AMERICAN CONTINENTAL CORP. CHIEF WILL CONCENTRATE ON HIS  OWN DEFENSE. LAWYERS, ACCOUNTANTS AND EVEN ECONOMISTS INVOLVED IN THE THRIFT  DEBACLE FACE NEW SCRUTINY.  </P> <P> Charles H. Keating Jr., a central figure in the nation's savings and loan  scandal, announced Friday that he resigned as chairman and chief executive of  American Continental Corp., the Phoenix development company he formed in the  1970s.  </P> <P> The resignation comes on the heels of recent stinging court setbacks for  Keating, including a decision Thursday by U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin  in Washington that upheld the government's seizure of Lincoln Savings &amp;  Loan last year. Lincoln Savings had been owned by American Continental.  </P> <P> American's other officers and directors resigned with Keating.  </P> <P> "The company no longer has any officers and directors," said James Fedder, an  outside attorney for American Continental, which has been operating in  bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> A statement from Keating, issued by Chicago attorney Stephen C. Neal, indicated  that his move was sparked by Sporkin's ruling, which effectively cut short the  66-year-old financier's effort to regain control of Lincoln. American  Continental bought the thrift in 1984 for $51 million.  </P> <P> "It has become clear that my client must now concentrate all his energy on  aggressively defending the legal charges against him," Neal said. Federal  banking regulators have filed civil racketeering charges against Keating for  the way he ran Lincoln.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, federal regulators Friday promised intensified enforcement action  against lawyers, accountants, appraisers and other professionals who  contributed to the collapse of savings and loan associations across the  country.  </P> <P> "No more vital question could be posed . . . (than) where were the  professionals?" Harris Weinstein, chief counsel for the Office of Thrift  Supervision, said at a news conference.  </P> <P> OTS officials said their efforts to punish the misdeeds of professionals were  given a big boost by Sporkin's ruling. In denying Keating's efforts, Sporkin  complained that lawyers and accountants approved numerous "clearly improper  transactions" that contributed to Lincoln's $2-billion collapse.  </P> <P> Although the ruling applies strictly to Lincoln, OTS officials believe that the  scathing criticism by Sporkin, a respected jurist and former enforcement chief  of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will influence the legal and  regulatory climate.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased Judge Sporkin has identified an area which has concerned me  since the day I walked into this job," said OTS Director T. Timothy Ryan Jr.  </P> <P> Sporkin, he said, "states our view, which you will see reflected in enforcement  actions."  </P> <P> OTS officials said the agency is conducting many detailed investigations that  could lead to substantial fines or the banning of culpable lawyers and  accountants from representing S&amp;Ls before the regulatory agency.  </P> <P> Other federal agencies have filed suits seeking financial damages from lawyers  and accountants who represented S&amp;Ls that collapsed into insolvency and  were seized by the federal government.  </P> <P> But the OTS could go significantly further in punishing professional misdeeds.  It could act to bar individuals or groups from representing any federally  insured thrift.  </P> <P> The professionals -- lawyers, accountants, appraisers and economists -- must  share significant blame "in a great many thrift failures," Weinstein said. "We  expect to move against those professionals in a vigorous way."  </P> <P> Weinstein declined to discuss whether OTS is considering action against lawyers  and accountants involved with Lincoln. But he said Keating, chairman of  Lincoln's parent firm, "and his colleagues with the cooperation and assistance  of their service providers, abused depositors and the American taxpayers to the  tune of tens of millions of dollars."  </P> <P> Weinstein said professionals played an important role in Lincoln's misdeeds:  Accountants treated sham transactions as real sales, and lawyers threatened  personal damage suits against federal regulatory officials to inhibit them from  taking action against the troubled S&amp;L.  </P> <P> "In this case, what was done couldn't have been done without the help of the  professionals," Weinstein said. "Highly sophisticated transactions are very  unlikely to be done without the assistance of professionals."  </P> <P> Weinstein added economists to the list of professionals who contributed to  thrift problems. In some cases, he said, economists advised thrift managers on  highly sophisticated, highly risky methods of computerized securities trading.  The economists could be held accountable if they failed to disclose the true  extent of the risk, he said.  </P> <P> The collapse of Lincoln, which was burdened by a portfolio of bad real estate  investments, will ultimately cost taxpayers $2 billion. The figure includes  expenses associated with paying off depositors, whose accounts are insured up  to $100,000, and selling unprofitable assets.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Sporkin said the government was justified in its seizure of  Lincoln last year and rejected Keating's challenge of the takeover. He said  Keating and other top executives "abused their positions" through behavior that  "amounted to a looting of Lincoln."  </P> <P> Sporkin's ruling Thursday was the second court setback for Keating in two days.  On Wednesday, a federal judge partially froze Keating's assets and required him  to disclose his personal finances to government regulators within five days.  Keating, reportedly worth $39 million in 1987, now claims that he is broke.  </P></p>

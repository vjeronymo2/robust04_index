			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sorting out problems at Home - Trygg-Hansa has a thorn in its US side When Mr Lars Thunell took over as chief executive of Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish insurer, three weeks ago, he knew his priority would be sorting out the group's troubled relationship with its loss-making US associate, Home Holdings. What he did not know was how quickly those problems were to intensify. Home's share price more than halved between November 4 and November 17, and last week the group's senior debt was downgraded by Moody's. Trygg's own share price fell 8 per cent last week. Trygg-Hansa bought into Home, a company more than twice its size, in 1991 to help it become one of the world's leading industrial and commercial insurance groups. The Swedish group holds 64.5 per cent of Home's capital and 47.2 per cent of its votes. Home is one of the largest US property and casualty insurers, with 1993 gross premiums of Dollars 2.42bn. Professional liability is a particular speciality, and the group ranks as the market leader in insurance for lawyers. The US group has run into deep problems, the chief of which has been its exposure to long-tail environmental and professional liability claims. These have forced it to strengthen its reserves by Dollars 465m over the past two years. Its difficulties this year have been compounded by high leverage, rising US interest rates, intensifying competitive pressures, and earthquake and cold-weather losses. Nine-month figures from Home and Trygg reflect the impact. Home suffered a Dollars 131m loss for the period, after reserve-strengthening of Dollars 175m, and Trygg was hit by SKr1.4bn (Dollars 190.9m) in Home-related losses, dragging it to an overall deficit of SKr1.76bn. Ideally, Trygg would like to be rid of Home, or at the very least, substantially reduce its ownership. Mr Thunell says Trygg should concentrate on what it does best - that is, its successful life and non-life business in Sweden. This differs from the internationalist approach of his predecessor, Mr Bjorn Sprangare, who was forced to quit the company during the summer, partly because of the problems at Home. However, untangling itself from Home is not proving easy. Last December, Home launched an initial public offering aimed at reducing its leverage and cutting Trygg's ownership sharply. The offer, however, raised less than half the Dollars 355m originally sought and Trygg was left with a far higher stake in the company than it wanted. Since then, it has tried to find a partner willing to take some of Home off its hands, but the search has proved fruitless. The problems have been crystallised by Home's need to strengthen its balance sheet following its latest reserve-strengthening. It wants to raise Dollars 250m in new capital through an equity or debt issue, or a bank credit. Trygg has also said it is willing to convert some or all of a Dollars 170m loan to Home to equity. The trouble is that the collapse in Home's share price - down to Dollars 4.25 early yesterday from a listing price last December of Dollars 17 - and the Moody's downgrading have made the refinancing task more difficult. Moody's said its decision to cut Home's senior debt rating to Ba2 from Baa3 reflected 'continued adverse loss development in Home's long-tail lines of business, such as professional liability, and from environmental, asbestos, and breast implant litigation'. It also warned that Home might have to strengthen its reserves still further. This leaves Trygg with a dilemma. If Home cannot refinance itself any other way, does it bail out its US associate in the hope that the group's performance picks up and it can sell out at an acceptable price in the long term? Or does it reduce its commitment and leave the Home to sort out its own affairs? There are other possible solutions, including a sale by Home of some of its operations. Trygg executives say the worst-case scenario would be for Trygg to write off its entire investment in Home, a move which would reduce Trygg's solvency ratio to around 60 per cent from 132 per cent. 'We have no more obligations apart from some minor reinsurance commitments,' said Trygg. The current value of Home's equity in Trygg's books is SKr2.16bn and the debt SKr1.33bn. Analysts, however, warn that if Trygg does try to walk away, it could face lawsuits from disgruntled policyholders and shareholders. The situation is going to require all of Mr Thunell's expertise in crisis management - expertise gleaned while he was president of Securum, the asset management group set up last year to handle the failed loans of Nordbanken, the biggest casualty of Sweden's 1992 banking crisis. Mr Thunell knows Trygg can ill-afford another blow to its reputation after the huge losses it suffered following the collapse of Gota AB and Svenska Kredit in 1992. He also knows Trygg cannot afford the distraction of Home when it needs to concentrate on the Swedish domestic market, where competition is intensifying.</p>

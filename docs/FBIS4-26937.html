			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Zhongyu (3769 1813 4416), minister of the State </F> Economic and Trade Commission: "Unswervingly Carry Out  Enterprise Reform"]    [Text] The main content of the present reform is  continued implementation of the "Regulations"; clear definition  of the ownership of the property rights of enterprises;  establishment of a system of modern enterprises with a perfect  legal person system as the basis, limited liability as the  feature, and companies as the main form; and strengthen  enterprise legislation    The 14th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party  set  forth the goal of establishing a socialist market economic  structure. This has attracted wide attention in the world. The  nucleus of China's reform of its economic system is the reform  of enterprises. Where shall Chinese enterprises, especially  state-owned enterprises, go? This is an issue that the people  are most concerned about. China's socialist market economic  structure is a new system combined with the basic socialist  system. It is suited to China's national conditions and is  conducive to the development of its productive forces. In  reforming China's state-owned enterprises we should consistently  adhere to the principle of taking public ownership as the main  body and developing other sectors of the economy at the same  time. Therefore, whether at present or in the future, China's  state-owned enterprises cannot take the road of privatization.  In the country as a whole, the position and role of the  state-owned economy cannot be replaced by any other economic  sector, nor will there be major changes in the overall setup.  In carrying out enterprise reform we should look for a way to  speed up development of enterprises and an effective form of  public ownership, with the premise of adhering it.    China's large and medium state-owned enterprises always take  an important position in the national economy. Since 1978,  although the world economy has been increasing slowly, China's  GNP has been growing at a rate of 9 1.326369e-315very year, and the output  value of state-owned enterprises has been increasing at a rate  of 8 1.326369e-315ach year. In 1992, of all industrial enterprises,  state-owned enterprises were only 0.162000060100f the total, but their  production value accounted for 36.672000060100f the total, and the  profit and taxes they handed to the state accounted for 51.62000060100f  the total. This shows that the state-owned large and medium  enterprises are the mainstay of the national economy. The  reform of state-owned enterprises is the basis for establishing  the system of socialist market economy.    In the past decade and more, the reform of enterprises,  especially state-owned enterprises, has been the key to China's  economic restructuring. Ever since the 4th plenary session of  the 12th National Congress of the CPC in 1984, we have realized  that the reform of state-owned enterprises is the most important  and essential issue of the reform of the entire economic  structure, and have adopted a series of policies and measures  for the reform of state-owned enterprises. Last year, the  question of the establishment of a basic framework for a  socialist market economy was raised at the 3rd plenary session  of the 14th National Congress of the CPC. The session also  clearly pointed out that we should change the operational system  of state-owned enterprises, establish a modern enterprise  system, and continuously deepen reform of state-owned  enterprises. This has made us deeply aware that enterprises are  the basic economic units and the main elements for competition  in the market. To confirm the principal position of enterprises  and to remold the micro-basis of the market economy are the  major topics in the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure.    The strategic concepts for the reform of Chinese enterprises  are: Centering on the general goal of establishing a socialist  market economic structure, strengthen enterprise legislation to  move enterprise reform onto a legal track; centering on reform  of property rights of state-owned enterprises, further improve  the legal entity system; with the establishment of a system of  modern enterprises as a basic direction, further change  enterprise operational mechanisms; and closely combine  enterprise reform, establishment of a market system, reform of  the macro economic management system, and establishment of a  social security system to create a good environment for  deepening enterprise reform. The fundamental purpose of  enterprise reform is to strengthen the vitality of enterprises  and to increase, to the greatest extent, the economic efficiency  of enterprises.    The main elements of the reform of China's enterprises are:    1. At present, all state-owned enterprises should continue  to implement the "Regulations Governing the Change of Enterprise  Operational Mechanism" and the "Regulations Concerning the  Supervision and Control of the Assets of State-Owned  Enterprises," which are to be issued soon; carry out in a  planned way the work of reappraising the stocks and assets of  enterprises, defining property rights, clearing up debts,  evaluating assets, and setting up standard internal management  structures; and do a good job of experiments in establishing a  system of modern enterprises, accumulating experience, creating  good conditions, and gradually popularizing it.    2. Clearly define the property rights of enterprises.  There are two problems which should be solved well: 1) The  separation of the ownership of assets from the legal person's  rights to enterprise property to enable them to become  independent of government administration, release the state from  undertaking unlimited responsibility toward enterprises, and  turn state-owned enterprises into commodity producers and  dealers owning all legal property and independently undertaking  business activities. 2) Solving well the relationship between  property rights and managerial rights within an enterprise. The  representative of the legal person of an enterprise should truly  give managerial rights to the manager, with the manager only  reporting to the legal person of the enterprise and having  independent managerial rights to turn the enterprise into an  independent legal entity.    3. Establish a system of modern enterprises with a perfect  legal person system as the basis, limited responsibility as the  feature, and company as the main form. The organizational forms  of enterprises are not classified according to the nature of  ownership but by the organizational form of property and the  legal responsibility they undertake. Promoting the system of  modern enterprises in state-owned enterprises is of major  significance in changing operational systems, raising managerial  and competitive abilities, and bringing their lead in the  national economy into full play. According to China's practical  conditions, adopting the corporate system for state-owned  enterprises is a beneficial experiment in establishing a modern  enterprise system. Through the experiment in limited liability  and joint-stock companies in recent years, we have seen the good  points of enterprises having a corporate form. But new  contradictions have arisen in these experiments, which tell us  that it is quite difficult to turn enterprises into ones having  a corporate form. Thus, we should not institute changes too  widely or for all enterprises, but should gradually, step by  step, promote it. Therefore, we experiment on a portion of the  large and medium state-owned enterprises to practice a modern  enterprise system, and at the same time standardize existing  companies with limited liability and joint-stock companies  according to corporate law.    4. Strengthen legislation on enterprises. Laws and  regulations concerning the market, except for the already  promulgated corporate law, are now in preparation. These laws  and regulations include those concerning single-investor  enterprises, partnerships, and cooperative share companies.  Other laws for standardizing the market and perfecting social  security are also in preparation, such as the law against  monopoly, and commercial act, contract, labor, insurance, and  social security laws. So that the laws can be smoothly  implemented and actually followed, further efforts should be  made to enforce the execution and jurisdiction of the laws.    5. Clearly define the relationship between the government  and enterprises, and conscientiously change the function of  government. The government executes its administration of the  national economy mainly by economic and legal means, aided by  some necessary administrative means. Generally, the government  undertakes the functions of macroeconomic regulation and  control, overall coordination, and administration of society,  rather than directly interfering with the production and  management of enterprises.    6. Current state-owned enterprises will be administrated or  reformed according to their classifications. Enterprises which  have something to do with state security, national defense,  sophisticated sciences and technology, and some special trades,  and enterprises which manufacture special products, will still  have the state-owned enterprise form and can be converted into  solely state-funded companies. Large and medium enterprises  which are strongly competitive can gradually develop into  enterprises in the form of stock companies controlled by the  state. Small state-owned enterprises can be turned into  companies with limited liability or cooperative share companies;  some can be contracted or leased and some can be sold at auction.    7. Speed up the structural adjustment of enterprises. With  regard to the many old state-owned enterprises whose product  structures are irrational, economic results are not good, and  debts are high, the state needs to make fairly major structural  changes. For instance, all sorts of methods, such as merging,  liquidation, joint ventures, peeling off, and reorganization,  will be used to make the structure of enterprises more rational.  This year, the state plans to gain experience through  experiments with the liquidation of enterprises and making a  major breakthrough in the standardization of enterprise  liquidation.    8. Create a better environment for the reform of  enterprises. We must enthusiastically do a good job in reform of  the fiscal and tax, banking, investment, and foreign trade  systems, set up and perfect market and social security systems,  do our best to nurture and bring up a contingent of  high-quality, professional entrepreneurs to lay social and  economic foundations for the development of enterprises.    9. Encourage all sectors of the economy to set up and run  single-investor enterprises, partnership businesses, cooperative  share companies, and corporations in accordance with relevant  state policies and regulations, and encourage the promotion of  the modern enterprise system in foreign-invested, township and  town, and urban collective enterprises where conditions are ripe.    The situation of the reform of Chinese enterprises is good,  and opportunities for reform are hard to come by. Though there  are difficulties and problems, they are what all enterprises  meet in their development. So long as we fully foresee the  difficulties, carefully design our reform plans, and  consistently carry out the reform, we will be certain to reach  our goal.</p>

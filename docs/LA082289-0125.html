			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Jim Bakker's federal trial opened in Charlotte, N.C., with the selection of a  12-member jury and six alternates to hear charges that the television  evangelist cheated followers out of $4 million so he could afford an expensive  life style. "Our faith is in God," Bakker proclaimed as he strode into the U.S.  District Courthouse. While jury selection was getting under way in the  courtroom, Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, went on television to tearfully  ask viewers of the "Jim and Tammy Show" to send money and pray for her husband.  Bakker, who has pleaded innocent, is charged with eight counts of mail fraud,  15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.  </P></p>

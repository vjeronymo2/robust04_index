			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Economic slowdown fears hit equities EVIDENCE that the economic recovery in the UK may be running out of steam, and persistent worries that the US economy has begun to falter, triggered another sharp sell-off of the FT-SE futures and continued to drive London's equity market lower at the start of the new two-week trading account yesterday. The FT-SE 100 Index ended the session only marginally above the day's lowest level, a net 19.2 weaker at 2,838.5, the bottom end of its recent perceived trading range. However, senior traders in London were reluctant to read too much into what was generally agreed to be a dismal showing by a London market unsettled by Wall Street's unhappy performance last Friday and the absence of any lead from the US yesterday, markets being closed for the Independence Day holiday. Dealers also pointed out that fund managers would be reluctant to adopt aggressive positions in either direction ahead of tomorrow's G7 meeting. Still unsettled by the late sell-off in equities last week, the FT-SE 100-share index opened in negative territory and continued to lose ground throughout the rest of a difficult trading session, led down by concerted selling efforts in the futures market. The Footsie began some four points easier and moved progressively lower to reach 2,835.8 during the early afternoon, before embarking on a half-hearted rally which saw the index close within three points of the day's low. Sentiment in the market was damaged from the outset with the latest report from the Institute of Directors saying that business confidence had fallen for the first time since the UK withdrew from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. More bad news for the market came with the latest economic data showing a lower than expected increase in consumer credit during May. Money supply figures for June showing a year-on-year rise in MO of 4.6 per cent were slightly below estimates. With the futures market still thoroughly depressed and under sustained pressure from the abritrageurs, who continued to sell the cash market aggressively and cover in the futures, the FT-SE 100 was left to find a trading level. Dealers said there was widespread concern about the stability of international bond markets following last week's worrying economic data from the US, which revealed a marked slowing in non-farm payrolls. 'If gilts and bonds do not fall out of bed, then we will be OK, but if not, then it looks tricky,' was the view of a senior London marketmaker. The lack of a lead from the US, plus the market's overall caution, saw turnover in equities fall to the lowest levels for many weeks. Volume totalled a meagre 384m shares, made up of 151m FT-SE 100 shares and 232.9m non-Footsie stocks, with the figures confirming despairing comments on the paucity of activity from market traders. Brokers said yesterday's customer business would fall short of the Pounds 1bn level, which has been breached on the downside on only a handful of occasions this year. The water issues, roughly handled in recent sessions, was one of the more resilient areas of the market, as were bank shares. But food retailing stocks continued to suffer from the impact of last week's remarks made by Asda.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier  Tokyo Sexwale today said the South African Police Service's  negative image has to change urgently. He and members of the  provincial legislature addressed the police in the region.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Veronica Van der  Westhuizen]  Throughout the years policemen have been regarded as thugs by  the majority of South Africans due to the political situation in  the country. Mr. Sexwale said that policemen had been used by  politicians to enforce unpopular laws such as the Group Areas  Act and the Immorality Act. He today asked the police to leave  politics in the hands of the government and to make the  protection of the public its primary task.    [Sexwale, in English] Let us strategize together. Let us  begin to find ways of addressing all the problems that we have  together. I must tell you, you are some of the most underpaid  people in this country [applause].    [Van der Westhuizen] Mr. Sexwale said the PWV's executive  council will support the police in all respects so that it can  regain lost respectability in the region. He spoke out against  attacks on policemen.    [Sexwale] We won't stand back to see policemen being killed  in the street -- honest, loyal people who are prepared to uphold  the law as professional police.    [Van der Westhuizen] Mr. Sexwale appealed to policemen, and  to those who, as he put it, did not deserve to wear a blue  uniform, to create a police service that will be trusted and  respected.

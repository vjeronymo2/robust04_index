			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / People: A team to get Ford out of reverse Tony Brigden, 50, currently director of parts and service operations, has been given the tough task of trying to reverse Ford's slumping sales fortunes in the UK. Brigden's is one of several new appointments Ford of Britain announced in its restructuring of senior sales management yesterday. Once the unchallenged market leader with a share of 30 per cent, Ford's share is now in the low 20s and it is becoming hard-pressed to stay ahead of second-placed Vauxhall. Brigden is to take over from Colin Breathwick, currently fleet sales director, who takes up the new appointment of director, retail strategy, on August 1. Reporting directly to chairman and managing director Ian McAllister, Breathwick, 49, will be responsible for analysing Ford's existing approaches to the marketplace. Brigden is to be succeeded in parts and service by Phil Cazaly, 45, currently director of sales and service operations at Ford of Europe, based in Germany. Ford believes a 'cultural change' is taking place in customer attitudes towards the car; during the 1990s car ownership will become less important to motorists, who will be more concerned with 'simply having access' to cars through a variety of finance or leasing schemes. ***** Nigel Blythe-Tinker has been appointed company secretary of SUTER, in succession to Antony Paton Walsh who is retiring early because of ill health. ***** Michael Spedding, formerly group financial controller of MAI, has been appointed finance director of MAI RESEARCH. ***** Jonathan Fox, previously personnel director at Asda, has been appointed human resources director at HICKSON INTERNATIONAL. ***** Jonathan Sayeed, former Member of Parliament for Bristol East who lost his seat at the general election, has been appointed executive chairman of RANELAGH, a public and parliamentary affairs consultancy. ***** John Harounoff, head of corporate affairs at Ladbroke, died on July 19.</p>

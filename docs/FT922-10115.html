			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Sport: Two clubs who have cracked their codes - Rugby THERE ARE not many days when I am torn between watching rugby union or rugby league but today is one of them. This afternoon I could see the two outstanding teams at their respective codes in action a few miles from one another: Bath at Twickenham, where they will try to win the rugby union Pilkington Cup a week after they wrapped up the league; and Wigan at Wembley, where they will do the double if they defeat Castleford in the Silk Cut Challenge Cup, having already won the championship. Bath and Wigan are 250 miles apart yet joined by their outstanding success in recent years at the two codes of the oval ball game. Bath have been the dominant union club in England since the election before the election before last. This is their seventh Cup final; they have won the previous six. They have won the league title three times. Wigan have found success at rugby league more recently. At the start of the 1980s they were in division two and facing bankruptcy. Such is their transformation that if they win today it will be the third year in a row that they have collected both of League's top prizes the Challenge Cup and the Stones Bitter Championship: indeed, it will be their fifth successive Challenge Cup. The success of Bath and Wigan is often attributed to players and officials. Invariably, however, there is one man who is oiling the wheels, whose thinking sets the patterns, who can be regarded as the moving force of the club. At Bath it is Jack Rowell, the club's chief coach, who was recently appointed coach of England's B squad. Rowell commands respect from his players while retaining his distance from them. 'An hour with him is worth five with anyone else,' a supporter said. Why? 'He talks such good sense. He has one of the quickest minds I have ever come across.' Rowell's work at Bath is in his free time, unpaid and voluntary. Rugby union is an amateur game but it has not stopped him bringing the management techniques and skill he employs as chief executive of Golden Wonder Foods to the Recreation Field. He works tirelessly with his players, improving their individual skills, making them more rounded players and thereby of more use to Bath, making them what Wigan's chairman refers to as the complete product. Take Jim Fallon as an example. At Bath he has matured into one of the finest left wings in the country, fast and, at nearly 15 stone, strong enough to barrel his way past others. Victor Ubogu, the prop, is another who has been brought on. As for Ben Clarke, the No 8 who joined from Saracens, he may now be the best No 8 in English rugby. Waiting in the wings are young men like John Mallett, the prop, and Audley Lumsden at full back. One of the reasons for Rowell's success as a businessman is his success with people. He is a natural pedagogue, a born teacher and in the past 15 years at Bath he has worked the oracle with successive captains, from Roger Spurrell to Simon Halliday and now Stuart Barnes. The man behind Wigan's rise achieved nothing as a player. For Maurice Lindsay, Wigan was a cause he wanted to take up. He had the money following the sale of his bookmaking business and the club was ready for a dose of his cheerful common and financial sense and commitment. Ring Wigan in the early evening after the office staff have gone and it is likely to be Lindsay who answers the telephone. He is running a multi-million pound business. The players earn an average of Pounds 90,000; the minimum is Pounds 45,000. Including bonuses, the players are expected to receive nearly Pounds 2m this season. To meet this bill and other costs, an income of Pounds 3m is needed. Norweb (the North West Electricity Board) is the club's main sponsor. Wigan were always well-supported. Their average gate is more than 15,000, twice as many as any other League club except Leeds and an astonishing tribute to the fans and to the players. Thus match receipts make a significant contribution towards the annual running costs of the club, as do a nightclub, smaller sponsors and a shop selling associated products. One of Lindsay's shrewdest decisions was to bring first the New Zealander Graham Lowe and now John Monie from Australia as coaches. These two men were at the cutting edge of the game in the Antipodes. Their success with Wigan has tilted the balance of power towards northern Europe. In the vocational aspect of his work, Monie echoes Rowell. 'I try to educate players to the game, to understand themselves and their team mates. I'd like to think that when I leave here they should all know enough to go on and become coaches.' At Bath, Rowell has developed a blueprint that has withstood the scrutiny and copying of coaching administrators at other clubs, such as Barry Corless at Northampton. 'Orrell are a match for us in commitment, Northampton in the way they have got the club organised,' says Stuart Barnes, Bath's captain. 'But at the moment and for the foreseeable future we have that ruthless edge in will and determination.' There is no sign of this waning. They have lost only two league matches at home since the league's inception. For that matter, Wigan are in no danger of losing their dominance in rugby league. Their crushing victory over Warrington last Sunday was their 22nd victory in a row. Thirteen of their players will tour Australasia with Great Britain this summer, the highest total ever from one club. Wigan have swept every trophy except for the Premier trophy, and they could win that this year. The double was rare enough until they first did it two seasons ago. A treble would be unheard of, fantastic. But then Wigan are just that, fantastic. Rugby Union could learn a lot from them.</p>

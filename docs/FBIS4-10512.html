			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pedro de Camargo Neto: "A Deceitful GATT Deal"] </F>   [Text] The new International Commerce Agreement will be  signed in Marrakesh. It is the result of the so-called Uruguay  Round of talks held within GATT. What enthusiasm should  Brazilian farmers have about the new agreement?    The way in which the agreement was negotiated cannot be  ignored. Negotiations violated a basic principle, that of  multilateral action. The position of weak countries was for the  most part ignored. Stronger countries made it clear that orders  come from those who have power. Orders are obeyed by  common-sense countries. The authoritarianism adopted by the  United States and the EU jeopardized the principle of  negotiation that should be observed by all commercial rules. It  is not a matter of claiming that we can have the same weight.  But it is necessary to clearly admit that most countries had  limited participation. We are actually in a submissive position,  and recognition of this situation will make it possible for the  Brazilian economy to find its appropriate place in international  commerce.    The Uruguay Round began with the revolutionary proposal to  eliminate subsidies for agriculture. The challenge represented  by the destruction of this economic "barrier" was exciting. Time  showed the change in the U.S. position against subsidies and for  free trade. For their part, weak countries lacked cohesion for  eliminating the "barrier." In the end it was clear that the  "barrier" is not a priority. The EU is facing problems in its  own structure. It has very close neighbors that might cause more  serious problems in the future. The United States is concerned  about building a "dike," not about eliminating the "barrier."  Agricultural subsidies were postponed for another occasion.    It would be very difficult to hail the 21 percent reduction  of subsidies on farm exports over the next six years. Subsidies  on exports have nothing to do with food insurance [seguranca  alimentar]. Nor do they have anything to do with the well-being  of U.S. or European farmers. They do not protect less  competitive farm sectors. They represent a simple and cheap way  of making internal adjustments -- unfortunately -- at the  expense of others.    Food support and food insurance policies generate a  production surplus. This surplus, however, can be managed  internally. The complexity of stronger countries' farm policy is  such that it allows for adjusting production without a  noticeable drop in farmers' income and without subsidizing  exports. Doing it on the international market, however, is  simpler and easier. This way, internal policy affairs are  adjusted by throwing out the economic waste of the production  surplus. They destroy international market prices by adjusting  their internal policy. What is simple and cheap for the strong  harms the agriculture of the weak.    Subsidies on exports cannot be justified. It is actually a  79  percent injustice. It means that because of a solution that is  simpler and more economic for the strong, a vast part of the  world will still have to wait perhaps six years to grow. We  obtained very little, if anything at all. We can resign  ourselves to the room we have. We should sign the agreement  because not doing so might be even worse. But hailing this would  be too much.</p>

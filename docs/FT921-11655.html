			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown criticises Labour-Tory tax conflict MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liberal Democrat leader, dismissed as 'irresponsible' the Labour and Tory clashes over taxation and instead set out how the end of the Cold War should lead to lower UK defence spending and restructuring of the United Nations, Ralph Atkins writes. Sticking to his pledge not to be distracted from his own agenda for campaigning - even it it means taking a lower profile - Mr Ashdown called on Mr John Major to play a constructive role in creating a 'new world order'. Mr Ashdown criticised Mr Major for ruling out this week an increase in VAT, saying such firm commitments on fiscal policy limited options within the European exchange rate mechanism. Anybody who promised never to put up taxes was 'either a fool or a fibber,' he said. Mr Ashdown also called for the UN security council to be restructured - possibly with Britain or France replaced as permanent members by the European Community.</p>

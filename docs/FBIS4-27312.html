			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of UN Security Council President on Replacement </F> of Fuel Rods Refuted" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  today published a statement refuting the statement of the  president of the Security Council of the United Nations decrying  the DPRK over the replacement of fuel rods at a reactor.    Follows the full text of the statement:    The United Nations Security Council, on May 30, according to  a scenario which had been worked out by some member states,  published a statement of its president groundlessly slandering  the DPRK and containing the unreasonable claim that the fuel  rods must be replaced strictly in compliance with the practical  demands of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the  opportunity of selected separation and preservation of fuel rods  might be lost. It is entirely wrong for the Security Council  to have discussed the question of the DPRK on the basis of the  wrong judgment made by the secretariat of the agency without any  justifiable reason.    It was only a few days ago that negotiations on the  refueling  of the 5 megawatt experimental atomic power station was held  between the DPRK and the agency.    The main question discussed at the negotiations was the  preservation of technical possibilities of future measurement of  replaced fuel rods and there was a sufficient debate on the  reasonableness of the method applied by the DPRK at present.    The agency said it would seriously study that method and the  two sides agreed to continue to discuss it in the future  negotiations.    And it was confirmed that none of the fuel rods replaced  this  time had been diverted to another purpose and, practically, the  whole course of current refueling is going on in the presence of  agency inspectors and under a strict control of inspection  cameras.    We must ask what justification the UN Security Council has  to  put the question of the DPRK on its agenda and discuss it now.    If things were to take a correct track, the Security Council  should have called in question not the DPRK, but some quarters  of the agency secretariat.    Before starting refueling, we had requested the agency  several times to take necessary measures such as its presence  and the removal of the seals. But it failed to send a group of  inspectors till refueling began, thus openly neglecting its duty  as an international organisation. This was what some quarters  of the secretariat did.    Even when we allowed "an additional inspection" which  alluded  to "an inspection left incomplete" at the time of the inspection  in March, they shunned it, thus intentionally ignoring the  statement of the president of the UN Security Council dated  March 31.    It was also the IAEA Secretariat that distorted the fact by  talking as if the negotiation had broken down and hurriedly  transferred the problem to the UN Security Council without a  clear explanation, categorically denying the method of the DPRK  even before the negotiating delegation of the IAEA which had  promised to study it arrived at the head office in Vienna.    This act was aimed at putting the DPRK in the "[word  indistinct]" by justifying their past behavior in concocting  "inconsistency" against the DPRK on the basis of false  information.    It is only too natural that DPRK which has engaged itself  only in peaceful nuclear activities as a dignified independent,  sovereign state will not yield to such unreasonable act of the  IAEA Secretariat and allow itself to be treated as an "offender."    So, the UN Security Council, instead of finding fault with  the DPRK, should have taken issue with some officials of the  IAEA Secretariat who laid hurdles in the way of the DPRK's  peaceful nuclear activities, framed a sinister political  intrigue to shift the blame on to the DPRK and transferred the  problem to the United Nations.    It is also self-contradictory that the presidential  statement  of the UN Security Council unreasonably urged the DPRK to allow  selected separation and preservation of fuel rods and  preservation of the possibility of future measurement.    Since we are in a unique status after a temporary suspension  of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from the NPT  [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], it is clear that we cannot  accept such routine and ad hoc inspection as selected  preservation of fuel rods. A full understanding of this was  reached at the recent negotiations with the IAEA.    Although we are refueling the reactor in a unique status, we  are doing the utmost to show the transparency of our nuclear  activities.    The refueling is taking place in such a manner as to fully  preserve the technical possibility of measuring the fuel rods as  requested by the IAEA when our unique status comes to an end.    This is a most scientific and realistic method invented by  our scientists and facility operators with a high sense on  cooperation, motivated by their consistent position to show the  uprightness of the nuclear activities. Its feasibility has  fully been proved through experiments.    If this method of our style is applied, it will be possible  to reproduce the channel and order of any fuel rods and measure  them correctly in the future.    At the recent negotiations in Pyongyang, we gave the IAEA  side a full explanation of our-style method concerning the  replacement of fuel rods and suggested with a good intention  that if there were any more questions to be discussed,  negotiations should be held any time.    There have been attempts these days to create the "urgency"  of the situation by alleging that the pace of the refueling is  too fast. Since it is part of the pure peaceful nuclear  activities and technical possibilities for ensuring the  continuity of safeguards and measuring fuel rods in the future  are fully guaranteed, there is no ground for taking issue with  the speed of refueling.    It was necessary to test the maximum efficiency of the  refueling machine that our refueling progressed at a rather fast  speed some time ago. This was also a normal course of the  peaceful nuclear activities. So, this is hardly a matter for  surprise.    Such being a case, at a time when everything is progressing  on a normal track, the UN Security Council discussed the biased  report submitted by some officials of the IAEA Secretariat  without any examination and hurriedly adopted a presidential  statement. It is really hard to understand.    This was because they were too dull to sense the reality or  thy were affected by some sinister political background.    If the UN Security Council, for this matter, is  disgracefully  charged with being manipulated by some specified member nations  while ignoring its noble mission to be responsible for world  peace and security, it will be a shame to history.    Originally, the foundation of the existence of an  international organisation is impartiality.    If the IAEA Secretariat and the UN Security Council, bereft  of impartiality, insist on pressure with an unreasonable  intention [words indistinct] feel any need to be restricted by  such pressure.    It is more than intolerable that we have suffered from big  obstacles in our peaceful nuclear activities, restricted by the  unilateral demand of the IAEA. In case pressure is put on us  again, we will no longer fall a victim to the unreasonable  demand but will have to go our own way, unhindered by anything.    This is the unshakable will of the Korean people, who regard  independence as their life and blood.    If some officials of the IAEA Secretariat declare that the  technical possibilities of the future measurement of fuel rods  were gone or the UN Security Council put pressure on the DPRK,  threatening "sanctions" under that pretext, we cannot but take  decisive countermeasures, rather freeing ourselves from such  unreasonable restrictions than suffering from them, and we will  be left with no other choice but to [word indistinct] over to  the continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities. We  will respond any time with utmost sincerity to the intention to  deal with the issue in a fair way and resolve it in a peaceful  way through dialogue. But we will counter without slightest  compromise any intention to unjustifiably put pressure on us,  ignoring our sovereignty, if but a little.</p>

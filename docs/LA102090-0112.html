			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSED DRUG-TESTING PLAN RAISES CONCERN  </P> <P> Police chiefs in Orange County are girding for some resistance to a plan that  asks each of the county's law enforcement agencies, including the Sheriff's  Department, to establish drug-testing programs for their departments by the end  of next year.  </P> <P> Robert MacLeod, general manager of the Orange County Deputy Sheriff's Assn.,  said members are already questioning motivations for the policy and whether  safeguards will be included to protect against possible abuses.  </P> <P> "We have received some phone calls," said MacLeod, referring to members of the  county's largest law enforcement union. "They're expressing concerns. . . .  What kind of checks and balances will there be? What kind of substances will  they check for? Will it be merely illegal drugs or prescription drugs, too?  I've had three people call today asking about codeine -- a couple of guys said  they take it for bronchitis and were concerned about it."  </P> <P> Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell, president of the Orange County  Chiefs of Police and Sheriff's Assn. which announced the proposal Wednesday,  said the association has built in enough time to allow individual departments  to deal with concerns raised by police unions and employee groups.  </P> <P> "We do not want to have a policy to nail people," Purcell said. "These are our  employees we are talking about, not criminals. We've allowed some time because  we want to work with the police unions. Hopefully, we will be able to work out  the bugs."  </P> <P> Under the plan approved by the police chiefs and Sheriff Brad Gates, Purcell  said individual departments will have the freedom to deal with the kinds and  numbers of drugs to be screened and the disciplinary procedures to be followed.  The plans are expected to be formulated by Dec. 31, 1991.  </P> <P> Purcell said his association merely presented a model plan and some guidelines  to help individual departments along. That model includes testing provisions  for the presence of morphine, codeine, cocaine, amphetamines and marijuana. He  said those substances represented the most commonly abused drugs.  </P> <P> The model does not include testing for steroids or alcohol, but Purcell said  those substances and others could be included in a plan tailored for an  individual department.  </P> <P> Aside from the questions raised by officers, MacLeod said his police  association has not taken a formal position on the proposal. However, he said  it would be good to ensure that a certified laboratory in drug testing  procedures be retained to provide a safeguard against false positive readings.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Chief Joseph T. Molloy said he expects police unions to question  the integrity of any system implemented in police agencies in the county.  </P> <P> "Drug testing is not the issue here," Molloy said. "It is how we're going to  make this a reliable process. What kind of a process are we going to build in  for their protection? Some labor groups may have a problem with it."  </P> <P> Molloy said he had informed his department of 340 sworn officers about the  issue well before the police chiefs made their announcement Wednesday.  </P> <P> "This wasn't something that was a covert action," he said. "All of this may be  ambitious. Our guys have not reacted to it."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tony Marcano contributed to this report.  </P></p>

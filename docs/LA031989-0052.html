			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REDUCE FATS IN DIET  </P> <P> Those in the medical profession have failed to point out the most significant  fact concerning the specious campaign by the Omaha millionaire and his friends  in the soybean industry to pressure food processors into switching from  saturated to unsaturated fats ("Health Crusader Targets Nabisco in Latest  Battle Over Use of Tropical Oils," March 2), so I shall do so.  </P> <P> Numerous studies, dating back to the 1961 Wadsworth Veterans' Administration  Hospital study, have shown that substituting unsaturated fats for saturated  fats in the diet does indeed reduce mortality from heart disease but raises  mortality from cancer, so that the total death rate remains about the same.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most prudent course would be to reduce consumption of fats of all  types, as recommended by the National Research Council ("Council Urges Major  Changes for U.S. Diet") in the same issue of the newspaper.  </P> <P> STEVE VICTOR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  The writer is author of "The Lighthearted Vegetarian Gourmet Cookbook."  </P></p>

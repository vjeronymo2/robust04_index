			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Serco makes Pounds 9.4m and shares rise 117p Shares in Serco rose by 117p to Pounds 14.50 after the facilities and contract management group announced a proposed 4-for-1 scrip issue and a 31 per cent increase in profits. The pre-tax outcome rose from Pounds 7.21m to Pounds 9.42m in the year to December 31, while turnover increased by 25 per cent to Pounds 187m (Pounds 150m). Of this figure, 17.4 per cent came from established businesses and 7.5 per cent from acquisitions. Serco said its mainly public sector markets had continued to offer good opportunities throughout the year and the outlook was promising. The rate at which the group was winning new contracts indicated that it would continue to expand in 1994. Mr Richard White, managing director, was confident the pace of UK privatisation would increase. 'The push is there from the government and we see it as a big opportunity in the medium term.' Serco recently won the five-year, Pounds 66m contract to manage a new jail at Doncaster through Premier Prison Services, its 50/50 joint venture with Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, a US private prison operator. The prison will be the most complex to be run by the private sector, with convicted and remand prisoners, young offenders and high-security cases among its 771 inmates. Overseas work won by Serco includes looking after 17,000 parking meters in Hong Kong and winning a share of the management contract for Diego Garcia, the US naval base in the Indian Ocean. Earnings rose to 46.5p (37p) per share. A proposed final dividend of 11.7p makes an increased total for the year of 17p (14p). COMMENT A 9 per cent share price increase in an unsettled market was tribute to the City's growing enthusiasm for Serco, which since flotation in 1988 has increased its market value more than eightfold. One constraint on the shares has been limited liquidity, so the scrip issue certainly helped sentiment. The group sees plenty of opportunities, both in the UK and overseas, although analysts find it difficult to really understand the huge variety of activities in which Serco is involved. Assuming 25 per cent earnings growth this year, the shares are on a hefty prospective multiple of 25. After doubling in value since the beginning of last year, the shares look more than up with events.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, 16 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--With the  high-speed development of the economy in the special economic  zone, fake and shoddy commodities have become a public scourge  in Shenzhen.    It was the "International Day of the Rights and Interests of  Consumers" yesterday. Shenzhen's Industrial and Commercial  Bureau, Consumers' Committee, and some production enterprises  took to the streets and shopping arcades to publicize protection  for the rights and interests of consumers and ways to identify  fake and shoddy commodities.    The Tianhong Shopping Plaza was crowded with people.  Suddenly someone called out that "Chief Justice Bao [a strict  and impartial official from the Song Dynasty called Bao Zheng]  had come." People turned round and actually saw a dark-faced  "Chief Justice Bao" escorted by "Zhang Long" and "Zhao Hu." It  turned out that Shenzhen's New Century Drinking Water Science  and Technology Company Limited had adopted an original approach  and had invited some actors to play the parts of "Chief Justice  Bao" and his subordinates to act for the people and to strictly  enforce the law. The shoppers rushed headlong toward "Chief  Justice Bao" and complained to him about fake and shoddy  commodities.    According to the latest Shenzhen Consumer's Committee  statistics, 60 percent of the complaints were about fake and  shoddy commodities. Nearly all high-grade and brand-name  commodities in Shenzhen, no matter whether they were imported or  made in China, including watches, electrical appliances,  garments, foodstuffs, wines, cigarettes, leather shoes, leather  bags, and even "mouse detectors [shu biao qi 7857 2871 0892],"  which most people are not quite familiar with, had counterfeit  equivalents. "Chief Justice Bao" was invited to protect the  interests of the consumers and the publicity effects were quite  good. This shows the deep hatred of the consumers toward fake  and shoddy commodities.    It is learned that Shenzhen City will inspect all imported  foodstuffs with fixed packaging beginning 1 April and  anti-counterfeit signs will be stuck on qualified commodities  before they can be sold.    In Shenzhen, 97 activities have been conducted citywide to  crack down on fake and shoddy commodities beginning late  December last year. Over 5,650 shops and stalls have been  inspected, 522 cases of producing and selling fake and shoddy  commodities have been handled and the people involved punished,  the operation of 326 shops and plants has been suspended for  reorganization, 28 illegal plants have been banned, and more  than 23,000 counterfeit items, under 23 categories and amounting  to over 530,000 yuan, have been seized.</p>

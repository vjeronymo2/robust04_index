			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Letter: UK/US prices comparison suggests poor competition and excessive profits (2) Sir, At long last somebody is writing about the excessive profits that companies somewhere in the value chain are making at the UK's consumers expense ('The price is wrong', July 21). Having spent three weeks last Christmas in the US, I have been trying to understand what causes the difference and can only agree with your conclusions. Goods sourced from the far east as well as traditional English manufactured products such as Churches Shoes are dollar for pound in the US. The issue becomes more insulting when one compares goods in global chains such as Toys R Us where the same dollar to pound parity exists irrespective of where the goods were sourced; in particular, I am thinking of Lego (Denmark), Fisher Price (components manufactured in Mexico - self assembly) and Little Tykes (US). Product ranges that include baby equipment, clothes electronics, food, compact discs, jeans and Japanese cars all follow the dollar/pound parity. To me this suggests price fixing, as I can not believe that the structural characteristics of such diverse industries are identical. A good example that illustrates how companies push price parity is the Lands End direct mail operation that has recently opened up in the UK. Comparing its US catalogue prices with the equivalent catalogue UK prices, parity holds on most lines. Hugh Saddington, 2A Carrick Road, Curzon Park, Chester CH4 8AW</p>

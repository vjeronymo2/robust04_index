			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Intracom's Russian gamble pays off IN THE two years since Intracom, the Greek telecoms and information systems manufacturer, set up automated 'lotto' games in Russia, its blue and yellow kiosks have sprung up in more than 130 Russian cities. Olympic Lottery, a Dollars 15m (Pounds 10m) joint venture with the Russian Olympic Committee, was the first in a series of deals with state-controlled lottery and sports organisations through which Intracom aims to position itself as a telecoms supplier to eastern Europe. Next month the Romanian state lottery system will launch a lotto game designed and installed by Intracom, and by the end of the year similar games should be operating in Bulgaria, Ukraine and Moldova. Kazakhstan will follow in 1994. Mr Constantinos Antonopoulos of Intralot, the lottery subsidiary of Intracom, said: 'We have to take a flexible approach to this market because we can't compete with the international telecoms companies on large government contracts. But we have other projects (from rural telephone networks to information systems for banks) where negotiations are well advanced. In the meantime, we're traders as well.' Intracom, in which Ericsson of Sweden holds a minority stake, sets its initial investment in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at Dollars 70m. The joint ventures should start to show a profit within two years. Intralot spends part of its rouble income on consumer goods - from cosmetics to disposable razors - which are sold at the kiosks where lotto players hand in their coupons. The joint venture has also become a distributor for Reynolds of the US, selling cigarettes through its 3,000 outlets. Intracom based the 'Lotto Million' game on games developed for the Greek and Cypriot state lottery and football pool systems. With a first prize of Rbs140m the weekly draw, shown on television, is one of Russia's top programmes.</p>

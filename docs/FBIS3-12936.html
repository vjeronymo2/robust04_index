			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Egyptian fundamentalist Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim </F> by Hisham Mubarak in Copenhagen; date not given; first three  paragraphs are POLITIKEN introduction]    [Text] As reported in POLITIKEN on Tuesday, the Egyptian  Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim, who has been granted political asylum in  Denmark, has issued threats against foreign tourists and  investments in Egypt.    The Egyptian lawyer and author Hisham Mubarak has been to  Denmark to interview Tal'at Fu'ad Qassim. Hisham Mubarak is  writing a book about the Islamic fundamentalists and their  international network.    The following is an extract from the interview with Tal'at  Fu'ad Qassim.    [Mubarak] What are the Islamic Groups now concentrating  their efforts on?    [Qassim] We are taking a three-pronged approach. First, we  are aiming at a military coup. On this front things are going  very well. The state has absolutely no information about it,  and the security police are being kept busy by a few small-scale  actions which some of the Groups' younger members have carried  out in the provinces.    Secondly, the population as a whole has to be mobilized. In  order to be able to carry out an Islamic revolution, the whole  population must be mobilized. It is very important to prevent  foreign intervention or, failing that, to delay foreign  intervention for at least 18 days, in the view of our military  people. We have organized many demonstrations and one of the  purposes of these was to train the Groups' members to mobilize  people, and we are experts in this field.    Thirdly, special missions. These are of great significance,  in that they involve the murder of some of the people in  government posts. (...) This organizational unit (responsible  for special missions -- POLITIKEN editorial note) has gained  experience through carrying out a number of missions, it is now  ready, and it will play a part in the implementation of the plan  (to overthrow the regime -- POLITIKEN editorial note). This  unit is active and it will not stop the death missions as long  as circumstances make these activities necessary. It is a  misunderstanding to think that the arrests of some members of  the Groups or an absence of action over a period of time are a  sign of weakness, since this is in accordance with a plan  adopted for this organizational unit's activity.  <H5>  Preparations for a Military Coup </H5>   The state knows nothing about the military organizational  unit which is responsible for preparing a military coup, nor  does it know anything about the organizational unit responsible  for special missions. If some of its members are arrested, the  only information these members have is about their own cell, and  that is no help to the security police at all. As for the other  cells, there is no connection between them at all.    [Mubarak] The former members of the military or those who  stood accused in the Jihad case (court case in connection with  the murder of al-Sadat -- POLITIKEN editorial note) were rank  and file soldiers and officers who had no power. If we assume  that what you say is correct, this does not pose a great threat.  What are your views?    [Qassim] I disagree with you. It is the young officers who  hold the real power, since soldiers do not take their orders  from the generals, and we believe in the importance of  lower-ranking officers; history has shown this. They are the  most motivated people.  <H5>  Tourists Spread AIDS </H5>   [Mubarak] Why have the Islamic Groups carried out terrorist  acts against tourism?    [Qassim] There is more than one reason for the policy of  attacking tourism. Firstly, tourism is a major source of income  which is incompatible with Islam and which goes to fill the  state coffers. This means that the regime receives money which  helps to keep it in power, while we think that the regime should  be removed. So we have decided to strike this area in order to  remove this source of income to the government, so that the  regime loses its power. (...)    Secondly, tourism in its present form is an abominable thing  because it spreads prostitution and AIDS via female Jewish  tourists. It is a vile means of spreading all forms of  immorality. Tourism is also used to collect information on the  Islamic Groups for foreign intelligence services. Therefore  tourism, in our eyes, is an abominable thing which should be  changed. These are the reasons for the tourist sector being hit  in accordance with the Groups' strategy of damaging the regime.    [Mubarak] But the acts of violence which you have  committed were also intended to kill, since it was tourists who  were killed. What connection is there between the tourists and  the government?    [Qassim] Some of the tourists are insured against being  killed. That is why our slogan is tourism, not tourists. We  have done a lot of planning and preparation because we wish to  avoid killing tourists. So we took a number of measures. We  issued various declarations, warning tourists against coming to  Egypt where their lives would be in danger. We declared that  anyone coming to Egypt was risking their life, because the  tourist sector is targeted, and we sent declarations to all the  competent authorities, in which they were urged not to admit  tourists for the reasons mentioned. In the light of this, those  who come anyway deserve whatever happens to them.  <H5>  Attack on Investments </H5>   [Mubarak] You have issued a statement in which it appears  that investments are shortly to become a target for the Groups'  mission. When will you carry out violent acts against  investments?    [Qassim] The time when investments will be attacked depends  on a number of factors. One of these is the Egyptian security  police's treatment of us. We will assess how the struggle  between the state and ourselves is progressing. If the state  shows increasing violence towards us, we will attack investments  in revenge and in order to prevent such violence.    [Mubarak] Can you not here give what you see as valid  reasons, as you can in the case of the tourist sector. What  reasons are there for attacking investments?    [Qassim] Our aim is to destroy all state institutions with  the least possible bloodshed. These things are very simple.  One of our military cells in the Groups has the capacity to  attack investments in Egypt, when the time is ripe.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Glaxo to re-enter OTC sector GLAXO, Europe's largest pharmaceuticals company, yesterday confirmed its intention to re-enter the over the counter (OTC) non-prescription drugs market. The group announced that Mr Arthur Pappas, an existing board director, would take responsibility for OTC products. His task, according to the company, would be to develop and implement an OTC strategy for the existing product portfolio. All possible methods of achieving this would be reviewed, said Glaxo. According to analysts, this might include creating, manufacturing and marketing OTC products from scratch, making an acquisition, or securing a series of co-development and co-marketing alliances. During the past week both the UK and US analysts have been worried that Glaxo might dilute its earnings by acquiring Warner-Lambert, the US' fourth largest OTC group. Glaxo's shares fell 13p yesterday to 682p in a sharply rising market.</p>

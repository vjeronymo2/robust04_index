			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DRUG WARS': MEXICO, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE NEWS MEDIA  </P> <P> What could have been an affecting story based on the life of Camarena turned  out to be a caricature of what is supposed to be life in Mexico under the  influence of drug lords and corrupted officials.  </P> <P> The series was full of the usual stereotypical and one-dimensional characters  we've come to know in American television and movies.  </P> <P> The Latin characters are all buffoons, crooks or both. Throughout the movie I  kept waiting for someone to blurt the line: "Badges, we don't need any steenken  badges!"  </P> <P> Even Brokaw twice asked the question: "Do you think the President should have  sent the Marines into Mexico?" Is he aware of the repercussions of such an  action? Relations between our countries would be strained for generations!  </P> <P> ROBERT LOLA, Los Angeles  </P></p>

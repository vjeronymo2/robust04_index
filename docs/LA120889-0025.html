			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Charge It With GWTW: Scarlett O'Hara's line in the classic "Gone With the Wind"  -- "Rhett, you never give me credit for anything" -- may no longer hold true.  To mark the 50th anniversary of the legendary movie and the eve of its  re-premiere, Rhett Butler is finally "giving credit" -- with a Gone With the  Wind MasterCard. Issued by the Citizens and Southern National Bank in Atlanta,  the cards will be reissued every two years with a different scene reproduced  from movie stills. The four-card collection will consist of a 1989-91 50th  anniversary issue with a specially designed commemorative symbol, and scenes of  Scarlett and her beloved Tara, Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, and a Rhett and  Scarlet profile.  </P></p>

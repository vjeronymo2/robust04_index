			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 30 Jan (TANJUG) -- I expressed my  gratitude to President Karadzic for his help and cooperation in  ensuring unhindered deliveries of humanitarian aid by land  corridors passing across this territory, British general Michael  Rose, the newly appointed UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]  commander for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, said after his meeting  today with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic.    "The talks were very interesting and comprehensive and  referred to the situation on the ground, the humanitarian  situation and the mandate of the UN peace mission in this  connection."    Expressing satisfaction about today's meeting with Rose at  the start of the latter's mission in former Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Karadzic said the aim of the meeting was for the two sides to  get to know each other and explain their basic points of view.    "My impression is that regardless of where they come from,  high-ranking officers are the ones least prejudiced. Such was  the case with all former UNPROFOR commanders and so it is with  General Rose, who is willing to examine the situation as a whole  and take an unbiased stand which the United Nations personifies.  We have always been satisfied with the UN high commands and  have never had any objections to their work," the Srpska  republic president said.    "General Rose expressed satisfaction about the safe passage  of convoys across the Serb territory and about the reduced  volume of military operations in the Sarajevo zone. We accepted  the suggestion that such a trend should be continued, especially  at the time of the Olympics and we also accepted a cease-fire  during this period and will not carry out any military  operations unless we are threatened.    "We will try to ensure an increase in humanitarian aid  deliveries through our corridors, as our aim is to lessen the  suffering of civilians as much as possible. My impression is  that our first meeting took place in a very positive atmosphere  and I hope that our cooperation will be excellent," Karadzic  concluded.    General Rose said: "We agreed on the need to make an effort  to normalize the situation in Sarajevo and to halt military  actions in the Sarajevo area. I think it is in the interest of  all of us that the situation is normalized, given the  unfortunate experiences of the people living here."    He confirmed that the process of replacing UNPROFOR members  in Srebrenica was discussed, and expressed conviction that the  rotation would be completed without any problems.    President Karadzic mentioned that he and Rose also discussed  possible dangers which could arise from deliberately staged  incidents, especially within the context of the provocations  announced by Muslim forces in connection with NATO planes in  northeast Bosnia, particularly in Tuzla and Srebrenica.    "We agreed that in such a situation we should have each  individual case examined by mixed expert groups, because such  tricks on the part of the Muslim side are very likely. We will  try to prevent this, but if it happens we will insist on a  thorough investigation and will be willing to take part in the  work of the mixed expert commissions," Karadzic said.    "The protection of humanitarian aid routes is within the  mandate of the peace forces and we are aware of the difficulties  and traps which can present themselves, but we will conduct an  investigation in every case and I therefore stress the  importance of the deliveries of humanitarian aid across these  areas," General Rose said.</p>

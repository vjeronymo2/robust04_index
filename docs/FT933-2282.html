			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Call to aid small manufacturers THE GOVERNMENT should consider establishing a German-style bank to enable small and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMEs) to obtain finance on the same terms as larger companies, says a report out this week. The report, prepared by Professor Jack Levy for the Institution of Electrical Engineers, also calls for a new Manufacturing Expansion Scheme aimed at smaller companies. This would replace the Business Expansion Scheme, which is being phased out. It says SMMEs in the UK are regarded by banks and venture capitalists as high risk, and have to pay much higher interest rates than larger companies. Their workforces are also much less well trained than in Germany and Japan. When large companies have had first pick of educated people, the SMMEs are left underskilled both in technical and administrative capabilities. The report says the Department of Trade and Industry's measures and schemes have been of some help to the SMMEs, but have not penetrated to the majority. It lists 50 actions, 25 each for Government and industry, which would help ensure the successful survival of the sector. These include encouragement for a new structure of inter-industry partnerships in research and development and wider tax relief on investments in growing businesses. But Prof Levy says the SMMEs themselves have to review their methods of working and use fully the available support from the government and the European Community, The institution says the Government has expressed its concern that the UK manufacturing base is not as strong as it needs to be if it is to make its necessary contribution to the national economy. The report is meant to contribute to the debate on how to rectify this. Small and Medium Sized Manufacturing Enterprises - A Recipe for Success.

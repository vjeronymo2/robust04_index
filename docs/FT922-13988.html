			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Tax boycott call in Italy THE Lombard League, the Italian regional party which emerged as the biggest winner from last Sunday's general elections, is determined to press ahead with its election pledge to encourage non-payment of taxes as part of its opposition to the political establishment in Rome. Mr Marco Formentini, the party's economics spokesman and one of the 55 newly elected League members of parliament, said it aimed to win control of Italy's big northern cities. 'With the administration behind us, we will invite people not to pay their taxes if the money is just going to be wasted,' he said. The threat comes as Italy's politicians mull over the outcome of the polls, which saw a sharp drop in support for the established parties in favour of smaller groupings and threaten to make the country increasingly ungovernable. Mr Formentini warned that the League would use its parliamentary power to exert strong 'supervision' over government spending, which it claims is 'squandered' on vote-catching projects, especially in southern Italy. The aim would be to gain seats on parliamentary committees to make it difficult to pass spending measures not sanctioned by the League, he said. The League, which gained 8.7 per cent of the national vote to emerge as Italy's fourth biggest party, is also trying to develop an economic programme to rebuff attacks that it has no coherent policies of its own. Mr Formentini said the League would seek to slash spending on health care, pensions and public-sector pay, while limiting transfers of central government money to local councils and state agencies. He denied the plans would lead to a deterioration of services, on the grounds that current spending on health and pensions was inflated by between 30 per cent and 50 per cent as a result of inefficiency and corruption. On the state railways, Mr Formentini said the League would dismiss 90,000 of the 200,000 workers. The party has targeted Milan, where it just beat the Christian Democrats into second place, as the first big city where it would like to gain control. The local council, traditionally dominated by the Socialist party, has been hit by a corruption scandal, and may now be sufficiently weak for the League to bring down, he claimed.</p>

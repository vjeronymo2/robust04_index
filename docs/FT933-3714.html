			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Private View: Work for all, the Prof proclaims - Christopher Freeman gives union leaders and governments the benefit of his research on the effects of technology on employment, spread the reduction in volume YOU WOULD not have guessed it from the dreary intonation of prepared speeches at the TUC Congress in Brighton this week, but trade union leaders are finally facing what their former colleague Clive Jenkins called 'the collapse of work'. The TUC's new general secretary, John Monks, addressed the problem on Wednesday, as did the European Community's social affairs commissioner, Padraig Flynn, on Monday. What is the problem? Demand for labour in western Europe has fallen sharply while the sweatshops of Asia are working overtime. Meanwhile the micro-electronic revolution is rapidly chipping away at the way in which work is organised and jobs are distributed. In Britain that has been accompanied by wage cuts, de-recognition of unions, erosion of worker protection and widespread subcontracting of labour - sometimes in the crudest fashion. It must appear to union leaders as if jobs - what they call 'real' jobs - are simply drying up. To discover whether this is true I consulted Professor Christopher Freeman, who is 72 today and who has spent half his lifetime studying the relationship of technology to employment. Earlier this year his research was recognised by an international jury of social scientists in Paris who made him the first winner of the Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 64,935) Prix International du Futuroscope. He already has the Bernal Prize and the Schumpeter Prize. Freeman, co-founder and former director of the Science Policy Research Unit at Sussex University, lives in Lewes, a few miles from the TUC conference hall. We met over lunch in a Thai restaurant to the accompaniment of a plaintive Chinese pop song. I asked him whether we had reached some kind of watershed. Freeman agreed that in some respects the situation was completely new. 'Nevertheless', he added, 'I would think - and hope - that economic theory can't be completely wrong in saying that if you have enough aggregate demand in the economy that it will, with some lags and rigidities, be translated at some point into useful employment, even if it's a different kind of employment. 'Technical change has led to a tremendous reduction in the number of working hours needed to sustain a reasonable living standard. The problem for economic policy is to spread that reduction in the volume of labour reasonably widely over the whole active population and not to concentrate it on a few regions, a few people.' Freeman calls this 'the active society'. (Commissioner Flynn used the same phrase in his speech to the unions.) 'But the hours of work need to be very, very flexible. And I think that's possible now. One of the big advances information technology has brought us is that you can vary your hours without great trouble.' Human's psychological need for work had been demonstrated by studies of prisoners of war. Without it, it has been found, they went to pieces. 'So I think what you need now is a society where there is work available for everyone who wants to do it.' Technology might disrupt old patterns of employment: for some that spells insecurity, others liberty. But it could free people for labour-intensive occupations - looking after other people, or creative work. Freeman says: 'Those occupations should increase as the boring, less skilled jobs get eliminated. And craft occupations should increase. 'In that sense, it could - I'm not saying it will - lead in some sense to a better society. Could. It probably won't, but . . .' The professor broke off with an apologetic laugh. I suggested companies would resist job-sharing and similar devices for spreading work. 'There are some employers who would like to behave in the way you are describing, and who are behaving in that way. There will be tendencies to go back - you can see it in the debate on the social chapter (of Maastricht) - to low-wage types of occupation, even sweatshops. 'Some will try and get through as they have done in each recession by reducing labour forces and wages if possible . . .I think there are more attempts to reduce wages now than before the second world war. 'The evidence for a pessimistic scenario is there in the fact that the UK government has taken this, I think, very retrograde stance on the social chapter. But the reason I think the scenario might be wrong is that there's also a lot of evidence that you get very low morale in those situations, and that good teamwork and reasonably good conditions in the end yield better productivity and certainly better implementation of new technology.' I asked whether Europe had any choice but to compete with Asia - or east Europe - on the same terms of low labour costs and high technology input. 'There is this strong school of thought which says wage flexibility is the main problem,' he replied. 'But there are two kinds of flexibility. The one most economists talk about is cost-price flexibility, meaning wage cuts and a reduction in social benefits - the big topic in western Europe. The other kind, which I think in the end is more efficient, is flexibility in work organisation, in technology, where you really learn to use new techniques and teamwork efficiently. It goes back to Robert Owen, this debate.' Is full employment still a realistic goal for a government? 'I think it is, but as I said earlier a better name for it is an active society, because of the importance of women's employment, part-time employment, old people's employment . . .' He laughed at the self-reference. 'It could in some ways be better than the old one in that some parents - I'm certainly one of them - would certainly have liked as males to have more time to look after children at various times in our lives. We couldn't do that with the old structure. I think we should be able to do it.' Freeman is a mild man who wears his honours lightly. He likes watching sport and birds. He is a suppressed 'twitcher', he says, and spent most of his Easter weekend chasing a hoopoe. He is also, privately, an idealist capable of surprising vehemence. He described himself, startlingly, as a 'neo-communist'. We had been discussing whether economics could be neutral, or 'value-free'. Freeman said that nobody, not even economists, could live without goals, beliefs and ethics. The world's complexities could be analysed in two ways: with abstract techniques like the mathematics of chaos theory, or by giving oneself time to think, to apply ethics and social values to the phenomena. 'Some people call that technology assessment, or cost-benefit analysis. I certainly think there's a function for philosophers, if you like, people who are concerned with the quality of life in general, including environmental issues and the question of speed of work.' He quoted T S Eliot: 'Where is the life we have lost in living? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?' When economists disagree, I asked, is that due to ethical prejudices, or because they can't agree on the numbers? 'It's more likely to be their political prejudices than their ethics. Very often they'll want the same thing but they'll disagree about the path to achieve it. Ideology is still very strong in the social sciences because it's so hard to do what the physical scientists do and replicate experiments.' Do you consider yourself a social scientist? 'Well, I've always hesitated to use the term 'scientist' in relation to economics or politics. In English at least it sounds a bit pretentious because the possibilities for coming to conclusions from experimental evidence are less.' What are your ideological prejudices? 'Probably other people can discern it better than I can. I'm certainly aware of a few, yes.' How would you describe them? 'I'd say I was a neo-liberal with a small 'l' and a neo-communist with a small 'c'.' What's a neo-communist? 'It means that I think inequalities in the world, between the third world and the rich world are obscene and should be reduced. They are also obscene within the rich countries - and I think they are getting worse almost everywhere.' Doesn't that make you a dangerous Leftie? 'No, no, a lot of Conservative economists are quite in favour of income redistribution.' Are the inequalities also inefficient in economic terms? 'I think they are, yes. Japanese companies pay their managers about one-tenth what American managers get in the same industry and I don't think they suffer. What the American big companies pay their executives and directors is way out of line . . . economically absurd as well as morally obscene.' Also in Britain? 'I think so, yes.' Freeman's two sons work in computer software, a promising field 15 years ago but whose future, their father says, looks less rosy now. Can an economist advise his children what to do? 'I doubt it very much,' he laughed. 'I don't think anyone's very good at long-term forecasting. With commonsense you can see some trends but if I was advising my youngest daughter, I probably wouldn't say.' He has two boys and two girls from his first wife, Peggitty, who died 20 years ago and a 17-year-old daughter from his second wife, Margaret. I asked him what he would do with the Dollars 100,000 French prize. Freeman said some he would give some to his children and to his brother who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. 'Especially I'll try and help my youngest daughter, see her right . . . to help her get whatever's going in the way of employment.' The laugh this time could so easily have been ironic. It wasn't.</p>

The debt for electricity equals 436,556 lats  (nearly 763,000 U.S. dollars). The office says there are  nearly 7,000 Russian militaries in Latvia at present, and 190  army units are stationed in 242 military objects. As many as 36  of these objects are Russian ships and other floating objects,  and the number of army cars and trucks equals 827.    Besides, there are 360 wagons with munition in Cekule and  Garkalne ammunition depots. By observing all security measures,  it is possible to withdraw from Latvia approximately 60 wagons a  month.    The office head, Ilgonis Upmalis, said Wednesday at a press  conference that the Russian army leadership has disbanded 400  army units in Latvia without informing the Latvian authorities  if the disbanded units' officers and their families left Latvia  or remained here. The same can be said about the Russian  Northwest Army Unit.    Upmalis claimed he had information that the Russian army  leadership has ordered to disband all army units still stationed  in the territory of Latvia. Upmalis noted that the Russian  Northwest Army Unit refused to make known the Russian army  withdrawal schedule, and, when signing agreement on army  withdrawal, the schedule would be unilateral and the interests  of Latvia would be disregarded.    The office also announced that Russia officially passed over  to Latvia several military objects: Alksnis and Birjuzov  Military school in Riga, Daugavpils Military school, and  Jekabpils and Lociki airports. As many as 40 Latvian commercial  structures have bought the former Russian army military objects.</p>

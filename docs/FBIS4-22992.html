N. </F> Postnikova, Crimean Medical Institute, Simferopol; UDC  615.471.03:61(043.8)]    [Text] This paper is a survey of the present state of  research on biological sensors. Enzymatic and immune biosensors  are described. Problems associated with using microorganisms as  biosensors are reported in detail. Use of luminescent bacteria  and luciferase sensors is discussed. The principles of operation  of fiber-optic and semiconductor biosensors are discussed.    Key words: enzymatic and immune biosensors, microbial  biosensors.    New sensitive means of testing with biosensory measuring  devices--biosensors--are enjoying increasingly wider use in  clinical biochemistry, microbiology, bioengineering and other  fields. Sensory systems based on enzymes, cellular organelles,  cells and tissues of animals and plants, and microorganisms, and  sensors in which the substance under analysis bonds with a  target molecule--a receptor, with antibodies, and so on are  employed extensively in creation of biosensors [18,40,55,56].  Physicochemical changes in sensory systems occurring on the  working surface of biosensors are detected and amplified by  transducers and registered by the corresponding physical  methods--potentiometric, optical, acoustic [12,44,63]. The high  resolution and specificity of biosensors and the speed with  which measurements are taken with them make them essential in  monitoring enzymatic processes and in laboratory diagnosis of  infectious and somatic human diseases. This survey describes the  current state of efforts to create and use biosensors in foreign  laboratories and in our laboratories.  <H5>  Enzymatic Biosensors </H5>   Sensors in which the sensitive layer contains specific  enzymes are the most highly developed type of biosensors. The  first enzymatic biosensor, developed by Clark [23], was intended  to measure glucose by means of glucose oxidase and an  O[.sub]2[/]-electrode. The simplicity, reliability and  swiftness of glucose determination ensured rapid development of  the new method. Glucose sensors enjoyed wide use in clinics. The  range of measurements of blood glucose concentrations is  approximately 2|b10[.sup]-2[/]-5|b10[.sup]-3[/] mg/ml,  while the time of a single analysis is not more than 15 sec  [40]. With the advent of implantable glucose sensors connected  to an arterial or venous shunt, it became possible to measure  sugar in the blood of a patient directly [13,41,67,75]. The  importance of such rapid analysis is difficult to overstate in  relation to diagnosis of sugar diabetes. Sensors for  subcutaneous measurement of glucose have been created [22].  Glucose biosensors are acquiring special importance in the  development of an artificial pancreas [37]. Glucose sensors are  being used successfully to monitor fermentation processes [51]  and in bioengineering [31]. Enzymatic sensors working with other  carbohydrates (galactose, fructose, xylose, xylulose) make it  possible to take measurements within a wide range of  concentrations--from 50 M to 2.0 mM[26,87]. Biosensors have  been developed to determine a broad spectrum of organic acids:  pyruvate [73,97], malate [45,101], oxalate [16], glutamate and  aspartate [100,102], lactate [19,51,73] and ascorbic acid [52].  A free fatty acid sensor [75] determines the acid content in  concentrations of approximately 0.4-2.0 mM in about 10 minutes.  Enzymatic sensors are widely used to determine amino acids such  as lysine, methionine, tyrosine [44,95] and aspartic acid [100].  Biosensors have been created to determine creatine and  creatinine in blood plasma and bile [59,68,99].    Enzymatic sensors are widely employed in food industry to  evaluate the quality and freshness of food products [52,84].  Thus, the freshness of fish is determined from the concentration  of hypoxanthine while that of meat is determined from the  presence of putrescine and cadaverine [80]. Biosensors are used  to determine ascorbic acid in fruit juices [52]. A sensor for  penicillin was obtained with the help of immobilized lactamase  and penicillinase [21,94]. A biosensor for uric acid is  sensitive to a substrate concentration of approximately 5 mg/ml  [62]. Other enzymatic sensors have been developed as well:  phenol [84], alcohol [94], ammonia [5], a sensor for  determination of phosphoric acid [91] and others.    Fast inactivation of the enzyme, especially when it comes in  contact with blood and other physiological fluids, is the main  shortcoming of enzymatic sensors. The life of most implantable  biosensors is approximately 3-5 hours. The stability of the  enzyme depends in many ways on its purity and the means of  immobilization.    Enzymes in biosensors are usually immobilized on nylon,  polyacrylamide, polyvinyl chloride, cellulose acetate and other  membranes [33,41,49,84]. However, direct attachment of an enzyme  to an electrode is also possible, which reduces the sensor's  response time. Stability of enzymatic biosensors is achieved in  a number of cases by introducing additional enzymes into the  sensory part of the sensor that break down reaction by-products  [53]. Development of biosensors led to creation of biosensors  with different types of electrodes--oxygen [53,75,80,94,97],  CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode [95], pH-electrode [56,102] and  others. Biosensors are being developed with immobilized  cofactors [43], as are multisensors making it possible to  measure several substances simultaneously [24,62]. New  directions in designing enzymatic biosensors include use of  field transistors [10,34] and Langmuir-Blodzhett  [transliteration] films [86] in them, and creation of  fiber-optic enzymatic biosensors employing photometric,  fluorescent and bioluminescent recordings [27,29,87]. Sensors  working under flow-injection conditions have been created for  environmental monitoring and to monitor processes in  microbiological industry and in other fields [51].  <H5>  Immune Biosensors </H5>   Immune biosensors are distinguished by high sensitivity and  specificity. The sensory part of an immune biosensor is  represented by antibodies or antigens immobilized on a membrane;  physicochemical changes in antigen-antibody complex formation  are registered by the corresponding electrodes. Immunosensors  are subdivided in relation to the means of detection into  electrochemical, amperometric, potentiometric and optical  [15,74], and in relation to the type of immunological reactions  used--into immunosensors with labeled reagents and without  labeling. The first immunosensor without a labeling agent was  created to detect anti-syphilitic antibodies [14], but because  of the nonspecificity of the cardiolipid antigen the sensor was  characterized by significant error. A potentiometric  immunosensor making it possible to detect antibodies to syphilis  at 800-time dilution of blood serum, and an electrochemical  immune biosensor for blood group determination were developed  later [15].    However, immunosensors without a labeling agent have many  artifacts as a rule, and they require separation of the  antigen-antibody complex from free substances, which makes their  use in clinical practice difficult. The sensitivity of  immunological methods is increased significantly by means of  labeled immune reagents; free radicals, radioactive isotopes,  fluorescent dyes, aromatic hydrocarbons and enzymes are used as  labels. Immune biosensors in which enzymes such as catalase,  glucose oxidase, _b_-galactosidase, peroxidase etc. have been  developed to the greatest extent [15,77,78]. Both antibodies and  antigens are labeled with enzymes [74]. Immune biosensors have  been created for determination of albumin and immunoglobulins  within a concentration range of 1-10 g/ml [78]. An  immunosensor for theophylline and gonadotropin can measure  concentrations of these substances within  1.1|b10[.sup]-9[/]-2.5|b10[.sup]-8[/] M [77], while the  detection limit of _a_-fetoprotein is 5|b10[.sup]-11[/] gm/ml  [15]. Enzymatic immune biosensors with several labeled  antibodies, which makes them polyfunctional, are being developed.    The choice of enzyme for an immune biosensor depends on the  type of transducer used in the given biosensor, a function that  can be served both by semiconductors and by electrodes (ion,  oxygen etc.) [46]. Peroxidase is usually used as the label in  luminescent immune biosensors. Labeled antibodies are applied to  a light guide, and change in the sample's luminescence as a  result of a bonding reaction is registered by a photocell. The  enzyme luciferase may also be used as a marker in such a system,  which significantly widens the sensitivity range of the  biosensor. Use of the electrochemical luminescence of pyrene for  analysis of blood serum albumin is promising [14]. Optical  immunosensors in which fluorochromes are used as labels have  been created on the basis of immunofluorescent analysis; the  sensitivity of determining proteins in such immune biosensors  reaches around 1 nM at a measuring time of approximately 5  minutes [74]. Use of monoclonal antibodies, liposomes and other  biological materials in fiber-optic immunosensors [1,8,36], and  the prospects of mass production of immune biosensors for immune  biosensory diagnosis [1] are discussed in a number of papers.  <H5>  Cellular Biosensors </H5>   Biosensors in which the analytical system contains the cells  of microorganisms, applied to a membrane or to some other  backing, may be lumped together in the class of microbial  biosensors. Use of intact cells as a sensor makes it possible to  determine the substrates and products of any enzymatic reaction  of a given test object without having to use the complex and  expensive procedure of enzyme purification, and to detect change  in cell metabolism in response to mutagens, toxins and  antibiotics. As with enzymatic sensors, microbial biosensors may  be classified in relation to type of electrode, means of signal  registration, class of substances to be determined, and area of  use.    Microbial glucose sensors have enjoyed the widest  application. An amperometric glucose sensor with  Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria immobilized in agar  produces a linear response to glucose in a concentration  interval of 2.5|b10[.sup]-5[/]-1.5|b10[.sup]-4[/] M, which  correlates with the enzymatic method of glucose determination  [93]. The sensor is convenient to analysis of culture media and  biological fluids. Ascorbic acid is measured by means of an  O[.sub]2[/]-electrode to the surface of which a  nitrocellulose filter bearing immobilized Enterobacter  agglomerans cells is secured [92].    Microbial biosensors are used to measure small  concentrations  of amino acids. A sensor consisting of a  CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode and membranes bearing immobilized  Escherichia coli bacteria was used to determine  glutamate. In response to glutamate decarboxylase, the bacteria  release carbon dioxide, which is measured by an electrode. The  sensor's selectivity stems from the absence of sensitivity to  glucose, acetate ions and inorganic ions [39]. L-tryptophan is  determined by means of a pO[.sub]2[/]-membrane sensor with  immobilized P. fluorescens cells; in this case the  response remains linear over an interval of substrate  concentrations of 4|b10[.sup]-7[/]-7|b10[.sup]-5[/] M  [93]. An O[.sub]2[/]-electrode bearing chemoautotrophic  bacteria that consume carbon dioxide on its membrane is used to  determine L-tyrosine. The sensor's response time is  approximately 10 minutes, and the response is linear within a  concentration range of approximately 10-50 M [76].    Microbial biosensors are widely used to measure ethanol in  fermentation processes using immobilized Trichosporon  brassicae yeast cells coupled to an  O[.sub]2[/]-electrode. The sensor reacts selectively to  ethanol, not reacting to methanol and organic acids. The  response is linear within a range of 2.0-45.0 mM, and the  quantity of measurements without loss of activity is 1,200  analyses [42]. The same sensor is used to measure acetate. A  sensor for ethanol was also developed on the basis of  Gluconabacter acetate bacteria membrane-bound with an  ion-selective field transistor [38]. A microbial biosensor with  Methylomonas methylovora cells immobilized on a mesh  electrode or in calcium alginate is also sensitive to ethanol  [25].    Ammonia monitoring sensors are used in fermentation  processes. They are based on an oxygen electrode and  Nitrosomonas sp. cells oxidizing ammonia to nitrite  ions, and Nitrobacter sp. cells oxidizing nitrites to  nitrates. The limit of detection of ammonia is approximately 0.1  mg/liter [39]. An ammonium sensor with nitrifying bacteria  immobilized on an O[.sub]2[/]-electrode is used to analyze  sewage, in which the range of ammonium measurements at pH 10 is  approximately 0.1-1.2 mM [47]. A microbial biosensor with  immobilized Bacillus subtilis cells was proposed for  determining ammonium ions [68,71]. The response time of the  sensor is 5 sec, linearity of the response is ensured within a  range of approximately 0.0-0.5 mM, the sensor is stable for  10-12 days, and presence of phosphates, sulfates and chlorides  does not influence signal magnitude.    A sensitive microbial biosensor for determining urea  consists  of a CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode connected to a nitrocellulose  membrane covalently bound with Proteus mirabilis  cells. The sensor is active for not less than 7 days, and the  response is linear within a concentration range of  7|b10[.sup]-4[/]-3|b10[.sup]-2[/] M [35,76].    An amperometric biosensor consisting of an  O[.sub]2[/]-electrode and Acetobacter pasteurianum  cells immobilized on a nylon membrane filter is intended for  determination of lactate in milk and in yogurt. The sensor's  response is observed to be linear within approximately  1.0|b10[.sup]-4[/]-13|b10[.sup]-4[/] M, and activity  persists for around 170 hours [50].    Microbial biosensors can be used in research on the  physiology of the microorganisms themselves. Thus, an  O[.sub]2[/]-electrode can be used to determine the  concentration of the antibiotic gentamicin, which affects the  duration of the first phase of oxygen absorption by immobilized  E. coli cells [42]. The action of gentamicin can be  evaluated and quick control of its activity can be achieved on  the basis of change in the intensity of metabolism by B.  pumilis cells (oxygen consumption, change in conductivity  and dielectric permeability) [4]. Biochemical oxygen consumption  is one of the criteria of pollution of rivers and water basins  by industrial wastes and chemicals. Biochemical oxygen  consumption can be monitored by means of a Clark oxygen sensor  with microorganisms utilizing organic substrate in aerobic  conditions immobilized on its membrane. The sensor can be used  to estimate the concentration of organic matter in liquid wastes  [69]. A microbial biosensor based on porous membranes bearing  E. coli, Azotobacter vinelandii and the  cells of other microorganisms secured to the surface of a  CO[.sub]2[/]-electrode is used to determine toxicity in  liquid wastes having a high concentration of organic compounds  [33,68]. Sensors consisting of Hyphomicrobium sp.  bacteria combined with a glass electrode are used to analyze  contamination of industrial wastes by methylsulfates. Its range  of measurement is 5|b10[.sup]-2[/]-6.3|b10[.sup]-1[/] M,  the sensor's response time is approximately 5 minutes, and  stability of work is guaranteed for a week [72].    An amperometric sensor bearing Synechococcus sp.  cells, which begins to transmit a signal after the photosystem  of the cells is disturbed, is used to detect chlortoluron,  linuron and other herbicides [20,84], and it can be used to  analyze the quality of drinking water. Sensors for mutagens and  carcinogens were developed on the basis of E. coli,  Salmonella sp. and B. subtilis  microorganisms [34,39]. Hybrid biosensors with urease or  creatine kinase in an ammonia biosensor are used for  amperometric determination of urea and creatinine. The limits of  analysis in this case are 5-50 mg/ml for urea and 5-500 mg/ml  for creatinine [47]. A biosensor for L-tyrosine and maltose was  developed on the basis of B. subtilis cells.    Microbial biosensors based on thermophilic bacteria are a  new  type of sensor [39].    Luminescing bacteria and other bioluminescent organisms are  unique sensory systems. Both native organisms and luciferase  complexes isolated from them are used for analytical purposes  [2,5,7,9]. Light luciferase sensors possess high sensitivity and  low inertia [47]. Microbial bioluminescent sensors containing  immobilized Beneckea harveyi bacteria can measure  dissolved oxygen with a sensitivity of approximately 3.5 nM, and  hydrogen peroxide with a sensitivity of approximately 0.4 M  [71]. Mycotoxins in food products at concentrations of  approximately 0.9-20.0 g/ml and trace quantities of  narcotics  and poisons are determined by means of lyophilized  Photobacterium phosphoferum cells [7].  Photobacterium fischeri strains are sensitive sensors  of various biologically active substances, including detergents,  the detection threshold of which is approximately 0.2 mN [2,3].  Mutants of photobacteria capable of restoring bioluminescence  level with the addition of nanogram quantities of different  mutagens and carcinogens are widely used as indicator systems.  Ph. fischeri and luminescing genetically engineered  strains of E. coli (lum), the luciferase system of  which is more sensitive to a large range of toxins, are being  used successfully to monitor contamination of the environment by  toxic substances [3]. Biosensors have been created on the basis  of bacterial and fire-fly bioluminescence systems for analysis  of synthetic and natural aldehydes [6,90], dehydrogenases [9],  proteases and their inhibitors [7], phospholipase [89], ATP  [29], hormones [47], ethanol [61] and toxins [84]. Microbial  contamination may be determined by bioluminescent methods with  an accuracy down to hundreds of cells, which significantly  raises the level of control. Bacterial luciferase is also used  as a label [79], being a promising substitute for the RIA [not  further identified] and other methods [96].    Higher sensitivity to a number of reagents and stability  under continuous measuring conditions are undisputed advantages  of microbial biosensors, though they are often inferior in  selectivity to enzymatic and immune biosensors.  <H5>  Fiber-Optic and Semiconductor Biosensors </H5>   Development of biosensors using chemiluminescent systems  combined with fiber light guides and quantometric methods of  registering biologically active substances and reactions is a  new, promising direction in the development of biosensors  [48,54,70].    Fiber-optic biosensors are unique in the reversibility of  their indicator systems and in the quickness of the response.  Specificity is attained by selecting different optically active  fluorescent or bioluminescent labels [82,83]. The principle of  operation of a fiber-optic biosensor is as follows: Light from  the source propagates along the optic fiber to the sensor, which  is fitted on the end of a light guide, and after reflecting or  scattering from the sample, it returns to the light receiver,  which analyzes the responding signal. Reflected light may be  spectrally altered as it passes through a sample under analysis  containing an optically active reagent.    An optical ``metabolic'' sensor has been proposed--a  miniature sensitive glucose sensor, the principle of detection  of which is based on competition between the metabolite to be  determined and a ligand labeled with fluorescein for a receptor  binding site [65]. The system uses filters that block scattered  radiation. The response time in such an optrode is approximately  10 minutes, and measurement accuracy for glucose is  approximately 0.13 mg/liter. A fiber-optic biosensor containing  five sensors was used to investigate the pH gradient in cardiac  muscle [64]. The measurement technique with this sensor is  relatively simple and inexpensive, and registration and analysis  are performed by means of a photomultiplier connected to a  processor. A fiber-optic biosensor has been proposed for  measurement of pCO[.sub]2[/] in which a Soverinkhauz  [transliteration] electrode measures the pH of a bicarbonate  solution in a container secured to the end of the light guide  [66].    Another fiber-optic sensor was also developed for  determination of O[.sub]2[/] using dye phosphorescence [19].  The structure of the sensor is similar to the one used to  measure pH. A powdered dye applied to organic sorbents is placed  in a porous polypropylene capsule at the end of a light guide.  Illumination with blue light excites phosphorescence of the dye,  which emits a green glow with an intensity that is inversely  proportional to the oxygen pressure.    Fluorescing reagents are also used to determine metal ions.  The concentration of halogen ions and pH in the physiological  range are determined on the basis of fluorescence extinction  using indicator systems made from polymer adsorbents [19].  Optical gas-discharge sensors based on fluorescence extinction  of pirenbutyric acid were proposed for determination of oxygen  [57]. Information was also communicated on an ammonium sensor in  which the sensor is precipitated onto an optical fiber [58].  Fiber-optic biosensors are ideal systems for determining gases  in biological objects because their response time is short and  their sensitivity is high (0.017 pH/sec, 0.6  pO[.sub]2[/]/sec).    Fiber-optic biosensors can register not only fluorescence  and  chemiluminescence, but also change in the color of the sample in  question. An optical enzymatic sensor containing alkaline  phosphatase was used to determine p-nitrophenylphosphatase.  Change in color of the substrate is registered by a photodiode.  An enzymatic electrode with a peroxidase photoreceptor secured  to a silicon surface (or a reaction chain of greater complexity)  was proposed for quantitative determination of hydrogen  peroxide, and for analysis of the activity of oxidases and  products--glucose, cholesterol, uric acid, hypoxanthine etc.  [60].    Polyenzymatic complexes bound to a permeable membrane at the  end of an optical light fiber will obviously become the  principal sensory elements of specific sensors in the future.  Fiber-optic biosensors are a new resource for obtaining  biological and chemical information. They are irreplaceable  wherever it is difficult to obtain such information by other  means, especially in medicine, where sensory components must  tolerate sterilization, be biocompatible, and allow precise  calibration.    Semiconductor field transistors are one of the most  promising  transducing components for biosensors. Semiconductor sensors are  divided into three basic classes in accordance with one function  or another: gas, ionic and biochemical. The last may be  considered to be semiconductor biosensors because they use  biological components as sensors--enzymes, antibodies, bacteria,  tissue cells, various organoids.    Beginning with the work of Bergveld [17], who was the first  to propose using a field transistor to make semiconductor  biosensors, different variants of such semiconductor structures  were discussed in the literature [54]. The significant amount of  attention devoted to such semiconductor biosensors is associated  with use of integrated technology, which makes it possible to  reduce the dimensions of sensors and to form different electric  circuit components on the same chip out of which the biosensor  is made. The possibility of creating so-called multibiosensors  and polyfunctional semiconductor biosensors, and organization of  their mass production are also important. An example of such a  biosensor would be a multibiosensor based on four field  transistors, each of which is covered by a membrane bearing the  corresponding enzyme [48]. It should be noted however that the  output characteristics of many multibiosensors are nonlinear.    Advantages of semiconductor biosensors include a high degree  of integration, and the possibility for creating polyfunctional  sensors and using them for continuous monitoring. It is expected  that biosensors will be used extensively not only in medicine  and bioengineering [27,28,85] but also in analytical instrument  making and microelectronics [30,32], as well as in the creation  of biorobots and biocomputers [88,98]. We can expect that  biosensors operating on new principles and providing for the  highest degree of perfection and the highest information level  in the development of methods for investigating systems will  soon make their appearance. The prospects of development in this  direction are obvious.  Bibliography    1. Arenkov, P. Ya. and Lavrentyeva, M.

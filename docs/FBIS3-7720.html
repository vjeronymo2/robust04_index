			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mate Granic, vice president and minister for foreign  affairs, has addressed the annual session of the UN Human Rights  Commission in Geneva. Jadranka Kosor spoke to Granic over the  phone following his address:    [Kosor] Croatia has sharply condemned every kind of  violation  of human rights, Mate Granic said in his address.    [Begin Granic recording] In addition to this, I spoke  clearly  in my address about ways envisaged by the Republic of Croatia to  resolve the current crisis, both with regard to the negotiations  on Bosnia-Herzegovina and to relations with the Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia, i.e. the normalization of these relations, which  crucially depend on developments in the UN Protected Areas, that  is the reintegration of these areas into the constitutional and  legal system of the Republic of Croatia.    I also stressed that--regardless of Mr. Mazowiecki's report,  the U.S. State Department's report, and those of some other  important nongovernmental organizations in which they reflect on  some violations of human rights in Croatia--Croatia has,  nevertheless, welcomed all international institutions. They  conduct their activities in the former Yugoslavia from their  bases in Croatia. [end recording]    [Kosor] Croatia proposed to the Human Rights Commission a  special resolution in which the problem of missing persons would  be treated as separate from other humanitarian problems.  Representatives of associations of families of missing persons  and POW's are also in Geneva, Granic said. They were received  by the president of the Human Rights Commission today. The  Croatian foreign affairs minister has left Geneva for London.</p>

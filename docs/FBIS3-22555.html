Barjaktarevic report: "More Than 250 Children Contracted </F> Meningitis"]    [Text] Seven persons with serious symptoms of typhoid  fever were brought to Pristina University Hospital. The number  of persons who contracted this dangerous disease, which was  believed to have been eradicated, has risen to 77 during the  last month. The epicenter is Stimlje, but typhoid fever might  break out in almost all Kosovo towns. The doctors of Pristina  University Hospital, including Professor Stevan Baljosevic, the  head of hospital, have recommended all Kosovo inhabitants to  boil water.    Children's meningitis, a disease that affects the brain,  also  appeared in Kosovo. More than 250 children have contracted the  disease so far.    After having visited Stimlje, the epicenter of the serious  infectious disease, Stevan Baljosevic gave the following answer  to BORBA's question about the causes and possible consequences  of the disease:    "The water-supply system of the Institute for Mentally  Retarded Persons has been completely destroyed, the water is not  chlorinated, and the water level in the basin from which it is  taken is below the stream so that fresh water is mixed with  sewage."    The symptoms of typhoid are unendurable stomachache, high  fever, sweating, vomiting and general weakness.</p>

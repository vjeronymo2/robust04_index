			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pierre Claassen, political correspondent] </F>   [Text] Kempton Park Feb 3 SAPA--The National Party's [NP]  inspirational federal congress had proved that true  reconciliation had been achieved within the party, NP leader F W  de Klerk said in Kempton Park on Thursday [3 February].    Closing one of the most extraordinary congresses of the  party's 81-year history, he said the NP had demonstrated it was  the only party which could claim to be truly national,  representing and speaking on behalf of all the country's people.    He was personally inspired, not by the huge number of  delegates or the spontaneous way in which it had reflected the  new make up of the party, but by its spirit of warmth,  naturalness and courage. "I am inspired by a meeting of spirits  and messages that came from the heart," he said.    However, he had a word of caution for the congress. It was  easy to get pumped up with enthusiasm and courage at such a  gathering, "but there are many Nationalists out there who feel  lonely". "I saw them on the (electioneering) road show, I stood  next to them when they had the guts to stand up and were  surrounded by hundreds toyi-toying [protest dancing] against  them."    For each Nat [NP member] under threat, there were thousands  who were worried and who did not stand up on rooftops because it  was dangerous. Mr de Klerk said the NP should create a massive  wave to break across the country and take these people with it  and give them courage.    Amazing scenes had preceded Mr de Klerk's closing address  when candidates of the four provinces had been introduced.  Black languages, spontaneous singing, ululating, whistling and  "viva's" had underscored the wide ethnic mix which now  represented the former party of apartheid.    After the closing, a gallery of what organisers called "our  more colourful candidates" met the media.    One of two former ANC [African National Congress] Umkhonto  we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] members  present, Mr Joshua Khumalo, said he had not joined the NP.  "Nobody joins his family, I just comes home."    Former Springbok rugby captain Naas Botha said he was as  surprised as anyone to have been nominated. "But then I thought  about what is going to happen for the next 35 years...and  standing on the sidelines is easy."</p>

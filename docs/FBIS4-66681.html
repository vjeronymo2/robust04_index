			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Malik Asgar Hashmi: "Let Someone Remember </F> Central Bihar"]    [Text] The Jharkhand parties now and then get the whim to  have an separate Jharkhand and engage in economic boycotts.  Whenever they get such impulses, they totally destroy one part  of Bihar. During this period, government property is destroyed  methodically. Education in schools and colleges is stopped for  this reason. Travel is disrupted for weeks, buses and trucks are  burned, and roads and rail tracks are destroyed. Banks and post  offices are repeatedly made ugly by this destruction. Why do the  Jharkhand parties do this? When they are questioned about it,  they declare their actions to be valid by saying that they need  a separate Jharkhand and their economic boycotts to put the  pressure on the government.    Interestingly, since independence these leaders have been  demanding a separate Jharkhand composed of at least 16  tribal-majority districts. However, they have not been  successful in getting their demand accepted to this date.  Instead, each time they come out in the streets raising slogans  about sealing off Jharkhand or of economic boycotts they only  hurt themselves. Who will be affected if all education,  transportation and government work is stopped for weeks and  months? The people of this area, of course.    It is possible that Jharkhand leaders will argue when this  question is posed that one must lose something to gain  something. However, what will they gain? They say that the  tribal-majority districts are comparatively backward in this  region. The people still live in jungles there. Very little  development work has been done here compared to other parts of  the state. Women and laborers are exploited here. However, these  are not the problems that can be resolved by establishing a  separate state for the tribals. Also, which part of our country  is free from such problems? The noise that the Jharkhand leaders  make over this region is also useless. This area has seen a  great change since independence. If one looks at these 16  districts in Bihar, one will learn that ( with exceptions) there  is no indication that these districts are more backward than  other areas. Instead, these districts appear to be more  developed than other parts of the state. The roads here do not  appear to have holes like those in other districts.    All the major factories in Bihar are located in the  Jharkhand  region. 42 percent of the minerals and jungle products that are  produced in the state come from this area. The breeze of modern  development mostly blows in this part of the state. Most  computer work is being done here. All the governments until now  have done most of the development work in this region. Seeing  this, what valid reasons do they have to give backwardness as  the reason for a separate Jharkhand state?    If truth be told, it is central Bihar that has the most  problems. if the people of this area make noises because of  their problems, it could be considered legitimate. After  independence, this land of Buddha, Ashoka, Chanakya, and  Jarasandh has been most neglected. The bad condition of this  area spread from Bhagalpur to Buxar and Patna with its 20  million population indicates that no economic development  project was implemented appropriately in this part of Bihar  during the last 45 years. Whatever there was in the past has  also been neglected. As the result of this neglect, the  cigarette and gun factories in Munger, engine factory in  Jamalpur, cotton mill in Gaya, stone quarry industry in  Karbandia, Dalmia industries, cement factory in Bolia, sugar and  rice mills in Gaya, Gushru, Barsaliganj, Bihta and Dalmia Nagar  all have closed.    The irrigation system in central Bihar has also vanished  after independence. Before independence, the major landlords and  farmers in this region had spread a network of wells, canals,  and irrigations ditches. After 1947, when the land was taken  away from the landlords, they ignored the irrigation sources.  The situation is so bad in this region that only 60 percent of  the area has irrigation facilities. The Mosen water reservoir,  the Northern Koyal Irrigation Plan, Dhadhar Irrigation Plan,  Eastern Higher Sone Canal, Sarohar Canal, and the Yamuna Canal  all have been destroyed due to lack of maintenance.    Except for in Patna, there is no other major railway station  in central Bihar from where trains leave to large cities like  Delhi and Calcutta. No new railway line was built here after  independence. The people in this area have been feeling the need  to have a double line between Patna and Gaya and a new railway  line between Rajgir and Bodh Gaya. No attention has been paid to  this need, and there appears to be little hope of anything being  done now.    Two railways minister were from Bihar. One was Lalit Narayan  Mishra and the second was George Fernandes. Both of them had  become ministers after winning Lok Sabha seats from northern  Bihar. Therefore, they spent more time in improving the railways  situation in northern Bihar than in central Bihar. There always  had been a dearth of sharp leaders from central Bihar. Most of  the state and central cabinet members are from southern and  northern Bihar. If one legislator from this area became a  cabinet member by chance, he only paid attention to his own  personal growth. The people who would let the region rot are the  kind who get elected as ministers from this region. During the  eighties Aurangabad's Babu Satyander Narayan Singh was appointed  chief minister for some time. However, he did not do anything to  help this region.    The slight by the politicians and neglect by the government  have resulted in the Naxalite problem taking roots in central  Bihar. The people in rural areas in this region hide in their  homes after sunset. Major landlords are especially scared of the  Naxalites. They have formed several private armies known as the  Sunlight army, Vir Kunwar army, Lorik army, and Diamond army  etc. There are regular bloody skirmishes between these private  armies and the Naxalites. The Naxalites do not hesitate to  harass the poor. News about amputating their noses, ears, hands,  feet, and necks come from this area often.    You can wonder which area should campaign for a separate  state in such a situation. Will a region resolve all its problem  by just forming a separate state? Another important question in  this context is: If this region of Bihar with its mineral  products and factories is made into a separate Jharkhand, what  will be left in the rest of Bihar?</p>

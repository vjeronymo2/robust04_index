			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. Carlos Jeque, former vice president of the  Mozambique United Front-Democratic Convergence Party [Fumo-PCD],  has told SAVANA that he will enter the presidential elections  race as an independent candidate. Jeque, 41, is a lawyer. He  told SAVANA that his decision comes in the wake of advice given  by political and business individuals, adding that the latter  are, quote, worried about the absence of a civilian alternative  in view of their (?disappointment) in Dr. Domingos Arouca, whom  we all trusted until very recently, unquote.    President Chissano, Afnso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique  National Resistance, and FUMO-PCD President Domingos Arouca have  already announced that they will run for the presidency.</p>

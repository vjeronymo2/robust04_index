			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Retail sales dip prompts doubts on timing of rate rise Retail sales dipped last month, prompting some commentators to ask whether Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, had acted prematurely when he raised bank base rates by a half percentage point this week to scotch incipient inflation. Sales volumes fell an estimated, seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent between July and August, confounding City expectations of a 0.2 per cent rise, the Central Statistical Office reported. Compared with August last year there was a 2.9 per cent rise, a sharp slowdown compared with July's 3.8 per cent year-on-year growth. It was the second lowest annual growth rate this year. Mr Richard Brown, deputy director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce and an outspoken critic of Monday's interest rate rise, said the sales data 'confirmed the BCC's concerns about the fragility of consumer demand' and underlined the difficulties faced by retailers. The British Retail Consortium, which represents more than 90 per cent of the UK retail sector, said the figures confirmed 'an even more cautious approach to spending' among consumers after many months of modest and steady sales growth. Mr James May, the consortium's director-general, warned of an 'inevitable adverse impact on consumer confidence' from the base rate rise. In the City, Mr Don Smith, an economist with Midland Global Markets, said the drop in sales provided 'clear evidence' that the tax increases decided in last year's two budgets were taking effect. The figures 'resonate strongly with other evidence pointing to weakening consumer demand, such as car registrations, housing sales and consumer credit', he said. But Mr John Marsland, an analyst with UBS, said three months growth rates, which showed volume retail sales advancing at 3.3 per cent compared with the year before, 'remained very favourable'. The Treasury, while admitting that high street activity slackened a little last month, said retail sales volumes were continuing a steady upward trend. One official suggested that the flattening of sales in August could be a sign that growth was becoming better balanced, with exports and investment playing a bigger part in the recovery. Non-seasonally adjusted figures put the average weekly value of retail sales in August at Pounds 2.85bn, in line with the weekly average in recent months and 3.4 per cent higher than in August 1993. The figures helped ease fears of inflationary pressures in financial markets. Prices of government gilt-edged stocks rose, helped by the better tone of US and German bond markets, and the removal of some stock overhanging the market. On the Liffe futures exchange, the December long gilt future was at 99 21/32 in late trading, up  13/16 on the day. The FT-SE 100 index gained 32.9 points to close at 3,112.7, after seven consecutive days of decline. Trade, however, was mostly technically driven. Sterling recorded gains against the D-Mark, off-setting losses against the dollar and leaving its trade weighted index unchanged at 79.2. Details, Page 10 Bonds, Page 27 London stocks, Page 38</p>

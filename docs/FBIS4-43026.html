			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow (DPA) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin's unexpected trip to Mainz for a medical  examination nourished speculation in Moscow on 9 June that he  might resign before long. Two leading Moscow newspapers,  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, citing  unidentified circles, reported that Chernomyrdin was about to  resign for health reasons. In that case, First Deputy Prime  Minister Oleg Soskovets or former Russian Security Council  Chairman Yuriy Skokov could succeed him. Chernomyrdin said in  Germany, however, that he was in good health, and there were no  indications that he might be weary of his position.</p>

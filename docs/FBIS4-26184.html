			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Dissident Wang Dan's 48-hour hunger strike in  protest against police harassment has only made matters worse.  The security forces responded to the 25-year-old former student  leader's protest by stepping up their surveillance and further  restricting his already limited freedom of movement.    Throughout the hunger strike, six plain-clothes and  uniformed  officers were stationed at the gatehouse of Mr Wang's  residential block in Beijing, preventing unauthorised persons  from entering and stopping him from leaving. Even after his  hunger strike finished at 9 pm on Friday, the police remained in  position yesterday to ensure foreign reporters could not get to  see Mr Wang. Speaking by telephone, Mr Wang admitted his  protest had achieved no positive result and he was at a loss to  know what to do next. "I have no plans at the moment. I will  have to think about what I can do now," he said.    Unless he takes the drastic step of renouncing his  commitment  to the democracy movement in China and refrains from all  political comment there is little chance the security forces  will leave him alone.    Since his release from nearly four years in jail in February  last year, Mr Wang has been under routine police surveillance  and forced to leave Beijing on several sensitive political dates  and during the visits of high-ranking Western government  officials. The strain and the pressure of continual police  harassment is beginning to tell. Mr Wang cannot get a job  because of his political record and every time he writes a  commentary or talks to the foreign media, he is questioned by  the police. With the long-running battle over China's Most  Favoured Nation trading status now over Mr Wang can no longer  count on pressure from the West to help his situation.    Just about the only way out would be for Mr Wang to leave  China altogether and study abroad but then he runs the risk of  not being let back into China. The prospect of becoming a  political exile like Han Dongfang or Wang Juntao does not appeal  to the young democracy activist who is dedicated to improving  human rights in China.    Meanwhile, the wife of a man who tried to organise a non-  government labour organisation said he had been missing for  three weeks and was feared arrested. Police refused to confirm  or deny they detained Liu Nianchun, said his wife, Chu Hailan.  She said police only told her to "go home and wait for news".  Three other men who joined Mr Liu in trying to organise a  National Alliance to Protect Labourers' Rights were known to  have been arrested. They are Beijing University law professor  Yuan Hongbing, Wang Zhongqiu and Zhang Lin. Mr Wang was a  student of Professor Yuan, while Mr Zhang was a former student  activist during the 1989 democracy movement and later organised  workers and peasants in Anhui Province in central China.</p>

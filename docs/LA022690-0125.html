			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-COWBOYS OWNER BRIGHT ALMOST FIRED LANDRY IN '87  </P> <P> Former Dallas Cowboys owner H. R. (Bum) Bright says he wanted to sack Tom  Landry in 1987 but couldn't talk Tex Schramm into doing it.  </P> <P> A year after selling the Cowboys to Jerry Jones, Bright said his one regret is  that he didn't fire Landry himself. He didn't because Schramm, the team's  general manager at the time, told him he didn't have a replacement ready.  </P> <P> Jones continues to take criticism for firing Landry and installing Jimmy  Johnson, his longtime friend and former Arkansas Razorbacks teammate, as head  coach.  </P> <P> "If I had known there would have been this much heat over Tom, I'd have taken  it myself," Bright said Sunday in the Dallas Morning News.  </P> <P> "I know that Jerry doesn't deserve all this stuff. It wouldn't have been as  hard for me as it has been for Jerry, because he was the one continuing. I just  didn't realize," Bright said.  </P> <P> Bright praised Schramm as a "born promoter" and said he was responsible for  bringing success to the Cowboys. But Bright said Schramm also realized the  Cowboys were skidding downhill fast.  </P> <P> "Something needed to be done," Bright said. "A new direction was needed on the  coaching staff from Tom on down. But despite the fact he appears gruff at  times, Tex is a sentimentalist. He didn't have the stomach to do what needed to  be done."  </P> <P> Bright said Jones may be getting a bad rap about having handled Landry's firing  in a cold-hearted fashion. He said Jones had insisted two days before a news  conference to announce the team's sale and coaching changes that there would be  no deal until he personally talked to Landry.  </P> <P> On Friday, the day before the deal was finalized, Schramm joined Bright and  Jones at Bright's offices, and Schramm called Landry to inform him that Jones  was bringing in his own coach, Bright said.  </P> <P> Jones wanted to meet with Landry personally that afternoon, but the meetings  broke up late and Landry had already left the Cowboys' practice facility.  </P></p>

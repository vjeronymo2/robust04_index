			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: The markets will be watching for signs that Italian consumer price inflation has picked up significantly: they expect a 3.7 per cent rise in the index in the 12 months to August. In the UK, large revisions to second-quarter real GDP would be a surprise. Tuesday: French trade figures for June are expected to to show a Ffr7.0bn surplus, down slightly from the Ffr7.6bn recorded in May. Wednesday: Analysts expect US durable orders and shipments for July to have fallen back somewhat on the previous month's rise. That would provide a little more ammunition for those arguing that the economy is slowing by itself, and did not need last week's increase in interest rates. Thursday: August consumer price inflation figures for Japan are not expected to show that the downward pressure on prices is at an end. But the Bank of Japan shows little sign of considering this a cause for lower interest rates. Friday: The focus will be on the US, where preliminary real GDP figures for the second quarter are expected show the annual growth rate up slightly on the 3.7 per cent achieved in the first three months of 1994.</p>

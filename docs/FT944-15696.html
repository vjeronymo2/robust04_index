			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: New York The US bond market ended last week on a positive note following Friday's barrage of favourable news on inflation. Treasuries rallied after the government published figures showing only modest increases in consumer prices and retail sales in September. The market was also consoled by news that industrial production in September was unchanged and capacity utilisation had slipped slightly. After other favourable economic reports during the week, traders took the view that immediate pressure for an increase in interest rates had eased and the Fed would sit on its hands at least until the next meeting of its policy-making committee on November 15. With little in the way of sensitive data due in the next few days, analysts think bond prices will drift upwards. Few shocks are expected from the figures for business inventories today, the trade deficit on Wednesday or housing starts on Thursday. One possible danger point is the Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey, also due Thursday. MMS International forecasts that the net percentage of Philadelphia companies noting a business increase in October will have risen to 17.5 per cent from 14.8 per cent last month. If the pick-up in demand is accompanied by adverse readings on prices paid and prices received, fears of inflation could be reawakened.</p>

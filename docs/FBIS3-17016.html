			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk by </F> unidentified correspondent on 20 March; place not given --  recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, while everybody  in Ukraine is preparing for the early election of a new  Ukrainian parliament on 27 March and making predictions as to  what will happen on the 27 and who will be elected, there are  people who have already voted at polling stations -- for  example, at polling station No. 7 in Moskovskyy district, Kiev.  Those are people who are unable to vote on 27 March and who  can, according to the law, vote now. Thus, the election has  begun. Tell us, please, can Ukraine survive such a multi-round  election? The first round is unlikely to yield a full house;  the second round has been mathematically predicted to result in  [?one-third] of deputies elected. And then what, third, fourth,  fifth?    [Kravchuk] First of all, no third round is foreseen by the  law. Elections would then have to be postponed, extended, or  deferred until next year. This problem is not a simple one.  But still, I hope that people will vote for worthy candidates.  Somehow I believe they will, because they should know that this  is an important stage in the reform of the entire political  system. If we get a new parliament, and if the new parliament  at once passes a law on the local power structure, on the powers  of local executives, their functions and their relations with  the center, the Supreme Council, the president, and the Cabinet  of Ministers, and finally passes a law on the president and what  kind of president we are to elect, then the presidential  election can take place in June. But if this election fails to  take place, and these laws are not passed, we will wind up in a  very tight corner, as I said before, a situation that is  dangerous from the point of who is to govern the state and how  it will be done.    Locally, we have authority: There are presidential  representatives, administrations, councils, and executive  structures [word indistinct]. They govern the processes  locally. In the center, there is the Cabinet of Ministers, the  president, and the Supreme Council, which is about to be  elected. According to the Constitution, the council can extend  its powers, but this article of the Constitution was passed  dozens of years ago, when nobody had any idea that such a  situation may occur during elections to the first and second  Supreme Council. That is why it's just written there this way,  but how do you implement it now, when a constituency can wind up  with two deputies, one elected in 1990, and the other in 1994?    [Correspondent] And their relations are not stipulated in  the  law?    [Kravchuk] Not stipulated anywhere. So it's not a simple  thing. Not a simple thing at all. We shall see another way out  when the new Supreme Council is already elected. But what will  happen is difficult to predict.    [Correspondent] But 27 March will be even a more difficult  day for the residents of Crimea than for the rest of Ukraine,  because Crimea's top executive, President Yuriy Meshkov, plans  to conduct a poll on 27 March. There has been a lot of talk  about this poll on the air.    [Kravchuk] I talked about it, too.    [Correspondent] And about your decree which abolished some  of  its premises. But a lot will depend on -- and I quote the U.S.  Embassy press statement -- Kiev's considerable self-control.  Does Kiev have that considerable self-control, Leonid  Makarovych?    [Kravchuk] Of course it does. Because, first of all, this  self-control needs to be understood in the way that we are  acting in accordance with the constitution and the laws of  Ukraine. It is very important. Whereas the president of Crimea  has exceeded his powers -- that is, has ignored the law, both  the Ukrainian one and his own -- the Ukrainian president is  acting clearly within the framework of the law. Thus, if you  put both of these documents on the scales, then you will see  that we are acting clearly in accordance with the law, while the  president of Crimea has violated the norms of both Ukraine's and  his own law. And that is dangerous. Our self-control shows in  the fact that we are staying always within the law. The Crimean  president's lack of self-control in this case shows in the fact  that he wants to break the law and he is breaking it. I already  said this, and I want to say once again that the main thing that  needs to be done in Crimea today is to solve economic problems.    A group of Crimean [word indistinct] led by the vice premier  worked here for a long time together with our law experts. We  met them half-way with a new formula for the Crimean budget.  Crimea needs to contribute 6,000 bn [billion] karbovantsi for  general Ukrainian needs. But to give them an opportunity to  balance out their income and expenditure, we allowed Crimea to  contribute only 2,700 bn; that is less than half the amount.  And the rest of the money will stay in Crimea, so there will be  a balance between income and expenditure. Besides, Ukraine is  contributing over 100 bn for the Crimean-Tatar problems, out of  its own budget. I understand, and we said this at the meeting,  that we should focus our attention on economic problems and  start solving them. As for powers, or other things, they are  being considered now as proposals and will be gradually solved,  and even some borderline cases concerning the division of powers  will be solved to some extent in favor of Crimea, not in favor  of Ukraine.    But this poll, I think, is aimed at getting the Crimean  population politically charged. So as not to merely talk, but  to quote figures and facts, saying, this is what the public  wants, and Ukraine is withholding that. I think if the  president is a legitimate one, and this is being claimed today,  that he is legitimate and must act within a legitimate  framework. This is the main road. A legitimate president  cannot break the law.    [Correspondent] There is a famous quote, which was also  recalled by former U.S. President Richard Nixon after a meeting  with you, which is your phrase: The president of Crimea may not  obey the president of Ukraine but he must obey.    [Kravchuk] Please, don't. You know, I am very careful about  subordination. I am very keen to see that people subordinate to  me, whom I am responsible for, are people capable of meeting  that responsibility. Then I am not worried. I am not keen to  rule over people who can break the law any time or bring about  unpredictable developments. Therefore, I don't even want to put  it this way in this case. And there is no need for that. But  the law, the Constitution, is beyond my will -- it is the will  of the law.    [Correspondent] You know, Leonid Makarovych, this U.S.  Embassy press statement also says that if one is to believe that  the new political leadership of Crimea aims for Crimea's  economic well-being, it would be better ensured by Crimea's  active participation in the program of all-around economic  cooperation the United States is starting together with Ukraine.  This statement was made after your official visit to the United  States.    [Kravchuk] By the way, there is one fine point here. We  understand that Crimea has an [?informal] status of a resort, a  recreation center, etc. It can become an attraction for ideas,  capital, and so on, to turn it into a world-famous recreation  base. It is possible. When Crimeans speak of a free economic  zone, certain economic problems, of giving them more rights and  opportunities for attracting capital, they have our support.  But there is one point. And it must be understood in Crimea.  Nobody will make a step without Ukraine's consent. If you talk  about serious investment, the involvement of international  financial structures, the European Bank, World Bank, the  International Monetary Fund, and others, these organizations  will not make a single step in relation to Crimea without  Ukraine's consent. Thus, this can happen only within the  framework of Ukraine.    We regard Ukraine as a system and Crimean problems within  this system. If someone should think today that the government  or the president of Crimea can directly approach international  financial structures, international state structures, other  states' governments, it is an illusion. Nobody will do anything  in this respect without Ukraine. And everyone must understand  and be aware of that.    [Correspondent] Ukraine, it is an obvious fact, adheres to  the principles of the CSCE and other international legal norms  in international relations. And if Meshkov is violating our  constitution and our laws, he is violating the CSCE principles;  therefore, this is extended to the extraterritorial level.    [Kravchuk] There was a program [words indistinct] saying  there are problems of security in Europe, there are established  international principles, there are norms. And the most painful  problem of all is that of territorial integrity and sovereignty.  This is the dividing line. This line determines whether there  is to be peace or confrontation.    No one oversteps this dividing line. (?If you) [word  indistinct] (?with) common sense and realistic policy, you do  not overstep it. You know (?where this will lead to).    (?So) I would like to emphasize this so that everybody  understands: Ukraine does not set itself the task of obtaining  something from Crimea at all costs. We want (?both) Crimea and  (?Ukraine) to tackle their problems. We shall help Crimea so it  tackles them itself. That is what I would like most of all. It  primarily applies to the economic issue. But whereas it was  stated at the outset that it was the economic problems that were  the basis...[pauses] (?They say) [word indistinct] political  confrontation and the question of where to go and for Crimea who  to be with and so on and so forth. First, this will not make it  possible to settle economic issues and, second, this will not  yield any results. Everybody [words indistinct].    [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, I thank you very much for  taking part in our program.    [Kravchuk] Can I raise a question myself?    [Correspondent] Please.    [Kravchuk] I found this, by the way, when looking at the  questions given to me today at Ostankino. One of them -- I  forget the name of our citizen from Lugansk Oblast -- this is  what this citizen -- or was it she? -- asks me: Leonid  Makarovych, I voted for you, the citizen says. I voted for you.  In our oblast now rumors are being spread around that you have  built yourself a dacha in Switzerland. Tell us whether this is  true. I was asked this question, incidentally, by a trade union  leader from Zaporozhye last year. I officially answered that  the president had no dacha in Switzerland. He is not building  it and is not going to do this. I use all the conveniences of  life that the Supreme Council provided me with. (?I would like  to repeat that) there was an official resolution adopted by the  Supreme Council, on (?27) minimum wages, a state dacha in  Koncha-Zaspa, transport, medical treatment, and everything that  is written there. There is nothing else.    I know, however, this: (?Under) the system of ideology that  you and I studied, there even used to be groups which were  called groups (?on the distribution of interdepartmental  finances). It is known how painful this detail is as perceived  by the people. You see, they say he came to power and at once  builds a dacha in Switzerland. They even say I transferred it to  my mother. She died thirteen years ago in 1981. There was such  a question and this is my answer to it: The Ukrainian president  has no dacha in Switzerland. He is not building it, was not  building it and is not going to do this.</p>

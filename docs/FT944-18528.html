			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Milan With the mostly good corporate reporting season now over, the debate over the government's budget proposals will rumble on this week. James Capel says that the dominant issue in its European equity strategy is one of earnings recovery, which it expects to support substantial market advances over the next year to 18 months. The broker forecasts a 50 per cent recovery in earnings per share in 1995 in the Italian corporate sector, driven both by volume demand and a reduction in variable costs. James Capel believes that the short-term risks remain considerable and could depress market performance further. The heterogeneous nature of the ruling coalition and opposition from the unions might soften the proposed budget cuts aimed at correcting the fiscal imbalance. The long-term outlook, with recovery in output and earnings, and a budgetary position that was certainly better than that of Sweden, could be promising for equity market returns, says the broker. At present, however, it maintains the view that other European markets offer growth prospects and value at lower risk, although individual stocks have good growth potential.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Siegburg/Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German business  representatives in Moscow seem to be increasingly at risk from  the Russian mafia. This was the gist of an alarming telegram  sent by the German Embassy in Moscow to the German Foreign  Ministry headquarters, according to the `Bonn-Info' information  service. Today a Foreign Ministry spokesman was unwilling either  to deny or confirm the telegram for the moment because of the  diplomatic nature of the message.    In the embassy's view, there is a "strong probability" of  German associations and firms "coming into contact with  organized crime sooner or later," particularly in Moscow and St.  Petersburg. That only left a "choice between paying or  leaving." The mafia was trying to plant "bookkeepers" to  monitor company income to secure their "tax share" in the form  of protection money.    Firms with retail outlets or storage buildings in particular  were therefore coming to arrangements with blackmailers to  prevent the risk of their buildings being "torched." The  blackmailers were also frequently threatening the lives of the  businessmen and their families. In its telegram, the embassy  raises the question of whether the German Government should  advise against business activity in Russia in the event of  growing risks. Protection from the Russian authorities was  "insufficiently guaranteed".</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Observer: FAO's food for thought Spare a thought for Patrick Cunningham, one of the unsuccessful candidates for the top job at the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Cunningham got knocked out in the first round of voting yesterday after collecting just one of the 163 votes. So how come 59-year-old Cunningham is so unpopular? The man from Ireland has an impressive record as director of FAO's animal production and health division. Last year, he headed a successful campaign in North Africa to eradicate a deadly animal disease known as New World Screw-worm. But in an election campaign pamphlet, FAO - The Issues, Cunningham was rash enough to suggest certain reforms that he believed were necessary at FAO. And there is scarcely anyone with even a passing knowledge of FAO who does not believe that reforms are necessary. So this seemed nothing new. But the present FAO boss, Edouard Saouma, took a dim view. He promptly cancelled Cunningham's travel budget, thus rather restricting his campaigning. Worse still, he did not renew the Irishman's three-year contract when it expired in August this year. Given his successful attack on the New World Screw-worm, renewal would normally have been automatic. Seems a funny way to run an election.</p>

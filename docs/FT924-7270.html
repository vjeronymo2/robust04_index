			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (10): Polite but confusing capital  -Tokyo AT FIRST sight Tokyo can seem a dense, bewildering city. A jumble of confusing signs, large neon-lit avenues criss-crossed by a warren of dimly lit narrow alleys. Too many people come - or do not come - because they are fearful of Tokyo's complexity and apparent impenetrability. For Europeans especially, who are used to wide streets and squares, to come to terms with Tokyo will require some work. But in essence, as long as people are confident it is one of the easiest capitals to use, at least on the surface. One of its main attractions is its safety. No need to worry constantly about your bag being stolen by a passing mugger, even late at night. It is also in most respects - such as its excellent subway system - a highly efficient, well-organised place, full of polite people. Most visitors start at Narita international airport, which is a relatively quiet oasis about 90km out of the city. A taxi into Tokyo will be very expensive. Better either to take the train into Ueno junction and then get on the subway or one of the limousine buses which will take you to your hotel or the bus terminal near the heart of the city. Tokyo has a wide variety of hotels from the expensive high-quality Okura, opposite the US embassy, to cheap guest houses. An excellent and convenient hotel which offers a range of rooms, some with views over the Imperial Palace moat, is the Fairmount Hotel. For the adventurous there are many excellent ryokan, traditional Japanese-style inns, which serve excellent food such as the Ohgaiso in Ueno park which has a 19th Century house in its courtyard. Getting around Tokyo can be alternately very easy and hugely difficult. The most important tip: if you do not know exactly where you are going, never leave home without a map. If you are meeting someone, get them to send you a map beforehand. The reason is simple. Getting from one part of the city to another - Otemachi, the financial district to fashionable Omote Sandoto, for instance  -is disarmingly simple. The subway is cheap, highly efficient and has signs in English. Taxis are not expensive but take longer. If you use the subway make sure you get out of the station at the right exit. Most subway stations have many exits, often a long way away from one another. Getting out at the right exit helps a lot. There are no street signs on the many minor streets and alleyways. If you do not have a map you can spend hours wandering around searching for your destination. There are no end of good places to drink and eat in Tokyo, whether in the Ginza main shopping area, Roppongi the night club district, or out in the neon-lit rabbit warren of Shinjuku, home to the main red light district. There is no theatre district to speak of such as Broadway and fewer cinemas. If you want to watch an English or French language film you should be able to find one in the Tokyo Journal listings magazine. If you are staying in the city over a weekend, try to get out for a day. Take the shinkansen bullet train to historic Kyoto or the local line from Shinjuku which will take you to the temples of Kamakura by the sea.</p>

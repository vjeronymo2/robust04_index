			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / International Company News: Procter &amp; Gamble in Russian deal PROCTER &amp; Gamble, the Cincinnati-based consumer products group, has reached an agreement which will lead to the manufacture of P&amp;G detergent products in Russia. The announcement comes as some big US consumer product companies are delaying expansion plans in the former Soviet Union because of the turbulent situation there and lack of infrastructure. P&amp;G stressed that the detergent deal does not have significant financial implications. The agreement has been signed with PO Novomoskovskbytkhim, a state-owned industrial complex at Novomoskovsk, about 130 miles south of Moscow. The agreement provides for P&amp;G to supply detergent formulations and technical assistance. P&amp;G, whose detergent brands include Ariel, Mr Proper and Dash, has been selling products in St Petersburg for about a year through a joint venture with the university there. The products, however, are made in Europe and imported. Under the new agreement, the products will be made at the Novomoskovsk plant.</p>

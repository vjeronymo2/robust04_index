			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Senior officer tells MPs RAF hopes voluntary redundancies will meet manpower reductions AS DEMONSTRATORS protested at Westminster yesterday against Royal Air Force plans to scrap one of the last Vulcan bombers, a senior RAF officer told MPs the service hopes to reach its target for manpower reductions through further voluntary redundancies, David White writes. Air Vice-Marshal Tony Bagnall, assistant chief of the air staff, told the Commons defence committee that a second tranche of redundancies was under discussion but that the RAF hoped to achieve its requirements 'without resorting to compulsory redundancies'. He described as 'alarmist' reports suggesting that many senior officers were facing dismissal. Under plans drawn up by the government two years ago, RAF personnel are due to be cut to from 89,000 to 75,000 by 1995. Cuts in support services could reduce this level still further. An initial redundancy plan affecting 969 jobs was oversubscribed by applicants.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Miners reject severance deal About 1,300 coalminers may be facing early redundancy after refusing to accept a British Coal deal linking severance terms with flexible working. Although there will be no threat to their jobs before coal privatisation in December, they are likely to be among the first targets if the new owners consider rationalisation necessary. Those who refuse to sign would be relatively cheap to make redundant. They would be entitled to the statutory minimum redundancy payment of less than Pounds 6,300, while their 12,000 colleagues who have accepted the package will be eligible for up to Pounds 27,000. The deal also offered one-off payments of Pounds 6,000 but obliged miners who accepted it to work shifts and at weekends. Most of the miners who refused to sign are based at Kellingley, Maltby, Stillingfleet and Longannet. The deadline for accepting the deal, which was opposed by unions, was Wednesday. Meanwhile British Coal said yesterday that a new processing facility at its Gascoigne mine in Selby would be able to supply 750,000 tons of coal a year for the domestic and industrial markets. Although the corporation said the coal was intended to replace imports, the development will worry private companies which have taken over nine pits closed by British Coal in the past 18 months. The private miners are aiming their products at the industrial and domestic markets. British Coal also said that it was exploring the feasibility of extending workings at its Whitemoor pit in Selby. The corporation said extending the mine's reserves beyond the River Derwent would enable it to operate well into the next century.</p>

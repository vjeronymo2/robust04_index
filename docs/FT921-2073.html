			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Parties clash on nationalisation LABOUR ACTED last night to quash Tory attacks over its plans for the water and electricity companies by ruling out claims that majority shareholdings in the utilities would be bought in the short term. However, party officials refused to deny categorically that the British National Grid and the water companies could be nationalised in the longer term if they failed to take consumer and environmental interests adequately into account. Instead of buying majority stakes in the companies, a Labour government would introduce legislation to regulate both sectors. These would give it powers to control prices and environmental practices. The dispute over Labour nationalisation plans came after Mr Chris Patten, Tory chairman, seized on remarks by Mr Roy Hattersley on BBC radio to describe Labour's policy as 'a shambles'. The Labour deputy leader had said his party would, 'when the time comes', buy back water shares at 'appropriate value.' His words were quickly denied by Mr Neil Kinnock, who stated definitively that Labour would not use public money to buy water shares. Yesterday Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, again confirmed the leader's position. But in a letter to Mr Kinnock distributed to the press, Mr Patten accused the Labour leadership of being at odds with its manifesto, which talks of public control of water being 'a priority'. His attack came as Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, challenged the ability of Labour's shadow Budget to fund spending commitments into the 1993-94 fiscal year. He said that Mr John Smith's calculations depended on privatisation proceeds that would only be available to a government ready to continue with privatisation programmes. Labour officials countered, however, that the government's planning for a second tax year were based on incomplete figures.</p>

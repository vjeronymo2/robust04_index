			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Telecom Italia prepares to demerge mobile phone arm Telecom Italia, Italy's state-controlled telecommunications operating company, yesterday gave the go-ahead for the demerger of its mobile telephone operations in the first half of next year. Telecom Italia's shareholders should approve the operation in late April or early May next year, and shares in the new cellular phone company will immediately be quoted on the Italian stock exchange. Investors will receive shares in the new company in proportion to their existing holdings in Telecom Italia. That means that about 60 per cent of the mobile phone operation will be owned by Stet, Telecom Italia's state-controlled parent company, which should itself be privatised later in 1995. The remainder of the mobile phone company's shares will go to Telecom Italia's existing minority shareholders. Analysts estimate that Telecom Italia's mobile phone business could be worth as much as L9,000bn (Dollars 5.8bn). The demerger is the latest step in the restructuring of Italy's state-controlled telecoms sector, which began earlier this year with the merger between five telecoms operating companies - including Sip, the main domestic operator - to form Telecom Italia. Telecom Italia's mobile telephone business will soon face competition from the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium, headed by Olivetti, the Italian computer group, which won Italy's second cellular phone licence in March. Both companies hope to capitalise on the extraordinary popularity of mobile telephones in Italy, where they are known colloquially as 'telefonini'. So widespread is their use that Telecom Italia recently distributed a booklet on telefonino etiquette. Yesterday, Telecom Italia's directors also agreed that from the beginning of next year, the group's satellite communication activities would be transferred into a new unquoted company, jointly owned by Stet and Telecom Italia. Both operations meet the requirements of European Union directives on the continuing liberalisation of the telecoms sector. In sectors already open to competition - such as satellite services, and mobile telephony - the companies responsible for those activities must be managed separately from the main state-controlled monopoly.</p>

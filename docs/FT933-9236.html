			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Turkish union in wage challenge TURKEY'S leading union, representing some 550,000 workers in public sector industries such as coal and steel, is to strike from August 25 in a direct challenge to the pay restraint policies of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the new prime minister, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. Turk-Is, the country's largest workers' federation, is demanding average pay increases of 85 per cent. This compares with inflation at an annual rate of 73 per cent in July and an earlier pay demand of 95 per cent. Public sector pay restraint is central to Mrs Ciller's efforts to bring down the public sector borrowing requirement, which is projected at around 15 per cent of gross national product in 1993, and is the main cause of Turkey's persistently high inflation. Mrs Ciller warned earlier that the budget deficit could reach TL150,000bn (Pounds 8.7bn), three times the target for the year. Any failure to curb wage demands will increase operating losses of the state sector industries and thus fuel the PSBR. However, the prime minister must be wary of alienating union support at a time of considerable retrenchment in the state industries and ahead of her plans for a large-scale privatisation programme.

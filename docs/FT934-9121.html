			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / World Trade News: BAe in talks over Swedish fighter British Aerospace is negotiating to become a partner in Sweden's latest jet fighter, the JAS-39 Gripen, David White, Defence Correspondent, reports. The British company has confirmed it is in discussions with Saab-Scania, part of the Swedish consortium building the lightweight fighter, which is already in production. A deal may involve component supplies and marketing support. BAe was already associated in development of the Gripen, and provided the first sets of wings. The Gripen, described by its manufacturers as the world's first lightweight multi-role combat aircraft, was set back by accidents involving a test aircraft in 1989 and then the first production aircraft, which crashed in August because of problems with its sophisticated electronic flight control system. Saab is a partner in the venture along with Volvo Flygmotor, Ericsson and FFV. The consortium has firm orders for 140 of the aircraft for the Swedish air force, for delivery between this year and 2001. BAe, which has a strong foothold in the Middle East and Asia, would seek to market the Gripen beyond the traditional group of Swedish military aircraft clients, which has been restricted to other Scandinavian countries and Austria.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Raid for Tootal stock EUROPE'S largest textile group Coats Viyella mounted what could be the final attack on its fellow textile company Tootal yesterday. Coats raised the terms of its offer and then tried to win control more quickly by raiding the market for stock. Around 10 1/2 m shares were believed to have been bought at the same level as the new bid price, with Coats willing to purchase 65m which would take its shareholding over 50 per cent. Trading volume in Tootal jumped to 22m shares. The only surprise about the latest offer was the cash element. All-paper terms had been confidently anticipated, but Coats increased the original bid of 65p cash per share to 80p and threw in for good measure the Tootal final dividend of 3.05p; there is an alternative offer, comprising a mixture of shares and cash. Mr Mark Finnie of Hoare Govett echoed the sentiments of several analysts by saying: 'At this level I would expect the deal to go through'. Tootal closed 5 up at 84p and Coats 3 down at 138p. Allied-Lyons rise The inconsistencies of the wider market failed to deter another flurry of speculative activity in drinks and food major Allied-Lyons. Stories began circulating again of a bid from Hanson, although a more plausible reason for the upturn was a buy recommendation from an influential broking house. A sector researcher described Allied as 'the best sitting duck in the market'. When the risks and rewards are weighed up, he said, there are likely to be outbreaks of speculative enthusiasm. The early retirement of both the chairman and chief executive of Allied-Lyons is awaiting confirmation. Cynics point to the group being rudderless in terms of management, and this may have given rise to the latest round of speculation. Allied settled 18 ahead at 545p on turnover of 4m shares. Drug patent dispute Glaxo fell 27 to 1097p as sentiment was depressed by a law suit from rival SmithKline Beecham alleging Glaxo's anti-nausea drug Zofran infringed its patent. Glaxo said it would defend its position. Analysts played down the issue. Mr Robin Gilbert at James Capel said the lawsuit was unlikely to return to the headlines for some time as the case progressed through the US legal system. Mr Steve Plag at County NatWest said the two companies would probably come to some royalty agreement which would have 'miniscule' financial consequences. SmithKline firmed a penny to 805p, a good performance given the dollar's retreat during the session. Traders said Glaxo had actually gained ground in dollar terms. BET reaps reward BET, the business services group, began to reap the rewards yesterday of presentations to US investment institutions. According to the market, these have been well received and transatlantic buying interest has since increased to quite substantial volumes. American support contributed to high turnover yesterday of 4.7m shares, although demand from UK investors also rose. The latter were starting to focus on the yield, exactly 10 per cent when trading opened yesterday. This is high for a Footsie stock. BET said in February when the shares were under attack that it saw no reason to expect a reduction in total dividend for the year to March 31, 1991. The group should report preliminary figures in mid-June. BET shares ended 9 higher at 182p. The stoic performance of British Gas shares on Monday, in response to the company's acceptance of Ofgas's revised pricing formula, gave way yesterday. Domestic and overseas institutions were heavy sellers of the stock after the bearish response by the press to the Ofgas moves. Gas shares dipped to 235p and closed a net 8 off at 236p on 15m turnover. Exploration and production (E &amp; P) stocks bore the brunt of persistent selling pressure generated by a bearish review of the sub-sector by Strauss Turnbull. The broker acknowledged it had taken a pessimistic view of E &amp; P issues, with the emphasis on the large downside potential in Lasmo, 8 off at 350p, and Enterprise, 4 easier at 560p. Strauss's only positive recommendations in the area were Premier and Clyde, whose shares have already sharply underperformed, Strauss said. Ultramar fell to 309 1/2 p before closing a net 7 lower at 312p, with an attempted placing of around 2m shares at 315p only partially successful; the Seaq delayed ticker showed a line of 768,000 shares traded for cash at 311p. Suggestions that institutions had been unravelling the Water Package and selling on some of the constituents ahead of tomorrow's local elections put the water sector under renewed downward pressure. Specialists said the selling had come from UK and overseas funds. The Package dropped 43 to Pounds 2940. Of the individual stocks, there was significant selling of Welsh Water, 7 lower at 319p, Yorkshire, also 7 off at 305p, and Thames, 6 cheaper at 305p. The electricity issues held up well, albeit in thin trading. Manweb was prominent, up 4 at 237p, as was Seeboard, which climbed the same amount to 195p. Kingfisher was boosted after the Court of Appeal lifted an injunction banning B &amp; Q, its home improvements chain, from opening on Sundays. The injunction against Wickes' building supplies was also removed. Kingfisher firmed 2 to 497p, while Wickes gained 2 at 60p. Boots, which with WH Smith (up 4 at 374p), jointly own the Do It All home improvements chain, put on 3 to 369p, although they were not involved in yesterday's legal action. Asda continued to weaken as speculation about poor trading company's meetings with brokers last week has done little to arrest the growing belief that the food retailer is being squeezed by J. Sainsbury and Tesco. Asda closed a penny lower at 119p; the shares have fallen 11 per cent since the middle of April. Unilever was off 10 at 738p as investors continued to switch out of the plc and into the NV shares, which are quoted in the Netherlands and New York. The shares were also depressed by suggestions that a broker would lower its profits forecast. There was an increase in activity in NatWest during the afternoon, with the shares rallying to close a shade better on the day at 325p, after 320p; turnover totalled 8.2m shares. Midland, ahead of tomorrow's annual meeting, lost 7 to 215p on 3.5m. First National Finance fell 12 to 193p after a broker's downgrading. William Baird was affected more by the prospect of greater liquidity in the stock, said traders, than the cash call of Pounds 39m through a rights issue. The shares, previously tightly held, dropped 20 to 238p. A confident statement and increased dividend distribution outweighed slightly lower annual profits from Yule Catto, and at the close the stock was 10 higher at 143p. The company expects to maintain momentum both in earnings and dividend growth, providing recessionary conditions do not deteriorate further. The warning at yesterday's annual meeting that interim profits 'will fall significantly short' of those achieved in the same period last year lowered Torday &amp; Carlisle 36 to 118p. Automated Security Holdings, the London-based security systems group, slipped 6 to 223p after announcing its intention to issue Pounds 60m worth of convertible capital bonds, yielding 9.5 per cent and convertible in 2006 at 250p a share. ASH accompanied the news with a confident statement on current trading, which it said showed turnover in the first four months of the year ahead of the same period last year. ASH said it was raising the money to take advantage of growth opportunities in Europe and the US, adding that it had applied for a US listing for its ordinary shares. Greycoat fell 11 to 327p as brokers continued to trim their forecasts ahead of the final results expected in June. Smith New Court cut its net asset value estimate for 1990/91 to 500p from 560p, bringing it in line with other brokers. Office rental values in central London are still weakening and show no signs of recovering this year, according to Smith. Evered Bardon fell to 92 1/2 p immediately following the preliminary figures, but later steadied to close a net 4 off at 94p. Specialists said the group would struggle to achieve current year profits above Pounds 30m and that a rights issue to reduce its gearing of around 60 per cent could be expected in the not-too-distant future.

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: BISHOP INC. REPORTS LOSS OF $511,000 IN 3RD QUARTER  </P> <P> Bishop Inc., an Agoura Hills supplier of engineering and architectural design  products, reported a fiscal third-quarter loss of $511,000, compared with a  year-earlier loss of $330,000.  </P> <P> The latest loss came on a slight drop in Bishop's revenue in the quarter that  ended June 30, to $2.37 million from $2.44 million. Bishop said it had expected  its losses to increase because the company has been restructuring its  operations to compete more effectively, but that it expects to cut the losses  beginning in the current quarter.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Bishop lost $872,000 compared  with a $393,000 loss a year earlier, and its nine-month revenue fell to $7.32  million from $7.53 million.  </P></p>

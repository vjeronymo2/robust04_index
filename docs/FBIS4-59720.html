			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Damascus Welcomes Washington Pledge </F> To Achieve Progress in Negotiations This Year"]    [Excerpts] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Syrian sources said  yesterday that the U.S. Administration's announcement of its  commitment to achieve "major progress" in the peace process this  year "is encouraging and positive, and we hope it will find its  way to real implementation." However, they pointed out that  progress depends on "pressures which Washington should put on  Tel Aviv to comply with the full withdrawal from the Golan."    On U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tour of the  region in a few days, the sources said that it is designed to  convey ideas between Tel Aviv and Damascus. The Yitzhaq Rabin  government had "requested some time to consider the Syrian  ideas." They added that "while Syria makes it a condition that  Israeli forces withdraw from all the Golan before any discussion  of peace or security, Israel gives priority to security and  peace, saying that the withdrawal can take place later and in  stages, with a view to testing Syria's good intentions."  [passage omitted]    Syrian Foreign Ministry sources have told AL-HAYAH that  pro-Israeli parties in the U.S. Administration are working to  halt the development of bilateral relations between Damascus and  Washington, and to keep Syria's name on the U.S. lists  concerning "drugs, terrorism, and human rights."    The sources told AL-HAYAH that these decisions conflict with  previous U.S. positions, as the drugs list was issued days after  a meeting between Minister Faruq al-Shar' and Robert Pelletreau,  assistant U.S. secretary of state for Middle Eastern affairs,  during which they discussed this question in detail. The  sources said that Pelletreau pledged to Syrian officials "to  remove Syria's name from the list. But the reality was  different -- which astonished Syrian officials."    A Syrian official has reiterated Damascus' demand that  Israel  withdraw from all the Golan Heights it has been occupying since  the 1967 war as a condition for achieving any progress in the  peace negotiations. He said: "Israel must announce its  willingness to withdraw completely from the Golan and to  dismantle the settlements before there can be any discussion of  peace and security. Israel must understand this well."    He added: "No one can force Syria to take any position that  conflicts with its principles and aims. Syria wants an  honorable peace that guarantees security for all states in the  region."</p>

Represented at the TCDC meeting were 26 countries from  Africa, Asia and Latin America. A Chinese delegation also  attended the meeting.    This is the first international conference held in Nigeria  since the Abacha administration took over power in mid-November  last year.    Initiated under the United Nations Development Program, the  TCDC is aimed at promoting cooperation among developing  countries.    At the opening ceremony, Nigerian Head of State General Sani  Abacha said TCDC "is a means of promoting cultural and  tech-nological exchanges among developing countries".    Abacha said the TCDC emerged as a new dimension in  international cooperation for development which allowed  developing countries to achieve national and collective  self-reliance.    At the closing ceremony, Nigerian minister of national  planning S.B. Daniyan described the TCDC as a means of national  and regional growth and such cooperation is needed to address  resource limitations in developing countries.    Reached by XINHUA on the phone, Huang Zhaohong, who headed  the Chinese delegation to the meeting, said in Abuja that a  total of 280 cooperation agreements were concluded by the end of  the meeting.    China has reached 64 cooperation agreements with Benin,  Cuba,  Gambia, Nigeria and Thailand, said Huang, who is also economic  and commercial counsellor in the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria.    With the Nigerian delegation alone, the Chinese delegation  has signed 57 such agreements in agriculture, industry and  technology. "This is the first time for China to have TCDC  agreements with Nigeria," he said.    "The Chinese delegation ranks first in reaching cooperation  agreements with other nations," he said.    In a speech delivered at the closing ceremony Li Wanming, a  woman member of the Chinese delegation, said the Chinese  Government attaches a great importance to cooperation among  developing countries.    Meanwhile, she also spoke highly of the role of the United  Nations Development Program [UNDP] in accelerating social and  economic development in developing countries.    China began to take part in the UNDP activities in October  1972. In September 1979, the UNDP set up a permanent  representative office in China.</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Home repossession action increases HOME repossession orders issued by county courts in England and Wales increased by 35 per cent to 74,079 last year from 54,718 in 1990, the Lord Chancellor's office reported yesterday. Applications for orders by lenders rose from 145,317 in 1990 to 186,786 last year. The hardest-hit areas include south London, with 2,306 orders issued in Croydon alone. Other badly affected areas were Birmingham, Portsmouth and Southend-on-Sea. The figures were broken into quarterly totals by the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which reported a marked change in the fourth quarter of last year. Applications for orders by lenders dropped to 42,888 from 51,031 in the third quarter. Orders made fell to 18,171 in the last quarter after rising through the year to a peak of 20,218 in the third quarter. The Building Societies Association said that it expected the 1991 total for repossessions to be 80,000, but Mr Mark Boleat, its director-general, said that the figures for the last quarter 'confirm the impression from lenders that the increase in repossessions has stopped and is hopefully on a downward trend'. The BSA said there were 43,890 repossessions for the whole of 1990 and 36,610 in the first half of last year. A repossession order does not always lead to action against the householder. Many repossessions also go ahead without a court order. As many as half of last year's repossessions were voluntary, such as when the owner hands in the keys of the property. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing finance analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the stock-broker, said: 'Voluntary repossessions are a unique feature of this housing recession.' The acceleration in repossessions last year prompted the government to announce a mortgage-rescue scheme last December and to suspend stamp duty on purchases of under Pounds 250,000 until August. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said of the figures: 'This puts to rest the claim by John Major that his government has stopped repossessions. If the current trend continues, up to half a million people could be faced with repossession in the two-year period to the end of this year.'</p>

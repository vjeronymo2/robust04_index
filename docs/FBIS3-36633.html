This was said by spokesman for Moscow's  secret services, Aleksey Kandaurov, who granted PANORAMA the  following interview.    [Bigazzi] How will the services be reorganized following the  decision to abolish the Security Ministry, formerly the KGB?    [Kandaurov] Yeltsin's decree sets out the broad outlines of  the functions and structures of the renewed special services --  the struggle against the espionage and subversive activities of  foreign services; the struggle against terrorism, against  illegal armed groups, against movements with extremist leanings,  against drugs and arms trafficking, and against corruption and  smuggling.    [Bigazzi] Is there a real threat of political terrorism such  as that of the Red Brigades in Italy?    [Kandaurov] There are already some armed groups that have  taken up weapons. Right-wing subversive movements such as  Aleksandr Barkachev's for instance. Armed extremists are  proliferating throughout Russia, and it is becoming increasingly  difficult to combat them.    [Bigazzi] Following the demise of the blocs, is there still  pressure from "foreign agents"? Which secret services are more  dangerous?    [Kandaurov] The CIA remains the most active, like the  British, French, and -- albeit to a lesser extent -- the Italian  services. On top of this, agents of the former Soviet republics  are now operating in Russia, too. Five Georgian agents and one  Estonian agent who committed a homicide have been arrested. In  1993, 20 foreign agents were arrested.    [Bigazzi] Zhirinovskiy is worrying the West. Did you  forecast the rise of the ultra-nationalists?    [Kandaurov] Two weeks before the elections we forecast that  Zhirinovskiy's party could have win 24 percent of the votes. We  were only wrong by one percent.    [Bigazzi] Many people, including Gorbachev, say that  Zhirinovskiy used to be a KGB agent. Is it true?    [Kandaurov] Not to my knowledge. In any case, what does it  mean, to have been a KGB agent? A number of the present  democratic leaders were KGB agents, too.</p>

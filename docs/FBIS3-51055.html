In the article, entitled "The Truth About Cuba," Bolanos  denounced the fact the CIA has once again published, a few days  ago, apocalyptic reports on the Caribbean island.    The diplomat emphasized: This is not the first time in  history that this U.S. agency has undertaken this kind of action  against Cuba.    He mentioned as examples the prediction of an uprising in  the  Caribbean country in 1961, during the Playa Giron (Bay of Pigs)  invasion, and the predictions that the revolution would  deafeningly fall in December 1990.    The ambassador recalled: In the first case, contrary to what  the CIA asserted, it was the people who defeated the mercenary  invasion, and the 422 foreign journalists who were on the island  waiting for "the fall" in 1990 returned disappointed to their  countries.    Bolanos said in his article that the Cuban Government does  not deny the enormous economic difficulties faced by the  country, but it goes by undeniably more objective figures than  the ones the CIA usually presents.    The ambassador explained: The year 1993 will be remembered  in  history as the most terrible year for the revolution, given the  damage caused by the fury of the empire (United States),  compounded by the consequences derived from weather disasters  which caused casualties and losses, the latter assessed at $1  billion.    Despite these severe circumstances, the diplomat wrote,  Cubans continue to be an organized, solidary society that shows,  according to CEPAL (Economic Commission for Latin America)  [ECLA] figures, the best distribution of revenues in the world.  There are no beggars or homeless, and everyone has access to  schools and hospitals.    Bolanos said that following the Soviet Union's disappearance  and the end of the Cold War, the United States' political  destabilization machinery has concentrated on Cuba.    He said the cost of anti-Cuban operations now totals $700  million per year, and the blockade continues even though the UN  condemns that policy.</p>

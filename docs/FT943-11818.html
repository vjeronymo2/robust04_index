			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Euro Disney cuts its operating loss despite revenue fall Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, announced a net loss of FFr546m (Pounds 66m) for the third quarter to the end of June, but said that operating losses had been reduced sharply from FFr381m to FFr194m. The increase in losses at the net level was the result of a one-off charge of FFr352m relating to a financial restructuring at the company, which is implementing a rescue package after suffering losses of FFr5.3bn last year. The reduction in operating losses was achieved despite a fall in revenues at the theme park and its hotels from FFr1.47bn in the third quarter of 1993 to FFr1.16bn this year. Euro Disney blamed a more aggressive pricing strategy and lower attendances after uncertainty last year over the future of the theme park. 'Some people outside of the company were talking of the possibility that we might have to close,' it said. 'This was never justified, but had an unsettling effect on clients and potential customers.' The reduction in operating losses was attributed to efforts to improve operating margins, a cut in general and administrative expenses and, most importantly, to the initial effects of the company's financial restructuring package which was concluded earlier this year. Property lease expenses, for example, fell by about 50 per cent due to interest waivers, while no royalties were paid in the quarter to Walt Disney, the US entertainment group which holds 49 per cent of the shares. Euro Disney said that its FFr5.95bn rights issue would be completed by mid-August. The proceeds will reduce debts, which stand at about FFr16bn, excluding convertible bonds. The seven-for-two rights issue was priced at FFr10 a share. Yesterday, Euro Disney's shares remained stable at FFr10. Walt Disney has pledged to take up its full entitlement to the rights issue, which is also being underwritten by Euro Disney's banking syndicate. Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, the Saudi investor, is also set to take a stake of up to 24 per cent. Walt Disney, Page 24</p>

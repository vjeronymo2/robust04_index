			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Namoz Normumin: "Labor Camps, or Pages From </F> Village Life: Part 1"]    [Text] Normally, when one says labor camps, one thinks of  prisons because the labor performed in labor camps is done by  those who are not themselves free. It is clear that free labor  is not done by free men...    If we are to use mankind's physical and mental attributes,  i.e., allow him to work freely, his personality is fulfilled.  Thus, the right to work is one of man's basic rights.    Man satisfies his material and spiritual needs instead of  wasting his power and abilities. His life is spent amid work and  these needs. These two forces form man and define his way of  life: in brief, they define the human fate.    I have been giving some thought to working freely. Perhaps  others have other ideas.    Well and good, what kind of work is used in today's  Uzbekistan. Can one call the work of kolkhozniks in the village  free labor?    The present villages of Uzbekistan came into existence as a  result of kolkhozification. Three quarters of Uzbekistan's  population live in them. Close to four million of this  population have contracted infectious hepatitis in the last  twenty years. The population in the village lives an average of  sixty years. Some 50 out of every thousand children born in the  villages does not live beyond the age of one year. We do not  want to dwell on the level of education, health, or cultural  work in the villages. These are well known to all.    Many, thinking of the fate of the nation, its health,  education, and culture, do not think specifically of the  village. Village people are living beings, but in chains.    In the interests of justice, we have to say that the  majority  of these people speak simply and are gullible. If someone were  to come on television and say "we have to live in the Union",  they would believe it. It is no complicated matter to make them  believe the opposite.    This being said, our narrative is about the so-called  village  labor camps and the way of life of those who live there.  <H5>  WHOSE IS THE LAND? </H5>   We say that the word "kishlok [village]" comes from the verb  "kishlamok [to overwinter]." Nomadic tribes spent the winter  months in places known to them. The people, once having accepted  the sedentary way of life, began to call the place a "village."  Up to the October revolution 76 percent of Turkestan's  population lived in villages. In the Soviet period, this number  did not change significantly. Sometimes one finds tuman [rayon]  centers instead of cities and the population living in these is  counted as living in cities. This being the case, official  figures of Uzbekistan today state that 60 percent of the  population live in villages and 40 percent in the cities.  Essentially, however, these tuman centers are not cities because  these settlements are not industrialized and the way of life of  those living in them does not differ significantly from that in  the villages. In fact, a part of the population in the tuman  centers, as in the big cities, consists of nomadic Russians. In  Surkhondaryo, a southern viloyat, the population lives entirely  in villages. It is simplistic to call the viloyat center,  Termez, a city.    Until kolkhozification, the land of Uzbekistan was in the  hands of landlords, and they leased this to peasants or  exploited it through day-laborers. Produce harvested from the  land was divided between the landlord and the day laborer by  contract. One must also point out that a significant portion of  the peasants owned their own land. As a result of  kolkhozification, the land was completely taken away from the  landlords and the peasants to whom it was leased. The feeling of  respect for productive and meaningful labor -- the feeling of  possession of the land -- was extinguished.    Who owns the land in Uzbekistan today? It is thought that  most of the land belongs to the state.    The drop from year to year in production from farmed land,  the fact that the harvested product does not meet world  standards, the ecological harm done by organisms in the soil,  its "rape" in order to extract a product from it, in other  words, the use of chemical fertilizers, raises the question of  who owns the land once again.    The present owner of Uzbekistan's lands is nonhuman and  nonnatural -- the State.    The government has no intention of privatizing the land. As  an excuse, it points out simple reasons such as the majority of  the population live in villages, there is a shortage of land and  water, and the people's tendency to work in groups. Its goal is  to retain the old order by preserving the government in its  hands by means of the land.    The population of the republic is now 22 million. A average  of 6-7 people live in every family. That means that there are  close to 3.5 million families in Uzbekistan. There is close to  four million hectares of irrigated land. On the average, every  family could receive slightly more than one hectare.    Twenty five sotikhs [a land measure] of land were given to  every family in our Republic, similar to the amounts given away  in the Peoples Republic of China. On this basis land reform was  carried out; rice and other products are the fruits of this  reform.    Now imagine: what if instead of twenty five sotikhs of land,  what if one hectare was given!    We think it would work better if kolkhoz lands were leased,  and then, after a definite period, privatized. Under existing  circumstances, this is the only way the resolve the problem. It  is difficult, but there is no other way!    Some simple people wonder why our government has not thought  of this simple idea. They think that the government is as simple  as themselves. But today's government is not so honest. If the  government were honest, it would see into what state the rural  population has fallen as a result of its policies, and it would  have resigned. The reason that land reform has not been carried  out in present-day Uzbekistan is that it is possible that as a  result of such reforms people in the villages would become both  materially and intellectually more independent. If kolkhoz lands  were leased to the peasants, they would escape from the clutches  of the present order. The peasants would make the transition  from compulsory labor to free labor, and, finally, their  understanding of their own government would increase. If this  were to happen, who would they follow? And, if democratic  elections were held, they certainly would not follow the  representatives of today's neocommunist order.</p>

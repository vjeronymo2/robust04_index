			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "fy": "Schaeuble Criticizes Scharping"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 22 Jun -- Schaeuble, CDU/CSU [Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag group  chairman, described SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]  Chairman Scharping's conference address as disappointing,  because it lacked concepts and convincing proposals regarding  solutions to problems. No statement was made on the SPD's goals  and the speech did not say anything about possible coalitions.  The question is no longer whether the SPD is tending toward a  red-green coalition, but whether it will expand such an alliance  into a popular front by including the PDS [Party of Democratic  Socialism]. Scharping also failed to provide a clear answer on  the party's attitude toward the PDS. Instead, the SPD just ran  everything down: German unification, the economic upturn, and  the government's foreign policy successes.    Scharping's government program contains promises that would  cost 60 billion German marks to realize, but the candidate for  chancellor does not mention where the money is to come from.  Scharping failed to explain how he would combat unemployment  and modernize the economy. Under him, the SPD has become a  party that is out of step with reality and keeps its head in the  sand with regard to the changed political situation in the world  in a way that would lead Germany into international isolation.  CSU Land Group Chairman Gloss talked of a desperate attempt on  the part of Scharping to use emotions to create the impression  of unity on the part of the SPD.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Montevideo, 7 Apr (EFE) -- During an interview with  EFE in the Uruguayan capital, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina said the America's Summit, called by U.S. President Bill  Clinton for December in Miami, seeks "to isolate Cuba from Latin  America." Robaina said: "If it is an `America's Summit,' Cuba  has earned a place there because, regardless of any different  economic models, the summit will lack political plurality if we  are excluded."    Robaina also discussed the upcoming Ibero-American Summit,  scheduled for June in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). He said  Cuba hopes that "we, the American countries, will be able to  meet without receiving orders from the United States." Robaina  added: "Cuba hopes the Cartagena Summit will issue resolutions  and not merely express intentions as in the past three summits."    The upcoming Ibero-American Summit is one of the goals of  the  Cuban Foreign Minister's three-day official visit to Uruguay and  will be a goal of the visits he will subsequently make to Peru,  Argentina, and Paraguay within a "political-economical  offensive" as he described it himself.    The Cuban Government hopes to receive more concrete support  from the Ibero-American Summit against the U.S. trade "blockade"  on Cuba. The foreign minister added: "It is not necessary to ask  for (Latin American) political support against the blockade  because we already have it. Now this support must be translated  into investments."    Nevertheless, the quest for these investments during  Robaina's current tour is of "a preparatory nature," without  hopes for concrete results. "Until we honor our debts to these  countries there will be an atmosphere that does not contribute  to striking more significant relations," Robaina said.    Cuba owes about $1.2 billion to Argentina and $33 million to  Uruguay. The foreign minister said the Cuban Government intends  to reduce these debts by delivering goods (specially medicines)  and, above all, by getting the creditors to invest in Cuba.    Concerning his subsequent stops, Robaina noted he already  has  a confirmed meeting with Argentine President Carlos Menem, a  Latin American leader who has been very critical of the  government system in Cuba. A meeting with Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori has still not been confirmed. A meeting with  Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy is much more complex  because there are no diplomatic relations between Paraguay and  Cuba and, therefore, Robaina's visit to this country is  unofficial.    Robaina emphasized: "During this tour, my task involves  explaining to the respective presidents the current Cuban  situation, which is extremely complex. At this moment, our top  priority involves finding an economic model that will allow us  to integrate ourselves into today's world without giving up our  political system's sacred achievements."    In Montevideo, the Cuban foreign minister met President Luis  Alberto Lacalle and Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu. Although his  official visit ended on 6 April, Robaina will stay in  Montevideo, on a private visit, until 8 April.    The Uruguayan politicians did not make any remarks on the  meetings, even though both of them openly expressed their  government's position, favoring a democratic opening of the  Cuban system that will allow its integration into Latin America  by reconciling its government system with those prevailing in  the rest of the continent.</p>

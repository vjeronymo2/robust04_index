			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: SOUTH GATE;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CITES SAFETY IN BAN ON ICE CREAM VENDORS  </P> <P> The South Gate City Council has unanimously approved an amendment to its  ordinance banning ice cream push carts.  </P> <P> The amendment adds a restriction to keep vendors off city streets because of  traffic hazards they might create, officials say.  </P> <P> City law already prohibits pushcart vendors who are unable to obtain health  permits from the Los Angeles County Health Department, City Administrator Bruce  Spragg said.  </P> <P> Spragg said some vendors recently received health permits, but the council  wanted to continue banning them from the city.  </P> <P> The council sees this as a public safety issue, the administrator said. The  carts are especially dangerous for children who run into the streets to buy ice  cream, he said.  </P></p>

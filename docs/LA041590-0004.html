			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HAPPY TALK CONFESSIONS OF A TV NEWSMAN BY FRED GRAHAM  (W.W. NORTON: $19.95; 352 PP.)  </P> <P> Those who nightly watched Fred Graham, former legal-affairs reporter for CBS  news, during the Watergate era know him as a thorough newsman with a knack for  explaining complicated issues in down-to-earth terms.  </P> <P> Those who read the first chapter of his memoirs will also know him as a very  funny writer. His description of the behind-the-scenes insanity at a local TV  station in Nashville, where he was a news anchor after CBS failed to renew his  contract, is a riot. It's also poignant -- Graham relays the anguish of a man  once near the pinnacle of his profession as he tries to fit into a rag-tag  "Happy Talk" operation.  </P> <P> It's a shame that after that great first chapter he suddenly makes a shift into  a choppy style that resembles news-bite journalism. Stories about his  interesting early careers as a lawyer and New York Times writer are told in  snippets intercut with scenes from his childhood or college days. The effect is  more confusing than revelatory. One wishes he had paid heed to what Bill Small,  one of his former CBS bosses, told him when his on-air style was getting too  fancy: "Just tell the news."  </P> <P> He does relate some juicy tales from inside CBS, including some about the  cutthroat competition among reporters. And about two-thirds through the book he  picks up steam as he writes about the changes at CBS news -- severe cutbacks  and the onset of the "infotainment" news style he calls "happy talk" -- that  rocked that organization. There have been other books on the subject, but  Graham provides the viewpoint of someone who was on the inside and saw careers  and lives, including his own, drastically changed.  </P> <P> Near the end of the book, he takes us back to Nashville for a fascinating look  at local TV news. Without belittling his co-workers or the form, he explains in  the best tradition of Graham reporting how "happy talk" works and why it didn't  work for him. David Colker  </P></p>

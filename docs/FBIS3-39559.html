However, a decision on their  implementation will not be made before the weekend [19-20  February], diplomatic circles announced in Bonn today. The  Foreign Ministry refrained from commenting publicly. In a radio  interview, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel recommended great  reservation, and stressed that one should wait and see whether  the Russian initiative will be successful. A NATO air strike  could be prevented in that case.    Contrary to speculation in Belgrade, the visa office, but  not  the entire consulate, is to be closed. The closure and the  departure for Hungary of part of the consular staff, including  dependents, would probably not be ordered before Sunday if no  peaceful solution becomes visible in the Bosnian war. The NATO  ultimatum will expire one minute after midnight on Sunday night.    The German Embassy will not be affected by the evacuation  and  will continue its work, diplomatic circles stressed.</p>

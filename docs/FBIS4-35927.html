			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F> Ministry in the Democratic Republic of Yemen"]    [Text] Within the framework of challenging the  international community and all the good Arab international  efforts, the ruling miltiary regime in Sanaa continues its  barbarous and aggressive acts against our people in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen. On this very day, the invading  and aggressive forces continued their desperate attacks on all  fronts. Our brave Armed Forces intercepted them, and inflicted  on them further losses in lives, vehicles, and other military  equipment.    In the Tawr al-Bahah zone, our forces succeeded in mopping  up  the infiltrating hostile forces, which were engaged in acts of  looting, robbery, and rape. Our forces are in the process of  imposing their control over the situation, after combing a  number of villages and towns for the routed remnants of the  hostile forces. On this front the enemy's losses were four  tanks, two Katyusha launchers, and hundreds of dead and wounded.  A large number of the enemy's men surrendered, including  numerous members of the infamous and disreputable jihad elements.    Our forces continue, in the provinces of Radfan and al-Dali'  -- after thousands of people joined them from the province of  Yafi and other provinces -- to cleanse the villages of the filth  of the routed remnants of the hostile forces.    In the Abyan zone our forces destroyed three Katyusha launch  vehicles and seized two hostile tanks. The combat actions of  our forces were characterized by determination, death-defying  action, a firm defense, and high combat morale. The enemy's  acts were characterized by barbarousness, randomness, and  desperation, especially after they realized that the ruling  military regime in Sanaa insists on continuing to challenge the  international community, and on shedding the blood of thousands  of the sons of the central areas, who have no control over their  fates and are pushed toward the holocaust of war and death.    God is great, God is great.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Fatah has narrowly won the elections to the Gaza  Strip Engineers Association, which will now be headed by a Fatah  representative, with a deputy from the Islamic list. The  executive committee will be run by a Fatah majority, but next  year the Islamic list will have a majority. This arrangement  was dictated by the need to rotate one seat.    Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that since the Islamic  movements have traditionally held a majority in the Engineers  Association, the Gaza Strip Fatah chapter views the election  results as a victory.</p>

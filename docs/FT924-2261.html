			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (4): Leaving the roller-coaster - Merchanting and added-value papers THE ROLLER-coaster ride of the paper industry, from outstanding profits to numbing losses, may be exhilarating, but it is a far from comfortable. Pulp and most grades of paper represent classic examples of cyclical industries. And they are becoming more and more classical as each down-draught of the cycle appears to become increasingly deep and long. One reason is the growing size of paper machines. A world-scale competitive paper plant now has a capacity of at least 200,000 tonnes a year, and sometimes more than 300,000 tonnes, explains Mr Denis Christie, paper, pulp and packaging analyst at James Capel. Each time a new plant comes on-stream it adds a significant chunk to regional capacity. Most paper groups demonstrate lemming-like behaviour when the economic cycle is at its peak. Unwilling to lose market share, they invest in these new increasingly large plants simultaneously, aggravating the subsequent imbalance of supply and demand. Not surprisingly, the more enlightened paper groups have attempted to get off the roller-coaster by diversifying into less cyclical paper businesses. These range from packaging to specialist papers and even merchanting. The Swedes have for some time been masters of adding value to paper. Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, chief executive of SCA of Sweden, explains that Swedish groups' home market is so small that they have to export, and these exports have to be products that can stand long distribution and can be differentiated. That excludes commodity products, such as pulp and newsprint. Mr Martin-Lof says Sweden cannot compete in the long-term in commodity products, because of the high costs of production there. The group has integrated its pulp production into paper products, to the extent that it is now a net buyer of pulp. SCA has spread its risk over the past 10 years by diversifying into hygiene and packaging products. Mr Martin-Lof proudly points out that the baby-nappy and feminine-protection markets have been almost unaffected by the recession, growing at up to 5 per cent this year. Similarly, the packaging market - for which SCA provides high-value coated paper - has expanded at 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent. To provide its packaging and hygiene products to its customers, it has had to move production to the continent, says Mr Martin-Lof. 'We can't sit and die in Sweden,' he says. Dr Jan Remrod, director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association, explains that, traditionally, the industry has been based in the forest. Now it has to look at the consumer. 'The Swedish government may not like it, but any further investment in the medium-term is unlikely to be in Sweden.' Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora, Europe's largest paper group, says there is a clear trend that the industry is becoming less global, because market demands are becoming more specific. Customers want quality and just-in-time deliveries. That means moving to the continent. 'We have been in the vanguard of added-value,' Mr Berggren proclaims. 'We are unrecognisable from the mid-1980s.' Stora has been moving further and further from the pulp market. It used to sell up to 600,000 tonnes a year, but it is now in a balanced position. Instead, the group has moved into printing and writing papers as well as board for food packaging. The example of the Swedes is now being followed by the Dutch. The recent announcement by KNP, VRG and Buhrmann-Tetterode that they intended to merge was driven by the desire to reduce their dependence upon pure paper markets. Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman of Buhrmann-Tetterode, explains: 'Because new paper machines have to be so large and can therefore distort the market so easily, the risk of making a misjudgment is enormous. By having other activities, we reduce the risk for the group of introducing new machines.' The combined group will have only Fl 2bn (Pounds 442m) of its Fl 13bn turnover in direct paper products. The counter-weights, as Mr van Oordt calls them, include packaging, graphic systems, office equipment and paper merchanting. However, the attempts to escape cyclical commodity paper markets have not always been entirely successful, explains Mr David Walker, vice-president of corporate analysis at Jaakko Poyry, the Finnish consultants. Paper companies have an unfortunate herdlike instinct, which means that, once one group has identified a fast-growing niche area, most of the rest plough in, leading to massive overcapacity and commodity-style prices. 'To be frank,' says Mr Berggren, at Stora. 'Overcapacity is affecting most grades at the moment.' Mr Walker points out that a number of companies moved into the uncoated super-calendered (SC) magazine market with mixed results. Repola has 800,000 tonnes annual capacity, Myllykoski 540,000 tonnes, Stora 475,000 tonnes and SCA 330,000 tonnes. Yet according to David Christie, analyst at James Capel, the outlook for SC magazine papers is probably the bleakest of all paper types, because capacity is expected to rise sharply over the next 18 months with the start-up of two machines, one of Repola's and one of Norske Skog, with a combined annual capacity of 550,000 tonnes. Naturally, operating rates, prices and margins, are all poor. Similarly, coated woodfree and carbonless are both areas with high-technology content and added value; but both are afflicted by overcapacity, says Mr Alain Soulas, newly appointed chief executive at Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group. Prices of coated woodfree have fallen by about 23 per cent since 1989, in spite of the market growing as much as 12 per cent a year. Mr Soulas believes the most important way of protecting investments from this sort of herdlike instinct is to brand products. He points to the group's Idem brand, which has allowed it to keep 30 per cent of the market and partially resist pricing pressure. He believes that achievement is outstanding. AWA's Conqueror writing-paper brand has actually increased both sales and prices over the last 12 months, he says. Other successful niches include playing-cards, banknotes, medical papers and labels. AWA is also Europe's largest existing merchanting company, although it may be challenged for that title by the new Dutch grouping. Mr Soulas believes about half of AWA's turnover in Europe has not been affected by the downturn.</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Clinton pledges to broaden area for free trade PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday raised the prospect of a broad free trade zone in the western hemisphere by putting the whole of Latin America back at the centre of US trade policy. Speaking at a White House press conference, he promised to build on the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico by expanding it to include free-market democracies such as Argentina and Chile. The president, who has been fighting an uphill battle to win Congress approval for Nafta, predicted that the House of Representatives would give its backing in its deciding vote next week. 'I honestly believe we're going to win it now,' he said. Mr Clinton said he did not want to exaggerate the potential job gains to be derived from Nafta alone, although he believed it was clear it would create more jobs than it lost. Much greater opportunities would come, however, when the pact could be expanded to other market-oriented economies and with the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'The real job growth . . . will come when all the other Latin American democracies and free-market economies also join in a great trade group with Mexico, Canada and the US. 'And it will come because, once this happens, we will have enormously increased influence in the world community to argue that we ought to adopt a worldwide trade agreement before the end of the year,' he added. After Tuesday night's Nafta debate between vice-president Al Gore and Mr Ross Perot, the former independent presidential candidate, Mr Clinton sought to portray next week's Congress vote as critical for the US's ability to negotiate freer trade opportunities from its partners not only in Latin America but also in the Uruguay Round. Mr Gore warned in the debate that a defeat for Nafta would make conclusion of the Gatt round difficult. An expansion of Nafta to include the rest of Latin America was promised by Mr Clinton's predecessor, Mr George Bush. But little has been heard of such talk in recent months as the prospects of Congress accepting free trade even with neighbouring Mexico seemed so remote. Mexican stocks soared 81.49 points to a record close at 2,035.33, and the peso recovered because of optimism over the result of the Gore-Perot debate.

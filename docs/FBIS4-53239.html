			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Chong-pil, "chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party" of South  Korea, again claimed recently that the "May 16 military coup"  was a "revolution".    Commenting on this, a NODONG SINMUN analyst today brands  this  as a shameless and brazen nonsensical balderdash.    The analyst says:    The "May 16 military coup" was an anti-democratic crime  which  blocked democratic development in South Korea and brought a more  brutal military fascist dictatorship.    The "May 16 military coup" staged under the manipulation of  the United States and the military fascist dictatorship produced  by it imposed formidable misfortunes and disasters upon the  people and left incurable wounds of grievances in their hearts.  This was why the traitor Kim Chong-pil invited angry rebuffs  from the mass when he defended the "May 16 military coup"  last year.    Nevertheless, he again praised the military coup. This is,  indeed, an unpardonable challenge to the people's aspiration and  demand for democracy. He makes such remarks in an effort to  conceal the past crimes he committed against the people, but it  is a foolish act. His face is the wolf's, whether he wears a  mask, or not. He only reeks of blood.    The traitor Kim Chong-pil contended that the present  "regime"  has its roots in the soil of "May 16". But he only took the  "civilian" veil off the South Korean "president", Kim Yong-sam,  while defending the "May 16 military coup" in which he had  played the key role. The Kim Yong-sam regime is, in fact, a  fascist dictatorial regime disguised with the "civilian" veil.    Kim Yong-sam once said "May 16" was a "coup". But it has  become all the clearer that his words were intended to conceal  the reactionary nature of the "civilian" regime which has its  roots in the military fascist dictatorship.</p>

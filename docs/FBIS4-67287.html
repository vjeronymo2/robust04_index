			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Chat Thai Party has approved the resignation  of Thanong Siriprichaphong, member of the House of  Representatives from Nakhon Phanom, who is accused by the United  States of being involved in the narcotics trade. Thanong's  resignation from the party thus automatically terminated his  membership in the House.    Speaking to reporters at Chat Thai Party's head office at  noon today, Banhan Sinlapa-acha, leader of Chat Thai Party, said  that the approval of Thanong Siriprichaphong's resignation was  made on the recommendation of the fact-finding committee set up  earlier by the party. However, as yet, Thanong Siriprichaphong  is still considered innocent because the court has not yet ruled  that he is guilty. Banhan said the drug charge against Thanong  has caused severe damage to the country and its political  institutions as well as to the Chat Thai Party. [passage omitted]</p>

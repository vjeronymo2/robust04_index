			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Roland Gribben: "BAe Merger Door Stays Open </F> Says Weinstock"]    [Text] GEC [General Electric Company] yesterday attempted  to give a merger deal with British Aerospace [BAe] another push  by suggesting the tie-up between the two companies could lead to  the creation of a national defence company. But Dick Evans, BAe  chief executive, gave a cool response to the idea and said there  were no plans for re-opening negotiations on any merger talks.    Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director, indicated, during an  interview with the BBC Money Programme, he was still holding the  merger door open and suggested the consolidation of existing  technical and joint venture links would produce a "national  champion" in the defence market. He said: "I think if the  national champion or the national defence company were more  efficient you would automatically get more protection.    "We would have more protection at home against imports and  better prospects of making export sales. So I do not think  there is any question that we could make the industry stronger  by an amalgamation which created a single prime contractor."    Lord Weinstock said he would like the talks with BAe to  resume "under certain conditions" but made it clear they could  not proceed unless BAe was "wholeheartedly in favour" of them.    On the same programme Mr Evans said he was "very keen" for  the existing relationship between the two companies to continue,  but added: "It does not have to go to a vertically integrated  merger."    Mr Evans was criticised earlier this year for going out on a  limb in backing a GEC and BAe merger but now feels that the  aerospace group is in a stronger position to maintain its  defence role through joint ventures rather than a complete  merger.    Robert Bauman, new chairman, is also said to be supporting  the joint venture rather than merger route. The feeling in the  BAe camp is that Lord Weinstock missed his chance of picking up  the group cheaply when the share price collapsed.    One source said: "He was worried about black holes in the  balance sheet but action is now being taken to fill them."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Letters" Section] </F>   [Text] SIR: In the evening session of the Burmese program  on January 17 1994, the BBC mistakenly announced that ABSDF [All  Burma Students Democratic Front] student leader, Moe Thee Zun,  and 11 others had been detained by the KNU [Karen National  Union). On account that there had been some confusion among the  members of the NCUB (National Council of the Union of Burma),  and a misunderstanding upon the KNU by the people and the  international community [as published]. Accordingly, we, the  meeting of the NCUB members present in Manerplaw, issue a  statement as follows:    The fact is that the BBC announcement came at a time when  discussions were being held between the ABSDF led by Moe Thee  Zun and the KNU, in order to prevent, in advance, any  misunderstanding from occurring between the two, in connection  with the KNU's decision to hold talks individually with the  Slorc [State Law and Order Restoration Council], occasioned by  various circumstances.    The (11-1-94) Central Committee Emergency Meeting of the DAB  [Democratic Alliance of Burma], which is a member of the NCUB  [National Council of the Union of Burma], adopted by consensus a  position expressing understanding for the NMSP (New Mon State  Party) which had to hold talks individually with the Slorc  because of circumstances and the KNU which intended to hold  talks individually with the Slorc. The KNU accepts with  understanding the implementation of their own program by its  allies, the political organisations including the Student Army,  though it had to decide, because of circumstances, to find  solutions to political problems through negotiations.    There is no serious problems between the KNU and the Student  Army or any other ally.    Consequently, we have to declare that the news reported by  BBC correspondent Larry Jagan and broadcast by the BBC in its  evening session on January 17, 1994 is incorrect.    [Signed] National Council of the Union of Burma</p>

			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / An irresistible force: Dividends are in the spotlight Rentokil, best known for pest control, put a cat among the pigeons on Thursday by raising its dividend in response to the chancellor's Budget. The increase aimed to compensate shareholders who do not pay tax, for example pension funds. These shareholders stood to lose out because, under Budget changes to advance corporation tax (ACT), they will receive a lower rate of tax credit on UK dividends. Fears about lower effective dividends for pension funds, the stock market's biggest investors, were one reason share prices fell on Wednesday. Rentokil's move, which was not what the chancellor intended to happen, may add to pressure from institutions for other companies to follow suit. However, only a few companies with high dividend and interest cover will be able to afford that luxury. 'Given that dividend cover is at a low level because of recession, I would guess there is only a minority of companies which can afford a dividend increase,' according to Mr David Gray, head of research at James Capel, the stockbroker. The Budget changes are complex, and many companies are still working out the full implications. But most observers say companies in the banking, construction and engineering sectors still need to restore dividend cover and have no room to compensate investors by lifting dividends. Utilities, however, could increase pay-outs because of strong balance sheets inherited from privatisation and low borrowings. Mr Gerald Corbett, finance director at building materials group Redland, said he wanted to restore dividend cover first. Lower ACT rates would save the company Pounds 10m a year and improve cash flow. 'The positive effect on the company of lower ACT will more than compensate gross (untaxed) funds for their loss of earnings,' he said. UK water companies, which pay no corporation tax because of high capital allowances, are likely to face calls for higher dividend payments. These calls may be hard to resist, because water shares are valued as high-yield stocks. 'I can understand institutions wanting compensation, but it's just another factor which will have to be considered at year-end,' according to Mr David Luffrum, group finance director at Thames Water. The ACT changes will also affect corporate pension funds, which will receive the same reduced dividends as institutional pension fund shareholders. For some companies, this could mean the benefit of lower ACT is balanced out by higher pension contributions. In other cases, pension fund valuations will have to be reviewed because previously assumed rates of dividend growth may no longer be valid. 'Either way, people with pension fund surpluses may find them being used up quicker than first expected,' according to another finance director. The ACT changes will be phased in over the next year, and the new 20 per cent rate only takes effect from April 6 next year. Companies paying dividends in the weeks or months ahead of this date will be sorely tempted to delay payment and qualify for the lower rate. One company, Rathbone Brothers, an asset management group, has already jumped the gun. It is bringing forward its interim dividend payment by two weeks to avoid the new ACT rules.</p>

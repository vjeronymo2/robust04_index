			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Electricorp static at NZDollars 407m ELECTRICORP, the New Zealand state-owned enterprise embroiled in controversy over a crisis in national electricity supplies, yesterday announced net profits of NZDollars 407m (USDollars 226.1m) for the year to March 31 compared with NZDollars 404m a year earlier. It warned that profits could drop to Dollars 250m in the current year as it is being forced to maximise the use of expensive coal and oil-powered thermal stations due to near-drought conditions in the South Island's lakes used to supply 60 per cent of the country's electricity. Critics say Electricorp failed to conserve lake levels in the hope that rains would come, a point the corporation disputes strongly. Electricorp yesterday signed an agreement under which it will pay Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer, NZDollars 10m to close one-third of the capacity at its Bluff aluminium smelter. The deal will allow 170MW of power to be diverted for use elsewhere in New Zealand. Comalco and its Sumitomo owners say the partial closure will cost it more than NZDollars 20m. There is widespread concern in New Zealand at the effect of the electricity shortage on industry which is working hard to conserve power. However, Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister, has ruled out accepting an official's recommendation that industry go on a four-day working week. Announcing the latest result, Mr John Fernyhough, Electricorp chairman, said the rate of return on shareholders' funds of 12 per cent was lower than the 12.2 per cent of 1990-91 and was due to delaying power increases and the higher than anticipated fuel costs from December to March due to low hydro-storage levels. He said extra costs faced by Electricorp this year would be at least Dollars 150m because of the crisis. But he said forecasting profits was difficult due to the hydroelectricity problem.</p>

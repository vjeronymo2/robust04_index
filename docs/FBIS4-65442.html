			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ulrich Rosenbaum: "A Disappointed Rudolf </F> Scharping"]    [Text] Bonn -- Whenever over the past few weeks a large  number of black limousines pulled up in front of the "Haribo  Villa" in Bonn's Godesberger Allee, former home of gummi bear  manufacturer Hans Riegel, one could be sure that SPD [Social  Democratic Party of Germany] chief Rudolf Scharping was meeting  top German industrialists.    Just like other SPD chancellor candidates before him,  Scharping values the confidential "tete-a-tete talks" at the  Political Club of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. Everyone of  any importance among German entrepreneurs on account of name,  rank, and turnover, attends these talks. No wonder Scharping  was upset when Hans Peter Stihl criticized the SPD's economic  program. "But we showed you what we wanted just as we showed  other leading German industrial personalities," said Scharping  in a letter to Hans Peter Stihl, chairman of the Association of  German Trade and Industry [DIHT]    For Stihl was also a participant in the confidential talks.  There were further rounds of talks with the industrial  associations, the Employers Association, the Automobile Industry  Association, and the Chemical Industry Association. On the SPD  side, regular participants included Scharping's economic and  financial expert, Oskar Lafontaine, and other members of the  Program Commission, as well as experts from the SPD faction.    "We had the impression that the gentlemen from industry were  positively impressed by the changes in SPD policy, away from  thinking in terms of a welfare state toward more growth,  employment, and a labor market," recalls one participant in the  talks. Someone had said that the SPD did not want to increase  the tax burden, but nevertheless it was important to limit the  supplementary levy to higher incomes to boost domestic demand.  "We also told Herr Stihl that we do not want to burden smaller  entrepreneurs with bigger taxes," it was said. But this is  exactly what the DIHT chairman is accusing the SPD of wanting to  do.    The interlocutors did not hide their disappointment with the  government's policies, especially those of the economics  minister. The industrial representatives thanked Lafontaine for  preserving the regressive tax levy in the Bundesrat.  Representatives of the German industrial associations  complained that the chancellor was displaying excessive euphoria  about the economic upturn. These cozy tete-a-tete talks are now  being followed by criticism from the DIHT and the German  industrial associations.    Inside the SPD, people remember a saying by former Minister  Karl Schiller whereby the highest accolade the SPD can expect  from industry is a lack of criticism of the SPD.</p>

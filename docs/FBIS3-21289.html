Ferhat: "Sent to the Tizi Ouzou Prison Last </F> July, Benhadj Is Transferred to the Blida Military  Prison"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] After spending six months at the Tizi Ouzou prison,  the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] number-two, Ali Benhadj, was  returned to the Blida military prison.    He was sent to Blida prior to his trial in July 1992 and  kept  there for a while afterward, we learned from reliable sources.  However, no information could be obtained as to the reasons of  the transfer, which took place this week, a few days before the  opening of the "National Dialogue Commission [NDC] Conference."  Could there be a connection between this transfer and contacts  with FIS leaders, announced and held in secrecy by the NDC?  There is no indication that this is the case. But his return to  the Blida military prison will enable Benhadj to join the other  FIS leaders who were sentenced at the same time as he was: Kamel  Guemazi, Ali Djeddi, Abdelkader Boukhamkham, Abdelkader Omar,  and Nourredine Chigara.    As for Abassi Madani, according to indiscretions echoed in  the press, he would be placed in an Algiers suburban residence.    Apart from that, we do not know if Benhadj's transfer has  anything to do with his hunger strike of last December. This  hunger strike, which was never officially acknowledged or  denied, was announced by Rabah Kebir from Bonn, where he had  taken refuge, in a press communique published by foreign press  agencies.    The communique indicated that Benhadj wanted to protest  "various measures taken against him," in particular "his  transfer to the Tizi Ouzou prison where he was kept alone in a  cell and no longer allowed to have visitors." We were unable to  obtain the slightest information concerning the conditions under  which the FIS number-two is held in prison. Concerning visits,  however, we recall that Hachemi Sahnouni stated that he had paid  a visit to Mr. Benhadj last 17 October.    On the other hand, his lawyers complained of some  restrictions in this respect. But it would seem that these  restrictions were motivated by the fact that Benhadj's defense  lawyers were relaying his messages to the outside.    Our readers will also remember that one of his previous  lawyers, Maitre Brahim Taouti, who had done just that, was  sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Algiers Special  Court last May. Maitre Taouti had smuggled out of the Blida  military prison a document signed by Benhadj, in which the  latter called for the death of civilian personalities, in  particular Mr. Hafid Senhadri, a CNSA [National Committee for  the Safeguarding of Algeria] founding member who was  assassinated last March. In connection with that case, Benhadj  was also supposed to be tried by a special court. But his trial,  the date of which was never made public officially, has not  taken place yet.</p>

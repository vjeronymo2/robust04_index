			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Ferruzzi creditors begin a delicate game - Foreign banks are looking to avoid bankruptcy proceedings FOREIGN bank creditors of the collapsed Ferruzzi-Montedison empire have begun a delicate poker game to recover what they can of the L4,128bn (Dollars 2.6bn) considered to be at risk. Talking tough, they declared last Thursday the restructuring plan for Italy's second largest private group as 'unacceptable'. This is in direct contrast to the Italians banks, which with L14,058bn at risk, have given a majority endorsement. The foreign banks last weekend formed a working group composed of Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS with the aim of preparing counter-proposals. The first task, they say, will be to assess the state of the companies, on which they have had no consistent information since the debacle of Ferruzzi debts and losses became known five months ago. They then want to be assured of cashflow projections and administrators' plans for management. From there, the tough bargaining will start. The foreign banks must propose a compromise rescue formula for Ferruzzi-Montedison acceptable to all parties concerned. If not, the administrators will be obliged to initiate bankruptcy proceedings. 'No-one wants to get involved in bankruptcy proceedings in Italy if they can possibly avoid it,' said one of the foreign bankers involved. 'The proceedings would be hideously complex and lengthy, and we have all seen the problems that have arisen, first with Federconsorzi and then Efim.' The 107 foreign creditor banks are not the only ones to realise this. In a letter to the foreign banks this week, Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank which drew up the restructuring plan, raised the dangers of bankruptcy proceedings if they continued to reject the proposals. Mediobanca and the administrators of Ferruzzi-Montedison believe the core of the group's agro-industrial, chemical and financial activities can be salvaged through restructuring. They point to the healthy half-year net operating profit of Montedison, the main industrial group, up from L398bn to L748bn. Whatever the outcome, creditors could lose more than L4,00bn in all, according to informal estimates circulating among bankers. Matters have not been helped by the foreign banks' claims that they were excluded from preparation of the Mediobanca plan. They are also wary after the mishandling of foreign creditors in the 1991 collapse of Federconsorzi, the agricultural services group, and the 1992 liquidation of Efim. The Mediobanca plan is centred on four elements: a debt moratorium for 1993 costing creditors L1,800bn; a consolidation of Ferruzzi-Montedison debt over 10-12 years costing creditors a further L1,600bn; assets sales worth L5,500bn; and capital increases totalling L5,400bn through debt conversion and fresh subscriptions underwritten 80 per cent by the creditors. There will also be a L800bn fund to assist small creditors. The 21 Italian banks, accounting for 71 per cent of the credits at risk, have backed this plan and agreed to waive interest for 1993. Of credits totalling L25,000bn on May 31, L18,899bn is bank debt subject to the moratorium and to consolidation. The Italian banks are more vulnerable, not only in the size of their lendings but in the quality. They have L8,238bn extended to Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the quoted financial holding controlled by the Ferruzzi family until the June collapse. A further L5,820bn of credits are outstanding with Montedison, Ferfin's quoted industrial group. Ferfin's assets are essentially its 38 per cent stake in Montedison, a 51 per cent shareholding in Fondiaria, the insurance company, and shares in diversified interests. The foreign banks, on the other hand, have their main exposure, of L3,381bn, to the operating companies, Montedison and its associates. Only L747bn is extended to Ferfin, the financial holding. They also have L1,537bn of credits unaffected by the moratorium or debt consolidation - L1,070bn to the soundly-operating Eridania Beghin Say foodstuffs business, and L193bn to Edison, the power generation company. The distinct nature of the foreign and Italian banks' exposures, coupled with the domestic banks' greater interest in preservation of the Ferruzzi-Montedison's indentity, has created different priorities and approaches. The foreign banks claim the interests of the creditors are being put before those of the Ferfin and Montedison shareholders. Ferfin's equity in Montedison must be first 'extinguished or reduced consistent with creditors rights', they told Mediobanca. The cancellation of interest in 1993 to protect shareholders equity, they claimed, 'violates creditors' rights, is inconsistent with accepted international restructuring principles, and is completely unfeasible'. Another point disputed by the banks is the extent of asset sales. Rather than protect the nature of Ferruzzi-Montedison, they believe credit recovery can be maximised through a larger sale of the good assets controlled by Ferfin. For instance, the plan envisages the Ferfin stake in Montedison to be cut to 30 per cent and its stake in Fondiaria, to 34 per cent. The backing of the big Italian banks for the plan enabled Ferfin's and Montedison's half-yearly accounts to be passed by their boards. Approval had been delayed from September 30 to permit the administrator to include at least the biggest Italian creditors' decision to forego interest in 1993. The next formal step will be the special meetings of Ferfin and Montedison convened for November 31 and December 1 to approve the first stage of their respective capital increases. If the foreign banks continue to oppose the plan, the meetings will have to be postponed, perhaps leading to bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

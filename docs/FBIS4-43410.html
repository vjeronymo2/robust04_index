			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that,  as in the case of terrorism, the difficulties in the economy  will certainly be overcome and Turkey will become an economic  superpower in the coming years. Ciller was addressing her  party's assembly group meeting. [passage omitted]    [Begin Ciller recording] [passage omitted] As a democratic  state of law, we are obliged to struggle against a separatist  group in line with laws and moral values. We must comply with  the requirements of democracy. We must remain unremittingly  loyal to national and international commitments with regard to  human rights. Despite this, we become the targets of human  rights accusations leveled by internal and external circles,  which serve as tools for the propaganda waged by the bandits  through lies and deception. Certain foreign centers use the  support to be provided to these separatist terrorists as a means  of blackmail. They supply them with all kinds of assistance,  both overtly and covertly. We must face all this without  violating national and international law. We reached this  current stage despite all these negative conditions. [end  recording] [passage omitted]    Commenting on the economy, Ciller reported that the U.S.  currency rate, which soared to 40,000 Turkish lira [TL] on the  eve of the 5 April decisions, has now stabilized at  TL32,000-34,000. The Central Bank's overnight interest rate  dropped from 800 percent to 30-70 percent. Interest on Treasury  bonds also began dropping rapidly as of this week, she noted.    Pointing out that the monthly budget deficit, which stood  around TL32 trillion, was reduced to 4.5 trillion, Ciller  remarked that the government's target for this year's budget  deficit is 107 trillion, as opposed to last year's target of 200  trillion. She declared: For the first time in the history of  the republic, we will halve the budget deficit.    The prime minister explained that the wholesale price index,  which increased by 32 percent in the first month [following the  economic decisions], decreased to 9 percent this month. She  estimated the inflation rate between June and December as 20  percent.</p>

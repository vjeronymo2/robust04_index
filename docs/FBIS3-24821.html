			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The Nigerian Government has been virtually silent so  far about the sanctions imposed on the military by Britain and  the United States last year. They were introduced in response  to the cancellation of last year's program for transition to  civilian rule and the ousting in November of the civilian-led  interim government. But now Nigeria's Army chief of staff, who  has been visiting troops serving in Somalia, has called for the  sanctions to be lifted and he even suggested that if they  continue they could interfere with Nigeria's future  contributions to UN peacekeeping operation. On the line to  Lagos, Akwe Amosu asked the chief of staff's spokesman, Colonel  Okon, if the sanctions were really hurting the Nigerian Army.    [Begin recording] [Okon] It does hurt in the sense that we  source our equipment and other war material from the Western  world. And to be effective and to be continuous in answering to  UN calls for peacekeeping operations, we need to replace this  equipment to be able to be effective all the time.    [Amosu] Do you actually need to replace large numbers of  weapons now?    [Okon] Not necessarily large numbers if the effectiveness is  continuous. What the Nigerian Army is saying is that, over the  years, the Nigerian Army has been called upon by the United  Nations to take part in peacekeeping operations in troubled  areas of the world. And, whenever it's been called upon, it  normally, usually, reacts swiftly.    [Amosu] So, would you say that your capacity to continue  such  missions overseas is compromised by the sanctions?    [Okon] Well, naturally, if an army is out of equipment, then  certainly its performance will be diminished.    [Amosu] The point is that, as you well know, the sanctions  were in fact imposed as a criticism of the Nigerian Government  for failing to introduce democratic change fast enough and for  reneging on promises to move to civilian rule....    [Okon, interrupting] So....    [Amosu, interrupting] And, the question that everybody will  be asking when they hear you say this is: What have you done to  merit having the sanctions lifted?    [Okon] Yes, well, the Nigerian military did not just scuttle  the democratic process for the fun of it. What happened is, in  the circumstances of the situation, the Army had to intervene to  prevent the nation from total disintegration, which might have  followed the events in the country. And, right now, what the  chief of Army staff...[pauses] our people...[pauses] he assured  the international community that the present administration has  already commenced in earnest the process of democratization with  the full aim of returning the country to complete civilian rule.    [Amosu] Well, he has said that, but there is very little  evidence on the ground so far that it is happening. The people  who imposed the sanctions will want to see concrete evidence  before they take them away.    [Okon] Well, if he says it at that level, you just have to  believe that that is what has been done.    [Amosu] Is Nigeria threatening to withdraw from  international  peacekeeping work unless the sanctions are lifted?    [Okon] No, no, no, that is not what it has done. No.    [Amosu] So, this is just a friendly request from Nigeria to  the rest of world to stop getting on our backs and just [words  indistinct]?    [Okon] Naturally, it can't do it by force.

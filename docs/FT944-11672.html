			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: PNG mining group expects to tap Nena Mr Norm Fussell, chairman of Highlands Gold, the Papua New Guinea-based mining company which is controlled by Australia's MIM Holdings, said yesterday that directors were increasingly confident that a mine could be developed at Nena, the copper/gold prospect close to the Frieda River in the West Sepik province, within four years. The resource, he said, was estimated to contain 1.2m ounces of gold and 1.2m tonnes of copper. Highlands' stake in it is 66 per cent. Exploration expenditure this year is expected to rise to K15m (Dollars 9.4m) more than treble last year's level.</p>

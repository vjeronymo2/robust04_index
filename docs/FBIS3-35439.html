			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By Seyyed Morteza Nabavi] </F> <H5>  [18 Jan pp 1, 3] </H5>   [Text]  <H3>  Oil Revenues in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] and  Foreign Debts </H3> <H5>  [Part 1] </H5>    The general revenues of the country for 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995], projected at 33,767 billion rials[Rls],  indicate an increase of 42.5 percent compared to the general  revenues for this year. Considering the substantial decrease in  the price of oil and the inability to achieve the anticipated  revenues this year, no clear, hopeful prospects exist regarding  oil next year. The disagreement of the members of OPEC regarding  the reduction in the production ceiling, the increase in North  Sea oil production, the decrease in the cost of oil excavation  by non-OPEC countries, and the probability of the entry of Iraq  into the world market indicate an uncertain future in terms of  the price of oil.    In the United States, it has been projected that if small  oil  companies suffer losses due to the decrease in the price of oil,  they should somehow receive subsidies. Also, the non-OPEC  oil-producing countries do not need to raise the price of oil,  as they apparently make more of a profit at low prices. In  addition, the oppressive powers will likely force Saudi Arabia  to increase production in order to keep prices down.    In the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] proposed budget,  the government has projected oil revenues at $12.45 billion,  which for the above reasons seems unrealistic. This figure has  been reduced to $9,444,000,000 in the joint meeting of the  Economic and Finance and Planning and Budget Committees and to  $10.5 billion in the joint meeting of the Petroleum Affairs and  Planning and Budget Committees.    The figure of $10.5 billion arrived at in the Petroleum  Affairs and Planning and Budget Committees is based on the  premise that OPEC will lower its production ceiling, and from  this perspective the export of 2.1 million barrels per day has  been calculated at $13 per barrel. Certainly, if the OPEC  members come to this agreement, that is, to reduce the  production ceiling, and act on it, the above-mentioned price  will materialize. But, as was pointed out, this is doubtful.  Such a determination does not exist at the present time, and  other OPEC members do not support it. The projection of the  joint meeting of the Economic and Finance and Planning and  Budget Committees seems closer to reality.    Based on a projected oil-demand model, which is dependent on  growth in the industrial countries, the price of oil and the  price of one fuel, such as coal, have been considered. With the  anticipated growth of 1 percent in industrial countries, the  OPEC base price next year is figured at $11. Given this figure,  the price of Iranian oil on the average will be $2 less than  this amount, and even $9,444,000,000 might not materialize.    If the world oil market improves next year, steps can be  taken to repay the deferred debts. Also, if in the first six  months of 1373 [21 March-22 September 1994] oil revenues go  beyond projections, the projects can be prioritized and the next  projects implemented as well. New projects must not be started  on the basis of the above revenues, because they will not  achieve results on time.    This year, there were $19.5 billion in outstanding debts, of  which in the first nine months of this year about $6 billion  were paid, about $3 billion have been credited, and we have  about $8 billion in late payments. Considering that the late  payments will reach $10 billion by the end of this year, it  would seem that if the oil revenues are achieved, the repayment  of these debts will be given priority. While there is no clear  program for the repayment of debts, it cannot be determined what  amount of the foreign currency that is gained can be converted  into rials and deposited in the government treasury.    The schedule of payment of foreign debts is the first and  foremost issue that must be clarified before any decision  concerning the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget is  made. Next year, about $6 billion in debts will be due. The  situation of the payment of these debts must be clarified.    Because of the delay in the payment of debts, the country's  foreign trade now faces problems, which must be resolved. At  present, due to the lack of cooperation of foreign companies and  banking networks, goods are purchased at a 20-30 percent higher  rate.    Government insurance has also stopped. If the situation with  regard to the schedule of debt payments is not clarified, even  on the minimum oil revenue accounts cannot be opened.  Clarification must be made for next year concerning the amount  of oil revenues that must be spent on making the late payments  and outstanding obligations, what amount will be spent on set  purchases, and what amount of foreign currency will be made  available to the Central Bank with which to manage the market.  If next year, like this year, we face problems with regard to  creating new commitments, certainly these limited dollars cannot  be converted into rials. The 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]  budget law projected $13 billion in new commitments, whereas in  actuality the amount will not be more than $5 billion.    In its proposed 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget  bill, the government has anticipated that $1 billion in oil  revenues will be spent on reducing the ceiling of foreign  obligations. In other words, out of $12.4 billion, $1 billion  will be reduced and the remainder multiplied by Rls1,750 and  calculated as part of the budget revenues. How much of the  foreign currency can be converted to floating-rate foreign  currency is questionable, because some of the installments of  the debts are based on 70-Rls and 600-Rls dollars and must be  paid from next year's revenues.    As some experts believe, in the interests of the country, we  must pay our debts as soon as possible, because, considering the  recession in the world economy, interest rates are at their  lowest level, and as soon as the economy improves, interest  rates will rise, in which case, we will be forced to pay high  interest on the late payments.  <H5>  [19 Jan pp 1, 16] </H5>   [Text]  <H3>  Taxes and Tax Revenues in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] Budget </H3> <H5>  Part 2 </H5>    According to this year's budget law, the level of tax  revenues is projected at about 5,409 billion rials. However, the  likelihood is that, due to the inability to collect "important  taxes," this figure will not be achieved. Tax revenues this year  are anticipated at Rls440 billion.    Considering the creation of a single foreign-currency rate,  from the beginning of 1372 [21 March 1993], the rate of tariffs  on imported goods was supposed to be amended. Unfortunately,  during the first eight months of this year, such an amendment  did not take place. In the past, the level of tariffs was on the  average 2 percent of the value of imported goods, which is a  very low figure. In the past years, in order to prevent price  increases on goods and protect consumers, import tariffs were  kept at a low level, and consequently domestic production was  harmed. Following the initial reform of import tariffs, the  Majles based the level of customs taxes and fees at zero but  gave permission to the government to amend and implement the  rates through commercial taxes. The government also set  commercial taxes at an average of 8 percent. But, as was pointed  out, in the first eight months of the year, the old tariffs  (averaging 2 percent) continued to be imposed. This 8 percent  was put into effect for the last four months of this year.    The level of 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] tax revenues  has been projected by the government at Rls6,400 billion, which  seems achievable. But the requirement is that customs taxes and  fees increase from the present 8 percent to 18 percent on  average. An increase in taxes on imported goods, in addition to  being in the interest of domestic products, will result in tax  revenues being achieved. Considering the minimum of $7 billion  in imports subject to customs tariffs and commercial taxes, it  would not be unlikely for tax revenues to be procured from this  sector next year.    The government was supposed to present a bill to the Majles  on the level of customs taxes and fees, in accordance with the  authorization given by the Majles to the government. This has  not been done yet. Considering that the legal deadline is Tir  1373 [22 June-22 July 1994], hopefully the government will  devise the bill on tariffs as quickly as possible in order to  enable the Majles to carry out an expert study and ratify it,  thus enabling us to collect an average of 18 percent in tariffs  on the value of imports from the start of 1373 [21 March 1994].  This is a practical step towards achieving the needed tax  revenues.    On the other hand, the level of taxes on companies, which  was  projected at Rls1,443 billion in the 1372 [21 March 1993-20  March 1994] budget law, in practice will go beyond the  ratification and will reach Rls1,700 billion, which marks a  17.8-percent increase. Hence, in terms of taxes on companies,  the figures for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] are practical.    The grand leader of the revolution spoke of "observing  social  justice" and "collecting taxes on the basis of income" as  policies governing the Second Plan. These points must be  implemented as soon as possible. The Ministry of Economic  Affairs and Finance, by establishing and equipping a  computerized system, is trying to make its information about the  tax resources more accurate. At the present time, not all the  tax resources are known. For this reason, some social classes  are known to carry a heavier tax burden. Some of this problem  will be eliminated with the issuance of tax cards on the basis  of which actual and legal persons will receive a code. These  cards have begun to be issued, and individuals must use them in  any transaction. In this way, more precise information on tax  sources will be obtained. Hopefully, codes will be given to  taxpayers as soon as possible to prepare the grounds for  creating an equitable tax system and observing social justice,  as Ayatollah Khamene'i emphasized. In this way, tax revenues  will increase. It is hoped that the Ministry of Economic Affairs  and Finance will make an effort to implement this plan as soon  as possible on a widespread basis in order to ensure that  persons with higher incomes pay more taxes.    One of the problems with tax laws is excessive exemptions.  According to an expert study, "50 percent of the [potential] tax  sources are exempt from the payment of taxes." As a result, the  tax burden is imposed on the remaining 50 percent. The issue is  not that tax exemptions should be eliminated altogether, but  that in some cases it is necessary. However, any kind of  exemption must be determined on the basis of accurate, expert  calculations. Exemptions must not cause an excessive burden to  be imposed on one group of actual and legal persons. At the  present, large government and public companies, foundations, and  banks, some of which have major incomes, are exempt from the  payment of taxes. The treatment of these companies must be  revised. This action, on the one hand, will clarify the tax  sources and enter them into the government treasury and, on the  other, prevent harm to production. Government and public  companies, organizations, establishments, foundations, and banks  must deposit their taxes in the Treasury, and if there is need  for assistance from a specific source, this amount must be  returned to them at the required level. Because the  above-mentioned units do not pay taxes, similar units in the  nongovernmental and nonpublic sectors, which are required to pay  taxes, are unable to compete with them. In addition to reducing  costs in certain units compared to others (discrimination in  protection), this situation eliminates sound competition. For  this reason, in many areas with active government and  government-affiliated companies and public establishments,  essentially there is no inclination for people to engage in  investment and production. Also, some banks, in order to avoid  the payment of taxes, have moved towards buying buildings.  Hence, the suggestion has been made that tax revenues be  distributed justly, a new dynamism be created in production, and  tax exemptions be revised. According to an expert estimate, the  "GDP" [gross domestic product] ratio in 1372 [21 March 1993-20  March 1994] is 22 percent, and if half of the taxpayers are  exempt from tax payments, the result will be that tax pressure  at a level of 44 percent will be placed on the other half.    The examination of the budget bill this year will undergo  two  rounds of discussion, and in the first round of discussions,  only the revenues will be examined. Most committees have new tax  and fee suggestions for securing revenue resources, some of  which are reasonable and some unreasonable. On the whole, this  examination will be followed by an increase in the price of  goods and services. For example, in order to improve cultural  issues regarding education or health and treatment, which are  very important, the collection of taxes within the framework of  the Constitution may be desirable. But putting taxes on  everything is certainly problematic. Will consumers agree to the  increase in the price of gasoline from Rls50 to Rls120 per liter  so that, for instance, the Bandar 'Abbas Refinery can be  activated more quickly? Certain issues will be addressed in the  following sections of this article in addition to a discussion  of Note 25 of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill.  <H5>  [20 Jan pp 1, 16] </H5>   [Text]  <H3>  Increase in the Price of Kerosene, Gasoline, and Other Oil  Products </H3> <H5>  Part 3 </H5>    One of the most important characteristics of the 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill is Note 25. According to  this note, if ratified by the Majles, the price of certain  government goods and services will increase. The prices of  kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, electricity, post,  and telephone are among the goods and services, which will see  increased prices.    At present, the price of gasoline, which in Iran is 50 rials  per liter, is Rls200 in Kuwait, Rls270 in the United Arab  Emirates (Dubai), Rls1,090 in Turkey, and Rls260 in Qatar. Also,  the prices per liter of kerosene are Rls200 in Kuwait, Rls980 in  Turkey, and Rls43 in Dubai, all of which are significantly  higher than the Rls15 RLS charged in Iran.[.sup]1.[/]    The low rate of oil products in Iran has resulted, on the  one  hand, in the extraordinary growth in consumption of these  products and, on the other, the smuggling of these goods into  countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, Turkey,  and Pakistan. The consumption of kerosene in Iran, with a  population of about 60 million people, is equivalent to its  consumption in China, with a population of 1.1 billion people.    The level of fuel consumption in Iran at the present is $10  billion worth annually. Some experts believe that if the present  trend of growth in the consumption of oil products continues, in  a period of less than 10 years, all domestically produced oil  will be consumed. Based on this reasoning, the government has  proposed in Note 25 that the prices per liter of gasoline  increase from 50 to Rls120, kerosene and airplane fuel from 15  to Rls30, diesel fuel from 10 to Rls20, and heating oil from 8  to Rls10, and the price of natural gas increase from 10.7 to  Rls12.4 per cubic meter. According to this proposal, the  difference between the above prices will be collected as taxes  on the sale of oil products and spent on investments. But the  decision on whether the collected taxes will be spent on  investment in oil affairs or other areas has been left for the  second round of discussions in the Majles.    At the same time, the Ministry of Petroleum, on the basis of  Rls1,600 per dollar, has estimated the costs per liter of  kerosene, gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil without  calculating the transportation costs of Rls294, Rls275, Rls263,  and Rls134, respectively.    The amounts to be collected as taxes on oil products in 1373  [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], based on the suggestion of the  government, will be mainly invested in refining and  transportation, according to the ratification of the Majles. The  government has projected that 89 percent of investments will be  in refining programs, 72.4 percent in transportation, and 7.3  percent production of oil products, through the imposition of  the taxes in Note 25 [percentages as published]. The creation of  the Arak and Bandar 'Abbas refineries; the building of platforms  in the Caspian Sea; the building of fuel stations; the  reconstruction and construction of Naftshahr; the building of  pipelines; and the development of the Sarakhs natural gas  fields, the Oil Industry University, Kangan Natural Gas, and  several other projects are among those projects, of which the  implementation has been suggested to the Majles by the  government from the funds obtained from taxes.    Even though the government has the authority and is able to  make a decision in the Economic Council concerning the increase  in the price of oil products, due to the social and economic  pressures regarding the above-mentioned taxes, it has sent its  proposals to the Majles. This is a commendable action worthy of  gratitude.    This year, as well, the government intended to increase the  price per liter of gasoline to Rls80 through the Economic  Council; however, due to the reaction of the Majles, no decision  was made in this regard. Offering the proposals in the form of  the budget will familiarize the Majles deputies more tangibly  with the realities.    Some deputies, on the one hand, expect the plans and  projects  to expand rapidly and, on the other hand, expect oil products to  be offered to the people at a low rate. In making decisions,  these two views are contradictory. If the deputies oppose the  increase in prices, they must accept the fact that the speed of  growth and development will decrease, and progress will be  slower. Thus, pressuring the executive officials to implement  the projects in their constituent regions is unreasonable. If  the Majles is willing to accept an increase in prices at the  intended level, it should also be accountable for its  consequences.    What facilitates decision making concerning oil products is  the calculation of the effects of price increases, especially in  regards to fuel. Majles deputies have asked the experts of the  government, the Plan and Budget Organization, and the Central  Bank to calculate and predict the effects of these increases on  other goods and services in order to see whether or not the  people can tolerate the inflationary pressures resulting from  these increases. Undoubtedly, with the increase in the price of  fuel, the cost of transportation will increase, and with the  increase in cargo and passenger fares, many goods and services  will be affected. The Majles welcomes expert plans by both  government organizations and independent experts. These plans  must firstly generate conservation with regard to the  consumption of oil products. Second, they must prevent pressures  being applied to the downtrodden and low-income classes. Third,  they should not have unpleasant political, social, and economic  effects. And, fourth, no subsidies must be given to the  high-income strata.    To subsidize the low-income and deprived classes, in selling  natural gas, rates should be based on a sliding scale, and  natural gas meters should be used to ensure that the low-income  classes and those with low consumption do not face problems.  This can force consumers to conserve.    In order to subsidize kerosene, gasoline, and other  products,  to return to a coupon system, given its ill effects, is not  proper. Therefore, a cash subsidy can be put into effect,  provided identification is carefully handled and precise  information on the income and occupation of individuals is  available.    In cities and villages, the public transportation system can  be subsidized and prices increased in other areas. But in cities  such as Tehran, where public transportation is insufficient and  personal vehicles play a significant role, another solution must  be found for the payment of subsidies. Otherwise, the  above-mentioned factors will escalate the inflationary effects  of the increase in the price of gasoline.    Considering that high-income and well-to-do families consume  more fuel, naturally they benefit more from general subsidies,  and this is contrary to social justice. On the other hand, the  elimination of general subsidies may also create unpleasant  effects for the vulnerable classes. In this regard, it is  necessary to make careful calculations before appropriate  decisions can be made.    Of course, to impose conservation in energy use, in addition  to price increases, there are other methods that can be  implemented. The development and dissemination of technical  knowledge and the spread of a culture of conservation are among  them.    God willing, the discussion on Note 25 concerning the  increase in the price of services, electricity, post, and  telephone in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget will  be continued in the next issue.  Footnote  [.sup]1.[/] Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar are  all oil-producing countries and southern neighbors of Iran.  Turkey also, as a neighboring nonoil country, has been used as  evidence. If the price of oil products is compared to that of  industrial countries, there is more of a gap. At the present  time, a liter of gasoline is Rls1,591 in Germany, Rls571 in the  United States, Rls1,528 in France, and Rls2,008 in Japan, and  the price per liter of kerosene is Rls1,007 in Japan and Rls330  in the United States. The price per liter of diesel fuel is  Rls1,190 in Germany, Rls297 in the United States, Rls1,067 in  France, and Rls1,328 in Japan. The price per liter of heating  fuel is Rls448 in Turkey, Rls171 in the United States, Rls242 in  Germany, Rls313 in France, Rls497 in Japan, and Rls5 in Iran. It  is noteworthy that these prices are based on the rate of  Rls1,600 to the dollar.  <H5>  [22 Jan pp 1, 20] </H5>   [Text]  <H3>  The Increase in the Price of Electricity, Telephone  Communication, and Postal Services in the 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March 1995] Budget </H3>  <H5>  Part 4 </H5>   In the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the  government has proposed an increase in the average per kwh  [kilowatt hour] price of electricity from 17 rials to Rls33.5.  Since there is a relatively clear picture available of the  various uses of electricity, making a decision in this regard is  simpler than that concerning oil products. At the present time,  38 percent of all electricity consumption is domestic, 32  percent industrial, 18 percent public use (including schools,  universities, offices, mosques, barracks, pharmacies, etc.), and  12 percent for other uses (commercial, agricultural, and  mobile). Suitable policies can be devised appropriate to each of  these.    The electricity industry requires heavy investment. If we  want to avoid blackouts, there is no other way but investment.  If investments are calculated at the day's prices, for the  production of every kwh of electricity (based on 4.4 cents in  foreign currency use at the market rate and Rls10 in rial  costs), Rls100 are necessary. Of course, at the present, the  cost of electricity, due to the low-rate foreign currency  received, is about Rls10. If fuel is calculated on the basis of  present prices and the remaining production factors on the basis  of the floating rate, the cost of every kwh of electricity will  be reduced to Rls50.    The level of electricity consumption at the present is  uncontrolled, and the revenues of the country are insufficient  for investment in this industry.    In order to prevent blackouts and conserve electricity, the  rates must necessarily be modified. Implementing a sliding rate  in such a way that no pressure is placed on the lower classes  and presenting a correct model to the consumer can solve  problems. In this case, those clients who reduce consumption  will face lower rates.    The level of usual and reasonable consumption for a family  is  250 kwh. This group of consumers, mostly deprived and low-income  individuals, can be given cost discounts and pay at the present  prices. (Of course, the minimum is different in regards to  warm-climate regions that use natural gas air conditioning.)  Families that use between 250 kwh and 500 kwh of electricity  should pay half the cost (Rls50 per kwh). In addition, families  that use 500 kwh and above should pay the total cost (based on  Rls50 per kwh). With these measures, 38 percent of electricity  consumption will be controlled.    To conserve industrial use, which makes up 32 percent of the  total consumption, at the peak hours (maximum use), such as  early evening, the price of electricity can be increased in  order to allow industrial units to regulate their work shifts so  as not to put pressure on the national network.    One of the existing problems at the present is that  electricity production must increase a great deal in order to  cover service for peak hours. If steps such as those mentioned  are taken, there will be less need for large investment  expenditures.    A point that must be noted in connection with industry is  that the level of electricity consumption, with some exceptions,  such as aluminum production, does not effect the cost of  industrial production very much. The highest level of  electricity consumption is in aluminum production, which uses  Rls750 worth of electricity per kg of aluminum production.    The repair of factories can be done in summer, because the  consumption load is very high in the summer months. Most  factories make repairs once a year, during which time the  consumption load is reduced.    The level of demand can also be used in industry. That is,  as  consumer demand goes beyond a certain level, it should be  followed by an increase in the price of electricity. Also,  incentives should be implemented to reduce consumption in the  production units, such that if a factory can do its work with 60  kwh of electricity, it will not increase it to 70 kwh.    Public uses, such as schools, mosques, and pharmacies, can  be  exempt from price increases, and others, such as offices and  barracks that have the most waste in public consumption, must be  required to pay the costs. Unfortunately, the lights of some  government offices are turned on during the daytime, and  modifying the price can encourage conservation. In connection  with commercial units, as well, the implementation of a  progressive rate policy can change the consumption model from  high-use to low-use lamps.    In the area of agriculture, considering its essential  nature,  there should be no price increases, in order to encourage these  activities.    In any case, in connection with electricity, various  scenarios exist, the best of which can be chosen and implemented  in such a way that, in addition to creating conservation,  pressure on deprived classes will be prevented and reasonable  development will follow.    The average price of a postal parcel is Rls65 at the  present.  With Rls35 in taxes for 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], as  proposed by the government and if ratified by the Majles, it  will be Rls100. One of the problems with this proposal is that  the rates are not divided according to urban, intercity, and  foreign parcels.    Even though the Postal Company, considering its present  revenues, faces problems, the point should be taken into  consideration that the least expensive method of communication  throughout the world is the postal service.    It is not clear why the Ministry of Post, Telegraph and  Telephone monopolizes postal services and does not allow the  people to establish parallel postal units (of course, under the  supervision of this ministry). This can give people choices and  create competition. Private and nongovernmental companies may be  able to offer postal services at lower rates. The Constitution  does not prohibit the government from issuing permits to the  people to engage in postal activities while supervising them.  One of the claims that has prevented people from taking charge  of postal services is that "private companies charge  excessively." The response is that people have a choice, and if  this occurs, they will not use such companies.    The increase in price of every pulse [words illegible] from  Rls12 to Rls20 on the average in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] is another government proposal to the Majles. In other  words, for every pulse, Rls8 in taxes will be added. [sentence  as published]    In many countries in the world, no money is collected to  receive a telephone line, and fees are collected from clients  based on the level of calls. However, in Iran, not only are  Rls600,000 to Rls1 million collected for every telephone line  received, but charges are also made in terms of the rate of  pulse. [sentence as published] Any new change in this connection  will depend on determining the actual cost of a telephone line.  The Communication Management Organization of the Plan and Budget  Organization has estimated the establishment of every telephone  line on the basis of $600 foreign currency costs and  148,000-toman rial use at 270,000 tomans, whereas another  estimate, based on Rls$521 in foreign currency expenditures and  30,000 tomans in rial expenditures, determines the cost of every  telephone line to be 134,200 tomans. The prices of the Plan and  Budget Organization seem less accurate. For this reason,  investment on the basis of Rls20 RLS per pulse seems high.  [sentence as published]    The last point that can be discussed in connection with Note  25 of the budget law is that if in its first round of  discussions the Majles ratifies the taxes on oil products,  electricity, communications, and post, the answer to the  question of whether the above-mentioned amounts, based on  government proposals, will be placed at the disposal of the  Ministries of Petroleum; Energy; and Post, Telephone and  Telegraph for investment or whether another area will be  suggested for their use will come in the second round of  discussions in the Majles. In any case, the issue depends on the  Majles deputies' determination to more carefully examine the  areas for investment from the above-mentioned taxes in the  second round of discussions.  <H5>  [23 Jan pp 1, 16] </H5>   [Text]  <H5>  Government Companies and Banking Funds </H5> <H5>  Part 5 </H5>   The budget of government companies and the level of funds  granted to them are issues that will be dealt with today, as the  discussions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] budget continue. According to the proposed  bill, next year, out of about Rls79,687 billion in the national  budget, the government will allocate Rls50,023 billion to  government companies, Rls5,216 billion to banks, and Rls1,043  billion to for-profit establishments affiliated with the  government. In other words, the government has proposed to the  Majles that in 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], more than  70.3 percent of the national budget be allocated to government  companies, banks, and for-profit establishments affiliated with  the government.    Unfortunately, the outcome of billions of rials in  government  investments in government companies, banks, and for-profit  establishments affiliated with the government is only Rls1,296  billion in profits, taxes, etc., for the government. These units  continue to fail to show a desirable return and efficiency, and  the losses projected for them amount to Rls4,032  billion.[.sup]1.[/] Essentially, why must 34,000 discovered  violations occur in government companies every  year?[.sup]2.[/]    Lack of care and sufficient supervision of the Majles over  the budget of government companies in the past years has created  such a situation. Essentially, the examination of the budget of  these companies was conferred on their general assembly, which  is comprised of a few ministers. In accordance with Article 53  of the Constitution,[.sup]3.[/] the budget of these companies  was presented to the Majles a few years ago. Supervision over  the budgets of government companies was more carefully accounted  for in the 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] budget law, but  because there was insufficient time in this regard, the  government was obliged to carry over the budget of government  companies to Khordad 1372 [22 May-21 Jun 1993] and receive  permission to spend based on the ratified budget through  Shahrivar [23 August-22 September]. Unfortunately, the  government did not present the report on the budget of these  companies on time to the Majles.    Another point in connection with the budget of government  companies is their number. Some believe that instead of fewer  than 500 units reflected in the bill, the number of these  companies exceeds 1,000 or 1,500 units. Based on permission  received earlier in their charters, these companies were  permitted to establish subsidiary companies, which they did.  But, unfortunately, the accounts of the subsidiary companies are  not reflected anywhere. In addition, no reference is made in the  budget laws to the names of all the companies in which the  government has shares. Such problems have resulted in a large  volume of the Muslim Treasury in the government units not being  supervised by the Majles. Even the Auditing Organization and the  Accounting Office have no supervision over these units.    Government companies sometimes allow expenditures that are  inappropriate to the initial goals of their establishment. The  waste and extravagance of these companies require separate  detailed discussion, and we will not give examples at this time.  The vehicles and other equipment that these companies donate to  the related ministries are examples of such extravagance. Some  government companies show little profit. Some are exempt from  taxes. It is not clear what amount of their reserve is spent on  investment or used to eliminate their cash needs. In any case,  an examination of government and government-affiliated companies  is important from various dimensions. Many of these units can be  transferred to the people, and thus both reduce the burden of  the government and make their activities "economical."    In the past, if government companies intended to make  investments, the government would allocate certain amounts in  the general budget for the development of these investments.  Following the increase in the volume of government expenditures  in the past few years, meeting the investment needs of the  government companies has been shifted towards the use of banking  funds.    The funds that the government invests in government  companies  or the funds that these companies receive must somehow be paid.  This has not occurred in many of these companies, and the  remainder of the debts of the companies to the banks and the  Central Bank are increasing regularly.    Government companies will receive Rls7,314 billion in loans  in accordance with the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] budget  bill and in exchange will pay Rls2,949 billion of the loans  received in the past years. As a result, in terms of next year's  budget, Rls4,365 billion will be added to the government debt to  the banking system.    If the investment of government companies through the use of  banking funds is economically justified, there is no argument,  because these funds will be repaid within a reasonable period of  time. But, unfortunately, this issue is postponed to the  following year's budget, and ultimately, the repayment is placed  on the shoulders of the government itself. What has become  common in the budget bills is that through the budget, the  Central Bank and other banks are obliged to place funds at the  disposal of these companies, which is sometimes against the  monetary policies. The 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] bill  anticipates 12 notes for this purpose.[.sup]4.[/] For  example, Note 17 obliges the Central Bank to allocate 100  billion RLS in funds to build a student dormitory, which is by  no means economically justified, because when this dormitory is  built, it will provide no income to help repay the debt. In  fact, this is the kind of budget deficit, which has been  transferred to the banking system. Certainly, no one opposes the  building of a student dormitory; but this is a matter to which  the government must allocate funds from the general budget. The  result of such a decision is that it would make the banks  economically unsound. The banks must be allowed to work  economically if monitoring is to be precise.  Footnotes    [.sup]1.[/] If government companies and banks have  operational revenues of Rls31,290 billion and their current  expenditures are Rls35,322 billion, naturally, they will have  Rls4,032 billion in operational deficits.    [.sup]2.[/] Reported by the Accounting Office.    [.sup]3.[/] Article 53 of the Constitution states: All  government receipts will be concentrated in the accounts of the  General Treasury, and all payments will derive from ratified  funds in accordance with the law.    [.sup]4.[/] Notes 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 17, 23, 50, 51, 52, 53,  and 54.  <H5>  24 Jan pp 1, 16 </H5>   [Text]  <H5>  Cash Flow and Inflation </H5> <H5>  Last Part </H5>   In the previous issue, the discussion concerned the adding  of  Rls4,365 billion by government companies to the government's  debt to the banking system, according to the 1373 [21 March  1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, because they fail to repay a  major part of the loans received. Also, the emphasis was made  that the obligation of the government to repay some of the funds  that cannot be repaid to the banks and the Central Bank is, in  fact, a sort of budget deficit, which has been transferred to  the banking network. This issue will focus on the level of funds  received in government companies and private units and their  role in cash flow and inflation.    Unfortunately, a great gap also exists at the level of  granting funds to people and government sectors. In the 1373 [21  March 1994-20 March 1995] budget bill, the government has  obliged banks to pay Rls7,598 billion in funds to government and  private organizations. Of this amount, Rls6,033 billion are  allocated to government and government-affiliated units and  Rls1,565 billion to the private sector. Among the government  organizations, a large share of these resources will be placed  at the disposal of oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, subways,  steel, airlines, and sugar cane projects.[.sup]1.[/]    Next year, if the banks are obliged to pay the funds at the  above-mentioned level and the private sector also receives funds  at the level of this year, the increased cash flow will exceed  25 percent,[.sup]2.[/], which is inappropriate with the  average of 11.7 percent determined in the Second Developmental  Plan of the government.    Since the rate of inflation growth has advanced in step with  the cash flow, inflation also can increase at the same ratio  next year. This is while there is no budget deficit. Otherwise,  the cash flow will grow more.    The dear Majles deputies must note that increased cash flow  escalates inflation and high prices, unless the ceiling of  obligatory funds of the banks and the Central Bank is revised.  Through the control of funds, inflation can be harnessed.  Considering the limitation on general revenues, it is necessary  to decrease the speed of the increase in cash flow in order to  prevent the imposition of problematic inflation which mainly  targets the deprived strata and low-income classes.    As much as possible, the payment of funds for investments  with no economic justification, and of which the repayment by  government companies is impossible, must be avoided. This step  is considered a kind of budget deficit and causes inflation.    The most important point in connection with the banking  network is that the structure of its organization must be  reformed and revised. At present, the rate of administrative,  organizational, and advertising expenditures of banks is high.  Also, the banking network demands a great deal in terms of  profit and service charges from loan applicants.    These issues must be reviewed. At the present, the banks  transfer many expenditures to loan recipients, including those  for advertising, employment, the opening of new branches,  expensive decorations, and the construction and purchasing of  numerous buildings. The cost of money (equipping of resources)  in the banks is higher than it should be, and the people are  paying for it.    One of the criticisms of the administration of banks is the  composition of the Monetary and Credit Council, a significant  number of the members of which are representatives of the  ministries that use the funds. To reform the monetary system,  the composition of the Monetary and Credit Council must change  and mainly be composed of a headquarters, economic officials,  and economic experts and not the consumers of the funds. In  addition, in order to reform the system of economic decision  making, the composition of the Economic Council must also  change, because in this council, the consumer organizations make  up the majority and promote the uneconomical decisions of the  Economic Council.    One criticism, which is true of the work of the banks, is  that they have become company owners and entered directly into  the administration of companies. Companies that have not been  economically sound, which rely on the support of the banking  network and suffer significantly from extravagance, must be  transferred to the people and become profitable as quickly as  possible. Direct investments amounting to 50 percent of the  shares must also be transferred to the people.    As monopoly is harmful in many economic activities, the  banks  must keep monopolies within the framework of Islamic laws and  the Constitution. Nonbanking credit establishments must be  allowed to engage in activities to provide the grounds for sound  competition. With this action, government banks that at the  present time consider themselves nongovernmental and public will  no longer be able to impose any cost on the users of funds.  Footnotes    [.sup]1.[/] The level of loans to be received by some of  the companies from the banking system in 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March 1995] is as follows: National Oil Company, Rls1,643  billion; Falat-e Qarreh, Rls130 billion; National Oil Products  Distribution Company, about Rls166 billion; National Natural Gas  Company, Rls226 billion; Iranian Electrical Power Production and  Transmission Company, Rls427 billion; National Iranian Steel  Company, Rls280 billion; Steel Mill, Rls100 billion; Mobarakeh  Steel, Rls120 billion; National Petrochemical Industries  Company, Rls1,062 billion; Islamic Republic Airlines, Rls150  billion; the Iranian National Steel Industries Group, Rls100  billion; Metro Company, Rls100 billion; and Sugar Cane  Development and Subsidiary Industries Company, Rls500 billion.    [.sup]2.[/] Next year, from the notes of the budget alone,  16 percent will be added to the cash flow.</p>

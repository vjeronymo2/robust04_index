			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Exports of Famous Grouse provide cheer for Highland HIGHLAND Distilleries, the independent Scotch whisky group, increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 28.7m to Pounds 38.8m last year thanks to increased exports of Famous Grouse and a change in the accounting treatment of its 35.4 per cent stake in the blender Robertson &amp; Baxter. Equity accounting for Robertson added Pounds 7.4m to profits. Although Famous Grouse profits rose Pounds 3.6m, this was partially offset by a fall in contribution from other whiskies. Famous Grouse, which contributes 55 per cent of group profits, increased sales in overseas markets by 14 per cent, against an overall increase for the industry of 1 per cent. The results showed the benefits of Remy-Cointreau's distribution of Famous Grouse, with notable market share gains registered in Sweden, Greece, the Netherlands, Thailand and Venezuela. In the last three years, Famous Grouse exports have risen from 550,000 to 850,000 cases and 40 per cent of sales are now overseas. In the UK, sales slipped 3 per cent in line with the market, but the brand maintained its premium price and 14 per cent market share. Profits from the sale of new and mature malt whiskies declined as blenders adjusted stock. Group operating profits in the year to August 31 were 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 23.5m, on turnover marginally up at Pounds 171.1m. The group repaid, at a cost of Pounds 4.9m, a FFr300m (Pounds 35m) loan raised in 1990 to help finance its investment in Orpar, the Remy holding company. The repayment reduced gearing from 6 per cent to 1 per cent. Earnings per share, excluding Robertson, rose to 16.2p (15.1p). A final dividend of 5p makes a total of 6.6p (from 6p).

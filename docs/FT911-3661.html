			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Managers shun passport offer BRITAIN'S offer of up to 50,000 passports to key Hong Kong people has been poorly received by managers and administrators, the individuals the package was designed to attract. Just fewer than 15,000 passports have been allocated for managers and administrators, the largest job category in the package. The quota has been under-subscribed by about 10 per cent, according to Mr Donald Tsang, director of administration. The package was introduced last year under the British Nationality Act. It was one of a series of measures designed to restore confidence in Hong Kong, severely shocked by the crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in Peking in June 1989. All the other job categories have been over-subscribed, some heavily. The government received 1,000 applications from legal professionals by the time the offer closed at the end of February against a quota for this category of only 185. Mr Tsang said the response by private sector managers and administrators was not surprising because they were the only people who had to disclose details about income. Almost 400 passports were set aside within the managers and administrators category for civil servants. Competition for these passports was fierce, according to Mr Tsang. The government received just over 63,800 applications for the first tranche of 38,900 passports on offer for people in the general occupations and disciplined services. A further 1,800 people, including entrepreneurs and sensitive service personnel, have been invited to apply by the Governor. The response was much poorer than expected. China's opposition to the scheme, a feeling in Hong Kong the scheme was elitist and a dislike of the UK were all blamed for the low level of interest. 'I only want a British passport so I can go and live in Paris after 1992,' says a 28-year-old Hong Kong Chinese journalist who did apply. Mr Tsang said any passports left over from the managers and administrators category can be carried forward and given out in the second tranche when a further 6,750 passports are on offer. Applications for the second tranche will run from 1994 to June 1997, when Hong Kong is handed back to China.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chen Xiao: "Anti-Inflation Efforts Are On Track"] </F>   [Text] A continuous slowdown to the gung-ho economy in the  second quarter of this year will help to cool down the sizzling  inflation which may pose a threat to social stability.    Further progress will come around the corner as the central  government sticks to an anti-inflation policy as its basic tune  for the rest of the year.    At the same time, however, the central government will have  to pay more attention to the lukewarm market demand which is  believed to be putting the brakes on rapid economic growth and  leaving mounting stockpiles of commodities in its wake.    "At the macroscopic level, the economy is getting onto a  healthy track with declining industrial growth in the second  quarter," said Li Guobin with the State Information Centre  (SIC), who is in charge of short-term economic forecasting.    "It is encouraging that the general retail price index for  the period is predicted to drop 16.7 percent, 3.4 percentage  points down from the first quarter."    According to the SIC, manufacturing in the second quarter is  predicted to grow at 18.0 percent, a slight drop of 0.6  percentage points against the first quarter.    The growth of credit in circulation is estimated at 24.6  percent, 3.4 percentage points slower than the rate of the first  quarter.    According to a report released by the State Planning  Commission, the gross domestic product will grow at the rate of  12 percent in the first half of this year.    A slight drop in economic growth is desired by the central  government, which is eager to free its hands from fighting  economic overheating to focus instead on deepening reforms.    China badly needs a more relaxed environment to further its  reforms in 1994, the year seen as the midpoint in China's era of  reforms.    Although inflation is still reeling with a two-digit rate,  resulting in negative interest rates, people are reluctant to  open their purses in the market and choose instead to keep their  money in the bank.    The outstanding bank savings are expected to climb 38  percent  to reach 1,770 billion yuan ($203.4 billion) in the second  quarter.    "This may be the best way for people to protect themselves  from inflation because most consumers have drawn lessons from  the buying spree in 1988 and have become more cool-headed when  shopping." said Zhang Yingxiang, an analyst with the State  Statistics Bureau (SSB).    In 1988, when China first suffered successive months of  double- digit inflation rates, people rushed into panic buying,  caring little about the quality of the goods.    In comparison, people now invest more carefully. And their  gloomy anticipation toward the bear stock market keeps them away  from securities.    Prudent consumption will continue to jam the growth of  retail  sales. According to the SIC, the retail sales volume will  likely dip 6 percentage points for a growth rate of only 19.3  percent in the April-June period.    "In addition to inflation, the sluggish market demand will  be  another outstanding problem in the second quarter." Li said.    The growing stockpiles in warehouses add to the difficulties  of enterprises suffering from a lack of credit.    According to the SSB, by the end of April, unsold products  in  State enterprises grew a disastrous 13.3 percent in value  compared with the same period last year.    Moreover. the increasing stockpiles are shoving more  enterprises into defaulting on their debts. The SSB said that  state enterprises' debts jumped 29.5 percent by the end of April  compared with the same period last year.    Producers of raw materials are not optimistic, since  manufacturers are loathe to buy raw materials, speed up  production, or try to sell their products for fear buyers will  default on payment.    "The central bank should consider reducing interest rates to  somewhat discourage rapid bank savings and encourage buying," Li  said.    His view is shared by a few economists, giving two reasons.    The current round of inflation is not mainly caused by  credit  expansion but, instead, by the rise in production costs and  grain prices which raged on at the end of last year.    At present, the price of producer goods is declining, which  can help to reduce production costs and curb the possible  further price hikes.    Meanwhile, residents will not rush to pull out their savings  deposits if the interest rate is cut because the existing rate  is already 9 percentage points lower than the inflation rate.    "Therefore, a slight cut in the interest rate will not  likely  cause a great decrease in bank savings," Li said.    But the central government is unlikely to take such action  in  the coming months.    However, some other economists, especially those with the  central bank have suggested that the State Council should raise  interest rates to slow down inflation.    It is a difficult decision for the policymakers.    Generally speaking, anti-inflation measures reduce consumer  demand, which will choke State enterprises. However, easing  credit will counteract the efforts against inflation.</p>

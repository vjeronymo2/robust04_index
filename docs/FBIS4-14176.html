			<p>BFN     [Text] On 20 April Labor Party leader Ibrahim Shukri handed  Dr. Yusuf Wali, agriculture minister and secretary general of  the National Democratic Party [NDP], a statement by the  opposition parties and political forces.    The leaders of the opposition parties issued a statement on  14 April concerning a political dialogue and asked the Labor  Party leader to hand it to the NDP secretary general.    The statement says that political reform should be at the  top  of the agenda of a national dialogue and that all opposition  forces should take part in preparations for this dialogue. The  statement also calls for guarantees for fair elections and for  revising laws obstructing the establishment of a democratic  society, noting that terrorism will recede if democracy is  achieved.    The statement also calls for a solution to the economic and  social problems that beset ordinary people.    The following is the text of this statement:    A. When President Husni Mubarak issued a call for national  dialogue at a session of the People's Assembly marking Mubarak's  reelection for a third term, leaders of the opposition parties  and political forces met and unanimously agreed to welcome a  dialogue in principle, viewing the president's call as an answer  to their repeated requests for cooperation and solidarity in  finding the best solutions to the country's problems. The  opposition leaders also examined the principles ensuring the  seriousness of the dialogue and issued a statement including  their views, which they presented to the president and released  to the public.    B. In later exchanges between the NDP and opposition  representatives, it became clear that the NDP agrees with most  of the opposition's statement.    C. This was followed by quite a long period in which there  were no exchanges and no particular steps were taken to prepare  for the conference on a national dialogue.    D. Following a recent meeting of the NDP General  Secretariat, which was chaired by President Mubarak, Information  Minister Safwat al-Sharif announced a decision by the NDP  Secretariat to invite a 25-member committee to prepare for the  national dialogue conference.    E. On 14 April, leaders of the opposition parties and  political forces who signed the aforesaid agreement met to look  into the developments since their previous meeting, and reached  the following conclusions:    1. The conferees, once again, state their commitment to the  statement they issued at their last meeting, in which they  stressed that political reform should be the top priority of a  national dialogue. They also stressed the importance of the  participation of all the opposition forces in preparing for the  dialogue. There is a particular need to guarantee the probity  of elections and to reconsider laws that impede the  establishment of democracy. Democracy will weaken the wave of  terror and help resolve the country's economic and social  problems that haunt the lives of ordinary citizens.    2. A dialogue can only be conducted in a spirit of equality.  Therefore, the opposition leaders request to have a part in  naming the members of the preparatory committee for the national  dialogue conference. They believe that the rules governing the  dialogue should be formulated in agreement among the  participants in that dialogue.    3. The signatories of this statement wish to note the  importance of providing a healthy atmosphere for national  dialogue through the following steps:    a. Ending the arbitrary measures that are being taken  against journalists of opposition papers; and    b. Refraining from passing laws or making decisions that  interfere with national political life, such as the amendment of  the village mayors' law and the extension of the state of  emergency by three years. The latter move, made only two months  before the expiration of the Emergency Law, could have been  delayed until the national dialogue had its say.    We implore Almighty God to guide us all toward what is best  for the nation.</p>

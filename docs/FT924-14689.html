			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Program selling leaves Nikkei lower again PROGRAM selling in the late afternoon eroded earlier gains and left share prices lower, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 156.36 to 17,111.74, the day's low, having firmed initially on buying by individuals, and index-linked purchases by investment trusts, rising to the day's high of 17,531.09 in early afternoon trading. Volume remained thin at 230m shares against 235m. Advances led declines by 528 to 370 with 173 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped just 0.04 to 1,299.09 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.66 to 1034.93. In spite of small-lot buying by public investment funds, leading investors failed to follow suit. The government's stock market support measures, announced with the emergency fiscal support package, included suppression of supply by guiding financial institutions to refrain from heavy selling, and by halting new share offers. On the demand side, an extra Y1,120bn was added to the original figure of Y5,680bn of public funds scheduled for investment. Now, following the interim closing of books at September 30, small-lot selling has emerged as authorities have loosened their grip on sellers. Worries over corporate earnings affected some high-technology issues. NEC, down Y4 at Y691, was one company affected by reports of lower earnings for the fiscal year. Showa Denko, the chemical company, rose Y6 to Y290 on reports that it will forge product development links with Asahi Chemical Industry, which advanced Y4 to Y600. Pharmaceuticals were firm, with Nikken Chemicals gaining Y30 to Y1,040 and Takeda Chemical adding Y30 to Y1,180. Both issues were popular on their research into drugs for Alzheimer's disease. Short-term speculators targeted Kubota, the most active issue of the day, which rose Y30 to Y597. It was bought on the environmental and public works theme; some investors hope that an increase in environmental and public works projects will increase demand for its plumbing systems. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 190.25 to 18,948.97 in volume of 7.3m shares. Roundup ANY rally in Pacific Rim markets yesterday appeared to be short-lived. HONG KONG reversed early losses to finish higher as bargain-hunters used Governor Chris Patten's maiden policy speech as an excuse to buy. The Hang Seng Index was up 35.91 at 5,589.03, having touched a low of 5,498.07 earlier in the session. Turnover fell to HKDollars 1.47bn from HKDollars 1.74bn. Blue chips, which had suffered the greatest losses on Tuesday and earlier in the day, rebounded considerably, with Cheung Kong gaining 10 cents to HKDollars 20.50 and HSBC Holdings adding 50 cents to HKDollars 55.50. SINGAPORE's brief rally ended abruptly as cautious investors sold off shares in late afternoon trading. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 0.89 to 1,331.67 in volume of only 25.64m shares. SEOUL rose on active intervention by institutional investors and the Securities Stabilisation Fund. The index gained 16.62 to 524.38 but brokers said the rally could be short-lived. TAIWAN ended off its highs as investors took quick profits from early gains. The weighted index 29.25 higher at 3,592.12 in turnover of TDollars 13.1bn. MANILA finished lower in slow trading as a downturn in major overseas markets continued to dampen sentiment. The composite index slipped 9.98 to 1,407.80 in combined turnover of 336m pesos after 367m. KUALA LUMPUR fell in the afternoon on renewed selling as investors remained concerned about the market's near-term direction. The composite index ended down 0.11 at 590.59 after standing 2.47 higher at midday, in volume of 61.9m shares. AUSTRALIA's early rally ran out of steam in the afternoon, leaving shares only slightly higher on the day. The All Ordinaries index closed 3.0 higher at 1,455.4. Turnover was light at ADollars 219.7m. NEW ZEALAND was hindered by Carter Holt Harvey, whose 7 cent fall to NZDollars 2.37 was the main reason for the 3.95 point fall in the NZSE-40 index to 1,392.31. Turnover was NZDollars 19m. Donaghys gained 15 cents to NZDollars 3.20 after news of its one-for-10 scrip issue.</p>

			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Government to encourage more private finance - Infrastructure THE government plans to investigate further ways of encouraging the use of private finance for infrastructure projects. The Treasury said yesterday: 'The government does not see this as the end of the process.' The chancellor was 'looking to the private sector to identify barriers to the successful development of the policy as well as to bring forward proposals for projects'. The objective of the changes announced yesterday was 'to find new ways of mobilising the private sector to meet needs which have traditionally been met only by the public sector'. The statement added: 'The key question is whether the private sector is genuinely assuming risk; there must be no creative accounting. The changes mean that: If the private sector is wholly responsible for a project which needs government approval and can recoup all its costs by charges at the point of use, comparison with a theoretical public-sector alternative will not be needed. Such a project will normally be put to competition. Under the current rules a comparison has generally been required if a project is one which the government might have undertaken itself. The government will actively encourage the private sector to take the lead in joint ventures with the public sector provided the private sector's costs can be recovered by charging users directly. There will need to be a sensible sharing of risks and rewards between the public and private sectors. Joint ventures will be let by competition to ensure the best terms. The government will specify its contribution in terms of money and risk. If it takes an equity stake, it will not be a controlling one. The government is willing to consider debt and grant finance for such projects. The public sector will have greater opportunity to use leases where they offer best value for money. The capital value of leased assets apart from property is at present usually set against spending allocations unless the lease meets only a short-term need. In future, the criterion will in all cases be based on risk, which is also the principle underlying the relevant accounting standard. Departments and nationalised industries will be able to enter into operating leases and count only the leasing payments against their provision, provided the great majority of the risk stays with the private sector. This change should give a new impetus in areas such as contract energy management. The measures which the chancellor has announced will add to the total level of national investment. The spending which is financed by government will come out of departmental spending allocations. The private-sector element will make additional resources available in the area concerned, and allow the publicly financed part to be used to the full.'</p>

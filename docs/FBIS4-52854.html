			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 14 KYODO -- The government is aiming to  enact a package of bills to revise 40 laws in order to relax  economically restrictive government regulations during the  current Diet session, government officials said Saturday [14  May].    The government will submit the package to the Diet after  approving it next Friday, the officials said. The current Diet  session ends on June 29.    The package is in line with economic stimulus measures  announced last April and September.    The government has vowed to come up with full-scale  deregulatory measures by the end of June as part of efforts to  spur domestic demand and hence the nation's appetite for imports.    If enacted, 134 items of regulations will be abolished, 16  items will be relaxed and 27 items will be rationalized, the  officials said.    Among the laws to be revised by the bills is one to abolish  obligations to report to the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) the establishment of an export and import  association.    The officials said the government hopes the enactment of the  bills will help revitalize activity in the private sector.</p>

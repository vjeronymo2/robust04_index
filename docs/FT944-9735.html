			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of Greece (4): Alliance a risky business - Greek joint ventures with eastern European shippers The world's largest tug, now working out of Piraeus, recently hoisted the Russian flag to mark the end of an 18-month dispute with Tsavliris, the Greek shipping group that specialises in salvage and towing. The quarrel over the Tsavliris Giant - now the Fotiykrylov - says much about the risks faced by Greek shipowners in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Tsavliris chartered the tug and its sister vessel, which had both belonged to the Russian navy, from a Maltese company. But Russian authorities later claimed the tugs were illegally registered in Malta and demanded them back. Now they are being operated by Tsavliris-Russ, a Cyprus-based joint venture between the Greek group and the Russian navy, managed by Tsvaliris. Several Greek shipowners have formed joint ventures with shipping concerns in Romania and the former Soviet Union, or are managing ships chartered from them on a bareboat basis. Shipyards in eastern Europe have more than 60 ships under construction, on order or with options pending for Greek owners. Ex-Soviet seamen are also in demand among Greek operators. 'Ex-Soviet crews had 12 years' training, so they're more skilled than most seamen. The disadvantage is that they don't have a lot of initiative,' says one analyst. Greek shipowners' interest in Romania sharpened in 1990 after the collapse of communism, as much of the country's large commercial fleet had been laid up under the Ceausescu regime. However, several Greek ventures in Romania have run into trouble. Forum Maritime's controversial attempt last year to acquire 51 per cent of Petromin, the state-owned Romanian tanker and bulk carrier company, came close to bringing down the Romanian government. The Dollars 335m deal, billed as the largest investment to date in eastern Europe, fell through following objections by the Romanian Development Agency, the country's investment watchdog and other state organisations, over financing arrangements. Minerva Maritime - a joint venture set up by Petromin and a Greek owner, John Alafouzos to manage and operate 10 vessels - came close to being dissolved this year amid claims that funds were mismanaged. Four Petromin officials involved in making over vessels to the joint venture were jailed on charges of illegally exporting Romanian assets. Greek owners involved in charter and management deals with eastern European shipping concerns complain that their partners lack market know-how. The eastern Europeans fear they may be outmanoeuvred by their Greek partners. Most joint venture agreements involve a cash investment by the Greek side to upgrade eastern European ships to market standard, to be recovered out of operating profits. Yet despite the prickly relationships, the joint ventures offer opportunities for making a quick return. They provide available tonnage which can be upgraded at a fraction of the cost of buying modern second-hand vessels and much faster than it would take to order and build a new ship. On the shipbuilding side, low labour costs at eastern European yards help make prices competitive. The Vardinoyannis group is building nine 45,000 DWT tankers at the Chernomorsky yard at Nikolayev in the Ukraine at a cost of Dollars 270m. Discussions are under way on extending the series to 24 vessels. The Laskarides group, which operates specialises in refrigated tonnage, is building 17 vessels at another yard in Nikolayev. There is no price tag for the ships, since specialised equipment is ordered from western suppliers and paid for by the shipowners. Eletson Corporation, which recently ordered a series of product carriers to be built at Newport News Shipbuilding in the US, is building three 68,000 DWT tankers on behalf of an associated company at a price of Dollars 34-36m each. East European yards have difficulty in financing equipment and material purchases, while they may also require expert assistance in building to high specifications. Greek owners have the flexibility to provide both where needed. Blue Flag Navigation has a 30-member team of experts based at Romanian yards where it is building 15 sophisticated vessels, inluding chemical, products and bulk carriers. Greek owners have also been able to take advantage of failed order at eastern European yards. Two months ago, Enterprises Shipping and Trading took over a collapsed deal at Poland's Gdansk yard from Latvian Shipping Company. Enterprises was able to pick up the contract for two high-specification 400,000 cubic foot reefers at a considerable discount, paying Dollars 23m instead of Dollars 28m for each ship. One of the biggest commitments to the eastern European market has been made by Sumo Trust, set up as the shipowning and management arm of the Manley Hopkins, the UK-based shipping services group. The company started by financing and upgrading seven Petromin ships at a cost of Dollars 15m. It is now building seven river and ocean-going products tankers in Bulgaria, to be chartered by Russia's Volga Tankers, and has a joint venture with Azov Shipping Company of the Ukraine.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Bar's monopoly ended: Solicitors in private practice win right to appear in higher courts Barristers' 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts was broken yesterday when solicitors in private practice won their battle for wider rights to present cases. The decision by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, and England's four most senior judges to approve the Law Society's application for wider advocacy rights means solicitors could be appearing in higher courts by next spring. At present they can only appear in magistrates' and county courts. The government legislated more than two years ago to give solicitors the right to appear in the higher courts, but the issue has been deadlocked by resistance from the Bar and judges. Mr Rodger Pannone, the Law Society's president, said it was delighted with the decision. 'Clients will no longer be forced to employ a separate lawyer for higher court advocacy,' he said. The society said it was disappointed that Lord Mackay and the judges had deferred their decision on wider advocacy rights for solicitors working in the Crown Prosecution Service, the government legal service, and in commerce, finance and industry. Although the society's application included employed solicitors, the judges felt unable to decide because of incomplete advice from the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee. The committee said it could not advise on whether employed lawyers should be given the right to appear in criminal trials until the 1990 Courts and Legal Services Act had been changed to restrict the amount of advocacy work done by Crown Prosecution Service and government lawyers. Lord Mackay has ruled out changes to the act and asked it to look again at the issue. Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, said she was pleased that the lord chancellor had not ruled out extending rights to Crown Prosecution Service lawyers. They would continue to push for extended rights, she said. The decision was welcomed by many City law firms, which have been gearing up for advocacy work in the High Court. Solicitors who have the necessary experience in advocacy, either as part-time judges or who have earlier practised as barristers, will be able to appear in the High Court almost immediately. But most will have to complete two Law Society training courses and it could be 1995 before they qualify to appear in the crown court, High Court, Appeal Court, or before the Lords.</p>

Assessing the situation in 1993, the Georgian leader mentioned  both the negative and positive results of the economic and  political development of the republic. Positive results include  the end of the civil war in Georgia and the joining of the CIS.  Shevardnadze described the joining of the new Commonwealth as  one of the most significant events in the life of the republic.  Speaking about negative results, he mentioned the tragedy in  Abkhazia, the temporary loss of control and jurisdiction over  some other cities and districts of Abkhazia, too hasty putting  in circulation of the Georgian coupon on the territory of the  republic and the deterioraton of the crime situation.    According to Shevardnadze, 1994 should become a year of the  improvement of the economic situation in Georgia and the CIS in  general, whose leaders understand full well that they can  resolve the acute economic and other problems only by joint  efforts. Shevardnadze is pinning much hope on the restoration of  economic relations with the former USSR republics and on the  establishment of new economic, political and other relations  with the CIS member states. He said in his new year interview  that 1994 should witness the end on the basis of justice of the  conflict in Abkhazia, which, in his opinion, is guaranteed by  the active work of international organisations, the CSCE, and  the positive role played by Russia and other countries, which  are friendly to Georgia, specifically, the U.S., Germany and so  on. He expressed confidence that hundreds of thousands of  refugees from Abkhazia, who are now living in other regions of  the republic, in Russia and other CIS member states, will be  able to return home.    He pointed out that 1994 would witness the adoption of a new  Georgian constitution. If the new constitution is adopted this  year, then parliamentary elections will probably be held in 1994  too. Naturally, he did not mention the date of the elections.</p>

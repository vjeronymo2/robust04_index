			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Admiral Eduard Baltin, Black Sea Fleet Commander,  thinks he succeeded in "maintaining the fleet as a combat unit,  an outpost on the southern CIS borders." He said so in an  exclusive interview with Interfax on the first anniversary of  his appointment.    In his words, the fleet was very much alive and proved its  worth in exercises.    Baltin, like all his men, wants the uncertainty about the  fleet's future to end and the two heads of state to arrive at  mutually acceptable decisions.    The admiral emphasized that he opposed involvement of the  fleet in politics and participation of servicemen in partisan  activities of any kind, pro-Ukrainian, pro-Russian, communist or  democratic. In his view, participation of armed men in political  games may lead to unpredictable consequences. Baltin believes  that the politicians must provide concrete aid rather than empty  promises if they want to show that they care for the fleet.    He said that the fleet faced problems of logistic, moral,  and  human relations natures. As Ukraine and Crimea are short of  fuel, energy, food and cash, the fleet is blamed for all the  troubles, he argued. He recalled that the Sevastopol  authorities demand that the fleet help them with fuel, money and  energy while the land tax alone that the fleet had to pay  amounted to nearly 13 Bn karbovantsy in 1993. The fleet  received from Russia 77 percent of the total amount of credits  and from Ukraine, as little as 23 percent.    Admiral Baltin said, "In our relations with the Ukrainian  Navy command we have to recognize the fact that they represent a  foreign navy and so our relations are business-like." He  admitted that "we are tied by numerous links" but emphasized  that "we cannot afford the upkeep of the units and ships of the  Ukrainian Navy."    On the other hand, Baltin said that he was "prepared to have  a closer cooperation with the Ukrainian Navy and its commander."</p>

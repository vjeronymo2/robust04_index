On behalf of their respective governments, Chinese  Ambassador  to Russia Wang Jinqing and Russian Vice-Foreign Minister B.N.  Pastukhov signed the agreement December 29 last year in Moscow.    After January 28, the agreement on visits by citizens  between  China and the former Soviet Union which was signed on July 15,  1988 in Moscow, will no longer be in force between China and  Russia.    The new agreement says that Chinese and Russian people who  hold diplomatic and service passports and their children under  age will be exempted from entry, exit and transit visas while  passing through each other's ports which are open to  international visitors or are designated by the two sides.</p>

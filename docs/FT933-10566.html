			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure on franc and krone THE French franc and the Danish krone came under strong selling pressure yesterday after their bands in the European exchange rate mechanism had been widened to 15 per cent against the D-Mark and Dutch guilder, writes James Blitz. The removal of their former ERM floors against the D-Mark encouraged dealers to push both currencies to levels at which they were undervalued on a trade weighted basis. Both the franc and krone recovered at the end of a European session in which trading was mostly thin. But the rally in their currencies was mainly a result of the decision by both countries' central banks to keep monetary policy tight. In France's case, the intervention rate was kept unchanged at 6.75 per cent, even though the franc's new floor of FFr3.8948 could easily permit another cut in rates. This meant that, although the franc fell as low as FFr3.55 to the D-Mark in the European morning, it later climbed back to a London close of FFr3.505. Denmark took a more aggressive stance, maintaining its one-month interest rates at 25 per cent. This allowed the Danish krone to come back to a London close of DKr4.0367 to the D-Mark after it had plunged as low as DKr4.1500. Belgium actively tried to maintain its currency within its former bands, intervening to support the Belgian franc at BFr21.50 to the D-Mark. The overwhelming feature of the market yesterday was the uncertainty of central banks over what action to take, now that the ERM has virtually collapsed. 'There is a policy confusion over whether to go down the competitive devaluation route, or whether to stick close to the D-Mark,' commented Mr Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. All European countries want economic growth to stimulate their economies. But, in France, the danger of competitive devaluation is that it could seriously embarrass the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, who was committed to the franc fort policy. However, Mr George Soros, head of the Soros fund in New York which takes active positions in currencies, told the Financial Times that France could cut interest rates tomorrow without any further pressure on the franc. For Belgium and Denmark, analysts see strong risks of disorderly devaluations that could impinge on their bond and equity markets - placing a burden on them to keep interest rates high. But, here again, Mr Soros felt that rates could be lowered without long term depreciation. Yesterday's appreciation of the D-Mark in Europe helped to push the dollar down 2 1/2 pfennigs to a close of DM1.7155. The dollar was also trading at a post-war low of Y104.05 in early US trading. Sterling ended 3 pfennigs off at DM2.5550 amid speculation of a base rate reduction in the UK. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.7080 and Y104.40.</p>

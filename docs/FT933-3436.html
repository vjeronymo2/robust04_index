			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: A social side to business (2) - Samuel Brittan's views on the legitimacy of the social elements of corporate responsibility, reported on September 2, generated a large number of letters. This is a selection Sir, Samuel Brittan seems to assume that corporate responsibility is about deciding how to divide up the cake, and concludes that the shareholders will win any tug-of-war with the community over how profits are divided. Socially responsible behaviour by business managers is not about managing the tug-of-war. It is about finding ways of managing the productive activities of the business so that a greater contribution can be made to the community without diminishing productivity or competitiveness. Being socially responsible requires creativity and entrepreneurial flair, not charity. Corporate responsibility is about business purpose. A management team wanting to create a 'responsible' corporation is unlikely to have 'maximising shareholder value' as its business purpose. Like Sainsbury's primary objective 'to discharge the responsibility as leaders in our trade' or Body Shop's desire to promote cosmetics that are not tested on animals, responsible corporations are likely to have responsible purposes. Brittan confuses objectives and constraints. He assumes that long-term profitability is an objective and accuses proponents of corporate responsibility of a 'systematic ambiguity'. He fails to recognise that all businesses, whatever purpose they choose, must create value for their active stakeholders - shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers. Long-term profitability is normally a central part of creating this value, but it is not the objective. The need to create value is a constraint not a purpose.

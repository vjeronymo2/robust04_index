			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Seeking high returns through high adventure: Sara Webb explains why financial explorers are attracted by emerging markets Mr Jim Rogers is not your average tourist. When he rode his BMW motorbike around the world with girlfriend Tabitha, he stopped off at nearly every stock exchange en route to see what he could buy. His holiday souvenirs included all seven stocks then listed on the Botswana stock exchange. Mr Rogers, formerly George Soros's business partner, is in one of the fastest growing financial industries: emerging markets. He invests in the debt and equities from far-flung regions. 'Emerging markets are to the 1990s what M&amp;A was to the 1980s,' says one expert in the field. Some - such as Thailand, South Korea and Mexico - have developed so fast they have more-or-less graduated to developed status. Others, such as the tiny stock exchanges of Morocco and Botswana, are of interest to the more adventurous explorers of the investment world. The high returns available from some of the emerging debt and equity markets are proving a strong lure for institutional and retail funds. Investors are pouring money into emerging market funds and new issues, hoping to make money in the fast-growing economies of Asia and Latin America. US closed-end mutual funds investing in emerging markets ranging from Brazil to Taiwan have raised a gross total of Dollars 3.81bn through new fund launches and rights offerings so far this year - up from Dollars 1.24bn in 1992, according to Lipper Analytical Services. As further testimony to this surge in interest, investment banks have stepped up their recruitment campaigns. Only recently, Morgen Grenfell picked up almost the entire team of emerging market equities staff - sales, trading and research - from James Capel, boosting their headcount from 100 to 120 and complementing their existing clout in the emerging market debt business. US firms such as Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley employ a couple of hundred people in the emerging markets area worldwide, covering both equities and debt. 'Firms like JP Morgan, Salomon Brothers and Morgan Grenfell dominate the emerging markets debt business,' says one independent adviser, who adds that the revenue generated from profitable debt dealing has in these cases allowed expansion into the emerging market equity business, a smaller and initially far less profitable area. The interest in debt trading stems partly from the decision by countries such as Nigeria, Morocco, Argentina and the Philippines to either reschedule their debt or repackage it in the form of bonds. In addition, retail and institutional investors can buy debt in eurobond form from a variety of emerging markets including Mexico, Hungary and the Philippines. UK houses such as Baring Securities and Flemings have built up strong reputations over several years, especially on the Asian equities side. However, traditionally the US houses have had a competitive advantage in the Latin American markets on their doorstep. Invariably, expansion means head-hunting the nearest individuals or teams. 'There's a terrific shortage: people are lazy so they just look around and see if they can steal talent from someone else,' says Mr Miles Morland, an emerging markets consultant to several US fund managers, who chucked in City life in 1989 to walk across France. 'Usually, what happens is that firms look at the existing pool of people and redeploy them, so you see good people being sucked out of western Europe to look at eastern Europe, or people in Hong Kong and Japan concentrating on other parts of Asia. 'At the moment there's almost no one looking at Africa - I've heard of five different Africa funds being proposed but no one can find anyone to manage them.' Mr Morland believes City firms are missing a great opportunity to hire well educated local staff in some of the emerging countries they cover: not only do they have the right contacts but they are also 'a lot cheaper' than most new recruits in the City. The people who do well in emerging markets 'tend to be a bit more creative and imaginative than your routine spread-sheet jockeys,' says one insider. 'They are the kind of people who go on holiday to Siberia and check out the local brewery for investment potential while they are there,' says another specialist. Mr Rogers, interviewed by phone while working out on his exercise bike in New York, claims 'a motorbike is the best way to see a country'. But his reception wasn't always the kind associated with the usual investors roadshow. 'The people at the stock exchange were always a little surprised . . . In Ecuador they thought I was some kind of drug smuggler.' It is easy to see the appeal of these emerging market investments. US interest rates are at their lowest level for 18 years; returns in the US Treasury bond and stock market look lacklustre; and growth in much of Europe has slowed down. According to JP Morgan Securities, the Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) rose 26.57 per cent in the nine months to September 30, outperforming both US stocks and bonds. Mr Stephen Dizard, a managing director at Salomon Brothers, points to the increasing internationalisation of US investors, which has resulted in greater interest in overseas investments - including emerging markets. The aficionados - like Mr Rogers and Mr Morland - get their thrills from being in a market where no foreigner has been before. 'Sri Lanka? That's a bit overdeveloped for my taste,' laughs Mr Morland. Mr Rogers, meanwhile, says he's putting his money into Ghana and Ecuador.

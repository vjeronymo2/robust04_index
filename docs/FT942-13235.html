			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World markets hit Salomon results Salomon, the US securities house, yesterday reported a modest first quarter profit of Dollars 66m (Pounds 44m) in the wake of a big drop in customer-related revenues, which were hit hard by sharp declines in US and international bond prices and increased volatility in world currency markets. In the same quarter a year ago, Salomon made a loss of Dollars 102m, which included a Dollars 37m after-tax charge to cover accounting changes. The latest results, described as 'disappointing' by chairman Mr Robert Denham, were poorly received by investors. The shares fell Dollars  3/4 to close at Dollars 48 7/8 in New York. Although Salomon - whose main subsidiary is its investment banking and securities brokerage unit Salomon Brothers - suffered from the same problems that have plagued other Wall Street firms and banks, the negative impact of declining world bond prices and unpredictable currency markets showed in the group's customer-related business - where losses were Dollars 173m - rather than its proprietary trading business. The losses were incurred primarily because during the big sell-off in US and international bond markets in February, Salomon was forced as a market-maker to buy large amounts of US and European government bonds from customers in a rapidly declining market. As the value of those holdings dropped, the group's customer-related operations ran up large losses. Salomon also incurred losses on its 'positioning activities', where the trading desks which handle customer orders also make short-term bets on securities prices and market volatility. In contrast, proprietary trading income was Dollars 212m, against a Dollars 319m loss a year earlier. This business involves Salomon taking long-term bets on securities prices and volatility and so earnings were less affected by the turmoil in markets in the quarter.</p>

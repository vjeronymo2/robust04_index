			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview of Academician Nikolay Trapeznikov by Tatyana </F> Sadkovskaya, under the title: RThere Are Practically No Healthy  People in Russia]    [Text] The occasion for the discussion with the  Academician, Director of the Oncological Center, and student  (since school days) of the patriarch of domestic oncology,  Nikolay Blokhin, was in no way a scientific sensation. But the  fact is not routine, even in relation to the present times: the  Oncological Center is closing for one and a half months, from  July 15 through September 1. Is there is no money to support the  work of this enormous, unique complex, to treat patients? Such  information has already appeared briefly in the press.    The Center is actually a bit low on resources. But about  this  - a bit further on. The Academician explained this uncommon fact  by the long-developing necessity for the repair of some of the  buildings of the complex, which opened as long ago as 1980.  Patients whose treatment cannot be interrupted will continue to  receive it; the fate of the others has also been looked after.  In a word, the Academician expressed confidence that there will  not be patients who have suffered as the result of this action.  It is difficult to check this assertion; therefore, let us take  the eminent Academician at his word.    And although there has been no sensation, you will  understand  that it made sense to continue the conversation...    It is said that AIDS is the plague of the twentieth century.  In Russia 500 people have acquired this plague. But in 1990, 700  thousand people in the USSR fell ill with cancer. We now have  500 thousand new cancer patients annually in Russia alone. Five  hundred and 500 thousand. But the majority, to please various  currents of opinion, are more concerned with the problem of AIDS.    Today 42-43 per cent of our patients recover. This is the  per  cent of recovery of the colored population of the US. It is  higher among the white population - half of the oncological  patients. It is clear why: the conditions exist for early  diagnosis, there is a higher level of medical assistance  rendered. So that deliverance from the terrible disease is not  only a scientific, medical problem, but a social problem as well.    How does it occur, and what are the causes...    According to forecasts, at the beginning of the next century  every third person will become ill with cancer in the course of  his life. Our current social characteristics will have their  effect in 10-15 years. It is known that incorrect nutrition is  the cause in 35 per cent of cases of the occurrence of malignant  tumors, and smoking in 30 per cent. Fifteen after the second  world war, the number of cases of cancer of the stomach  increased sharply - the deprivations of the war years were  taking their toll. Now these tumors, as in other countries, are  encountered infrequently. Among tumors, lung cancer leads among  men, breast cancer among women. But in 15 years a sharp increase  in stomach cancer cases awaits us: todayUs deprivations of the  population will take their toll. When I lecture in the labor  collectives, it is awkward for me to speak of rational nutrition  - people in general are going half-starved.    I especially want to talk about smoking. The widespread  publicity about the nation's ill health elicits, to put it  mildly, surprise. A number of bans and restrictions of local,  including Moscow, authorities is not changing the situation  fundamentally. It is necessary, as has occurred in the US and  Canada, and for which the French public is campaigning, to ban  legally the advertising of tobacco products. Note: our  politicians give interviews, as a rule, with a cigarette in  their teeth (in his time a chain smoker, as are, incidentally,  many surgeons, Nikolay Nikolaevich gave this habit up twenty  years ago. - T. S.). Or, for example, athletic competitions are  going on, and the entire stadium is plastered with cigarette  ads. How can this be reconciled? Moreover, smoking fosters the  occurrence not only of cancer of the lung, but of the throat,  the urinary bladder, the kidney... Americans are a nation more  interested in and knowledgeable about questions of health;  therefore, in the US in the last 2 years 3 million people have  quit smoking...    Yes, 30 per cent is an impressive fact. Could you  comment on another percentage that has been mentioned: 42-43 per  cent of people with a diagnosis, which until now has sounded  like a simple death sentence, do recover... This percentage  evidently includes cases caught at an early stage.    The WHO has proclaimed: early diagnosis saves the patient's  life. This is correct. But now, thanks to advances in  chemotherapy we cure even some neglected forms of cancer. We  cure cancer of the testis in 85-90 per cent of cases, including  those with lung metastases. We even eliminate some tumors of the  uterus without operative intervention. At our center 100 sick  young children are observed, born of women who have experienced  uterine cancer. Osteogenic sarcoma is conquerable in 70-75 per  cent. Medicine will very shortly be in a position to cure some  malignant tumors completely. Even now 80-85 per cent of children  with cancer can be rid of the disease. All we need is a full  arsenal of preparations, radiation therapy, and highly qualified  specialists.S    I believe that you have only the latter at your  disposal.    We have the equipment for radiation therapy: 60 per cent of  patients receive it - in pure form and in combination. Linear  accelerators are already in use throughout the world. Here they  can be counted on oneUs fingers: the Center, oncological clinics  in Volgograd and Arkhangelsk. There are another ten RelephantsS,  domestic counterparts of American accelerators, with much poorer  capacities. Therefore, gamma therapy is mainly used in the  outlying regions. But that is a past era.    But the greatest problem is antitumor preparations. We are  always short of them. One foreign firm has opened a currency  pharmacy at the center. Some kind of safety valve, at least.    I passed by it. The prices are scary: there are  ampoules for 40 dollars each. How much does the treatment of one  patient cost? I hope, anyway, it's not up to him personally:  shouldn't oncological patients be helped gratis?    We charge patients from the CIS. We do not take money from  Russians. How much does it cost? One simple example: the modern  treatment of a patient with osteogenic sarcoma with preservation  of the extremity (previously an amputation was carried out). The  cost of an endoprosthesis is 5 thousand dollars. Plus  chemotherapy - this is another 25 million rubles. If an  enterprise can pay for the treatment, we accept it. We pay for  others out of the budget, our commercial activity. But here is a  paradox which cannot be explained. We treat from budgetary  funds. And there is, for example, the state firm, TFarmatsiyaU.  It is ready to send us currency preparations, but it requires 20  per cent of the ruble cover of the cost of these pharmaceuticals  from the Center. This is very much like shuffling the same money  around different pockets of the same pair of pants.    Given such a patient cost, how much money does the  state allocate to the Oncological Center?    It's easier for me to answer what the budget of our partner,  the American National Cancer Institute, is. One billion 200  million dollars. While so far this year we are living without a  budget at all. The Russian Academy of Medical Sciences promises:  we will give so much for treatment, so much for food, for  salaries. And not a word about scientific research, although we  are a scientific institution first and foremost. True, I have  received pleasant news from the Ministry of Health: the Center  is being allocated 2 billion 125 million for the development of  expensive treatment methods such as bone marrow transplantation,  plastic surgery in oncology...    Our last conversation compelled the optimistic  percentages of recoveries to fade. Therefore, let us return to  the stage of neoplastic diseases when the shortage of funds will  not be so tragic for the outcome of the illness, that is, the  problem of early diagnosis.    The Center has now concluded an agreement with enterprises  and organizations to carry out surveys in collectives. We are  creating teams of various specialists and equipping them with  the most up-to-date equipment. Literally the other day twenty of  our colleagues returned from Novorossiysk. A terrible picture is  sketched on the basis of the results of these trips. I have in  mind not only our patients, but the state of health overall. And  a large number of cases of cancer, about which people were  completely in the dark, have been identified as a result of each  trip.    Landings of specialists are not comparable, of course,  with a stagnant must-do situation, with a professional  examination which cannot be called anything other than a bluff.  Certainly, those who are completely in the dark are on the  conscience of its initiators... But one center like yours is not  enough for all of Russia. And not every enterprise in todayUs  conditions can allow itself, obviously, a not inexpensive  contract with the Center.    In our time we have been leaders in oncological science.  But,  now... There are national anti-cancer programs in many developed  countries. They are reviewed by parliaments, and obtain the  necessary financing. The President of the US has a council on  oncology; it was headed up until his death by Hammer, who is  well known in our country. Congress hears the Director of the  National Cancer Institute annually, and only then approves the  budget.    Russia also needs such a government approach to the problem,  which is longer called an exclusively medical problem (remember:  every third person contracts cancer in his lifetime), and our  own national program, directed toward a reduction of mortality  from tumors.    Our Center is engaged in its development. Perhaps the fate  of  draft law on oncology we developed, which has been lost in the  long drawers of our parliament, will not befall this document.  Primary prevention, early diagnosis (screening programs, for  example, to identify cancer of the uterine cervix and breast  here have already been worked out here to the level of  demonstration projects), fundamental research, the development  of treatment methods - these are the main necessary constituents  of such a national program. I am naming them in order of  priority.    Well, in the practice of domestic oncology today the  priorities have been precisely arrayed more or less the wrong  way around.</p>

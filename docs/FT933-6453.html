			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Deadly delays as winter approaches: Is this the last chance for Bosnia's warring factions to reach an agreement As the Bosnian parliament meets in Sarajevo's battle-scarred Holiday Inn hotel today to debate the latest peace plan drawn up in Geneva, it does so to the sound of an international ultimatum. If western negotiators are to be believed, today's meeting represents the last chance for the Bosnian government to agree a settlement - either it must accept the plan to divide Bosnia into three ethnic mini-states, before returning to the negotiating table in Geneva on Monday or, inevitably, it must face further bloodshed. Such an ultimatum is unlikely to have much effect, however. Although the Serbs and Croats seem likely to accept the deal when their own parliaments meet today, the Bosnia government seems set to demand revisions for as long as it believes it can force a better deal either by stepping up the threat of western military intervention or by continuing the onslaught in central Bosnia. An attempt by the country's weak, multi-ethnic government to stall would be understandable. Both alternatives on offer - agreement or further fighting - are undesirable. If the Moslem-dominated leadership says 'yes' to the plan, they will be accepting a 'solution' that not only legitimises the dismemberment of Bosnia and with it their military defeat, but which also seems unworkable. The new map of Bosnia would give the Serbs a geographically contiguous republic covering 54 per cent of Bosnia, and borders with Serbia and Croatia; the Croats would have 17 per cent of the territory, divided into two parts, one of which touches Croatia; the Moslems, who formed 43 per cent of the population before the outbreak of war, would be scattered between four disjointed chunks of land, wedged between two hostile states. 'Bosnia' would be little more than a name on a map. Vital questions would remain: where would ethnically mixed Bosnians live; who would govern the capital Sarajevo and the southern town of Mostar after the proposed two years of United Nations and European Community administration; how could the Moslems be guaranteed access to economic supply lines via the Adriatic Sea and River Sava in the north? A senior American official in Washington commented: 'That anyone could even think this map would be workable shows how desperate the situation is. This is really the end of the Moslems.' And yet, as the international mediators, Lord Owen for the EC, and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the UN, have repeatedly stressed, if the Moslems reject the plan today, they face intensified aggression. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has warned that a rejection by the Moslems would trigger an all-out assault by the Serb armed forces, who now control 70 per cent of Bosnia in an arc of territory in the north and east - almost all their military aims. The Bosnian Croats, smarting from a series of recent Moslem victories in central Bosnia, seem even more ready to continue the fight. Some Moslem commanders believe that they could sustain further Croat assaults, and want to expand the land they have wrested back in the past four months. But if the two options facing the Moslems seem to provide enough motivation for them to stall, either potential outcome of today's meeting threatens fresh diplomatic embarrassment for the west. The US and its European allies are still far from ready to police a partition. They remain even more divided about what course to pursue if the Moslems reject the agreement. Earlier this week, Lord Owen admitted that without Nato backing, and a peacekeeping force larger than any seen in the United Nation's history, the agreement stood little chance of being signed, let alone implemented. How many peacekeeping troops would be needed is unclear. Mr Stoltenberg has suggested 40,000, in addition to the 10,000 on the ground in Bosnia. Most military experts believe this is an optimistic assessment. However, given the UN's current financial crisis, and indecision at Nato's highest levels, finding even 40,000 troops would require considerable diplomatic effort. UN secretary-general Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali yesterday indicated that it was unlikely that the UN could provide such a force. The British and French governments insist that the political will in Europe to deploy peacekeeping troops is still there. But, symptomatic of the footdragging, they say that without a settlement, they cannot give assurances about how many troops might be deployed, or when. In practice, though, the main stumbling block to deployment is a lack of firm commitment from the US. America's unwillingnes to deploy ground troops  -while pushing for air strikes that might endanger the European ground troops already deployed - has rankled European leaders and fuelled transatlantic tensions. Most European allies insist that the bulk of a peacekeeping force must come, at least initially, from the US. But though US administration officials say their earlier commitment to assist in implementing a peace agreement stands, they have avoided any specific discussion of the size or type of involvement. But if a peace agreement poses a policing quandary for the west, the possibility that the Moslems will reject the plan poses almost insupperable uncertainties. After a year of stop-start negotiations, many western diplomats view the prospect of more peace talks in Geneva with dismay. One British diplomatic official said this week: 'We cannot start the negotiations from scratch again. If Lord Owen asked for more negotiations then we would support him, but we can't have the negotiations all over again.' One factor influencing diplomats may be the suspicion that the two mediators are increasingly acting out on a limb - a view that grew this week after reports that they had not consulted European governments before suggesting that Mostar should be run by the EC. But if the latest peace plan crumbles, the alternatives for the western allies - that they should either withdraw their humanitarian efforts from Bosnia completely or intervene with a large-scale military force to make the Serbs relinquish land - remain, European diplomats say, almost unthinkable. The US has, in the past, embraced the idea of tougher action against the Serbs. However, calls for air strikes earlier this year were greeted with deep reluctance in Europe. So far, there is no sign that the British and French governments have changed their opposition. A few lone voices can still be heard in Washington, demanding a lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnians. But in spite of the deep moral distaste felt throughout Europe at the apparent abandonment of the Bosnian Moslems, the European allies have shown no sign of accepting either a lifting of the embargo, or a full-scale military intervention. Though German officials - and the press - continue to grumble with frustration at British reservations about becoming embroiled in the conflict, there is no sign that they are prepared to do more than seek fresh humanitarian initiatives, and to bring their diplomatic influence to bear on a recalcitant Croatia. Some American officials have also turned their attention back to Croatia, suggesting that if the Croats continue their blockade of Mostar they could face economic sanctions. In the UK, the government has mainly confined itself to trumpeting the extent of its aid commitment to Bosnia. Although it has set up a high-level military command to control its operations in the region, military officials admit that its main task so far has been drawing up plans for emergency withdrawal of troops if the three warring factions turn their guns on the allies. But as western dithering continues, winter is approaching. With aid agencies warning that the suffering this winter could be worse than anything so far in the 17-month conflict, the fear remains that if President Alija Izetbegovic, the Moslem leader, stalls, and fighting grows more ruthless, by next spring there may not be a Holiday Inn left standing in Sarajevo - or even a Bosnian leadership left to meet in it.

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Euro Disney price cut EURODISNEYLAND, the troubled theme park, plans to cut the prices at some of its hotels to try to drum up business during the slack winter season, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. A family of four will from early January be able to stay in a room at the Santa Fe, the cheapest of the six hotels at the park, for FFr300 (Pounds 34.80) a night, rather than FFr375. EuroDisneyland has also made slight cuts in low-season prices at its middle-range hotels. Room rates at the New York and the Disneyland, the two most expensive hotels, have remained unchanged at FFr1,000 and FFr1,600 respectively. The price cuts are the latest attempt by EuroDisneyland to improve its performance. Euro Disney, the park's operating company, which hoped to be profitable from its first year, is next month expected to announce heavy losses for the year to September 30. Analysts are braced for a net deficit of FFr1.8bn for 1992/93. The group had previously announced it was reducing the low-season entrance price at the park from FFr250 (at high season) to FFr175 for an adult and from FFr175 to FFr125 for children.</p>

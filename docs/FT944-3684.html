			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Warburg sets out to tempt investors SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley are likely to seek ways of paying UK shareholders sterling dividends on shares in the merged investment bank they want to create, although it will probably be a US company. The move is being considered by Warburg's to convince shareholders of the plan's benefits, even though they will not be offered the premium for shares they would receive in a takeover. Mercury Asset Management, the fund management company which is 75 per cent owned by Warburg, is to announce today that it has appointed the merchant bank Lazard Brothers to advise it on the merger offer. Warburg's only outside adviser is its corporate broker Cazenove &amp; Co, although it recently employed the US bank JP Morgan to advise it about obtaining a credit rating from the agency Standard &amp; Poor's. One of the most contentious issues of the merger, the terms of which are expected to be announced shortly, is whether Morgan Stanley and Warburg will make a preferential offer to buy out MAM's minority shareholders. Without a preferential offer, MAM minority shareholders could reject the bid on the grounds that the merged banks are not paying full value for a company that contributes Pounds 1bn of Warburg's market capitalisation. However, a preferential offer could be resisted by Morgan Stanley directors. It could also undermine the deal's logic because minority shareholders would receive a higher price for MAM shares than Warburg. Warburg directors are thought to be trying to bring forward an announcement originally planned for next week giving preliminary terms of the merger, as well as details of how operations would be combined. There was considerable volatility in Warburg's share price on Friday following the announcement on Thursday because of speculation about the motives for the merger and the possibility of a counter-bid. The merged investment bank will probably be a US company, but listed in New York and London. However, directors believe UK institutions may prefer to receive dividends in sterling. See Lex</p>

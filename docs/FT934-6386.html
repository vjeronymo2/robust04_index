			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Book Review: Nice brain, shame about the feathers The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature By Matt Ridley Viking Pounds 17.99, 404 pages Sex is not only one of the wonders of life but also one of the two great mysteries of evolutionary biology. The other is human intelligence. This remarkable book draws together many of the latest strands of scientific thinking, to create a coherent explanation both for sexual reproduction and for the extraordinary explosion in human brainpower over the past million years. The first big question is why animals have been put to the trouble of creating separate males and females to reproduce sexually, when asexual reproduction requires much less time and effort. The answer produced 60 years ago - that sex helps a species adapt to changing circumstances by sharing out genetic innovations - is unacceptable to the 'selfish gene' school that dominates biology today. Contemporary biologists believe the individual and its genes always come first; evolution never operates directly for the benefit of the species. Asexual individuals producing self-fertilised eggs should be able to swamp sexual rivals, who can reproduce only at half their rate, before the long-term advantages of sex make themselves felt. The surprising answer, according to Ridley, is that sexual reproduction evolved to beat disease. The mixing of genes through sex gives the offspring a much better chance of withstanding the host of viruses, bacteria and other parasites that plagued their parents. Asexual rivals, on the other hand, are stuck with essentially the same disease-fighting genes as the previous generation. Ridley describes new evidence to show that sex is worthwhile because it gives your children an immediate advantage in the fight against disease. Some comes from the molecular biology of germs and genes, some from computer modelling and some from experiments and observations of real animals. The Mexican minnow, for example, can reproduce with or without sex. If there is fungal disease in the pond, the sexual strains dominate; if not, they lose out to their asexual rivals. The Red Queen goes on to show how, once separate males and females existed, genetic competition led to the growth of sexual adornments whose principal purpose is to attract the best possible mate. One example is the peacock's tail. Another is the human mind. Ridley picks up the recent work of biologists such as Geoffrey Miller of the University of Sussex in suggesting that the best explanation for human intelligence is as a sexual adornment. They reject the traditional view that brainpower started increasing rapidly among our ancestors because intelligence was so useful for making tools, using fire, hunting animals and gathering plants. Those challenges are essentially predictable, requiring some intellect but not an ever increasing amount - and they would have applied equally to other apes living on the African savannah. The human brain, according to Miller, is 'largely a courtship device to attract and retain sexual mates: its specific evolutionary function is to stimulate and entertain other people, and to assess the stimulation attempts of others'. Brain size would originally have started to increase through chance mutations in the genes controlling sexual selection. These would have spread rapidly through the pre-human population, in what Ridley calls an 'arms race between the sexes'. This is the Red Queen effect, named after the character whom Alice meets in Through the Looking Glass. However fast she runs, the world keeps pace with her and she never gets anywhere. However intelligent we are, more intelligence is always better for understanding, manipulating and seducing other people with similar brain size. As Ridley admits, the sexual evolution of the human mind is much the most speculative theory discussed in his book. But it is as plausible as any alternative explanation for human intelligence, and it accords with examples of the Red Queen in action elsewhere in the animal kingdom, which have been subjected to various experimental tests. Many mammals and birds have developed elaborate colours, ornaments, displays and songs, to persuade members of the opposite sex to mate with them. These special attractions do not necessarily help individuals survive in the natural environment - indeed they may hinder survival by wasting precious energy or attracting the attention of predators - but no one dare opt out of this race between the sexes. The sexual pressure is greatest in polygamous species such as the peacock. If all peahens go for males with the showiest tails, then a less discriminating female who picks a relatively plain mate is likely to have plain-looking sons. They will fail to attract other peahens and so her genes will die out. Ridley, a British science journalist and former zoology researcher, gives only sparing personal information about his biologist heroes. Never mind - the ideas in The Red Queen are so interesting that the excessive personal detail found in American popular science writing would have been an irritating distraction. Illustrations, however, are a serious omission. Like many other science books, The Red Queen suffers because the author and publisher have made no effort to produce the graphics which could have illuminated the theories. For example, computer models showing sexual and asexual animals competing under different conditions would have been worth a thousand even of Ridley's lucid words. In their absence, there are a few pleasantly genteel engravings that might have graced a Victorian volume. Indeed, for a book about human sexuality, it is curiously chaste in every way. The Red Queen may link sex and intelligence on an intellectual plane but in practice it leaves both as mysterious as ever.</p>

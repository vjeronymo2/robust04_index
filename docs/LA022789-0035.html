			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'THREE WAYS HOME' PACKS MORAL PUNCH  </P> <P> Somehow the idea of a play about a computer animator who inadvertently joins a  volunteer program to help abusive welfare mothers, befriending and assisting  one of them, sounds unprepossessing, not to say careless. Inadvertently? So, as  one person commented aloud in the lobby of the Los Angeles Theatre Center where  just such a play -- Casey Kurtti's "Three Ways Home" -- opened over the  weekend: What a surprise.  </P> <P> Kurtti's play is no soft little exercise in white middle class liberal  compassion. This is one tough-talking slab of writing whose jangled emotional  keyboard is perfectly tuned. It makes an unsparing, frequently comic kind of  music that lifts a potentially lachrymose, bleeding-heart situation out of the  humdrum and wouldn't be caught dead imitating, condescending or patronizing  anything or anyone.  </P> <P> Properly speaking, this is not the story of a reluctant friendship between  Sharon (Deirdre O'Connell), the childless white volunteer, and Dawn (Vonetta  McGee), the black welfare mother of four with a sometime live-in, sometime  violent boyfriend. It is the story of their enthusiastic aggressions:  determined collisions, campaign strategies and open warfare that end up in  family court where the volunteer, to her surprise, finds herself joining the  enemy.  </P> <P> That scene is what you call pivotal, marking a predictable turning point in the  embattled relationship. But in Kurtti's clever writing and the razor-sharp  production this play receives at the hands of O'Connell, McGee and the  acrobatic Glenn Plummer (who plays Dawn's 16-year-old son, Frankie, a kid  strung out between his X-Men comic book power dreams and his powerlessness as a  hustler trying to deal with the real world), the moment is triumphant.  </P> <P> Kurtti's play, whose major sin is going on a bit too long, brooks no  sentimentality. It suggests that the roughest and most improbable encounters  can bear improbable fruit if a willful, stubborn intelligence prevails on both  sides. But that's all the concessions it makes. The troubled Frankie is the  linchpin of the women's relationship, and director Chris Silva has smartly made  the character more emblematic than real -- a ubiquitous, furtive presence who  haunts the play as he must haunt his mother's waking moments and our collective  conscience, while at the same time remaining one of Peter Pan's classically  Lost Boys.  </P> <P> Quite a trick. But then Silva's staging altogether is quite a trick. The  production is draped against a series of dark fire-escapes (designed by Donald  Eastman and lit by Anne Militello, both of whom designed the same show for  Silva in New York last summer) that serve as a giant Jungle Jim for the  dream-obsessed Frankie. Plummer is a wiz at filling Frankie's shoes,  streetwise, aching, curiously innocent and bouncing around the stage with the  resilience of a rubber ball.  </P> <P> But this is not to take anything away from the women who, between them, carry  the play. Dawn, with the giant chip on her shoulder, is a predictable customer,  outwardly stubborn and tough, but devoted to and protective of her kids.  Kurtti, however, ups the ante by giving her colorful and sometimes unexpected  responses -- which the attractive, forceful McGee carries off with style and  presence.  </P> <P> More intriguing is the paradoxical character of Sharon, a woman motivated  enough to maintain a career, yet who allows herself to be sucked into this  roller-coaster volunteerism largely in spite of herself. Much of what makes the  play uncommon is Sharon's reluctant embrace of her new role. And O'Connell  plays her with such an edge of self-mockery, her own amusement at her  involuntary new role, that it undercuts any potential pretentiousness that this  perilous theme invites. It's another benchmark for this amazing actress ("Etta  Jenks," "Stars in the Morning Sky").  </P> <P> There is a fourth and important character in this play who never appears on  stage. It is the disembodied presence of Janet, the caseworker who ropes Sharon  into volunteering and Dawn into accepting the volunteer. Through this  programmed quasi-mythical creature, Kurtti strikes some of her more serious  satirical blows, undercutting the standard psychobabble and bankrupt phrases  designed to fix unbearable lives with Happy Face Band-Aids.  </P> <P> That subtext alone would be worth the price of admission. But there is a lot  more going on in "Three Ways Home" than meets the ear. And if Kurtti would only  take a hard look at the play's second half and slash a good 10 minutes, few  experiences would touch this one for unmoralistic lessons in deep morality.  </P> <P>  At 514 S. Spring St., Tuesdays through Sundays, 8 p.m. with Saturday and  Sunday matinees at 2, until April 30. Tickets: $22-$25; (213) 627-5599.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Accountancy Column: Time to ask who should audit the government's auditors - The case for independent scrutiny of the UK's two public watchdogs A DECADE after the creation of the Audit Commission and the National Audit Office, the UK's two public audit watchdogs have clearly proved their worth. But the time has come to question who audits the auditors themselves. The National Audit Office and the Audit Commission audit the majority of public bodies, with a remit to report on value for money and the figures in the accounts. They are sometimes the taxpayer's only 'foot in the door' of non-elected bodies such as the regional health authorities. Their contribution to improving public sector management is widely acknowledged, while the savings they identify more than cover their costs. The Audit Commission was established in 1983 and is responsible for co-ordinating the audits of and promoting value for money in local authorities. In 1990 its duties were extended to include the National Health Service, bringing the total level of expenditure under its scrutiny to around Pounds 90bn. Some 70 per cent of its audits are undertaken by the commission's own staff and the remainder by selected private sector accounting firms it appoints. The National Audit Office was established in 1984. It audits the accounts of central government departments and many other public agencies. It also has the power to carry out value for money audits of these and other public bodies, such as universities. The total amount under scrutiny is Pounds 450bn. The Audit Commission has been instrumental in causing change in the way local government and latterly the NHS use their resources. It uses a comparative approach to identify best practice which forms the basis of its recommendations to all authorities. A recent report showed that Pounds 15m could be saved if hospitals mended leaking pipes and used water more efficiently. Another on public libraries showed the cost of issuing a book is Pounds 6 at the most inefficient libraries. The National Audit Office also has an impressive record in raising issues ranging from how the Ministry of Defence could save Pounds 30m by better utilisation of its housing stock, through to questioning the effectiveness of cervical and breast screening. A timely report issued just after the Windsor Castle fire revealed that inadequate fire safety standards in government buildings had already resulted in losses of Pounds 8m and has caused the Houses of Parliament to be refused a fire certificate since 1979. Most of the National Audit Office reports are presented to parliament through the Public Accounts Committee and are used to call to account the senior civil servants responsible. Occasional television glimpses of these officials squirming under interrogation can give a curious satisfaction and sense of retribution. Real sadists can read the full transcripts published a few months later. But who audits the auditor? Are our auditors performing their role effectively? Amid the hundreds of value for money reports published over the last 10 years, covering thousands of public sector activities, not one is an independent review of the performance of the public sector auditors. While they have been expanding the scope and improving the standards of public audit practice, the auditors themselves are still audited to only a rudimentary, traditional level. The National Audit Office is auditor to the Audit Commission and has the right to undertake a value for money audit, but has never done so. The two bodies need to liaise closely in some areas of their work. This appears a rather incestuous relationship. A close scrutiny of the Audit Commission by the National Audit Office would be likely to cause some embarrassment on both sides. The National Audit Office's own affairs are subject to more stringent scrutiny. Its annual budget must be approved on behalf of parliament by the Public Accounts Commission - a committee of MPs. The Public Accounts Committee also questions the head of the National Audit Office about planned expenditure and activities. Minutes of these discussions are published but some of the more sensitive issues, such as proposed pay levels and problems with office relocation, are censored. A private firm of accountants - currently Clark Whitehill - audits the National Audit Office and has undertaken some value for money reviews on topics such as recruitment, training and accommodation. The results are passed on to the Public Accounts Commission. But they have never been made available to the public. An open and independent appraisal might allay the concerns of critics over a range of important issues. Is the mix of staff appropriate? Auditors, mainly with a background in professional accounting, are examining issues ranging from medical procedures to road building. The US government auditors, by contrast, are drawn from a wide range of professions. Is productivity sufficiently high? The number of Audit Commission reports on value for money in local government fell from 19 to 12 between 1990 and 1991. In 1991 it managed to deliver just 49 per cent of audit opinions on local authority financial statements within two months of publication deadlines, while its fee rates rose by 6.7 per cent - compared with inflation of 4.1 per cent. In the same year, the National Audit Office spent only 50 per cent of its budget on direct work on investigations. The rest went on overheads. Should more audit and value for money projects be contracted out? While the rest of the public sector has been exposed to competition, the National Audit Office spends just 5 per cent of its expenditure on contracted services. The Audit Commission has always placed 30 per cent of audits with private sector firms. This proportion has been static since 1983. Is more attention paid to efficiency than effectiveness? Both sets of auditors are constrained in the extent to which they can question policy. This means that some of the really interesting questions are never posed. Is audit coverage sufficiently integrated in programmes run through different agencies? For example, how well do the auditors work together to assess the impact of policies such as the development of a national curriculum imposed by central government but implemented by local government and grant-maintained schools? The two audit bodies are, of course, experts in giving advice on the use of resources, and they apply much of this knowledge to their own organisations. The National Audit Office has a comprehensive resource management system that feeds into a five-year corporate plan. This is published annually and discussed by the Public Accounts Committee. The Audit Commission has given its own - mainly glowing - assessment of the impact of each of its publications since 1983 in 'How effective is the Audit Commission?' It has recently invited comment on its new strategy document 'Adding Value'. Both bodies have well-established quality-control procedures and both publish annual reports which include performance indicators such as cost, the number of accounts audited, the number of recommendations agreed to, and an estimate of the value of savings identified. This record of accountability is impressive compared with many other public bodies. But it is internally driven. While the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission have carte blanche to review and report on most of the public sector, it does seem anomalous that they alone should escape independent public scrutiny. An independent body with an overview of both organisations would be the ideal remedy. But there is no obvious candidate and this would require a change in legislation. At a minimum the auditors should be subject to periodic performance audits, with the results in the public domain. Mary Bowerman is lecturer in public sector accounting at the University of Hull.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Pechiney packaging arm hit by warning Shares in Pechiney Inter-national, the packaging arm of Pechiney, the French state-owned aluminium group, fell sharply yesterday following a warning by Mr Jean Gandois, chairman, of a fall in first-half profits. The shares lost 5.6 per cent to close at FFr152.2 following Mr Gandois's statement to the company's shareholders' meeting. However, he added that he expected an improvement in the second half of the year, compared with the first six months. According to Mr Gandois, first-half profits will be hit by increased financial charges, partly reflecting higher US interest rates, and the cost of recent investments and acquisitions. The result, he said, would be a reduction in net profits compared with the FFr439m (Dollars 77m), after amortisation, recorded in the first six months of 1993. Mr Gandois said the company was considering a convertible bond issue, although the size and the timing had not been decided. The company said recovery in the weak Paris stock market would be necessary before an issue could be launched. Mr Gandois said sales in the packaging division had shown a relatively strong improvement since the beginning of the year, but prices had remained uncertain.</p>

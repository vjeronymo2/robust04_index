			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Rebellious Tories ensure that Major faces a tough time: As conference approaches, Kevin Brown examines leadership chalenge rumours MR JOHN MAJOR returned from his Portuguese holiday three weeks ago determined to draw a line under the series of setbacks which has undermined his leadership since last year's general election. He has not succeeded. The prime minister's strategy has been to dismiss talk of an autumn leadership challenge as a product of the 'silly season', the summer period when political rumours sometimes achieve unjustified prominence in the absence of real news. This approach sufficed while the rebellion was confined to backbenchers such as Mrs Teresa Gorman, the rightwing MP for Billericay. But it may not be enough to deal with the more substantial intervention of Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor. Mr Lamont, sacked by Mr Major in May, gave fresh impetus to the rebel campaign yesterday in newspaper articles in which he scarcely bothered to conceal his contempt for the party leader. Mr Major's dismissive description of Mr Lamont's comments as 'rather sad and disingenuous' prompted a declaration of loyalty from the former chancellor last night, but the episode did nothing to calm the party's troubled waters. Sir Teddy Taylor, the MP for Southend East, was only one of a number of rightwingers claiming that Mr Lamont's views were shared privately by several ministers. However, in spite of all the huffing and puffing on the back benches, it remains unclear whether, and when, a challenger will emerge. One idea being discussed on the right is to put up a 'stalking horse' candidate designed to tip Mr Major on to the slippery slope towards resignation by demonstrating his unpopularity among Tory MPs. Ironically, this was the strategy adopted in 1989 by opponents of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, now Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister. Mrs Thatcher crushed Sir Anthony Meyer, the rebel candidate, but was sufficiently weakened to be defeated a year later. The consensus is that Mr Major would be fatally wounded if more than 100 MPs opposed him or abstained from voting. But the problem for the right is that a leadership challenge can only take place if 10 per cent of Conservative MPs request a poll in writing. The rule book says that the identities of the MPs would be kept secret. But nobody in the Westminster rumour mill imagines that the names could be kept confidential for long. This means that 34 MPs would have to declare openly that they want the prime minister replaced. Mrs Gorman claims that sufficient disgruntled MPs are prepared to stand up and be counted. Less committed observers question that assertion. The arithmetic may change, however, if Mr Major fails to demonstrate a clear grip of the party over the next month. The crucial test will come at the start of next month when the Conservative rank and file gather in Blackpool for the annual conference. The signs are that many are already in an angry mood. This is partly because of the deep-seated unhappiness about the government's performance on crucial issues such as the economy and law and order. It is also a reflection of irritation about manipulation of the conference agenda by party headquarters. For example, there will be no debate on the extension of value added tax to heating fuel, although dozens of critical motions have been submitted. Mr Major, who is not a good conference speaker, will have to deliver the performance of his life to still the campaign against him. But Mr Lamont is not finished either. The former chancellor is widely expected to return to the attack when he addresses a fringe meeting organised by the Bow Group. Lady Thatcher will publish her memoirs next month. Any suggestion of disloyalty by Mr Major during the 1990 leadership crisis will be seized upon by rightwingers as further evidence of his untrustworthiness. The outlook for Mr Major is not all gloom. His advisers have always claimed that the government's problems would ease as economic recovery took hold. He is also protected by the rebels' awareness that the most likely winner of a leadership battle would be Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who attracts equal dislike from the right. Nevertheless, Mr Major's future remains unpredictable. Even if he escapes a challenge this year, the leadership issue would be reopened by a poor Conservative performance in the European parliament elections in June. That, say the cooler-headed rebels, is the time to watch.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Setback for Maxwell MPs THE CAMPAIGN at Westminster on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners suffered a setback yesterday, as it emerged that there is little prospect of an inquiry by the parliamentary ombudsman into the conduct of the department of trade and industry. MPs believe that the statement last week by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was a signal that there is not enough of a case of potential maladministration for the ombudsman to investigate. Mr Lamont said that claims that the DTI had failed to act on warnings from Imro, the investment management regulatory organisation, did not appear to be substantiated, and that in any event, the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) had found that those legal uncertainties did not make any material difference to Imro's regulation of the Maxwell pension fund companies. The pensioners' campaigners have regarded an investigation by the ombudsman as critical to their argument for government compensation. Mr Richard Page, the Tory co-chairman of the all-party group campaigning on behalf of the pensioners, contacted Mr William Reid, the ombudsman, last month, with details of Imro's representations to the DTI in 1987 and again in 1990 about the difficulties of combining trust law and the financial services act. Though a decision not to launch an investigation will be a blow to the campaign, the issue may not rest there. Mr Frank Field, a member of the cross-party social security committee, has said that when the committee begins its renewed inquiry into the Maxwell affair, it might consider meeting Mr Reid. Mr Reid has already issued a statement outlining the limits of his jurisdiction. Details of the argument against an investigation were set out in a Commons debate by Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary. He said that after Imro had passed to the DTI a report by Professor Hayton about the problems of the law on pension fund regulation, the department had told Imro and SIB not to rely solely on trust law for regulating the management of occupational pension schemes, and that it was for them to devise adequate investor protection. 'Neither Imro nor SIB at any time advised the DTI that it disagreed with this advice or was unable to deliver the degree of investor protection required,' Mr Nelson said.</p>

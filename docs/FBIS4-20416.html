			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Xie Yanjin (6200 1484 3160): "Futures </F> Market Develops Well, as Its High Tide Swells at First Time"]    [Text] What is the situation in the development of futures,  a new form of trading in China? Recently Mr. Lu Jian, President  of the International Futures Brokerage Company Ltd, of China,  expressed his view on this question.    China's futures market has successfully gone through the  difficult stage from theory to practice after the founding of  the Shanghai Metal Exchange and the Shenzhen Exchange in 1992.  However, China's futures market in 1992 was far from being  perfect. It is still in its embryonic stage. Only the year of  1993 was the crucial year for development. During that year, the  scale of the futures market had become much larger. The market  had formed a network, covering various major cities throughout  the country. Generally speaking, the development of China's  futures market is as follows:    1. China's futures market is rapidly changing from spot  trading and forward spot trading towards standard futures  contracts. With the development of market economy, the share of  futures contracts of the market is rapidly expanding. They serve  as a definite supplement to the spot market.    2. The varieties of commodities on the futures market have  considerably increased. When the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock  exchanges were first founded in 1992, the goods for futures  trading were only limited to nonferrous copper. In 1993, they  included grain, petroleum, sugar crops and even standard futures  contracts for treasury bonds. This had diversified the varieties  of commodities on China's futures market.    3. As far as every futures exchange is concerned, there are  considerable varieties of goods offered at various new futures  exchanges which have opened their doors since the second half of  1993. Let us take the Beijing Commodity Exchange as an example.  Commodities offered at the exchange now include rolled steel and  treasury bonds in addition to nonferrous metal. Even in futures  exchanges which have been in business fairly early such as the  Shanghai Futures Exchange, they have added rice, petroleum,  diesel oil and others to the list of goods offered at their  exchanges. This makes their offer of goods more diversified and  comprehensive, and further expanded their scope of business.    4. From the point of view of market management, the  membership of the futures exchange has also become more  diversified. Most of the members of the futures markets in  Shanghai and Shenzhen in 1992 were production units. The  percentage of specialized brokerage companies in the membership  rose in 1993. These specialized brokerage companies have played  a significant role in helping China's futures market develop  itself along the right track. For example, the International  Futures Brokerage Company Ltd, of China has membership in the  world's three famous futures exchanges only one year after its  founding. This has winded up the history whereas China's futures  trading has no place in the international futures market. Due to  the tremendous growth of China's futures market in 1993, people  often call 1993 the "Year of Futures."    China's futures market is able to make remarkable progress  within a short period of more than a year because of its solid  economic foundation. China had officially established its market  economic system in 1992, putting 70 percent of the producer's  goods and 90 percent of the consumer goods on the market. This  had pointed out the important role of pricing signals. Prices  were relatively stable when the system of planned economy held  sway in the past. However, under the conditions of market  economy, prices of many raw materials and commodities fluctuate  a great deal in different seasons and years. Therefore,  enterprises and peasants are faced with many incalculable  factors in the market economy and greater risks as compared with  the past. How can they avoid such risks? The only method to  avoid such risks is to protect their profits by hedging.  Therefore, the emergence and development of China's futures  market is something inevitable.    After a year of rapid development, China's futures market  has entered the year of 1994. That does not mean that the market  has slowed down. Mr. Lu believes that 1994 remains the "year of  futures." He gives the following three reasons:    1. After China enters the 1990s, it has maintained a high  rate of economic growth. Its rate of economic growth is expected  to reach 12 percent in 1993. It can still maintain a growth rate  between 10 and 12 percent. Even if there will be some  fluctuations in the next several years, such ups and downs would  only affect the rate of growth. The overall trend will be  characterized by a sustained growth. The development of the  futures market is closely linked with the rate of economic  growth, because economic growth means the expansion of  investments and trading. Therefore, we may say that in 1994,  China's futures market will still witness a year of growth and  improvement in 1994.    2. In the course of macro-economic control during the second  half of 1993, various enterprises once against suffered from new  chain-debts. They owed each other money, scrapped contracts and  cheated each other. Therefore, many production and supply and  marketing enterprises incurred heavy losses in spot trading and  forward spot trading. This was mainly because underground spot  trading and the illegal practices in handling transactions. The  system of open outcry, the signing of standard futures trading  contracts and the system of floor trading have enhanced the  transparency in doing futures trading and protected the prestige  of all traders. Meanwhile, investors may engage in trading by  paying a small amount of margin only. Thus, they may be able to  control a large amount of commodities with a small amount of  money. Moreover, the implementation of standard futures  contracts has helped solve the problem of transportation for  spot trading and made things convenient for the enterprises to  do trading. Therefore, more production, supply and marketing  enterprises have participated in doing futures trading since the  beginning of 1994. This is an inevitable trend in the course of  developing market economy.    3. Only when the futures market established in 1993 enters  the year of 1994, will it be possible for all its members to  play their role well. After a certain period, China's futures  market is no longer able to meet the needs of its members in  doing futures trading. From this point of view, the development  of the 1994 futures market is a continuation of the progress  made in 1993.    As a new event in the development of market economy, China's  futures market is still faced with some problems at the present  moment.    Currently, a considerable number of futures brokerage  companies in China's coastal regions and some major cities in  China's inland provinces, which have the experience of handling  futures trading in Hong Kong and Taiwan, carry out fraudulent  activities that run counter to the principle of open trading.  For example, they often mislead their clients by providing them  with wrong information, and make illegal profits. This had  seriously harmed the interests of the investors.    Nevertheless, we must not doubt the future prospects of the  futures market because of this. In order to further improve  China's futures market, the relevant departments of the state  must work out administrative rules and regulations and laws on  futures trading, and make the control of futures trading a  regular system and procedure.    In addition, it is necessary to set up a  government-recognized authoritative association for futures  trading and implement a membership system. Efforts must be made  to enforce a system under which all futures brokers must take a  standardized test to ensure their competency. Right now, the  method has already gone into effect.    Consequently, it is expected that China's futures trading  will take on a new look in the near future.</p>

			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Yes, chefs have feelings too: A restaurant critic's comeuppance MR JUSTICE Frank Martin, a Dublin judge, this week awarded the maximum damages allowed in an Irish Circuit Court, Pounds 15,000 plus costs, against the Irish Times and its restaurant critic, Sandy O'Byrne, for her review of the Olive restaurant in Sandycove, Co Dublin. As a restaurateur turned critic this judgment, even though it sets no precedent in British law, should have sent professional shivers down my spine. It did not. Instead, I felt as though I had eaten a bad meal rather than read someone else's account of one. Why, I asked myself, could the restaurateur not accept the criticism? Why should the reviewer, if she were factually inaccurate, not apologise and print a correction? And why was the legal process involved at all to settle a matter of personal and highly subjective opinion? In its day my restaurant received both good and bad reviews, fortunately more of the former. Only one, in the Evening Standard, shortly after we opened, brought any noticeable increase in business. The other good reviews did, however, have one significant effect - they were wonderful for staff morale. Photocopied and pinned to every available wall in the kitchen and staff changing room, they gave everyone a much-needed boost and allowed us to deal calmly with the customers next day who demanded the impossible immediately. I wish I could say we accepted the bad reviews with the same equanimity. We swore, cursed, felt very hurt and tried to investigate what had gone wrong. In one respect the hurt was understandable. Cooking is a very personal process. When I cook at home for friends and they leave anything on their plates  - I try to be a generous host - I feel hurt. Chefs have the same feelings. They do not like their hard work to be rejected but because they very rarely see their customers they have no chance of gauging their customers' reaction whether it is laudatory or critical. But chefs and restaurateurs do share one great advantage. The most difficult aspect for anyone to understand about the restaurant trade is that there is no 'pending tray'. Everything happens so quickly - a busy dinner follows a hectic lunch seemingly within minutes - and all customers have to be dealt with so promptly that there is little time to sit and talk, let alone mope over a bad review. Instead, there is the immediate possibility of putting things right. If, at lunch, the fish section was slow or the desserts not good enough, customers can be compensated immediately with a free bottle of wine and the organisational details can be rectified promptly. A playwright, concert pianist or sculptor, whose productions may take years to create, does not have this opportunity. When I asked the novelist Julian Barnes how he reacted to a bad review he said that it would be inhuman not to feel some gut reaction - letting down the tyres of the reviewer's car was his immediately intuitive solution. But in his previous careers, studying for the Bar and then writing literary and restaurant reviews, he had come to the same conclusions as I have. First, in matters of personal and critical opinion the law should never be brought in except in extreme cases of damage or malice (ie allegations of a lack of hygiene that may have caused food poisoning). This would rule out restaurants suing critics for their highly subjective observations. Second, restaurant reviewers, and their newspapers, should allow restaurateurs and chefs the right of factual correction. Once that was established reviewers might be forced to stick more closely to expressing what they know rather than what they feel. Such a system would also bridge the gulf between reviewers and their readers. The most salutary aspect of the law suit in Ireland, and there have been similar cases in Paris and Sydney where restaurant critics and their papers have been successfully taken to court by restaurateurs, may be that the general public stops taking any critic's word as gospel. Even the best restaurants and the greatest chefs can have off nights and no restaurant stays bad for ever - it usually goes out of business. In almost four years as a restaurant critic three different chefs have threatened me with legal action - one even phoned me at home at 8.45am on a Saturday to complain about what I had written about him in that day's paper  -but fortunately nothing materialised. What I dread far more is a letter of complaint, or even the threat of legal action, from a reader who has returned disappointed from a restaurant I have praised. I sincerely hope it will never happen. If it should, I will carry on going to restaurants because I feel that they do more than just serve food and wine. When the novelist Paul Gallico was a sports journalist for the Daily News in New York in the 1920s and early 1930s he wrote that he loved going to sporting events - boxing, baseball or the races  - because all human life was there. I feel the same way about restaurants and no judge, over-sensitive restaurateur or prima donna chef is going to dampen my enthusiasm for them.</p>

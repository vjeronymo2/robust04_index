			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Mitterrand warns on Maastricht rejection PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand last night raised the French referendum campaign on Maastricht to a new pitch, warning in a three-hour television debate that rejection of the treaty would be a 'serious setback' for France and Europe. Mr Mitterrand, whose approval rating has been in steady decline, refused to make any link between the outcome of the September 20 vote and his own political future. In his first TV debate for four years, Mr Mitterrand sought to explain and defend the treaty on political and economic union. As well as fending off spirited and often hostile questioning from selected private citizens, he crossed swords in a surprisingly courteous duel with Mr Philippe Seguin, Gaullist standard bearer of the No campaign. With opinion polls indicating a close result, the impact of the debate on the referendum is hard to predict, given that neither Mr Mitterrand nor his antagonist made any serious blunder. The see-saw nature of the referendum campaign was highlighted by publication of a poll conducted earlier this week for Societe Generale, the French bank, showing 52 per cent of the electorate planned to vote No. This poll contradicted five others published this week, all indicating a narrow Yes majority. The TV marathon was marked by an intervention from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who told French viewers that fears of losing their identity in the EC were misplaced. He saw no reason for any French 'inferiority complex'. Mr Mitterrand said the Germans were 'making a big sacrifice' in agreeing to monetary union. 'Their pride is the D-Mark,' he said. In his case for a No vote, Mr Seguin strongly criticised Mr Mitterrand for committing France to a single monetary policy over which it would have little control and for pushing France towards the goal of a federal Europe. Mr Seguin stressed that Britain had won the right to opt out of monetary union, but France had not. Mr Mitterrand claimed Maastricht was necessary for the European Community to protect itself. While barriers were coming down between EC states, the Community still lacked common policies to assure its internal and external security. He acknowledged that a referendum defeat would pose severe problems for him. But 'worn' though he and his unpopular Socialist government were, he denied he was such a liability that he should step down to win approval for Maastricht. Mr Seguin called for renegotiation of Maastricht to introduce more democracy into EC decision-making, a bigger say for national parliaments, a new common currency in parallel to national currencies, and a greater opening to east Europe. A Yes vote in the French referendum is a clear favourite with the bookmakers. Ladbrokes is quoting 1-2 (bet Pounds 2 to win Pounds 1) for a majority in favour, with a No vote offered at 11-8.

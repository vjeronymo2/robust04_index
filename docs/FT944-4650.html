			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: German shipping group sees record year Hapag-Lloyd, the German shipping and tourism group, expects operating profits to increase to a record DM720m (Dollars 460m) in 1994, in spite of the failure of its container shipping operations to achieve its target of breaking even. The main contribution to profits, up from DM645m last year, is expected to come from the Hamburg-based company's tourism activities, including leisure air travel, package holidays and its travel agency. Profits of the company's cruise operations have fallen, partly because the destinations served by the cruise liner Europa - including India and South Africa - did not prove popular. Nevertheless, Hapag has chartered a second smaller cruise liner, the Bremen, and may exercise an option to buy it next year Hapag's container operations will make an operating loss of between DM10m and DM15m, Mr Bernd Wrede, chairman, said in London. This represents an improvement on the 1993 loss of DM50m but is less than the forecast break-even. The company now hopes to reach break-even in 1995, Mr Wrede added. The company's container activities have been restructured over the past two years, resulting in a 20 per cent fall in employee numbers to 3,300. At the same time, the number of containers shipped has risen by 15 per cent to 850,000 twenty-foot unit equivalents (teu) while operating costs have remained steady. Total group turnover is expected to rise to DM4.1bn in 1994 from DM3.9bn the year before. Container shipping accounts for just over half of the total. Hapag expects to invest just over DM400m this year, compared with the average of DM500m to DM550m in recent years. The company has disposed of its towing operations, contributing DM85m towards a total capital gain on asset sales of DM120m included in the operating profit figure.</p>

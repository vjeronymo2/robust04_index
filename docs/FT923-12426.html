			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Seven of the best - Radio AN unexpected item on Wednesday's Woman's Hour wasbreakfast with seven female honorary degree holders of St. Andrews University, which is celebrating the centenary of its admission of women. They were a historian, a theologian, a novelist, a philosopher, an artist, a molecular-physicist and a neuropsychologist: Jane Dempsey-Douglass, Louise Johnson, Fay Weldon, Rosalind Hitchison, Brenda Milner, Wilhelmina Barns-Graham and Lady Warnock. They talked about women. Were men's and women's brains different? Philosophy was gender-free, as were writing and science; but not painting - women go for detail, men for main forms. Research showed men's and women's brains to be alike, and here the talk veered into the practice and the ethics of science. On Saturday, it was good to hear Robert Louis Stevenson's unfinished Weir of Hermiston on Radio 4. Robert Forrest's adaptation follows the book as far as it goes - Archie Weir (Forbes Masson) rows about capital punishment with his brutal father Adam, a judge. Adam says Archie will not do for the Bar with his ideas and must stay with the estate. There he falls for Christina (Wendy Seagar), sister of the wild Elliott brothers; but he resolves to stop seeing her. Stevenson's notes suggest that she now be seduced by Archie's friend Innes, and Archie should kill him. Gaoled but rescued, he and Christina escape to America. (The date is 1813.) Forrest sticks to this. In America, Christina admits she is pregnant. This, I think, is Forrest's insert, natural though it seems, and he leaves it there. It is a good tale, well played in Scots under Patrick Rayner's direction. Another effective adaptation, also on Saturday, was Radio 4's Classic Serial, Guy Meredith's version of Camus's La Peste - a repeat from 1986 (part two is tonight). The outbreak of bubonic plague in Oran is observed through the lives of familiar people. Dr Rieux, Tarrou, the journalist Rambert and so on react - not as to a crisis - but as to tiresome daily events. Those dead rats] Those new infections] When their meaning is clear, there is no panic, just routine restrictions. Their effects on different people is what infects the mind with alarm. Under Cherry Cookson's direction, the atmosphere is magically suggested. I must not overlook Radio 3 drama, now we know of its imminent reduction; but Martyn Wade's Burn the Aeneid] on Sunday was no advocate. This is a farce about Vergil's dying instruction to destroy the script of his great epic. His executors try every way to avoid it, including the seduction of Vergil's sister-in-law. The Emperor demands it shall be sent to him, but Homer, the dog of one of the executor's, has eaten it. Never mind, another copy has been concealed under Vergil's corpse. Cherry Cookson directed this too, and got more fun from it than it deserved. Radio 1's good deeds now include Unsung Heroes, a Saturday series calling for justice to writers of pop songs. Often there are no credits on labels, yet the songs are sung by millions, and such names as Albert Hammond and Mike Chapman should be as well known as Bach or Mozart, though maybe not for as long. Writers interviewed last Saturday did not suggest musical genius. Music is hardly involved, only an instinct for what 'sounds good', developing simple chords around your title - which may have come up in everyday chat. Easy to sneer at notes or lyrics; but they are what people want to hear, and to sing, and deserve that much credit.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: News Corp buys 50% of Mushroom Records NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's Australian media group, is expanding its recorded music business with the purchase of a 50 per cent stake in Mushroom Records, Australia's largest independent recording company. Announcing the purchase yesterday, Mr Ken Cowley, chief executive of News in Australia, said the company's wholly-owned Festival Records subsidiary had acted as Mushroom's main distributor for 20 years and would continue to do so. 'This new investment is in keeping with our commitment to provide first class multi-media entertainment and information services,' he said. Mushroom has annual sales of around ADollars 50m (USDollars 34m) Mr Michael Gudinski, chairman of Mushroom, said the deal would allow the company to expand overseas, especially in the US and Britain, with its stable of recording stars which include Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan. Mr Gudinski said the deal would provide valuable links with News subsidiaries, including Fox Broadcasting, and would bolster Festival Records' position in a competitive Australian market where top recording companies have bought out most of the independents. Mushroom was founded 21 years ago. Mr Gudinski will retain day-to-day control of the operation.</p>

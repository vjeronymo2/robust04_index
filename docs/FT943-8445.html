			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Electrolux soars on strong US sales Large capital gains and a strong underlying recovery helped Electrolux, the world's biggest manufacturer of household appliances, to multiply its first-half profits. The pre-tax figure, after financial items, jumped to SKr4.43bn (Dollars 570m) from SKr605m including SKr2.77bn in capital gains on disposals. Excluding these items, the result was up 174 per cent at SKr1.66bn, slightly ahead of expectations of SKr1.52bn. Operating income climbed 71 per cent to SKr2.50bn. The upturn was led by the group's household appliance division and reflected cost-cutting, new product launches and better demand in the US and Europe. The US market had a particularly strong second quarter, helped by hot weather which drove up sales of air conditioning and outdoor equipment. The pattern in Europe was less of clear recovery than of stabilisation in some markets, such as the UK, Spain and Nordic countries, and a slowing of the downturn in others, such as Italy and France. The company remains cautious about prospects in Europe, warning that interest rate rises could undermine the turnround. It expects a slight slowing of US sales. The second half will see lower financial costs after a disposal programme which has cut net debt by SKr7.5bn since last year. The main disposal was Autoliv, the car safety equipment manufacturer, which contributed a SKr2.9bn capital gain. Group sales expanded to SKr55.5bn from SKr49.6bn, up 8 per cent on an underlying basis. Higher volumes account for most of the increase, although Mr Leif Johansson, chief executive, signalled that the group had obtained some price increases. 'We are beginning to see limited price increases, both in the US and in Europe, particularly in outdoor products,' he said. The company also believes it has slightly increased its market share in Europe and US through own-brand sales. Second-quarter profits, excluding capital gains, rose to SKr991m from SKr483m. The group said that underlying operating margins during the period had increased to 5 per cent from 3.5 per cent. First-half household appliance sales rose 11.2 per cent to SKr31.5bn, from SKr28.3bn.

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Management: Same formula, different race - What can managers learn from sportsmen? Jackie Stewart and his son Paul tell Tim Dickson Damon Hill may be British motor racing's most famous son. But 27-year-old Paul Stewart, whose father Jackie scored 27 Grand Prix victories in his time, is fast proving to be another chip off the old block. Young Stewart is no all-conquering driver just yet - he is currently seventh in this year's Formula 3000 championship, the class below Formula One. But what marks him out for special attention is Paul Stewart Racing, the company he founded with his father in 1988. On first acquaintance it is not an exceptional business. It runs several cars, employs around 45 people at offices and workshops in Milton Keynes, and besides Formula 3000 concentrates on racing in two other 'formative' classes, Vauxhall Lotus and Formula Three. Like other motor racing teams its income - in excess of Pounds 3.2m this year - is dependent on corporate sponsors. What distinguishes Paul Stewart Racing in a sector notoriously short of good management talent is the rare commercial flair of its celebrated founder. He is now passing this on to his son. Professional sportsmen often earn a living from their admiring contacts or dining out on past glories - but relatively few develop genuine business careers or can claim to have established and grown a new venture. Jackie Stewart is one of them. The three-times world championship winner has brought to his son's company some of the lessons which sport can teach businessmen - sound preparation, good teamwork and the like. But he has also applied his experiences of commercial life gained over 10 years at the wheel of a Formula One car. 'As a professional sportsman I had the privilege of working with some of the best business and technical brains in the world,' says Stewart senior. 'I learnt a lot about marketing, generating enthusiasm and the importance of communication.' Appreciation of risk - a skill which comes in useful in business as well as at speeds of more than 200mph - could also be added to the list. 'I survived as a driver by minimising the downside risks, meticulously analysing those that were worth taking and those that weren't,' explains Stewart senior. 'In a sports business like ours there's no puffing up a balance sheet to disguise short-term performance. Either you win or you don't, that's what it's about.' At the heart of the company's philosophy is a belief that talent on the track should be matched by professionalism off it. Take Stewart senior's ideas on the increasingly competitive and cut-throat world of corporate sponsorship. 'Sponsorship is almost an obsolete word,' he explains, outlining how it now goes well beyond dangling a bit of media exposure in front of a few motor racing enthusiast chairmen. 'What it's really about is bringing people together.' With the 31 sponsors, many of them Scottish-based, effectively the 'shareholders' - among them Highland Spring, the Marshall Food Group, Bank of Scotland and the Forte hotel group - Stewart works hard to provide a worthwhile 'return'. Companies get their names on the cars and a chance to invite clients and employees to races. But the most interesting part of the 'dividend' - and the one Stewart claims gives the company an edge - is the potential business to be won in the sponsorship group. Neil Kirby, deputy general manager of Forte's Grosvenor House Hotel in London, says the group is stocking Highland Spring thanks to a meeting arranged by Stewart, while conference and hotel business has come its way from other members of the 'network'. David Paterson of Bank of Scotland does not expect to win vast numbers of new accounts or deposits, but underlines Stewart's readiness to make introductions and says this may produce a more tangible return to the bank than merely having its name emblazoned on the side of a car. If Paul Stewart Racing could teach some businesses a trick or two about pleasing 'shareholders', the company is no slouch when it comes to staff development. Its 'staircase of talent' idea may sound like something out of a management consultancy brochure, yet it neatly reflects the view that drivers and mechanics can be 'grown' through experience in all three formulas. With unprecedented Formula Three and Vauxhall Lotus championship wins for the team this season the drivers have excelled on the track. But away from it each one is trained in public speaking, both to represent and entertain sponsors at events. 'Today they understand that they are part of a service industry. And service means, being where the sponsors want them, dressed appropriately, ready, willing and able to talk about the investor's business,' explains Paul. Modern management thinking, indeed, trips off young and old tongues alike with Stewart senior particularly obsessed by change. 'I've seen the goal posts move so much with the Japanese motor industry,' he says before delivering an image of the British motorcycle industry unlikely to be found in any business school textbook. 'It is not as if they were shot in the back by a high-powered rifle from a great distance, nor stabbed from behind a curtain on a dark night. They died in their own beds, asleep, suffocated by their pillows.' A recent example of their own challenges came when a rival team developed a chassis which threatened their early season lead in the Formula Three championship (which their driver subsequently won). 'We decided to get a different car, which was not only very expensive. With the championship slipping away we also had to learn quickly to engineer it and adapt to it.' Paul Stewart Racing aims to reduce its dependency on sponsorship income through diversification and is trying to exploit the expertise it has so far developed in telemetry - the use of radio waves to transmit readings and measurements of instruments to a recording device. It has no proprietary technology, but its 'racing mentality' is attracting the interest of Ford's North American vehicle dynamic engineers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Conservative Party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg </F> by station announcer Johannes van der Walt--live, interview  broadcast in progress]    [Text] [Hartzenberg] Firstly, we have to indicate that the  Afrikaner nation has a claim to land in South Africa. You know,  Mr. Mandela has said no volkstaat [homeland] for the  Afrikaners....    [Van der Walt, interrupting] While he is living, yes.    [Hartzenberg] Yes, while he is living. The PAC  [Pan-Africanist Congress] said they are demanding the whole  South Africa as it was in 1652, before Jan van Riebeeck came  here. The PAC did not object then when we began to occupy South  Africa; and we have claims -- legitimate claims -- because ever  since that time the Afrikaner has been here, and we are a nation  -- one which is being threatened at the moment. That is the  international criteria that is necessary.    [Van der Walt] Dr. Hartzenberg, in other words the report on  that working committee, which was requested to investigate this  matter a few weeks ago, and it has been evaluated and  considered....    [Hartzenberg] It has now been evaluated and decisions have  been taken and those decisions will be announced next week.    [Van der Walt] Even the issue of boundaries will also be  announced within a week?    [Hartzenberg] The issue of boundaries and how we arrived at  it -- that will also be announced. We maintain that it actually  depends on the people. You know, if you have a certain region,  we know that as South Africa is today there are certain regions  which belong to other nations and we are not, in any way, laying  any claims on any of those. There are certain areas which have  been occupied by other population groups which are a reality,  which cannot be included in our volkstaat. Then you also have  some of our people who do not want to be included in such a  volkstaat, and we do not want to force them to be in our  volkstaat. In other words, these are all criteria which have  been taken into consideration.    Then we went further and approved the actions in towns and  cities that have to be planned, the towns must work out  comprehensive programs aimed at declaring, or rather proclaiming  -- irrespective of whether the Transitional Executive Council  likes proclamations or not -- those towns volkstaat towns.    [Van der Walt ] Is this the peg that you said....    [Hartzenberg] This is the peg I spoke about, but if you  start  talking about claims and you start talking from the point of  view of regions, then it is up to the people to knock in that  peg because it will be their will to embrace that town in a  volkstaat. Those are programs that have been approved and that  have to be set into motion around 29th March, and that we hope  -- if it happens throughout -- will be something spectacular and  will reaffirm our claim on freedom and our claim on land, as we  saw happening yesterday as regards the Zulu nation.    We also further reaffirmed that the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Front, AVF] will not participate in the  elections and that the differences in this regard - in  right-wing ranks -- will not detract our attention and our  actions from our actual objectives and our enemies, namely the  ANC [African National Congress] and the SACP [South African  Communist Party] as well as the government. That we are not to  grab each other by the throat, but rather that we strive toward  our objective purposefully, enthusiastically, with idealism and  dedication so that we can see our volkstaat materialize -- that  is what we have been striving for. And we don't have a trace of  doubt that our nation will not be free in its own fatherland,  under its own flag, and with its own anthem "Die stem van  Suid-Afrika" [The Voice of South Africa].    [Van der Walt] And the election?    [Hartzenberg] Well, that question, as a result of all the  things which have happened lately, it has been extremely  difficult, of course, to bring that to fruition before the  election. The differences in our ranks, the fact that one of  our ally partners has been forced through violence to surrender,  and all that sort of thing has had such a quick effect, but what  we want to at least do is to make the volkstaat a type of a  reality, that it is inevitable, that it has to come; and  everyone will know that it has to be there. And this is our aim.  I must tell you that when that volkstaat will materialize -- it  is in fact a question no one can answer -- and how it will come  about, no one knows. But come it will -- there is no doubt about  that because that is a legitimate right of every nation, and our  nation also has that right. Everything depends on us.    [Van der Walt] It is something, Dr. Ferdi, that binds us  together, despite the split in our ranks.    [Hartzenberg] That is a fact. That is the cementing factor,  and we can launch actions in which all can participate to  promote and strive for this objective. And one of these days  the election will be over and then there will be no need to  argue about such things. But if I read the signs correctly,  then it seems to me as if that election will perhaps not take  place, because I....    [Van der Walt, interrupting] I have always said that.    [Hartzenberg] I have heard some of these revolutionaries say  that they have brought one government of an independent state to  its knees, they are in the process of destabilizing another, and  they also have their eyes focused on kwaZulu, and they say it is  not their sole aim to take over independent and self-governing  states, but to take over the Pretoria government. And Mr.  Mandela has made rumblings which amount to the fact that they  will achieve this through violence; and that there will possibly  be no election. And I think we Afrikaners have to realize that  if they are going around interfering with the governments of  independent and self-governing states, they are also on their  way to us -- that they will want to force us Afrikaners to  surrender. And that is why it is essential that we must not  grab each other by the throat during these times of crises,  because should this happen, then we must stand together and we  must assert ourselves.    [Hartzenberg] If it had been during other times, with no  communist takeover threatening within five weeks, then we could  have afforded to sort each other out. But right now we have to  keep the wolf away from the door [laughter from both] and we  have to see to it that we do not end up in an embarrassing  situation.    [Van der Walt] Dr. Hartzenberg, the agreement which Dr.  Pieter Mulder spoke about between...[pauses] that they are going  to take part in the election as a front, but yet remain part of  the CP. Your comment on that?    [Hartzenberg] No, no, I made no such agreement with them. We  discussed the matter, and look, I did everything in my power and  under those circumstances no person has a desire to lose  colleagues along the way. And we discussed the matter and looked  at all possible ways, to see if there was a solution somewhere.  But unfortunately that is the position. In politics it is a  reality, namely that one can only belong to one party, because  if you belong to two parties, where is your loyalty then?  Really, one must accept it as a reality, and our constitution  also determines that. And it's not only because the  constitution states it, but it's because it is a reality.    And the other thing is, if someone belongs to one party and  you are a candidate to another party, then it's just not  tenable. All political parties forbid their members to belong  to other parties and to become candidates of other parties. I  discussed this with the gentlemen concerned. We did find ways  and means, but I told them emphatically that if they become  candidates of another party, then they could very well cancel  themselves out of the party. The constitution says that if you  render yourself available as candidate to another party, then  your membership automatically expires.    [Van der Walt] Could you, as leader of the Conservative  Party  -- just in conclusion, Dr. Hartzenberg -- say something relating  to what is in the news this morning and today, this issue about  the police? We were approached by listeners this morning. They  want to know our views about the matter -- this thing about  there being an international investigation into the actions of a  sort of third force in the police, something the ANC has been  talking about for a long time?    [Hartzenberg] Well, Johannes, I think it is significant that  such a report has been brought to light now. We have not as yet  seen the report officially, we have only been reading newspaper  and other reports. But it still seems as though it is not a  report based on firm grounds. It is still hearsay evidence.  And it is part of the suspicion-creating, the revolutionary  onslaught. These revolutionists work that way, as happened in  Russia. The resistance against a communist takeover must be  broken down, and in this case the top general is put in the  accused's box without any legitimate reasons, without a  comprehensive investigation. They are put on obligatory leave  for no real reason; and I think this issue of a third force is a  story being exploited by the ANC to focus suspicion on the  police, and the security forces.    [Van der Walt] And also to detract attention from the  conflict with the Inkatha Freedom Party.    [Hartzenberg] Yes, but also to weaken the forces which have  to maintain law and order so that they can violently...[pauses]  because this is the impression I get, that they don't intend  taking over the country through an election but through other  ways. And that fits in with Mr. Mandela's utterance the other  day, when he said that such an onslaught was being directed at  the police. And that is why I want to sympathize wholeheartedly  with those guys who are really being treated unfairly.</p>

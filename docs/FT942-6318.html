			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Lipton appeal setback The struggle by Mr Stuart Lipton, chief executive of Stanhope, to block a deal in which British Land acquired a 29.9 per cent share of Stanhope has suffered a further setback in the Court of Appeal. In a unanimous decision the Court of Appeal dismissed an application by Mr Lipton's private company for leave to appeal against an earlier court ruling striking out proceedings by his company against British Land and the Bank of Nova Scotia. Mr Lipton had claimed pre-emption rights over the 29.9 per cent stake which British Land acquired from the Bank of Nova Scotia in March. However, his case was dismissed by Mr Justice Vinelott earlier last month. The judge refused leave to appeal and costs were awarded to the defendants. On Friday in the Court of Appeal Lord Justice Millett upheld that ruling describing the case as 'speculative' and adding that the plaintive's allegations were 'wildly implausible'. Mr Lipton had been anxious to overturn British Land's acquisition of the stake, which is seen as a step to gain control of Stanhope's half-share in Broadgate, a development in the City of London. He said he had the right of first refusal to buy the stake.</p>

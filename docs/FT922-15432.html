			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Dispute erupts in CPSA election THE OUTGOING general secretary of the CPSA Civil Service union is urging members to vote for a specific candidate in the election for his successor as part of an attempt to stop a Militant sympathiser winning the job, Michael Smith writes. The advice by Mr John Ellis in the union's newspaper to vote for Mr Barry Reamsbottom, who describes himself as a moderate, was attacked yesterday as a misuse of power by one rival candidate and gross interference by another. They are Mr John Macreadie, deputy general secretary and a Militant supporter, and Mr Peter Thomason, assistant secretary and a candidate who says he is a Kinnockite. Mr Ellis, in his column in the monthly Red Tape newspaper, attacks the Militant Tendency and advises the union's 124,000 members to vote for Mr Reamsbottom. Mr Macreadie was beaten by Mr Ellis for the top job five years ago after a re-run election. He is demanding a right to reply to Mr Ellis's article. Mr Ellis is to become general secretary of the Council of Civil Service Unions.</p>

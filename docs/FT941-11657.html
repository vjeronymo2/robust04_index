			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Arts: April in Paris - Theatre John Godber, the writer/director from Hull, is still in his 30s. Already he has a string of successes behind him. Bouncers, Teechers and Up'n'Under were all admirably professional. The titles described the subjects, the last being about rugby league. They were full of zest, social observation and competence. Sadly, I missed On the Piste (another expressive title) when it played - to some acclaim - in the West End last year. But it never occurred to me until the opening of April in Paris at the Ambassadors this week that Godber is one of the best contemporary British playwrights. The piece is not quite new. First performed in Hull in 1992, it has toured the country and ran on the Fringe - to mixed reviews - throughout last year's Edinburgh Festival. It has arrived in London with a new cast: Gary Olsen and Maria Friedman. Splendid as they are, most of the praise must go to the writing and the direction, which is by Godber himself. April in Paris can be only described as a comedy. Some of it is very funny. Yet it is the sadness that prevails, along with the craftsmanship. Olsen and Ms Friedman are the sole characters. Married for nearly 10 years, they quarrel, yet remain mutually dependent; there is never much chance that they will part. He is a physically large man, suffering the pains of having been made redundant. He paints in his shed, mainly pictures of power stations in sombre colours. She is half his size, neat and good-looking, still has a job and spends her spare time entering magazine competitions. She wins a trip for two, including 'a night of luxury' on North Sea Ferries to Paris. Neither she nor her husband have been abroad before, and not very far out of Hull. The first hint that this might be an out-of-the-ordinary play comes when the storm in the North Sea clears and the husband, a reluctant traveller, catches a glimpse of the receding English coast. 'Have you noticed,' he says, 'how sad the people in the streets have become?' Paris is a revelation. They love it. The artist in the husband comes out when he sees the Mona Lisa in the Louvre. He accepts a steak tartare in a restaurant without knowing what it is, then overcomes his revulsion to find it delicious. The wife picks up French faster than he does, but even he agrees to go on the Metro and stuns her by asking for a carnet at the ticket office. This is, incidentally, the most pro-France and pro-European Union play that I have seen by a British writer - possibly the only one. There are no cheap jokes about foreigners. With the liberation supplied by Paris, the couple begin to call each other by their first names, Al and Bet, for the first time in years. The return to Hull is an anti-climax, but life will never be the same again. Al continues to paint in his shed, but now - in bright colours - a surrealistic Eiffel Tower. This time it is the husband looking at the magazines for travel prizes - like taking his wife to Mexico, which gives the play a very neat ending. The sets, designed by Robert Jones, are integral to the piece: small black and white for the house in Hull, then a few minor changes to show a ship in storm, and finally, in the second act, a huge background of the Moulin Rouge. Some of the vignettes are superb: watch Al and Bet travelling together standing in a crowded Metro after midnight. Rarely can two players complement each other so well as Olsen and Ms Friedman. As for Godber, he has arrived as a playwright who can combine comedy, depth and feeling. Ambassadors Theatre. (071) 836 6111</p>

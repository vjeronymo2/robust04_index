			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Crimean tilt towards Russia stokes chances of conflict with Ukraine Crimea's moves this week to appoint a Russian citizen as prime minister and introduce the Russian rouble by summer are raising the likelihood of conflict with the Ukrainian government in Kiev. Ukrainian leaders have denounced the pro-Russian actions by the separatist Black Sea peninsula, saying that they could cause 'a big political upheaval'. But they have so far stopped short of threatening retaliation. Since winning a landslide victory last month, Crimea's first president, Mr Yuri Meshkov, has been fulfilling his campaign promise to reintegrate the region into the Russian economy and press ahead with a referendum next March on independence. Last week, Mr Meshkov was in Moscow to initiate negotiations on economic co-operation with Russia. Russian regional affairs minister, Mr Sergei Shakhrai, confirmed on Wednesday that an economic agreement had been drafted. In addition to Russian roubles, Mr Meshkov announced that Russia would supply gas and oil to the energy-starved region where a third of its enterprises have stopped operating and half are working at 50 per cent capacity. Russia is also reportedly providing Rbs50bn to resettle Crimean Tatars returning to the region after Stalin's second world war deportations. Moscow's more active involvement in Crimea's aspirations for independence threatens to add to Ukrainian-Russian tensions, just as the two sides were beginning to resolve their differences on nuclear arms and energy supplies. And Crimea is already the centre of a Russian-Ukrainian dispute over the Black Sea Fleet based there. Mr Valery Shmarov, deputy prime minister, has condemned the Moscow-Crimea talks, saying: 'The rouble will not appear again as legal tender on Ukraine territory.' President Leonid Kravchuk, for his part, is looking at whether it is constitutional for a Russian citizen to hold a high regional post with access to state secrets. A holiday and retirement area for Kremlin elite, Crimea is 70 per cent populated by ethnic Russians. The coastal region was arbitrarily transferred by the Kremlin from Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction in 1954. But since becoming part of an independent Ukraine in 1991, Crimea's 2.5m residents have seen their fortunes decline with the worsening Ukrainian economy. In the face of calls for independence, Kiev has granted Crimea political autonomy and free economic zone status.</p>

He  will not deviate "one centimeter" from this accusation,  Schoenhuber said at a news conference at the Bavarian land  congress of the right-wing extremist Republikaner in Erding near  Munich on Saturday [26 March]. "The one who causes  anti-Semitism in Germany is Mr. Bubis."    The delegates' meeting, from which the press was excluded,  was accompanied by protests. "Right-wing extremists are once  again waging war against a hesitating democracy," said Fritz  Schoesser, Bavarian land chairman of the German Trade Union  Federation, with a view to the latest attacks. At a peaceful  memorial rally he stated that the 70,000 registered right-wing  extremists are a "warning signal for democracy in this country."  According to the police, about 600 people participated in the  demonstration against right-wing extremism.</p>

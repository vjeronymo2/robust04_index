			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- Representatives of  the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said on Tuesday  evening that Bosnian Serb forces have withdrawn their heavy  weapons to outside a 20km zone from the inner core of Gorazde,  as provided for under the NATO ultimatum, and that there is no  longer a threat of air strikes against their positions. Gorazde  is a Moslem enclave in the east of civil war-torn  Bosnia-Herzegovina where Serb and Moslem forces clashed heavily  for almost a month. The NATO Council threatened it would bomb  Bosnian Serb positions unless they withdrew their heavy weapons  to a distance of 20km from the center of Gorazde by 00:01 GMT  Wednesday.    The UNPROFOR representatives in Sarajevo declined to specify  if all Serb heavy weapons had been withdrawn from the area, but  said that there was no longer a threat of air strikes.  Confirming this, U.N. Spokesman Eric Chaperon said that the  U.N. force commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Michael  Rose was going to bed. Chaperon also said that Moslems had  fired at an UNPROFOR patrol which was checking the Serb  positions in the vicinity of Gorazde. There were no casualties,  he said, but a protest has been sent to the Moslem authorities.</p>

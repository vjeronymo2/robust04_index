			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Bankruptcies in Japan double in 1991 JAPAN'S individual bankruptcies soared to 23,491 in 1991, double that of the previous year, reflecting sharp increases in insolvencies because of consumer loans. The figure, compiled by the Management and Co-ordination Agency, also reflects a surge of defaults on credit card loans and purchases by the younger generation. Individual bankruptcies, have become a social issue with many older Japanese shocked as traditional frugality has given way to materialism. According to the Japan Credit Counselling Association, consumers in their 20s accounted for 49 per cent of assistance given in 1990. Credit extended to Japanese consumers during 1991 through consumer loans and credit card purchases totalled an estimated Y65,600bn, (Pounds 280bn) three times higher than 10 years ago. Credit card companies have yet to reach agreement with the government on methods of implementing stricter checks on credit information. Japanese vehicle sales fell in May for the 13th month in succession, compounding fears that the end of the recession is not yet in sight for the hard-pressed Japanese motor industry, Stefan Wagstyl writes. Sales dropped 12.3 per cent from a year before, the biggest decline since 1984. The decline was particularly severe for small passenger cars, for which sales fell 19.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Fears grow over coal job cuts MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, trade and industry secretary, met Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday amid growing government worries over the economic effect of massive job cuts in the coal industry. The forthcoming privatisation of British Coal will be accompanied by about 30,000 job losses and pressure is mounting from local MPs to cushion the impact of what is likely to be the most severe employment cut yet in a state-owned concern. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister who will handle the privatisation, was also at the meeting. The shrinkage of British Coal to a commercially viable size will devastate areas of north-east England where there are virtually no other sources of employment. However, the government's determination to curb public spending in the wake of sterling's devaluation appears to have shut off the alternatives of postponing the privatisation or subsidising pits to keep them in operation. There is a possibility of small amounts of EC money to help coal communities. The government still plans to introduce a British Coal privatisation bill, probably by November, to keep to the timetable of auctioning British Coal next year. It also intends to press ahead regardless of whether new coal-based electricity contracts are agreed in the coming weeks.</p>

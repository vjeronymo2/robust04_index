			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (INA) -- Foreign Minister Muhammad  Sa'id al-Sahhaf, head of the Iraqi delegation to the meetings of  the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], met here today with Yemeni  Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah.    Basindwah explained to al-Sahhaf the plots being hatched  against Yemen's unity with the aim of undermining the people's  achievements.    The Yemeni minister stressed his country's rejection of any  interference in its domestic affairs by any party because what  is happening in Yemen is an internal affair and because the  legitimate authority and the people are determined to preserve  unity and to side with the constitutional government to foil the  objectives of the separatists.    For his part, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf reiterated Iraq's  firm  position in support of the legitimate government in fraternal  Yemen and preserving its unity.    During the meeting, they also discussed the current Arab  situation, ways of enhancing joint Arab action, and the items on  the agenda of the nonaligned meeting in Cairo.    The meeting was attended by Dr. Nabil Najm, Iraq's permanent  envoy to the Arab League.</p>

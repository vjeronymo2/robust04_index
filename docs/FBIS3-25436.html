			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] With the exception of the Mozambique People's  Progress Party [PPPM], which gave a short reply, and other  parties, which did not bother to reply our questionnaire, the  foreign policy favored by the three parties -- the Mozambican  Nationalist Movement [Monamo], the Mozambican National Union  [Unamo], and the Mozambique Democratic Party [Pademo] -- is more  or less the same and, curiously, coincides with the foreign  policy of the ruling party, the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo].    Basically, what the three parties favor is a policy of  cooperation with all countries in the world on the basis of  respect for the sovereignty of each country, respect and  noninterference in internal affairs of each country. What  differs, apparently, are the priorities to be taken into  account. Some consider cooperation with the five  Portuguese-speaking African countries to be a priority, while  others give priority to regional cooperation.    This theme -- foreign policy -- is the last part of the list  of questions that DOMINGO sent to registered political parties,  excluding Frelimo.    We had formulated our question in the following manner: a)  What are the priorities in a political relationship? b) What  are the strategies to reduce (or eliminate) foreign debt? c)  What is your assessment of the Nongovernmental Organizations  [NGOs]? d)What regional integration projects--the Southern  African Development Community [SADC] and the Common Market for  Eastern and Southern Africa [Comesa]--do support? e) Of the  economic, social, and cultural exchange policies, what are the  priorities? f) Is there a need to join the Commonwealth? And  finally, g) What are the criteria to choose the best economic  partner?  <H5>  Monamo </H5>   In international relations, priority will be given to  respect  for the treaties and protocols signed with the Mozambican State.    Monamo/PMSD will strengthen further international relations  with neighboring countries and developed countries that have  been economically assisting and expressing solidarity with  Mozambique.    Foreign Debt: This is a burden that the country will have to  reduce through increased productivity and export of surplus  produce or essentials, such as the Cahora Bassa power supply,  transportation to landlocked countries, mining, timber, prawns,  and so on.    The foreign debt should be renegotiable and capable of being  canceled, with a safe and feasible repayment policy.    The NGO's will have to be studied case by case to understand  their specific work and assess its national interest.  Monamo/PMSD's attitude regarding NGO's is however to recognize  their solidarity gesture.    d) [as published] Regarding the policy of regional economic  integration, we feel that, before integration, we have to  organize our own house so that the country can benefit from the  institutional advantages of economic integration. It is first  necessary to achieve internal stability so that we can have a  true integration and not just copy what we see happening in  other parts of the world.    e) Regarding the policy of economic, social, and cultural  exchange, this will depend on the degree of relationship. It  should not be a political choice but an exchange based on  advantages obtained therefrom.    Monamo/PMSD will be governed by pragmatic principles,  without  forgetting the natural cultural, lingusitic, and economic  interdependence.    Fortunately, the country, under a social-democratic  government led by Monamo, will not be tied to ideological or  political interests, but national interests, respecting  diplomatic and international principles.  <H5>  Unamo </H5>   Foreign Policy a) Establishment of amicable relations with  all southern African countries, Portuguese-speaking countries,  African countries, and other countries in the world in general,  on the basis of mutual respect for each state, noninterference  in the internal affairs, and mutual benefit.    b) We have a potentially rich country. By granting  investment facilities to nationals, it would be easy to reduce  the foreign debt. This has not been possible because the policy  on the country's production and development followed by the  government over the past 18 years was disastrous.    c) NGO's are welcome because they assisted the Mozambican  people during the 18 disastrous years under the ruling  Government. They can continue in the country, assisting the  Mozambican people in other fields for the country's speedy  reconstruction and development.    d) As is the case of the EEC in Europe, a similar  organization in Southern Africa would be beneficial. This will  depend on the development of the Comesa and SADC however.    e) The policy of economic, social, and cultural exchange,  should be geared first to the countries of the region,  Portuguese-speaking countries, Western countries, and -- taking  into account current changes -- former East European countries,  as well as Nonaligned countries, depending on these countries'  interest.    f) Since Mozambique is a now a democratic country, based on  the rule of law, there is every interest to remove the country  from its current misery. Thus, if the Commonwealth expresses  interest, we shall certainly join it.    g) All countries that want to invest in the country are  welcome, provided they have good humanitarian intentions. There  is a need to respect national policy, because we shall not  accept the country's monopoly in the benefit of foreign  interests. Thus, we are open to countries like Italy and  others, as long as they respect the principles mentioned above.    [Text]  <H5>  Pademo </H5>   Pademo favors a foreign policy of national independence,  solidarity, and cooperation with all countries in the world.  Cooperation and international relations should be extended to  diplomatic, economic, scientific, and cultural fields, among  others.    The principle of mutual respect among peoples and national  sovereignty, as well as equality among sovereign States, is  fundamental for relations and international cooperation. These  two fields are interdependent and their development demand the  centralization of defined tasks. The noninterference in the  internal affairs of other States defended by our party include  the rejection of the use of economic and military power to  impose on other countries a political and social system, against  the wish of the majority of their people.    The development of relations with all countries worldwide  will be promoted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and  International Cooperation. The present Higher Institute for  International Relations and the School of Journalism should be  transformed into an academic and technical institute. The  resulting institution should be similar to "business schools"  existing in other countries.    Pademo is aware of the deep historical links which exist  with  Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking African countries. With  these countries, we favor special relations on the basis of  mutual and balanced interests. Pademo also favors the  continuation of existing relations with Latin American countries  with which our country signed different kinds of accords, within  the framework of world solidarity and promotion of technical and  scientific development in Mozambique.    The party respects principles contained in the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter and advocates the  adoption of a foreign policy which favors peace and views  negotiations as the best form to resolve international conflicts.    In brief, the policy defended by Pademo in the field of  international relations and cooperation, is aimed at achieving  and promoting the following objectives:     -  Promotion and defense of national interests.    -  Promotion of human solidarity and mutual respect among  peoples  and nations.    -  Promotion of international cooperation to consolidate  universal  peace and eliminate discrimination in all its forms.    -  Respect for the international law and obligations in  treaties,  as well as the solution of international disputes, through  negotiatioon, mediation, reconciliation, arbitration, and  adjudication.    -  Promotion of a new more just world economic order which will  allow less developed countries to find acceptable solutions for  problems facing their peoples.   <H5>    Defense of African Unit and Regional Economic Organizations: </H5>   The OAU, based in Addis Ababa, played an important role in  the struggle for political independence of many African  countries, including our country. The assistance given by this  organization to liberation movements, mainly based in Tanzania,  is unparalleled.    During the present moment, the struggle for political  independence is almost over and most African countries are  carrying out internal reforms to democratize their societies.  Conscious of the historical responsibilities of the OAU, Pademo  supports the role of this organization in its struggle for the  economic independence of the continent. This constitutes a new  phase of struggle for the emancipation of Africans.    It was on the basis of resolutions and recommendations by  the  OAU heads of state, particularly in the Lagos Plan of Action,  that regional organizations, such as Southern African  Development Coordination Conference [SADCC], the Preferential  Trade Area [PTA], and others were born. The aim was for African  countries to form firm fronts of struggle for economic,  scientific, and social development. Our party support for these  organizations is unconditional. It is our hope that through  these organizations, we shall be able to reduce the gap of  inequality in various fields between our continent and other  continents.    The objectives defined by African leaders for the promotion  of cooperation between African countries, have not had the  desired effect, because of lack of implementation of approved  decisions. It is not only because of lack of means that  regional projects are not being implemented. Thus, Pademo  recommends the adoption of new attitudes in economic,  scientific, and other kind of cooperation among African  countries.    United Nations: The United Nations is an organ that  includes most of the world's independent countries. It is made  up of various agencies that specialize in various areas. Its  principal aims are to promote well-being, justice, and peace in  the world.    Our party's pacifist policy faithfully and actively supports  the resolutions made democratically by UN organs with a view to  a peaceful settlement of problems among nations.    By the same token, the party advocates:     -  A policy of neutrality;    -  Promoting and upholding the policy of nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons;    -  Eliminating all kinds of mass extermination weapons;    -  Promoting a policy of noninterference in the internal affairs  of other countries;    -  Promoting a good neighborliness policy.       b) [as published] Only by seeking greater efficiency will it  be possible to make sound use of the debts we assume, or they  will never benefit the Mozambican people. Debts must be  assumed, but in a planned manner. It is not possible to avoid  them.    c) The nongovernmental organizations [NGO's] must operate in  this country in a well planned manner, without interfering with  the work of the state and without conflicting interests among  themselves. Coordination between NGO's and the state shall  always be recommended and the executive must create mechanisms  for that purpose.    d) It is important that the aims and the nature of Southern  African Development Community, SADC, and the "contested" Comesa  within the southern African context. Some actions by those  organizations suggest their aims are political rather than  economic. Pademo recommends a cautious approach by those  organizations and it believes that true economic integration  will only be possible with the reduction of development  imbalances in the various countries that are members of those  organizations. However, membership in those organizations is  important and operational mechanisms must be treated with  caution.    e) Annex c) answers this question.    f) Pademo does not see the need for Mozambique to integrate  the Commonwealth, just as it sees no need for it to become part  of the Organization of Islamic Countries. We believe those were  opportunistic moves by the Frelimo government in a bid to secure  support from countries that are members of those organizations.    g) Criteria for choosing economic partners will depend on  the  country's economic climate. However, our party does not exclude  economic cooperation with any country, as long as it also  includes economic advantages for this country. Moreover, Pademo  believes cooperation should be as diversified as possible to  prevent complete dependence on a single economic, scientific, or  technical partner. In regard to the advantages of cooperation at  large, it is important to note that Pademo believes Italy has  played a very important role in our country's political and  economic life. We should not blame foreigners alone if the  things that are built do not work. It is an open secret that  one of our society's major problems has to do with project  management.    To the Mozambique People's Progress Party, PPPM, "the  concrete strategy for pulling the country out of its economic  chaos, achieving social progress, and pursuing a foreign policy  is to introduce federalism, meaning political decentralization  comprising statutory, basic legislative, and general political  powers, in addition to administrative, economic, and financial  autonomy."

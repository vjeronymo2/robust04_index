			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Directors' pay If institutional shareholders want to end the sort of compensation package Reed Elsevier agreed with Mr Peter Davis, they will have to do more than call for the abolition of three-year rolling contracts. It is hard to judge what difference it would have made had Mr Davis been on only a two-year contract. But since the bulk of the Pounds 2m settlement consists of enhanced pension entitlements for two years, it is safe to assume not much. The award is by no means the most extreme example of corporate largesse in recent years and few would deny that Reed's shareholders have been handsomely rewarded during Mr Davis' stay. The company says that this was reflected in the size of the settlement as were the chances of his getting another job. Perhaps in an ideal world, executives would have contracts which paid out only until they found another post. But this is widely considered impractical if only because it provides them with no incentive. It should, however, be possible to link compensation more explicitly with performance. Unless companies get tougher in negotiating severance terms on an executive's departure, there will be increasing calls for contracts to be a maximum of one year. Such a move would be fiercely resisted by companies. Handsome pay-offs can be a convenient way of keeping disgruntled former directors quiet. But it would be hard to convince investors that paying hush money was in their interests.</p>

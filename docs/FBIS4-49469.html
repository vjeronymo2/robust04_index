			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 5 (CNA) -- The remarks by a Japanese  cabinet member that the "rape of Nanking" was a "fabrication"  and that Japan was not an aggressor in World War II triggered  indignation and protests across Taiwan Thursday [5 May].    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commenting on Japanese  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's remarks made in an interview  published in the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Wednesday, said the Republic  of China [ROC] Government "feels sorry and is indignant" about  the remarks.    "We strongly protest against what Nagano said about the  massacre in Nanking, which is an apparent distortion of history  and has abused the feelings of all Chinese," the ministry said  in a statement.    In the quoted remarks, Nagano said Japan's aim during the  war  was to free Asian nations from European colonialism. "It is  wrong to say the war was a war of aggression," he was quoted as  saying. "We thought seriously about the liberation of colonies,  to liberate a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."    Li Shou-kong, a retired professor in contemporary history at  National Taiwan University, said the 1937 Nanjing massacre, in  which at least 300,000 residents in the southern Chinese city  were slaughtered, was a fact that could not be denied or  whitewashed. "The only part of the tragedy that remains open to  speculation is the number of the residents actually killed," Li  added.    "As a matter of fact, the Japanese militarists killed and  sexually abused the innocent victims in China not only in  Nanking but widely and predatorily in many parts of the  country," he said.    Japan whipped up a wave of anger in Taiwan, Mainland China,  Korea, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia some 10 years ago by  whitewashing in student textbooks its aggression in World War  II. After that incident, the Japanese Education Ministry sent  two officials to Taiwan to make apologies, Li said.    Meanwhile, Kuomintang [KMT] legislators, at an emergency  interpellation session, demanded that Japan make public once  again the truths surrounding the massacre in Nanking and Japan's  behavior in Mainland China and other parts of Asia during the  war. They also demanded an explanation for Nagano's remarks.    KMT legislator Wei Young called for close attention to be  paid to the positions of new-generation Japanese politicians and  their attempts at historical revisionism. He claimed that  Nagano's statement on the issue was not an isolated incident.    Wei refuted Nagano's remarks about Japan's intention to  liberate a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as "absolutely  unjustifiable."    He said Taiwan should demand across-the-board war  reparations  from Japan.</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Thailand (3): Watchdog to the rescue - Reforms continue on the Thai stock market / Thailand's stock market now has more appeal for hard-headed realists Mr Ekamol Kiriwat, the forceful head of Thailand's 18-month-old Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), finds a robust good humour useful - 'recently I tried to explain what 'disclosure' means to some big players. They obviously thought I was quite mad]' he says with relish. Yet the bark of Mr Ekamol's 18-month-old watchdog has clearly helped foreign and institutional investors concentrate more on underlying value than on the insider knowledge and share-ramping that used to be the driving force in share trading. At the beginning of the 1990s a consensus emerged among government regulators, including the Bank of Thailand (the central bank), and institutional investors that the Thai stock market's traditional shenanigans could no longer be tolerated. It was agreed the market needed to be less fun for privileged insiders and more appealing to hard-headed realists, both at home and abroad. Mr Ekamol likes to point out that in a country with a chronic capital shortage, 'it's a privilege for anyone to get capital, to get scarce money. That's why I want to be very straight on the stock market and the debt market - I believe in real finance.' After enduring predictable 'paper tiger' jibes, the SEC pounced on three groups of alleged share manipulators in late 1992 and early 1993. Although there is no sign that anyone will be convicted soon, the move quickly deflated a speculative market to the horror of many individual investors. A tentative revival of optimism towards the middle of the year was squashed by unexpectedly bad second quarter corporate earnings. But, buoyed by continued strong economic growth, investors regained their nerve as the second half of the year progressed. Towards the end of September, the momentum suddenly gathered pace as foreign institutions, some of whom had never given Thailand a second look, started buying Asia and the Stock Exchange of Thailand index proceeded to romp through all previous records. From the beginning of October to mid-November, the SET index surged by 38 per cent, easily outstripping rival markets in the region during the period despite having the worst expected earnings growth figures for 1993 (4 per cent - or minus 10 per cent excluding the profitable banking sector - compared with Singapore's 14 per cent and Hong Kong's 19 per cent earnings growth). Mr Peter Emblin, the investment vice-president of local fund managers One-Investment Management, said: 'Prices have been driven by falling interest rates so far. I think the market's now waiting to see if corporate earnings can pick up as we go into 1994 after which there could be a second lift to prices.' SBCI's director of South-East Asia Research, Mr Edward Lamond, believes Thailand's stock market is at about the same stage of development as Hongkong was in the early 1970s - when some price-earnings ratios spiked at 90 before collapsing to 20. During November the average p/e for the Thai market was in the low 20s, but Mr Lamond says ratios could rise to 40 or 50 before subsiding suddenly. 'P/es may have been trying to move way out in 1991 before they were cut back by Saddam Hussein. This (rise and crash) is a very chastening experience for a developing economy,' he warned. Institutional investor appetite for Thai shares notwithstanding, there remains a dearth of large, cleanly-run companies in which to invest. When pressed to name 'good value' companies, analysts are wont to bring up names such as The Pizza Company, holder of the Pizza Hut franchise: a good 'buy' no doubt, but with hardly enough share capital to satisfy foreign fund managers. International investors tend to shy away from some of the big counters that do exist such as Bangkok Land and the local flagship of the sprawling Chearavanont family empire, CP Feedmill, whose relatively opaque managements make analysts suspicious. Even newly-privatised Thai Airways International's forecasts have been far too optimistic. There are, however, plenty of large companies coming to the market for finance. Foreigners over-subscribed 17 times for the tranche of TelecomAsia alloted to them, and the shares should start trading mid-December. Although part of the CP empire - and perhaps overpriced - TelecomAsia is in a potentially lucrative sector and holds a concession to install two million desperately needed telephones in Bangkok. Also arriving soon - and providing a change from the old staples of the Bangkok market such as banks, cement companies and property developers - are telecommunications companies Loxley and UCOM, a soon-to-be-privatised subsidiary of the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, and National Petrochemical Corp. The biggest technical issue still facing foreign investors are the limits placed on foreign ownership of listed companies. Officials' ideas for circumventing these legally - by so-called Mexican trusts, for example - have yet to bear fruit. But there is still plenty of local money waiting to get into the market when the time is right. Mr Rob Collins, research director of Asia Equity, says newly-established local mutual funds have raised Bt35bn which has yet to be placed. Some admire the Thai market because it is not as highly regulated as Singapore and has liquidity that puts it ahead of Taiwan and South Korea, but critics say the SEC has only scratched the surface of the wrongdoing that continues to undermine the SET. The head of one foreign broking house in Bangkok said: 'The SEC has stopped the utterly outrageous things like the huge share ramps, and the relentless churning that went on. But a lot of monkey business goes on which will have to be dealt with soon.'</p>

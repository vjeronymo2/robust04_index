			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S PLANE TO SEE WHY MATH STUDENTS ARE CHAMPIONS  </P> <P> The problem was fairly easy for Arthur Nam, a 17-year-old geometry student at  Warren High School in Downey.  </P> <P> "A plane 15 centimeters from the center of a sphere cuts the sphere in a circle  of radius 8 centimeters. Find the diameter of the sphere."  </P> <P> Thirty-four centimeters, of course.  </P> <P> Nam answered that problem and 28 others correctly -- he missed only one -- to  lead Warren High to victory in the geometry division of the 1989 National  Mathematics League competition. More than 430 schools from across the country  entered the geometry division, said league director Diane Riley, who released  the final results.  </P> <P> "Personally, this competition was easy," said Nam, who one day would like to be  a researcher or a professor.  </P> <P> But the first-place finish was no mean feat, according to Riley. The contest  problems are more advanced than those that would be presented in the average  high school geometry course, she said. The league, an organization of math  teachers, has run the contest for the last six years to stimulate interest in  mathematics. "The schools that participate are the top schools in the country,"  she said.  </P> <P> The competition consisted of five, 30-minute tests, with six geometry problems  per test. It was given by teachers and administrators at participating high  schools. School personnel used answer keys to grade the tests, and then  reported the scores to the National Mathematics League. The top five scores in  each round represent a school's overall score. The league relies on an honor  system, counting on school officials to report accurate scores.  </P> <P> Twenty-eight Warren High students had perfect scores on the first test, but so  did at least five students from 72 other schools. Warren and South Pasadena  High were tied for first place with perfect scores after the second round,  according to the league.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leading After 3 Rounds  </P> <P> The Warren High students had a rougher time with the third test. The top five  scorers missed four problems for a combined mark of 26 points out of a possible  30. Nevertheless, Warren High held the lead after three rounds. Vestavia Hills  High of Birmingham, Ala., and Grissom High of Huntsville, Ala., were in second  and third places.  </P> <P> One of the two problems Jane Kang missed during the competition was on the  third test. She is Warren's second-highest scorer.  </P> <P> "They test your thinking. You have to think about everything you learned and  gather data," said Kang, a 16-year-old who says she plans to study science in  college.  </P> <P> Warren was one of four schools with perfect scores in the fourth round. At that  point, Vestavia, last year's geometry division winner, was in second place  trailing by four points. Warren sealed the victory when its top five scorers  correctly answered all the problems on the fifth test. Runner-up Vestavia also  had a perfect score on the last test. Stevenson High of Prairie View, Ill.,  came in third, with Grissom High and Berkeley Preparatory School of Tampa,  Fla., tied for fourth place.  </P> <P> Six students finished with perfect scores, while five, including Nam, missed  only one. Riley estimated that more than 10,000 students of different ages  participated in the geometry competition. To compete, a student must be  enrolled in a geometry class.  </P> <P> Warren will receive a plaque for the victory and the top students will receive  ribbons. It was the first time the Downey school participated in the  competition, said Dianne Camacho, Downey Unified School District's mentor math  teacher.  </P> <P> About 100 Warren High students took one or all of the tests, she said.  </P> <P> Camacho, who teaches honors geometry and other math courses, said she was proud  of the students for winning. But perhaps more important, Camacho said, was that  the competition enabled her to further sharpen her students' skills.  </P> <P> "After the exam, I put the (missed) question on the board and said 'What would  you do?' " Camacho said. "Sometimes they'd say: 'That's easy. Why didn't I  think of that?' "  </P> <P> Camacho attributed the school's success to hard work by instructors and  students in their math classes. The students had no school-organized  preparation outside of class, she said.  </P> <P> Camacho also credited a testing program, in which the district has participated  for the past five years. The program, offered through the University of  California and the California State University and Colleges system, uses  testing to identify students' weaknesses and enable teachers to provide better  instruction.  </P> <P> "I think it's helped us a lot," Camacho said.  </P> <P> Nam said he benefitted from outside math work with his father, a physicist who  would make up problems for his son. He also said he was helped by years of  schooling in Korea, where advanced math is taught at an earlier age than it is  in the United States.  </P> <P> "By the time you go to high school you're in calculus," Nam said.  </P> <P> Warren's top scorers had something else in common -- they said they enjoy math.  </P> <P> "Math is challenging," said Chang Kim, 14, who missed three problems during the  competition. Kim said she also studies math on her own. She wants to be a  doctor.  </P> <P> Warren High also participated in the National Mathematics League's math  analysis division, which required students to work 30 problems over five tests.  The school finished 14th among 269 schools that entered the division, Riley  said. Twenty-five students participated, Camacho said.  </P> <P> In addition to geometry and math analysis, the league stages competitions in  sixth-grade math, pre-algebra, algebra I and algebra II.  </P> <P> "I think next year we're going to try to (participate) in all the levels if we  can," Camacho said.  </P> <P> The Downey Unified School District has been working to improve its math program  in recent years. It began offering advanced placement calculus three years ago.  Twenty-two district students took calculus during the 1986-87 school year. Last  year, 27 students took calculus, and this year, 32 students are enrolled,  Camacho said.  </P></p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): A new home on the range - In A Nutshell Fed up with paying auditors' fees? One answer could be to register your business as a US limited liability company, according to Robert Coleman of International Corporate Compliance.* Registration under company legislation in the state of Wyoming does not involve a company paying US taxes, provided it has no US shareholders and does not do business in the US, but it does avoid the need for a UK (and a US) audit. Companies must still file accounts with Companies' House and a bank can still register a charge against the business so US registration is not a way to escape the scrutiny of UK creditors. Nor is it a tax fiddle, says Coleman. International Corporate Compliance, itself a US limited liability company, is run by Coleman and David Sinclair, both accountants. It has had about 25 clients, including companies in the fields of financial services, property development and engineering, seeking US registration since launching its service at the end of last year. Basic registration and one year's charges cost Pounds 390 plus VAT. *404-406 Finchley Road, London NW2 2HR. Tel 071 794 6600.</p>

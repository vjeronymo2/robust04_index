			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / ITV Council chairman chosen MR LESLIE HILL, chairman and chief executive of Central Independent Television, has been elected to succeed Mr Greg Dyke of London Weekend Television as chairman of the ITV Council. His appointment comes after suggestions from companies such as HTV and Meridian that an outsider should be appointed. In the end Mr Hill, who has been associated with the campaign for a smaller number of more powerful ITV companies, was elected unanimously to the chairmanship of the trade association. He and other industry executives will today meet Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to discuss maximising the potential for exporting programmes. The Independent Television Commission emphasised yesterday that of the 131 expressions of interest received about Channel 5 and the future of digital television, just 76 referred specifically to the options for Channel 5.</p>

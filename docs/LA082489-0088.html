			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> CHANGE IN EMISSION RULES ASKED FOR TRASH INCINERATOR  </P> <P> Long Beach needs to change the operation rules for its trash incineration plant  or face continued violations for nitrogen oxide emissions, a major component of  smog, a city official said.  </P> <P> The city has asked the South Coast Air Quality Management District to change  its rules so that nitrogen oxide emissions from the Southeast Resource Recovery  Facility will be averaged over an hour instead of every 15 minutes.  </P> <P> That way, the city could avoid being cited or fined for occasional short  durations of nitrogen oxide emissions because plant operators would have a  longer period to return the plant to normal operations, city Solid Waste  Manager Bill Davis said.  </P> <P> Otherwise, Davis told the City Council, the plant is expected to exceed its  maximum allowable output of nitrogen oxide about once every 10 days. The  builder of the plant, Dravo Corp., could be held financially liable if the  plant fails to meet pollution standards, he said.  </P> <P> The high-tech plant on Terminal Island burns trash to produce electricity.  Council members hailed the $100-million plant as helping protect the city from  a landfill crisis that is expected to affect all cities in Southern California  over the next few years.  </P> <P> Davis said the bursts of nitrogen oxide are produced by surges of temperature  in the plant's furnace. Also, the plant's nitrogen oxide emissions rise when it  burns nitrogen-rich grass clippings or tree trimmings.  </P></p>

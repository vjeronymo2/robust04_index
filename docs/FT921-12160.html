			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Still waiting for the revolution: The difficult relaunch of the Citizen's Charter When the prime minister, Mr John Major, launched his Citizen's Charter in March 1991, he said that its aim was to improve 'every part of the public services'. Standards would be set out in 'clear contracts of service - contracts which mean something'. There would be 'financial sanctions, (with) direct compensation to the public or loss to the budgets of those that fall down on the job'. This was Mr Major's big idea, and it represented a distinctive break with the policies of his predecessor. Mrs Thatcher appeared to believe that public services should provide a basic service for people who could not afford to pay their own way. But yesterday's bullish relaunch of the Charter cannot conceal the difficulties which have been encountered in turning the idea into reality. Certainly there has been considerable activity since detailed plans were set out in last July's white paper on the Citizen's Charter. One highly visible result has been a flood of charters, covering everyone from benefits claimants to users of the Scottish courts. Another is that more public servants are wearing name badges, a measure which Mr Francis Maude, the Treasury minister in charge of the Citizen's Charter, believes will make a profound difference to the quality of service. 'Being identified makes people behave differently,' he says. 'The individual can't shelter behind the anonymity of the machine.' There are measures in the legislative pipeline which will strengthen the powers of regulators to set service standards for the privatised utilities. And the government has tabled plans for more performance-related pay for people working in the public service. But the success of the Charter will be measured by its achievements in the core public services which are widely seen to have declined in recent years: the three 'Ps' of parents, patients and passengers. Charters have already been published covering the first two, but they demonstrate the difficulty in satisfying the prime minister's desire to provide clear contracts of service which mean something. Seven of the 10 points in the Patient's Charter, for example, restate existing entitlements of limited appeal, such as to be registered with a GP or to be kept informed of treatment. The only significant new guarantee is that from April 1992 no patient will have to wait longer than two years for an operation once he or she has seen a consultant. However, there is no time limit on the delay before seeing a consultant (this can be six months or more). Worse, recent figures on NHS waiting lists suggest that the two-year guarantee is lengthening the delays for operations where waiting times are less than one year. Those involved in the Charter point out that this is only the first step in a process of changing the culture of the health service, so that its priorities are set by the customers rather than those working in it. The Charters will be revised regularly, ratcheting up the standards year by year  -so that, for example, the maximum waiting time for an operation will soon be reduced from two years to 18 months, with further reductions later. But at some point, providing acceptable levels of service will almost certainly need extra resources, a point that ministers are reluctant to concede. The delay in producing the third of the three Ps - a Passenger's Charter for British Rail customers - reveals the difficulties in meeting Mr Major's aim of financial sanctions when charter pledges are not honoured. Promised for last autumn, the Passenger's Charter has become bogged down in the difficulty of finding money to fund the scheme. The Treasury is not going to underwrite it: that would rather defeat the point. But if BR has to find the money from its own resources, it must come from lower investment or higher fares - in either case, rebounding on the people it is intended to help. Instead, therefore, the emphasis will be placed on prevention rather than cure. Thus, on Network SouthEast - the most troublesome part of the railway  -the plan is to give each of the 15 principal routes an individual, achievable target for punctuality and reliability, and to give commuters a discount on the cost of renewing their season tickets if the targets are not met. Each line's performance will be measured as a moving average, so that managers can counteract any downward blip with a big effort to restore performance. People making individual journeys may be disappointed to find that compensation is no more generous than the semi-secret system operating already, except that it will be more open and less arbitrary. The only significant difference is likely to be the introduction of a self-financing scheme allowing people to buy entitlement to superior compensation rights by paying a premium in the form of a reservation fee. Ministers acknowledge that one reason for the difficulty in agreeing an acceptable Passenger's Charter is that the government does not control BR in the same way as it does the health service. The same absence of control has led to similar difficulties in applying the principles of the Charter to local authorities which are responsible for delivering many public services. For example, it had been hoped to use the charter mark seal of approval as an incentive for local authorities to improve the quality of their services. The very limited charter mark scheme announced yesterday is unable to fulfil this role, partly because ministers realised that they simply did not have enough information to make it work. Ministers are also conscious that a consumer satisfaction sanction exists already: what incentive is a government seal of approval compared with the prospect of re-election? The engine for change in local services is now seen as the new powers and duties of the Audit Commission, the local government watchdog. It will be able to specify performance indicators and produce league tables to identify good and bad performers. However, the Commission estimates that it will need probably five indicators, such as value for money and the amount of service provided, for as many as 40 service areas. A limited range of 'bell-wether' statistics could be chosen as key indicators, but that would encourage different interests to pick their favourite statistics from the information available. The system could become incomprehensible to the people it was intended to benefit. Whatever the sophistication of the indicators, there are still difficulties in comparing the effectiveness of services. How, for example, can fair comparisons be made between a council which provides high-quality nursery education for a few children and one that provides it for almost every child but does so less well? Other problems in making the Citizen's Charter work have resulted from the inclusion of bright ideas in the white paper which have proved difficult to implement. For example, little progress has been made so far on plans to set up a network of local lay adjudicators to deal informally with complaints over public service failures. A consultation paper on the idea, promised before the end of 1991, has yet to appear because of two problems: the multiplicity of existing compensation schemes for the public service - many of them statutory and not therefore easy to subsume in a uniform lay adjudicator scheme; the resistance of the Treasury to funding a scheme - even a simple free telephone number which could provide complainants with information of the channels for complaint. When the consultation paper does emerge, the scheme will be all 'lay' and no 'adjudicator', as one insider puts it. The likelihood is that the scheme will amount to little more than a network of local worthies who point disgruntled consumers of public services towards the appropriate channels. Perhaps this is not surprising, given the experimental nature of much of what the government is doing. 'We are on a voyage of discovery into uncharted waters,' says Mr Maude. 'No government has tried to do anything like this before, and it is inevitably a process of evolution.' But the achievements of the first six months since the Citizen's Charter white paper was published must be judged against the prospectus set out by Mr Major when he first launched the idea. Apart from a lot of paper, it is hard to see much which could not have been achieved without a Charter. It certainly does not yet amount to a revolution in the public services which puts the consumer in the driving seat.</p>

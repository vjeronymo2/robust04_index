			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Balladur advocates EU defence white paper The European Union should produce a white paper on defence to define 'precisely' its security interests and how to defend them in conjunction with Nato, the French prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, proposed yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris. Expanding on the vision of a multi-speed Europe that he unveiled earlier this week, the prime minister made clear at a meeting with French ambassadors that such a defence white paper should be prepared by EU governments in contrast to the economic white paper drafted last year by Mr Jacques Delors' European Commission. Mr Balladur's proposal seems to stem from disappointment that the defence white paper which his government produced earlier this year, and which committed France to maintaining military spending in the 1995-2000 period, has not evoked any matching commitments or ambitions from France's EU partners. At the same meeting, Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, called yesterday for big changes in EU institutions at the planned 1996 revision of the Maastricht treaty. 'For France', he said, 'it is a question of a significant reform, not a simple re-plastering job.' The government's foreign policy pronouncements are designed to signal France's ambitions for its EU presidency in the first half of next year. However, they drew a sharp reaction from President Francois Mitterrand who tartly reminded the prime minister that the French constitution gives the president the first word in foreign and defence policy.</p>

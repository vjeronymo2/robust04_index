			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> REPUTED DRUG CARTEL MEMBER ARRAIGNED  </P> <P> The reputed No. 3 man in Colombia's Cali drug cartel was arraigned in a Miami  prison under tight security for fear fellow cocaine traffickers might try to  free him, federal officials said. The Cali cartel -- a rival to the  better-known Medellin cocaine cartel -- operates out of the city of Cali and  has grabbed a growing share of Colombia's drug trade, Drug Enforcement  Administration officials said. Luis Santacruz Echeverri, 35, was arraigned by  U.S. Magistrate Samuel Smargon in a prison administrative office at the federal  Metropolitan Correctional Center. Santacruz was indicted June 14 on 14 counts  of cocaine possession and distribution in the seizure in July, 1987, of 2 1/2  tons of cocaine. Santacruz pleaded innocent at the arraignment. No trial date  has been set.  </P></p>

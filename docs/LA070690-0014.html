			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Cruise Races to Radio: Tom Cruise has gone from the racetrack to the radio to  hype his "Days of Thunder" film, which is doing less-than-zooming business at  the box office.  </P> <P> Cruise visited KIIS-AM (1150) and KIIS-FM (102.7) morning personality Rick Dees  for an hour Thursday in what was apparently his only local radio interview. The  actor told Dees that he liked Maria McKee, Melissa Etheridge, the Rolling  Stones, AC/DC and Technotronic's "Pump Up the Volume." Cruise also said he  considers "Days of Thunder" a huge hit already. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by B.Ya. Shteynberg, Computer Center at Rostov </F> University; UDC 681.124.2]    [Abstract] For optimizing the reallocation of  two-dimensional arrays in a supercomputer memory, algorithms are  constructed which minimize the number of simultaneous data  transfers for executing nests of cycles such as transposition of  a matrix. The memory is assumed to consist of p segments so that  p simultaneous data acquisitions or p simultaneous data  retrievals are possible, program fragments being considered here  which contain arrays with indices linearly dependent on the  cycle counters I and J. The reallocation problem is thus reduced  to synthesis of a parallel algorithm for fastest execution of  the two-dimensional cycle DO 1 J = 0,N    DO 1 I = 0,M 1 Y(I,J) =  Y(I,J)= X(a*I + b*J + c, a1*I + b1*J + c1) involving two  orthogonally disposed arrays Y and X. It must be kept in mind  here that, unlike distribution of data, allocation of data does  not indicate into which cell J of a memory segment a given array  element I will move. The problem is solved for N= M= p- 1 and  two specific cases. The first case is a fully accessible  commutator with p inputs and p outputs which can be connected to  one another, the simplest one being such a commutator where at  some instant of time one input can be connected to only one  output, while simultaneously another input can be connected to  another output. The second case is a ring network facilitating  simultaneous transfers but only those which correspond to cyclic  shifts, namely permutations _s_ such that (_s_[.sub]i[/]- i)  mod p = _s_[.sub]j[/] mod p for any i,j in respective 1,...,p  sets. The reallocation algorithms involve deparallelization of  cycles and are validated by three lemmas: 1) when a,b,p are  natural numbers, then there exists a number t such that GCD(a +  t*b,p)= GCD.(a,b,p)= 1; 2) when a,b,c are integers, then t can  be any number in the set of integers; 3) for any integers b and  p there exist integers t and s such that t*b + s*p= GCD(b,p) and  t is the reciprocal of p (GCD - greatest common divisor).  Following rigorous proofs of these lemmas, respective algorithms  are applied to reallocation of an array in a multiprocessor  computer system with either a universal commutator or with a  ring network. Theorems are then proved, with the aid of an  appropriate fourth lemma each, which define the least number of  transfers necessary for simultaneously executing a nest of  cycles DO 1 L = 0,p- 1 1  A(u*I + v, u1*I + v1)= B(a*I + b, a1*I + b1) over a universal  commutator and over ring network respectively. This number is  p*d in the first case with d= GCD(a,b,p) and p or  p[.sup]2[/]/q in the second case, q being the largest divisor  of c/GCD(a,b,c)= GCD(a,b,c)/b and each transfer being a shift.  Transposition of a two-dimensional p-order matrix p in  accordance with the appropriate algorithm is demonstrated on a  binary cycle DO 1 J = 0,p-1    DO 1 I= 0,p-1 1 Y(I,J) =  X(J,I) equivalent to a DO 1 L = 0,p-1    DO 1 I = 0,p-1 1  Y((I,(I+L) mod p) = X((I+L) mod p,I) cycle.

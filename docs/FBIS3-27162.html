The visit comes only one day after the expiry of a NATO  ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw or put under UN  control all their heavy weapons in Sarajevo, or face NATO air  strikes, which were deemed as unnecessary by NATO and UN  officials "for the time being."    Accompanying Silajdzic will be Bosnian Parliament President  Miro Lazovic and Presidency Member Ivo Komsic.    "The visit comes at a crucial moment for the future of the  Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people," the local  Bosnian Embassy said.    Washington has been sympathetic with the Bosnian Government,  which is comprised mainly of Muslims, the grieved side in the  22- month war in the Yugoslav republic.    Appearing in an interview of the ABC Television, U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, "finding a rational  settlement, finding one that is satisfactory to the Muslims, has  to be a very high priority."    Christopher, who is scheduled to meet Silajdzic Monday  morning, said Washington is trying to know what the Bosnian  Muslims' "reasonable requirements" are and help them achieve  them.    Silajdzic will stay in Washington for three days. He will  first meet Deputy Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff and Assistant  Secretary of State Stephen Oxman Monday morning.    The prime minister will have a second meeting with  Christopher Thursday afternoon.    After their stay in Washington, Silajdzic and his entourage  will go to New York Friday, the Bosnian Embassy said.</p>

The resolution calls on CPPCC organizations at various  levels  to take an active part in political consultations and democratic  supervision, involve themselves in the discussion and management  of state affairs, and make new contributions to the country's  modernization and the peaceful reunification of the country.    All kinds of work of the CPPCC, the resolution says, should  be subordinate to and serve the country's general task of  "seizing development opportunities, deepening reform, opening  China wider to the outside world, promoting development and  maintaining stability."    Present at the closing meeting were Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the CPPCC National Committee, vice chairmen of the committee, as  well as party and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao  Shi, Zhu Rongji, Liu Huaqing, Hu Jintao and Rong Yiren.    The meeting was presided over by Wu Xueqian, vice chairman  of  the CPPCC National Committee and was attended by 1,762 members  of the CPPCC National Committee. The meeting elected two new  vice chairmen, seven new Standing Committee members and a new  secretary- general for the current National Committee.    The two new vice chairmen are Zhu Guangya, president of the  Chinese Association of Science and Technology, and Wan Guoquan,  vice chairman of the China Democratic National Construction  Association. Zhu Xun, minister of geology and mineral resources,  was elected the new secretary-general.    The session expressed satisfaction over the work of the  CPPCC  National Committee in the past year, approved its work  arrangements for this year, and adopted a revised constitution  of the CPPCC, which takes effect as of today.    The session received 1,893 proposals, of which 1,851 will be  delivered to relevant party and government departments for  handling.    In his closing speech, Li Ruihuan said CPPCC should improve  the system of multi-party cooperation and political  consultation, which is the main form of China's socialist  democracy, and make it more effective.    He said publicly-acknowledged practices and experiences that  are of universal significance and embody the principle of people  being masters of the country should be incorporated in China's  political system by legal means so that they become  commonly-abided rules in the political life of the society.    A fairly complete legal system should be established in  China, he said. This is to make sure that systems and laws do  not change with changes of leadership or with changes in the  views and attention of leaders, he said.</p>

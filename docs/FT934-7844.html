			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Howard to seek bar on industrial action by prison officers THE government plans today to raise the stakes in a confrontation with the Prison Officers' Association by seeking a High Court injunction banning the traditionally militant union from taking industrial action. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will argue that, since prison officers hold the office of constable, industrial action involving breach of contract is outside employment law. If the courts endorsed this view, it would prevent the union taking most forms of industrial action at a time when it feels threatened by the introduction of private prison management. A ballot of POA members approved action short of an all-out strike over the government's market testing programme, which will extend private management. The union is also protesting over transfer of work to support-staff, as well as prison violence and overcrowding. Action started last week with little disruption so far, but the union plans to refuse to accept most new admissions to prisons next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. This would mean up to 2,000 prisoners having to be held in police cells as an emergency measure. Mr Derek Lewis, director general of the Prison Service, said the action could represent a 'serious threat to the operation of the criminal justice system and law and order'. The home secretary will seek the injunction this afternoon unless, as appears unlikely, the union executive calls off the proposed disruption by midday. Prison officers, said Mr Lewis, shared some rights of detention with police officers and held the office of constable. According to his legal advice, this meant they were not workers within the terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. Their dispute was not a trade dispute as defined by the act, and the POA did not enjoy immunity under it. The union leadership could not incite prison officers to breach their contracts of employment. The POA leadership stood by its decision to call next week's action. Mr John Bartell, chairman, described Mr Howard's proposed action as a 'cynical attempt to neuter a union that is causing difficulties for the government'. Britain already has two private prisons and the contract to run a third, at Doncaster, will be awarded next month. The POA, which has a hardline reputation, feels under attack because private operators are unlikely to recognise it. It appeared to go hesitantly into the present dispute, but the position being adopted by Mr Howard confronts it with the risk of losing its ability to call action in the future.</p>

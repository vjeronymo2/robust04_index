			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 Jun (EFE) -- The Dominican  Government warned today it will not allow the presence of  foreign troops in its territory to reinforce the embargo against  the Haitian military.    Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral told EFE: "In  no  way will we (the Dominican Government) accept foreign troops in  order to reinforce the border."    The high-ranking official referred to Argentine President  Carlos Menem's possible offer to send Argentine troops to the  Dominican border with Haiti to reinforce the blockade against  the military coupists.    Menem will present this proposal during a meeting to be held  tomorrow in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton,  according to high-ranking diplomatic sources in Buenos Aires  quoted by the Buenos Aires daily CLARIN.    Fifteen days ago, Argentina became part of the "Friends of  Haiti Club," which also includes the United States, France,  Canada, and Venezuela.    Herrera said the Dominican Foreign Ministry had no knowledge  of Menem's proposal and explained that what the Dominican  Government agreed to with the United Nations -- and "the United  States is aware of this" -- is the presence of "approximately 20  observers" who would work together with Dominican authorities.  The deputy minister added that the mission would consist of  individuals, including military, of various nations, but he said  five or six military personnel "cannot be considered a troop."    He added: "We do not accept any foreign troops in Dominican  territory to carry out something that corresponds to a bilateral  matter. We are not at war with Haiti or anyone" and thus cannot  accept the presence of military troops on Dominican territory.    He explained that the Dominican Government is complying with  the UN provisions and that it will receive the necessary  reinforcements, but this will be in advisory and logistical  support.    After saying the Argentine Embassy "in no way" had made  contact with the Foreign Ministry to discuss the Haitian crisis,  he said his government had not received the logistical support  which the international organizations has promised.    "We are absorbing the economic cost of maintaining the  Dominican troops on the border with no assistance, up until now,  from any international organization," said the deputy minister.  Nevertheless, he said despite the heavy cost the embargo  represents for the Dominican Government, his country is still  guarding the border while the international community's  sanctions prevail against the "de facto" Haitian Government.</p>

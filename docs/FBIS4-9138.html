			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oana Stanciulescu: "The Mangalia Navy Harbor and </F> the Kogalniceanu Airport Will Be Put at NATO's Disposal"]    [Text] During the 5-6 April meeting held by NATO General  George Joulwan [supreme commander of the Allied Forces for  Europe] and National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca, the  principal issue that was approached was the modernization of the  Romanian Armed Forces, said sources at the National Defense  Ministry.    Currently Romania has seven battalions of paratroopers that  will be the nucleus of the future Rapid Deployment Force, which  is a NATO military structure. Within the next 20 months Romania  will have to reorganize and enlarge those forces so that finally  they will consist of three rapid deployment brigades each made  up of three battalions of paratroopers and one battalion of  special operation forces, namely mountain infantry, marines, and  reconnaissance. Each brigade will also have its own logistics  support battalion, said the aforementioned sources. Those  forces have to be able to intervene within 12 hours anywhere in  Europe.    In NATO's assessment a considerable part of the Romanian  Army's current equipment cannot be used in the future. That is  why they suggested that it should be modernized. Thus, as a  conclusion of the talks, NATO pledged to offer credits to  Romania to buy transportation means (trucks), complete the  general overhauling of the Navy's equipment, and improve its  antiaircraft weapons.    General Joulwan suggested to the Romanian party that its  military communications system should be fully redone, because  similarly to the radar watch network, during the 1989 December  events it did not prove to be reliable. During the  aforementioned talks they also approached the experience  accumulated from the modernization of the Slovak Army  communications, which was done with the assistance of German  experts, the modernization programs designed to update the  antiaircraft defenses of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech  Republic, and the necessity of establishing a "joint air space."    Another issue they discussed referred to the access of NATO  to Romanian military facilities -- more precisely, to the Navy  harbor at Mangalia, the Constanta port, the [Air Force] airport  near Kogalniceanu [Constanta County], the firing range near  Sibiu, and the air-to-air and airplane practice field near  Midia [Constanta County].    During the meeting the Romanian party was briefed by the  NATO  general about the fact that the current level of the Russian  conventional forces exceeds, by 2,100 armored personnel  carriers, 400 tanks, and 620 artillery pieces, the level  established by the arms reduction treaty, and that the majority  of those forces are concentrated in the rayon of Kaliningrad, as  a threat to the Baltic states.</p>

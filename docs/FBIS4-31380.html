			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Geneva, June 8 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Republic  (R.S.) President Radovan Karadzic said Wednesday that partial  solutions, such as the signing of ceasefire accord for one  month, pushed towards war and did not represent a basis for  peace in Bosnia- herzegovina. He told reporters that the Serb  side was once again not treated equally.    The accord -- signed Wednesday by U.N. special envoy Yasushi  Akashi and Vice-Presidents of the Moslem-Croatian Federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina Ejup Ganic and the Bosnian Serb Republic  (R.S.) Nikola Kolrevic -- envisage the two sides refrain from  engaging for a period of one month in any military activity  beginning June 10 at noon local time.    The signed document, as set out in Geneva, in no way  (?completed a platform) with which, under Akashi's proposal, the  conference opened and according to which an accord was to have  been signed for four-month ceasefire period, as the basic  pre-condition in finding a comprehensive political solution to  the Bosnia crisis.    The Serbs have from the outset of the conference requested a  lasting ceasefire, while the Moslem Croatian delegation first  boycotted for four days the talks, under the pretext that armed  Serbs did not leave the three-kilometer exclusion zone around  Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, as set out in the  U.N. Resolution No.913. When the Moslem observers and U.N.  members on the spot confirmed that armed Serbs have left the  said area, Ganic said he would accept only talks on a four-week  ceasefire.    The signed accord, clearly designed to suit the Moslem side,  was taken in Geneva as the first step towards a comprehensive  cessation of hostilities, something, as set out, about which the  warring parties would continue discussions over the next few  days. All this, of course, on condition the Moslems indeed  intended ever to join in earnest talks on peace and adhere to  the signed documents, including this one signed Wednesday in  Geneva.    The accord envisaged the warring sides carry out an exchange  of prisoners and release all captured persons on their  respective territories as well as submit to the Red Cross lists  of missing persons. This process is to be scrupulously  supervised [word indistinct].</p>

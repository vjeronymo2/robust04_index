			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL TEAMS HOPING FOR BIG-TIME DAY;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USD AND USIU TRAVEL FOR GAMES WITH RANKED TEAMS, AND SDSU  PLAYS HOST TO USC FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 50 YEARS.  </P> <P> USIU Coach Gary Zarecky isn't deluding himself going into today's game at  Arkansas. He just hopes that the Gulls have their pride intact when they leave  Fayetteville.  </P> <P> This was not the case when USIU played at then No. 17 Oklahoma two weeks ago.  The Sooners ran to a 97-45 lead -- at halftime. Oklahoma went on to win,  173-101, and took the heart out of a team that came to town with a 2-0 record.  </P> <P> The Gulls have a five-game losing streak but seem to have rebounded from what  Zarecky termed "utter devastation" at Oklahoma. USIU was competitive in losses  to California and Loyola Marymount at home this week.  </P> <P> "We have to go into Arkansas with things in perspective," Zarecky said. "We're  just looking to get into our 11-game home stand against teams our own caliber."  </P> <P> The Gulls are led by guard Kevin Bradshaw, who scored a school-record 54 points  in a 152-137 loss to Loyola Thursday. Bradshaw is averaging 30 points and  Demetrius Laffitte 18.  </P> <P> Arkansas is led by guard Todd Day (20.5) and forward Lenzie Howell (16.5). RICK  HAZELTINE  </P></p>

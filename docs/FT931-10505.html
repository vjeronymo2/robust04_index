			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P lowers Italian bank debt ratings STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has lowered the debt ratings of three Italian banks, reflecting a deteriorating domestic environment and the Italian government's more 'hands-off' approach to the sector, writes Antonia Sharpe. Istituto Bancario di Torino's senior debt rating is cut to A plus from AA, while Banca Commerciale Italiana's and Banca Nazionale del Lavoro's are both cut to A from AA minus. ***** Ems-Chemie, the Swiss speciality chemicals group, reported a 44.5 per cent jump in net profits last year to SFr143m (USDollars 94m), on sales 14.7 per cent ahead at SFr896m, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. More than half the profit growth came from securities trading, which yielded SFr51m compared with SFr23m the year before. ***** TNT, the Australian transport group, plans to float its remaining 20 per cent holding in TNT Freightways of the US, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. TNT floated 80 per cent of the group 15 months ago. ***** Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, a leading Swedish commercial bank, says a combination of state guarantees and a share issue are the best way for it to escape its financial crisis, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, chief executive, did not quantify how much the bank would need to raise, but said it would need up to SKr10bn (Dollars 1.35) to guarantee its non-performing loans. ***** Denway Investment, the Chinese joint venture manufacturer of Peugeot vehicles in Guangzhou (Canton) is to raise HKDollars 403m (USDollars 52m) through a flotation on the Hong Kong stock market, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. ***** Banespa, Brazil's third largest bank which is controlled by the state of Sao Paulo, posted net profits of Dollars 156.3m in 1992, compared with Dollars 92.6m a year earlier, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.</p>

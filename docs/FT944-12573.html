			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: The Romantic spirit revisited - Opportunities have been missed in this rehang of German art There is usually nothing more tedious than to review a show twice, for all that it might be currently the most brilliant thing in the world. But there are exceptions, especially in those cases where doubts or questions were raised by the initial experience. Autres temps, autres murs: a show rehung is in many senses a new show, and to give such a one the benefit of those doubts is no bad thing. I first saw The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1770-1990 at Edinburgh in the summer, and found it something less than the sum of its parts, fascinating and beautiful though many of those parts undoubtedly were. It was a case, I felt, of curatorial ambition over-reaching itself. Two hundred years'-worth of any nation's art would be problem enough in the simplest chronological presentation, let alone in the sustained exposition of a dense and complex argument. What a brave idea it was and, in the event, what a frustrated opportunity. The move from the grand and ample Classical spaces of the Royal Scottish Academy to the more tortuous and constricted plan of London's Hayward Gallery, was bound to entail a certain concentration of material and trimming down. Would it bring with it a refocusing of the show's essential rationale, and with it a more comprehensive and integrated view of the subject as a whole? Not at all. Too late, of course, to expect that any of the more obvious and inexplicable gaps would now be plugged (we knew there was to be no Beckmann, no Schad, no Hubbuch, no Corinth, no Menzel) but surely some of the more obvious and direct comparisons across the period, which the very premise of the exhibition invites, would now be made - Beuys with Klee, Dix and Radziwill with Rethel, Baselitz with von Marees and Bocklin, the Bauhaus practice with the early theorisings of Goethe and Runge. Not a bit. But scholars and curators are stubborn beasts, for whom any idee fixe is fixe indeed. The bare fact is that not a single concession has been made, in terms of editing or reconsideration, in what was manifestly the weakest part of the Edinburgh showing. There the work of the last 30 years, represented by a mere six artists, was shown apart in the Fruitmarket Gallery. At the Hayward these same six have been given the entire mezzanine and the entrance gallery, which must amount to nearly 30 per cent of the area available for exhibitions. Small wonder then at what else has been left out. What this says of the judgment and priorities of the organisers shouts for itself. It is but the current orthodoxy that a room-size sculptural installation by a Beuys or Polke must take precedence over any other consideration, even in so historical a context as this. I would only say that the showing on a sensible scale, and in a proper context, of Beuys, Kiefer and Baselitz, would have been entirely justifiable. As it is they stand with their three fellows as though there has been no other Deutsche Romantik art in a generation - nothing of recent East German realism, for example. All that aside, the show holds many beautiful and rewarding things, albeit fewer of them, from the Friedrich landscapes at the outset, so eloquent in their gentle melancholy, to the abstracted, lively refinement of the Beuys drawings at the end. The run of early 19th century self-portraits and small paintings - Janssen stripped to the waist, Friedrich's wife leaning out of the window, Kersting's pretty 'wreath-maker' sitting sad beneath the trees - is a delight. And what does all this tell us of the romantic spirit in German art in all this time? That there was ever a soulful yearning for the ineffable, the unreachable, the sublime? That the fond quest for purity and perfection took with it, too, a more doubtful sense of destiny and foreboding? That in the dark night of the soul, darker and more troublesome spirits walk abroad - Bocklin's shaggy unicorn deep in the forest, Dix's ravens that tumble from the winter sky? What quite does the nymph fear, in von Marees' painting, from the horseman who turns away to pluck the fruit from the dark tree? Such questions are proposed, but no answers offered. Some paintings of the Nazi period are shown, but only a few, a mere gesture towards a subject that by now requires proper treatment. Controversy flared briefly on the matter, as though by Friedrich's noble yearners we might see that the enormities of Hitlerian barbarism were inevitable. Nonsense, of course, in any particular sense, but more general questions remain. What, if indeed it exists at all, is this peculiar quality of national sensibility, this soulful, contradictory agonising and self-searching, that distinguishes the German from the Romantik of other kinds? This exhibition, over-ambitious yet stretched as it is so thin, does little more than ask. The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990: the Hayward Gallery, South Bank Centre, London SE1, until January 8, then on to the Haus der Kunst, Munich: sponsored by Deutsche Bank, Siemens and Urenco, with assistance from Lufthansa: part of the South Bank's Deutsche Romantik Festival.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin and his visiting South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam  expressed their willingness on Thursday [2 June] evening to  expand bilateral cooperation, particularly in the economic  sphere.    Speaking at the state diner in honor of Kim Yong-sam in the  Kremlin, the Russian president said "ties between the two  countries are developing effectively at present."    But it is necessary to "move ahead" and give "the green  light" to all cooperative projects in all spheres of live,  Yeltsin pointed out.    He added that this applies first of all to the economic  field, particularly since the two countries have opportunities  and reserves for this.    Russia wants to see Korea reunified in a peaceful,  democratic  way as soon as possible, Yeltsin said, expressing hope that a  "united" Korea becomes "a reliable partner of Russia."    According to him, relations with Seoul is "one of Moscow's  most important priorities in the Asian-Pacific direction."    One of the high priority tasks is to guarantee the  non-nuclear status of the Korean peninsula, the Russian leader  stated. He recalled that Russia was the first to propose  convening an international conference on the issue.    "The conference would seek a comprehensive solution to the  nuclear problem as well as specific accords aimed at lessening  and eventually eliminating the dangerous confrontation on the  Korean peninsula," Yeltsin noted.    Kim Yong-sam said, in turn, that he is quite convinced that  "a very bright future lies ahead of us" in Russian-South Korean  relations.    "We will surely share a great future together if the  advanced  technology and vast natural resources of the Russian Federation  are combined with the industrial development and business  management expertise of (South) Korea," he said.    He said documents concerning the Korean war of 1950-1953,  which were handed earlier on Thursday to the South Korean  president by Yeltsin, "will stand as a symbol of our firm  determination to make a fresh start in our relations, putting  behind us our unfortunate past relations during the era of Cold  War."    Kim Yong-sam arrived in Moscow on Wednesday afternoon for a  four- day official visit to Russia. On Thursday morning he  signed with Yeltsin a joint Russian-South Korean declaration at  the close of their summit talks in the Kremlin.</p>

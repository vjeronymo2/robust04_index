			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (12): Performance is starting to matter - The impact of the rapid ageing of Japan's population JAPAN'S PENSION funds have often been viewed by outsiders as designed more to lubricate the country's complex and cosy network of corporate relationships than to benefit the actual members of company funds. That interpretation has not been discouraged by funds such as the Japan Securities Dealers' Employees Pension Fund, which announced that its money would be divided neatly among the fund management arms of securities companies and indicated that the shares would be maintained regardless of performance. But there are hopes among foreign fund managers in Japan and among the more aggressive Japanese managers that the 'silver wave', the rapid ageing of the country's population, will force company funds and the Japanese government to put more emphasis on performance. A second hope is that companies with new funds or funds that cover numerous companies within an industry will be less shackled by traditional corporate relationships and more open to using independent investment advisers, including foreigners. The industry groupings, such as the Tokyo Electronics Sub-Contractors Association, could be more fertile territory, as they should dilute an individual company's obligations to, for example, its bank, which may want pension funds to be handled by an affiliated trust bank. Last financial year, Japan's legally-recognised corporate pension plans totalled about Dollars 230bn, and nine foreign-affiliated trust banks were among the 38 trust banks and life insurance companies allowed to manage Japanese pensions. And, from last April, 133 investment advisers, 36 of them foreign, were given access to some of the new money flowing into the system. The foreign companies would like greater access to pension funds, having calculated that they now manage only 0.3 per cent of the total, and they want an easing of the restrictions on fund employment. Principal secured assets must comprise at least 50 per cent of funds invested, domestic stocks up to 30 per cent, foreign currency denominated securities up to 30 per cent and real estate up to 20 per cent. One foreign manager said that these restrictions 'limit the ability of foreign companies to show their particular strengths'. While foreign companies are unhappy about the pace of liberalisation, they are reluctant to be identified when criticising the system for fear of antagonising the all-powerful Finance Ministry. Foreign companies hope that the government's own concern about the financial burden of expected demographic changes in Japan will provide a stimulant for further reforms of fund management. About 11 per cent of Japanese are now aged 65 or over, but the ratio is expected to jump to 16 per cent by 2000. One change in the year to end-March was the sharply increased allotments by the state-run Pension Welfare Service Corporation to life insurance companies, which received 30.1 per cent more than in fiscal 1989, while the trust banks received only 13.7 per cent more. Trust banks must manage funds individually, while the life insurance companies have the advantage of being able to pool all incoming funds for management. But Mr Tokuo Banba, assistant general manger of planning and co-ordination at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, says that the importance of trust banks has not diminished, and that 'yield is not everything.' He emphasises that Japanese companies want stable fund management, and that high yields in the short term will not necessarily impress them. According to Mr Brian Matthews, president of Jardine Fleming Investment Advisers, building long-term relationships is particularly necessary in Japan. He says his firm has been helped by pension fund appointments from two government-related organisations and that these contracts are important because when other quasi-government funds look to make appointments, 'our name will be on the list.' He estimates that establishing a significant presence will take five years from the liberalisation last April, and is 'surprised that we have had these successes so quickly'. Jardine Fleming Investment Advisers is 51 per cent owned by Jardine Fleming Investment Management and 49 per cent by Yasuda Trust and Banking. Mr Matthews says the idea is 'to combine the asset management capabilities of the Fleming group with the domestic marketing capabilities of Yasuda'. The venture, he says, has been a success. Mr Shoji Yamada, director of pension fund management at Yasuda Trust, reckons that the Japanese industry may be '15 to 20 years' behind the US, and admits that foreign companies have valuable expertise: 'We have studied the western style of fund management, and are interested in new skills.' Given the problems in Japanese financial markets in the past year and the realisation that stock prices can fall as well as rise, Japanese managers have become more wary about the deployment of funds. They have been noticeably absent from the Tokyo stock market in recent months, and have warned companies that uncertainty over stock prices has made dividends all the more important. Mr Shigeyuki Araki, investment planning manager at Dai-ichi Mutual Life, says that his company's hidden stock profits fell by half last year, and 'we are telling companies that they must increase dividend payments if they want us to buy.' If performance is becoming more important in Japan, the question remains as to how the government intends to measure that performance. The Finance Ministry has hinted that private firms could be allowed to establish a performance scale of sorts, but there has been no formal indication as to when such a system will be introduced.</p>

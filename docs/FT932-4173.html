			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Mansfield ahead 14% as margins improve MANSFIELD BREWERY lifted pre-tax profits 14 per cent from Pounds 11m to Pounds 12.5m in the 12 months to March 27. The Yorkshire and east Midlands brewer also proposed a 4-for-1 share split. Property disposals contributed just Pounds 8,000 compared with Pounds 407,000 and earnings per share increased by 14.8 per cent to 55.8p (48.6p). Excluding the effect of the property sales earnings per share expanded by 21.1 per cent. The final dividend is increased to 11p (9.6p) for a total of 15.4p (13.6p). Profits at the operating level, after charging Pounds 1.3m against free trade debts and loans, increased by 11.8 per cent to Pounds 18.7m (Pounds 16.7m). The operating and trading margins improved to 15.9 per cent and 10.6 per cent respectively mainly reflecting the increased proportion of draught beers in the mix. Turnover rose to Pounds 117.7m (Pounds 114.5m), buoyed by the full inclusion of the 94 pubs acquired in March and April last year. The expansion of the estate, which continued with the purchase of a further 17 pubs for Pounds 3.1m, enabled the group to increase sales of draught beers and ciders by 3.2 per cent despite the depressed market. Tied trade sales on a like-for-like basis fell 3.9 per cent. However, free trade sales rose 0.7 per cent with sales to wholesalers growing 15.9 per cent. Sir David White, chairman, said this had enabled the group to further increase its share of the regional draught beer market. Sales of take home beers fell 7.6 per cent. During the year Pounds 21.3m was invested in capital projects, including pub acquisitions and refurbishment, and free trade loan growth, partly financed by Pounds 4.5m of property disposals. Borrowings increased by Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 63.5m representing gearing of 44.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: US indicators weaken dollar THE DOLLAR had a day of mixed fortunes on foreign exchange markets yesterday after an uncertain set of indicators checked an initial surge of popularity in the US currency, writes James Blitz. Traders had been hoping that the figures would fuel renewed confidence in the dollar after several days of uncertain trading. In the end, the broad range of indicators proved so wildly contradictory that the market was left in an aimless mood over how to respond to them. Two of them were clearly positive. The important April consumer confidence measure, issued by the Conference Board, a US business group, leapt to 64.8 against forecasts of 55.1. The figure for first-quarter GDP matched market predictions, rising a solid 2 per cent after a modest 0.4 per cent increase in the fourth quarter of last year. Analysts, however, said these results had already been factored into dollar trading. And figures for March new home sales, which plunged 14.8 per cent, had a depressing effect on the market. As a result, early interest in the US currency, which at midsession in London was trading at DM1.6600, was checked in the afternoon. It ended at DM1.6555. In London trading the dollar managed to reverse a slight slide against the yen, finishing at Y133.25 after a previous close of Y133.10. In New York trading, the uncertain economic indicators were also a dampening influence on the dollar. After opening more firmly against both the D-Mark and yen, the US currency later slipped to close at DM1.6536 and Y133.15. The D-Mark had a mostly uneventful day after the punishment it took in trading on Monday. The German currency is suffering in the wake of Germany's worst industrial unrest for 18 years, and two surprising resignations from the Bonn cabinet at the start of the week. Dealers said it had recovered some of its poise by the end of trading in Europe yesterday. In London, it resisted a renewed attack from sterling to end at DM2.9375, the same as its previous close. The other important action of the day in European markets centred on the Swiss franc, which extended yesterday's late rally on newspaper reports that it might bid for European Community membership. 'The world, its wife, their children and the dog were short of Swiss francs,' said one US bank trader cynically, 'and they used the rehashed EC story as a good excuse to take profits.' The Swiss franc ended the day 1.32 centimes stronger against the dollar at SFr1.5158, from SFr1.5290. It closed in New York at SFr1.5160. Although it remained strong, sterling failed to fully break through the DM2.94 barrier in London trading, as profit-takers took their gains after the pound's successes on Monday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zilina, Central Slovakia, April 28 (CTK) -- The  Slovak Government should be left in peace so that it can  responsibly prepare the elections and continue the process of  economic transformation, which is fatally unavoidable, Slovak  President Michal Kovac said today.    Speaking at a meeting with representatives of local and  state  administration of the Zilina district, Kovac stressed that  without privatization Slovakia would not cope with its present  serious temporary economic and social troubles. The influx of  foreign capital, indispensable for Slovakia, depends on the  irreversibility of economic changes and the stability of the  domestic political situation, Kovac said.    "Although Slovakia has a new government sworn-in in a  legitimate way, the tension in our society has not yet dwindled  completely," he stated, adding that weakening of the fragile  democratic system could "result in the return to the  authoritative regime".    Kovac called for national and political reconciliation and  the unity of citizens. According to him, some people use the  "Slovak principle" as a pretext for the search of "lines of  separation, accusations, and finding of enemies."    In a discussion Kovac reacted to a statement by Zilina Mayor  Jan Slota, made at the meeting, who cast doubt on the need to  pay heed to what Western countries say on developments in  Slovakia.    Kovac said that Slovakia's integration into European  economic, political, and security structures was in its national  and state interest, which must not be challenged by anybody. As  a new country, Slovakia is perhaps monitored in a far more  sensitive manner than Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic.  In this connection, reactions in Slovakia are also sensitive  when some Western politicians omit Slovakia when listing the  countries of Europe's interest, Kovac said, adding that he  himself was very sensitive to it. "When we find out...that it is  caused by our domestic policy, we are obliged to draw changes  from it," he said.    Referring to the question of the Magyarization of ethnic  Slovaks living in southern Slovakia, Kovac said he was disturbed  by this, but the solution of the problem was in the hands of the  Slovak cabinet, which could, for example, earmark certain funds  from the state budget.    During his two-day working stay in central Slovak districts  of Zilina and Cadca, Michal Kovac is also to visit enterprises  and cultural and historical monuments, and meet with business  people.</p>

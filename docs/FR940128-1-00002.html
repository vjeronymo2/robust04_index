This action is necessary to reflect shifts in production since the original districts were established. The Plan requires the periodic realignment of the districts based on shifts in production to ensure equitable representation of producers and handlers on the Board.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by February 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Interested persons are invited to submit written comments concerning this proposed rule to: Docket Clerk, Fruit and Vegetable Division, AMS, USDA, P.O.

The Plan is authorized under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916), hereinafter referred to as the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000 and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

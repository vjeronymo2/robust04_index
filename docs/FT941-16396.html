			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Golan pioneers refuse to surrender a life's work: Julian Ozanne reviews local obstacles to a settlement over the strategic heights bordering Syria Ramona Bar-Lev settled in the Golan Heights in 1969, two years after Israel captured the strategic plateau in a counter-offensive against a Syrian attack. 'We are not climbing down from the Golan,' she says. 'The government can't talk about the Golan as if it was still 1967. It is now 1994 and we have given all our life to this place. We are the reality today.' The views of the 13,000 Israeli settlers on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are unlikely to be given much weight when President Bill Clinton meets President Hafez al-Assad of Syria in Geneva on Sunday. The two leaders will discuss making progress in peace talks between Israel and Syria which focus on an Israeli return of the Golan in exchange for peace with Syria including trade and diplomatic ties and security guarantees. In Israel, however, the plight of the Golan settlers - praised and financed by successive Israeli governments - has ignited widespread public support and sympathy. Across Israel banners and stickers express public solidarity with the settlers. Sacrificing the settlers in the interests of peace will not be easy for a democratic government with a thin majority and mounting opposition to the peace process. Furthermore, if Israel is about to give up Golan for peace with Syria, the Jewish settlers and investors do not resemble a population about to be displaced. They are busy expanding their businesses and building new red-tiled roofed homes with government approval and subsidies. Many Golan residents simply refuse to accept the government would surrender the sparsely populated Golan Heights which is viewed as vital for Israel's security and water supply. Last week Mr Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, Israel's housing minister, officially opened a government-built 700-house extension of Katzrin, the main Golan town, and vowed Israel would 'not abandon the residents of the Golan Heights'. 'The government says one thing but keeps encouraging us to stay here. There will be no change because the government does not believe in giving up the Golan and knows it can have peace with Syria without doing so,' said Mr Uri Meir of the Golan Development Company which encourages new investment. 'I have grandchildren born on the Golan and I have spent the last 26 years working to make the Golan something special. I cannot believe I will ever leave the Golan and start a new life at 46 years-old.' Mr Meir says the Golan contributes Dollars 200m to the Israeli economy annually from agriculture, industry and tourism. This year a chocolate factory and a producer of door frames will join more than a dozen other businesses at the Katzrin industrial site. All investors receive a 30 per cent grant from the government. The Golan Heights Winery, one of the existing investors has just started a Dollars 5m three-year expansion programme, adding to its investment of Dollars 15m since 1983. The expansion plan will double production to 340,000 cases by 1999, much of it for export to the US and Europe. 'The government is supporting this expansion because it believes in the long-term profitability of our company,' said Mr Doron Rand, the marketing manager. 'The government talks about changes but there are many ways to make changes without us going down from the Golan. On a business level we are going ahead as if nothing will change. Our future is here.' The confidence of investors and settlers on the Golan reflects the special importance attached to the Heights by Israel. Since 1967, the Golan, which is strategically positioned above Israel's northern valleys, has been seen as the country's most vital defence line. Unlike the other occupied Arab lands, Israel annexed the Heights in 1981. Control also ensures the security of the basin of the Sea of Galilee which supplies 30 per cent of Israel's water resources. Golan residents say they are different from settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip where there is a Palestinian population dispossessed of its land. Before 1967 the Golan was a military area with only a handful of Arab villages. 'The Golan today is the ultimate model of pioneer-Zionist accomplishment,' says a campaign leaflet. Mrs Leora Dormann, a teacher, moved to the Heights in 1981 and lived with her husband and two children in a caravan. 'The politicians told us we were the pioneers of the 1980s. We were idealistic and we believed we were doing something for the country making it safer and building something from scratch,' she said. 'Many of our friends died defending the Golan. We are going to object, protest and fight against it and we are not going to go peacefully or easily and I am going to fight with my kids and my pupils. We are not fanatics but it hurts. It is as if the government is now saying we have to throw away our lives - all that we did here.' Not all the Golan settlers are as determined. Some are ready to leave but are waiting for the government to offer compensation. 'When people heard about the Clinton-Assad meeting here they said we are getting closer,' said Mrs Sue Korda, a resident of Kibbutz Ein Zivan, close to the Syrian border. But those who want to stay outnumber those who want to leave and, buoyed by recent opinion polls of Israeli support for keeping the Golan, they are ready to fight a fierce campaign to stay put.</p>

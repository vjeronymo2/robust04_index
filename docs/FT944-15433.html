			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dollar weakness hits bourses after Kohl victory Sunday's narrow victory for Germany's Conservative/Liberal coalition was seen as a reassurance for the country's financial markets, and it certainly seemed to be good for both the D-Mark and bunds, writes Our Markets Staff. It had less apparent effect on the Frankfurt equity market, but Mr James Cornish, the NatWest strategist who concentrates on the European political scene, put this in perspective. 'It is good for equities, too,' he said, 'but they were already up by more than 7 per cent last week.' Outside Germany, he added, the Kohl win should be good for countries with a commitment to hard currency; it was probably no coincidence that the usually sedate Danish equity market posted a rise of 1.5 per cent yesterday. FRANKFURT's professionals went fishing for more buyers in the early morning, with prices marked up and a little buying lifting Dax futures. However, the buyers did not bite and, from an Ibis-indicated high of 2,147.3 in the morning the market slipped rapidly to close the session 14.85 lower at 2,090.88. Turnover rose from DM6.4bn to DM8.5bn and, in the afternoon, the Dax recovered a little to 2,095.58. Unfortunately, what was good for the D-Mark was bad for the dollar, and the malaise of the US currency had its impact on exporters: there was weakness in chemicals, carmakers and engineering and metals, with Hoechst down DM5.10 at DM329.50, Daimler by DM15.30 at DM779.70 and Thyssen by DM7.50 at DM290. However, the losses were not restricted to cyclicals. Deutsche Bank fell DM12.50 to DM714.50, although it denied a Spiegel report alleging that it had profited from the oil futures fiasco which drove Metallgesellschaft into financial disaster. In utilities, Veba fell DM9.80 to DM526 and Viag by DM9.60 to DM475. PARIS was pulled down by a number of factors, including a weak currency and some institutional switching of funds from France into Germany following the general election there at the weekend. The resignation of a senior member of the Balladur government was not seen as affecting sentiment, brokers said, since the decision by the industry minister to quit on allegations of corruption had been expected. The CAC-40 index settled down 26.60 or 1.4 per cent at 1,906.42 in turnover estimated at FFr6bn. Vehicle and component stocks reflected the market's overall weakness, with Peugeot off FFr6 at FFr782, Michelin down FFr3.90 at FFr229.10 and Valeo FFr1.40 lower at FFr280.10. The government said yesterday that institutions subscribing to the partial privatisation of Renault - pre-marketing begins today - could be expected to pay between FFr163 to FFr178 per share. Eurotunnel confirmed forecasts of weak 1994 revenues and the shares lost FFr1.15 or 6 per cent at FFr17.85. ZURICH was lower in thin turnover, the SMI index losing 9.7 to 2,575.6 in response to the weak dollar and profit-taking after last week's advance. UBS bearers, however, picked up SFr5 to SFr1,290 as the bank continued to buy its own shares ahead of the extraordinary shareholders meeting on November 22 at which shareholders will be asked to approve the bank's planned capital restructuring. Roche certificates gave up SFr65 to SFr5,835 after the group announced that third- quarter sales fell 4.7 per cent to SFr3.4bn. Ciba registered dipped SFr3 to SFr714, while Sandoz, which is expected to announce nine-month figures next week, fell SFr5 to SFr632. Export-oriented shares fell prey to the weak US currency, Nestle giving up SFr7 at SFr1,197. AMSTERDAM was supported by bonds as the weak dollar threatened to drag equities lower. The AEX index finished with a modest rise of 0.28 at 408.44, having seen a day's high of 411.60. Unilever, up 30 cents to Fl 200.30, attracted interest from Merrill Lynch in a review of food industry stocks, the broker noting that the stock had the best performance among European groups in the third quarter. Merrill added that an estimated p/e of 12 times 1995 earnings did not seem too demanding, while the company also stood to benefit from its positioning in the world's emerging economies. MILAN turned back from early highs amid fresh signs of backtracking by some ministers over the budget proposals. The Mibtel index finished 24 ahead at 10,143, off a high of 10,288, as teething troubles with the new Mib-30 index also acted as a disincentive. Credito Italiano was a bright spot, climbing L45 or 2.6 per cent as it launched its rights issue to raise L1,500bn and the bank's president said he had many new projects in mind at a time when the Italian banking system was about to regroup. Olivetti was L60 or 3.1 per cent lower at L1,890, although dealers said there was no news to account for the fall. TEL AVIV bracketed the Israeli/Jordan peace treaty with two gains of 2.4 per cent. On Sunday, it liked Friday's Israeli September price index and the Mishtanim index put on 4.46 at 188.07; yesterday it added a further 4.52 at 192.59.

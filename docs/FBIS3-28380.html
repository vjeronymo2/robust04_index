The sale of construction materials and the opportunity to  participate in construction contracts are among the most  promising prospects arising from the expected influx of US  companies after US President Bill Clinton announced on Thursday  night he was lifting the trade embargo, they said.    "If we come up with well-thoughtout strategies on the part  of  both the Government and the private sector the revival of  Vietnam can be turned into something complementing, instead of  competing with, the Thai economy," Thotsathit Rotprasoet,  manager of Thai Military Bank's Ho Chi Minh City branch, told  BUSINESS POST.    The fact that Vietnam may soon be able to speed up  rehabilitation of its war-ravaged infrastructure will boost  demand for construction materials, and this presents a potential  for growth in bilateral trade with Thailand, said Sinthon  Kanthawong, the Thai Commercial Counsellor to Vietnam in Hanoi.    Vietnam's domestic cement production capacity is now four  million tons, while the country's Ministry of Construction  projects demand at 8-10 million tons. Both Mr Thotsathit and Mr  Sinthon agreed that opportunities for Thai construction  companies were very clear, either in subcontracting from giant  multinationals or in supplying construction materials and heavy  machinery. Thailand's location is certainly a plus, Mr Sinthon  added.    "Thai products are in the quality and price ranges that fit  the Vietnamese demand and purchasing power besides being in a  geographically convenient location," he said. However, Thai  companies wishing to invest or develop business opportunities in  Vietnam will face tougher competition now with many other  players entering the scene, especially the Americans and the  Japanese, he noted.    Mr Thotsathit called on the Government to promote trade  financing facilities in order to allow greater and easier trade  in construction materials such as cement, asphalt, cranes and  other heavy machinery. He also said it was high time the Thai  Construction Contractors' Association moved into the Vietnamese  market under the leadership of the Thai Government, in a  systematic way. Such a movement has not yet taken place, he  added. Mr Thotsathit said Thailand could help fill the gaps  existing in Vietnam to create a complementary economy. "There  is a reason to fear rivalry with Vietnam if the Thais are not  well-prepared. But if we are well-prepared, the growth of  Vietnamese economy can benefit the Thai economy, and this is  already very clear with the construction sector."    Mr Sinthon agreed, saying that competltlon in the production  and export of primary agricultural commodities is inevitable.  "But for manufactured products such as motorbikes, electric  appliances, consumer goods or semi-processed goods, Thailand can  meet those rising demands in Vietnam," he added. Thailand has to  take the competitiveness factor into consideration in the longer  term but not the short term, he noted.</p>

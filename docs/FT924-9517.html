			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Technology: HDTV hits the screens BBC engineers and Thomson-CSF Laboratories in Rennes, France have been demonstrating this week that at least one digital high-definition television (HDTV) service can be broadcast on a standard eight-megahertz (MHz) channel used for today's non-satellite TV. A digital television signal was broadcast from a low-power transmitter at the BBC's Crystal Palace mast in London. The signals were received at the BBC's Engineering Research Department and at a number of other test sites in south London and Surrey. 'This was a real test that demonstrated that this system will work within a normal television channel,' Henry Price of BBC Engineering said yesterday. He described the test as a significant step on the way to HDTV, which offers high-quality pictures if used with a special television. The compression techniques, along with the transmitting and receiving equipment, were developed by Thomson-CSF to convey about 60 M bits of information in a single conventional channel. The BBC believes that by combining the techniques with digitally compressed television pictures it would be possible in principle to transmit two HDTV lines in a single eight-MHz channel. If the techniques are used to broadcast conventional TV pictures rather than HDTV pictures some engineers believe up to four channels could be broadcast in the capacity now occupied by a single channel. National Transcommunications, the privatised transmitter and engineering arm of what was the Independent Broadcasting Authority, has also been carrying out compression work under its Spectre project. Spectre has shown that digital channels can be broadcast alongside existing terrestrial services without causing interference. Because viewers will need decoders to receive either HDTV or a wider range of new compressed channels, engineers suggest that it may take until the end of the decade before fully commercial services are launched using the technology.</p>

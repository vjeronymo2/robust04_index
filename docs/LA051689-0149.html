			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hotel Investor Firms to Hire Investment Bankers: Hotel Investors Trust and  Hotel Investors Corp., two companies whose shares are paired on the New York  Stock Exchange, said they plan to hire investment bankers to consider ways for  boosting the shares' value. Hotel Investors Trust, based in Woodland Hills,  invests in lodging properties and Hotel Investors Corp. is a hotel management  concern. The companies said they took the action because their shares have been  underpriced and do not reflect "their intrinsic value." After the announcement  last week, the companies' shares jumped 15% to $9.50 a share; they closed  Monday at $9.25 a share. Before the announcement, the shares had been trading  near their lowest level for the past year. The companies gave no specifics  about what steps might be taken. But the bankers likely would consider a  financial restructuring of the companies, a share buyback and the sale of part  or all of the companies, among other things.  </P></p>

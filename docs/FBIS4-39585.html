			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 8 TASS -- The forum of public  organisations of the people of northern Caucasus and Cossack  troops from Russia's south is prepared to take tough and  efficient measures if six Ingush hostages earlier detained in  North Ossetia are not released until June 10.    An appeal to the North Ossetian president, which came to  ITAR-TASS from the Ingush permanent mission in Russia today,  says that if the hostages are held any longer, the forum of  public organisations reserves the right to hold up traffic from  North Ossetia to the territories of the Stavropol, Kuban and the  Don region as of June 11. Other protest actions and sanctions  will be taken in future, the appeal said.    Representatives of the north Caucasian people and Cossack  troops from Russia's south come out for strict implementation of  the Russian president's decree of May 30, 1994, including in  part concerning the immediate release of hostages, the appeal  said.</p>

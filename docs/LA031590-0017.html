			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOISETTES REAPPEAR IN THE CUISINE CLASSIQUE OF TODAY;  </P> <P> DINING: CHEF JEAN CLAUDE GUILLON BRINGS BACK THOSE THINLY SLICED PIECES OF  LAMB, BEEF AND VEAL OVERLAPPING IN A CIRCLE ON A PLATE.  </P> <P> There is something zealous in the drive by Japanese restaurant and hotel owners  to parade their star chefs around the world, I suppose to show off their stuff,  like some pushy mom coaxing Junior to play a virtuosic "Flight of the Bumble  Bee."  </P> <P> That's what happened the other night when executive chef Jean Claude Guillon of  the Japanese-owned Le Grand Hotel Du Cap-Ferrat in Le Cote D'Azur, stopped off  at the sister Hotel Bel-Air on the way back from similar visits to affiliated  hotels in Japan, Hong Kong and who knows where else the new Japanese owners  have hotels in the Far East.  </P> <P> There is nothing like a South of France meal in the middle of winter. It brings  you back to the sun, so that the only thing dancing before your very eyes is  not Michael Jackson walking into the Hotel Bel-Air dining room, or the woman at  table number one bundled up in her Fendi fox, but the look of summer green in  the salad, the blue of azure sea in the langouste and coquilles.  </P> <P> The noisettes de filet d'agneau roti is another thing that fills the room with  the fragrance of the Riviera.  </P> <P> I remember going from restaurant to restaurant, from village to village,  starting at Monaco and moving on to Cannes, where noisettes of lamb, veal and  beef, thinly sliced and overlapping in a circle, were a common theme.  </P> <P> It was the noisettes period in the cuisine nouvelle in those days. Overlapping  noisettes of veal, beef and lamb were everywhere. I found them in Los Angeles,  as well, when I returned, and lo, they seemed to disappear as quickly as they  arrived, with the declaration by Paul Bocuse, the father of nouvelle cuisine  himself, that nouvelle cuisine was dead. "Vive la Cuisine Classique," cried  Bocuse, raising his fork and stabbing the hunk of beef on his plate.  </P> <P> Cuisine Classique became -- and is still -- the cuisine of the moment. It's the  cuisine that allows a diner to order a shameless hunk of meat on a bone, and  sop up the juices with a hunk of bread without remorse. I've been sopping up  juices unremorsefully from shameless hunks of meats (osso buco is my favorite  even though it's Italian) ever since.  </P> <P> The overlapping noisettes, which I had almost forgotten existed, appeared again  at Guillon's dinner. Little overlapping noisettes circling the plate like a  baggage claim belt or, to put it more delicately, like a carousel, brought back  memories of those dinners on the Riviera.  </P> <P> What you do with the noisettes is to cut away at the clean, clear slices of  perfectly formed meat in dainty strokes so that a mere morsel spears onto the  edge of the fork. Then you tap it gently into a pool of buttery sauce on the  plate. It's OK, however, to sop up the delicious sauce with a tiny morsel of  crusty bread stuck on a fork, although I did once observe Bocuse tear off a  rather large piece of bread, coarsely dunk it in a sauce surrounding delicately  arranged noisettes and stuff it whole into his mouth.  </P> <P> Guillon is no slouch in the restaurant business. His credentials read as  Bocuse's resume might, only better: Les Trois Marches, L'Archestrate, Charles  Barrier, Gaston Lenotre, Le Gavroche, Auberge de L'Ill.  </P> <P> The menu he created started with a group of appetizers, which were passed with  glasses of Louis Roederer, Brut 1983: pisaladiere, the pizza of the Riviera;  tartlette ratatouille (crusty toast topped with ratatouille, a standby  appetizer of Provence, plus tiny patty shells filled with langouste to remind  you of the menu to come.  </P> <P> Once at the table the menu began with a salad of baby greens (arugula, mache,  frise) mixed with lobster and scallops. Then there was the fillets of roast St.  Pierre (turbot) on a pool of wild mushroom-anchovy sauce.  </P> <P> The noisettes of roast lamb "comme on les aime en Provence" (as one likes them  in Provence) was the same one that my memory brought alive. The sauce, as  velvety brown as a coffee berry, responded to my crusty bread like a dream.  Boscuse would have been proud.  </P> <P> It was the dessert that really unraveled the memory veil that separated me from  those glorious days in the South of France. Suddenly I was at Hotel Du  Cap-Ferrat, as it was called then, on the patio, under a white umbrella,  beneath a spreading chestnut tree, the skirts of the crisp, white tablecloths  fluttering in the sea breeze.  </P> <P> Croustillant de Framboises et Le Coulis may sound formidable, but it is nothing  more than a three-decker lace cookie sandwich filled with the creme patissiere  that's used for Napoleons. In fact, the dessert is a rendition of the classic  Napoleon, only using cookies instead of puff paste.  </P> <P> A pool of raspberry sauce was the perfect flavor mate for the orange-flavored  cookies, which the French call tuiles aux amandes, because they resemble roof  tiles. These cookies often appear as after-dinner sweet nibbles in the form of  broomstick rolls, curved tiles, cornets or other shapes, thanks to their  pliability while still warm.  </P> <P> Unlike the noisettes, which require a complicated sauce and ingredients that  only a restaurant chef would bother to deal with (such as a brown sauce made  with lamb bones and stock), the cookie dessert is a great idea for home bakers  who enjoy entertaining.  </P> <P> What an impressive company dessert it is. The lace cookies are rather scary to  attempt at first try, but once you have the hang of handling the baked cookie  and know what to expect, they are as easy as any cookie to make. Once out of  the oven lace cookies are either molded or allowed to cool flat on the pan.  Cooling causes them to become brittle and no molding is possible unless  rewarmed. These cookies are flat so no special handling is required. A little  practice will help, however, before tackling the real thing for the big day.  </P> <P> The creme patissiere can be made from scratch. But some chefs (not Guillon, you  can wager) cheat a bit by using packaged pudding mix with some whipped cream  folded in. It looks and tastes like the homemade creme patissiere, but it  isn't. Restaurant pastry chefs make mountains of the creme patissiere to use as  needed so no recipe was given. We'll share our tricky recipe using packaged  mix. No one will ever know.  </P> <P> The coulis used by the pastry chef for this recipe is made with raspberry juice  and clear caramel, another restaurant procedure hard to duplicate at home. So  we substituted raspberry puree and corn syrup with good results.  </P> <P> CROUSTILLANT DE FRAMBOISES ET LE COULIS  </P> <P> 1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon orange juice  </P> <P> Grated zest of 1 orange  </P> <P> 2 1/2 tablespoons Grand Marnier  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups powdered sugar  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons butter, melted  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups finely chopped almonds  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons flour  </P> <P> Creme Patissiere  </P> <P> 1/2 pint raspberries  </P> <P> Raspberry Coulis  </P> <P> Mint leaves  </P> <P> Whipped cream, optional  </P> <P> Mix together orange juice and zest, Grand Marnier, powdered sugar, butter,  almonds and flour to form soft dough. Let stand 30 minutes.  </P> <P> Pinch off pieces about 2/3-inch in diameter (size of nut), and place on  non-stick baking sheet, about 3 inches apart. Bake at 375 degrees until  browned, about 4 to 5 minutes, watching carefully to prevent scorching. Remove  from baking when slightly cool. Cool completely on wire racks.  </P> <P> Place lace cookie in center of plate. Top with dollop of Creme Patissiere and  few raspberries. Layer with another cookie round. Top with more cream and  raspberries. Top with third cookie round. Decorate with few raspberries and  mint leaves.  </P> <P> Surround with Raspberry Coulis and decorate with pipings of whipped cream.  Makes 12 cookies.  </P> <P> Creme Patissiere  </P> <P> 1 (3 1/8-ounce) package vanilla pudding and pie filling mix  </P> <P> Dash vanilla  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon powdered sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> Prepare vanilla pudding mix according to package directions. Set aside.  </P> <P> Stir vanilla and powdered sugar into whipping cream and whip until stiff. Fold  into pudding until well incorporated. Makes 2 1/2 cups.  </P> <P> Raspberry Coulis  </P> <P> 2 (10-ounce) packages frozen raspberries, thawed  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon corn syrup  </P> <P> Powdered sugar  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons Cointreau  </P> <P> Press raspberries through sieve or strainer, discarding seeds. Add corn syrup  and powdered sugar to sweeten as desired. Add Cointreau. Makes 1 3/4 cups.  </P></p>

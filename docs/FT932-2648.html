			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (9): A base in the light fittings market / Review of the return of Philips after 43 years Philips, the Dutch electronics and electrical group, was one of the foreign companies which seized the chance to return to Poland when the communist regime collapsed. Ending a 43-year break in close relations with Poland, forced by the nationalisation of the company's operations in 1948, the Dutch group established its base in the former eastern bloc in mid-1991. The re-entry came through the purchase of a majority interest in Polam-Pila, a lighting equipment manufacturer which, like so much of Polish industry, was floundering for survival at the time of privatisation. Philips paid Dollars 16m for a 51 per cent stake in the plant at Pila, 320km north-west of Warsaw, and was granted a further 15.6 per cent interest worth Dollars 5m in return for raising the plant and its surrounding area to EC environmental standards. The stake was subsequently boosted to 87 per cent by the purchase of a 20 per cent slice from employees. These shares were sold to employees by the state at half the price paid by Philips. The remaining shares are in the hands of the state treasury. Philips also won a three-year tax holiday on profits - this runs until midway through next year - and the right to have a 15 per cent duty waived on imported machinery and equipment worth up to Fl37m and delivered in Poland by the end of the year. The transfer of ownership has bot been without difficulty. The terms were criticised as being too generous and a short industrial dispute followed the decision of the Dutch company to freeze wages against employees' expectations and contrary to the example of several other foreign groups which entered Poland at the same time. But with this phase behind it the plant has become Philips's base for eastern European expansion in the light fittings market. Its proximity to the former Soviet Union and the associations established there in the previous two decades are expected to offer it an especially high potential across eastern frontier. Mr Stanislaw Kozlowski, the president of the Polish company says that 'the Russian market is our destiny.' At present 58 per cent of sales are to export markets. Of this total the US and the UK buy a combined 48 per cent with the former Soviet Union ranking down the list with other European and Arab countries. Incandescent lamp fittings, its main product, scores a significantly higher proportion of export sales than fluorescent fittings and luminaries. The Dutch company said earlier this year that its overall Polish operations returned a net profit of Z75.4bn (Dollars 4.8m)in 1992. The result comes from sales of Z777.5bn, of which Z647.2bn was generated by the Pila plant. The plant in Pila was the biggest state-owned producers of lighting equipment at the time of the takeover but inefficient production and a mountain of debt had driven it to the wall. Throughout the last two decades its state-designated function was as a generator of foreign currency through exports. Heavy local bank loans were ploughed in to sustain production, with little likelihood of their repayment after servicing charges. The debt has been reduced dramatically since the takeover, but interest payments remain a drain on the company. In order to reach into the international markets during the 1970s and 1980s, Polam Pila sought to establish ties with world indsutry leaders for the purchase of equipment and advice. But these overtures were repeatedly rejected, partly because of a concern that the technology might be passed on to third parties, especially the then Soviet Union. Desperate for a much-needed new glass plant, the Poles were forced to turn to Toshiba of Japan, which completed a Dollars 25m project in 1984. The Toshiba plant reached contractual standards, but has been virtually scrapped and replaced with Philips equipment since the takeover, in an important part of the plan to elevate production efficiency. Mr Kozlowski says that this decision demonstrates the importance of becoming a part of one of the world's industry leaders and so share in the latest technology. Philips's historic ties in Poland, coupled with informal links in the two previous decades, made the Dutch group a natural potential buyer as the market in the former eastern bloc became split among the world's leaders. Osram, a subsidiary of Siemens, is negotiating the purchase of Tesla in what was formerly Czechoslovakia; and GE bought Tungsram in Hungry. Mr Kozlowski says that the much bigger GE deal, which has run into significant problems, has been instructive. Philips, unlike GE, has not attempted a big, immediate about-face in management and production techniques; where possible, local management has been retained - to a point where foreigners have only a token presence in specialist areas.</p>

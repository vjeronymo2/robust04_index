			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: QVC claims higher Paramount bid QVC Network, the television shopping group, claimed yesterday to have submitted a higher offer than rival Viacom in Monday's sealed bid auction of Paramount Communications. However, analysts cautioned that the Dollars 10bn takeover battle was still far from settled. The Paramount board met yesterday but recessed without taking any action on the bids. A company spokesman declined to discuss details of the meeting. The board will recommend one of the offers to investors. Shareholders will be free to accept either and each of the bidders will be able to improve its terms for a limited time after starting a formal tender offer for Paramount's stock. Before Monday's auction QVC's offer was worth around Dollars 10.1bn, compared with Dollars 9.6bn from Viacom. Mr Barry Diller, QVC chairman, made only a slight increase on Monday in the value of his offer, apparently out of concern that he did not bid up against himself. Despite this, QVC said yesterday it had been advised by Paramount that 'it is the high bidder'. Viacom declined immediate comment. QVC has added around Dollars 100m to the value of its cash tender offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's stock, increasing the bid from Dollars 90 a share to Dollars 92. For the remaining 49 per cent of the company, it is offering 1.43 shares of QVC stock per Paramount share, the same as under its previous bid, and a revised preference stock offer. This now consists of 0.32 shares of non-convertible stock, with a dividend of 6 per cent, compared with a convertible with a 5 per cent dividend. The new bid also includes 0.32 warrants a share to purchase QVC common stock at Dollars 70.34. QVC said the increase in the cash component of its bid gave Paramount shareholders the benefit of its victory earlier this month in the Delaware Supreme Court, which insisted that Paramount create a level playing field between Viacom, its preferred suitor, and hostile bidder QVC. The court criticised a Dollars 100m fee Paramount agreed to pay Viacom if their merger agreement was not consummated, but the Supreme Court allowed this to stand because QVC had not explicitly asked for it to be struck down. Nevertheless, QVC's attorneys believe the Supreme Court stance means it can get the payment invalidated by simply applying to a lower Delaware court.</p>

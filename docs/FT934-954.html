			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Labour admits it held BNP inquiry The Labour party was yesterday forced on to the defensive when it admitted that its inquiry into the Tower Hamlets racism row had failed to identify who had leaked 'inaccurate' canvass returns. These had talked up the chances of the British National party winning the recent by-election in the London borough. The party yesterday confirmed that the Bow and Poplar branch, under instructions from the Greater London Labour party, held an inquiry into the leaking of the canvass returns which failed to identify the culprit. Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrats' campaign co-ordinator, asked why the Labour inquiry had not been open and why its existence had been denied by Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman. Mr Straw recently said that Labour had had no internal inquiry because 'there was nothing to inquire into'. However, Labour yesterday said there had been an inquiry into 'the mechanisms of the campaign' which it said was different to the Liberal Democrats' inquiry into racism. The Liberal Democrats' inquiry recommended the expulsion of three party members after controversial leaflets were published.</p>

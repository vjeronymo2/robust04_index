			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries After an agonisingly long wait, Lucas has finally got its man. It is more than a year since the company renewed its search for a chief executive to replace the retiring Sir Anthony Gill, and two years since the quest originally started. As a new leader for Lucas Mr George Simpson is a near-perfect candidate. His experience in helping to transform Rover will be invaluable, as will his aircraft industry connections with British Aerospace, so it is a pity that Lucas did not find him earlier. The delay will have done little to boost morale and, in that context, it is unfortunate that BAe now wishes to hang on to him until May. Still, however belatedly, Mr Simpson is just the man to take the difficult decisions which Lucas faces. The company will have to examine how many expensive development projects it can afford to fund. Its applied technology division may need further rationalisation. Most importantly, he will need to motivate and encourage the management team to turn the company round in much the same way that he did at Rover. All of that should underpin Lucas's nascent recovery. Unfortunately for the incoming chief executive, the company's share price already discounts most of probable earnings gains over the next two years. He may thus have to wait for his efforts to be reflected in the stock market. BAe, meanwhile, has suffered a heavy blow. Yet given Mr Simpson's talent for promoting good people to support him, it should be able to make good the loss.</p>

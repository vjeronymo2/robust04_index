			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Swedish Elections: Swedes offered few promises on jobs Some Swedish companies used to employ 30 per cent more staff than they needed - just to cover for those who did not turn up to work on a particular day. During the three-year recession, absenteeism declined dramatically and a shake-out in companies helped to speed up the increase in unemployment. In the run-up to Sweden's election on Sunday, even the optimists have accepted that the country will never return to the halcyon days of the late 1980s when unemployment was below 2 per cent. Although much of the election campaign has centred on the state of the public finances, unemployment has been a recurrent theme in public meetings and in the valstugas - the street corner huts erected in their thousands by political parties at election time. Sweden's unemployment has soared to 14 per cent (including those on training schemes) from below 5 per cent in just three years. This has played havoc with state finances because of lower tax revenues and heavy funding costs. It is also an unprecedented trauma in a country with little experience of unemployment. The country's current plight represents one of the biggest failures of the Swedish model which was supposed to deliver job security in return for labour market restraint. The multinationals laid off as many as 20 per cent of their employees between 1991 and 1993 to improve productivity and regain competitiveness. With the economy recovering, there is clear evidence that unemployment is past its peak. But 600,000 people are still out of work, including those on training schemes. Last year the problem cost Sweden SKr82bn (Pounds 6.8bn), or 5.7 per cent of GDP, a level only exceeded by Finland and Denmark in the OECD area, and accounted for nearly half the entire budget deficit. None of the parties is offering dramatic or easy solutions. The Social Democrats, who look likely to return to power, have detailed a specific programme for creating 90,000 new jobs in their first year of office, emphasising infrastructure programmes and favourable tax treatment for investments. The ruling centre-right coalition wants to improve the overall business climate, saying it can create 500,000 new private sector jobs by the end of the century. What unites the parties is a common acceptance that the new jobs will have to be found in the private sector. This in itself is a breakthrough in a country which saw all of its employment growth between 1960 and 1993 derive from the public sector. What distinguishes the programmes is emphasis. The Social Democrats believe active government policies can have an impact, even in the short term. But they differentiate companies from their owners, giving the former much more favourable tax treatment. Government policies are more long-term, and there is more stress on providing incentives for the start-up of new business. One reason for urgency is that Sweden wants to tackle long-term unemployment before it becomes entrenched. This is why the Social Democrats reject the type of tough fiscal and monetary strategy pursued by Denmark in the 1980s because they say it has led to a permanently high level of long-term unemployment. If they act now, they believe, they can stop labour market bottlenecks stimulating inflation when unemployment falls to a certain level, the so-called non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. Ms Mona Sahlin, the Social Democrats' party secretary, says: 'Everyone knows that the longer people are doing nothing the harder it is to get them back into the workforce. We must avoid long-term structural unemployment.' Backing up this emphasis, her party aims to ensure that young people are not out of work for more than 100 days. There is a belief that the upturn in the economic cycle will at least get the unemployment figure down to half its current level. But will it? US experience suggests that most job creation in a modern western economy comes from services. And it is here that Sweden clearly has further to go, partly because there is a cultural resistance to the creation of a low-wage service sector. Opponents say pejoratively that they don't want to turn the country into a 1920s-style 'maid' society. There is also resistance to any further lowering of unemployment benefits, which have already been cut from 90 per cent to 80 per cent of former salary. Mr Lars Jagren, an economist with the Federation of Swedish Industries, believes Sweden will have to look again at both wage differentials and unemployment benefits if it wants to make real progress on unemployment. 'We have still not solved the crisis,' he believes, 'because we have still not accepted the changes needed to avoid long-term unemployment.'</p>

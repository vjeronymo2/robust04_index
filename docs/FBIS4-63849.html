			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Agafonov report: "Restricted Shokhin, or Moscow </F> Vaudeville Act"]    [Text] Seoul -- At the end of last week another spasm  occurred in Russian foreign policy: The talks with Seoul over  the whole range of trade and economic relations, pegged to the  South Korean president's visit to Moscow, were suddenly called  off. Although the leadership's active desire to hush up this  affair and to avoid great publicity can be observed, there is no  getting away from this extraordinary occurrence, and it is  necessary to speak of it.    Russian diplomacy, writhing in convulsions brought on by the  capricious situation at home and by unprofessionalism, has  valiantly disgraced itself once again, having made even doubters  come to believe that the problem of saving the face, prestige,  and reputation of a civilized, stable partner in contacts with  the outside world is either secondary or simply does not exist  for the present Russian political elite.    We spat right in our own eye in the manner of a cheap  vaudeville act: Just a few hours before the Russian delegation  was due to arrive in Seoul (a special flight was planned for  almost 50 high-ranking people, including several ministers and  governors) Moscow informed the Koreans that Vice Premier  Shokhin, head of the mission and cochairman of the bilateral  intergovernmental Committee for Economic and  Scientific-Technical Cooperation, could not leave his workplace  because of some internal circumstances, and the delegation would  hardly travel without its head; then another report arrived from  Moscow, imparting the news that the measure which the sides had  been working selflessly to prepare for almost two years would  still take place, only instead of Shokhin, who is burdened with  sudden difficulties, another vice premier -- Yarov -- would be  in charge. True, Yarov is not particularly knowledgeable about  Russian-Korean economic affairs but, on the other hand, he is of  appropriate rank and is not bound by circumstances. Finally,  two or three hours later, the "Yarov version" also fell through  -- the Koreans were notified definitely that the Russian  delegation would not appear in Seoul at all....    Moscow's odd feint, which struck the Koreans to the very  bottom of their oriental soul, was at first perceived in Seoul  as a symptom of a sharp exacerbation of the internal political  crisis in Russia, threatening major reshuffles in the Kremlin  corridors and other large-scale upheavals minute by minute.  Instead of upheavals, however, Shokhin participated in  Russian-Finnish talks and other measures, the Council of  Ministers met on schedule, and enigmatic Russian life clearly  had no intention of becoming unsettled. This made the puzzled  Koreans look for other explanations, engage in soul-searching,  and urgently analyze how Seoul could have angered Moscow so  greatly. The nerve-racking work ended in the conclusion that  the Korean side had provided no grounds on the eve of the summit  meeting for a cooling or, still less, the wrecking of the  intergovernmental talks. When it became crystal clear that no  other interpretation could be found for the surprise from  Moscow, except that "restricted movement" status had been  imposed on Vice Premier Shokhin, emotions flared in Seoul. The  Koreans regarded our nice vaudeville act as an insult.    Just two factors have kept bilateral relations from major  complications and a flat spin. The first, main factor is the  aforementioned visit to Russia of Korean President Kim Yong-sam,  which is scheduled for 1 June and remains on the agenda. The  second is Yeltsin's personal message to Kim Yong-sam apologizing  for the omission and assuring him that the calling off of the  talks has no bearing on the bilateral dialogue. As is our  custom, the letter did not arrive prior to the extraordinary  occurrence but 24 hours after it, only after an adverse squall  had swept through the Korean press.    It is clearly too soon to regard the incident as closed. The  thing is that the called-off talks were conceived not only for  the sake of inaugurating the intergovernmental Committee for  Economic Cooperation but also as a kind of lightning conductor  -- the sides were to have discussed in detail a number of  complex issues in bilateral affairs so as not to submit them  "raw" to the meeting of the two presidents. Central to these  issues are the problem of Russia's failure to repay its debts  relating to Korean credits, the question of compensation for  those who died on board the downed Korean Boeing, and other far  from cheerful issues. Since the lightning conductor has not  worked, Moscow must be prepared for all this to surface in the  summit talks and not improve the climate there. Another nuance  is a purely personnel one. Both in Gaydar's cabinet and in  Chernomyrdin's government the economic part of the Korean  salient was entrusted to Shokhin, who visited Seoul repeatedly  and "ran" bilateral affairs. The present misfire with regard to  his trip to Korea will inevitably freeze the very figure of  Shokhin for Seoul and undermine its trust in him, unless Yeltsin  personally rehabilitates his vice premier within the next few  days.    The biggest ricochet -- the severe blow to the prestige of  Russian diplomacy and the undermining of the reputation as a  reliable and stable partner -- will have to be kept in mind  until "better times," since, as practice shows, Russia does not  yet wish to learn from its own mistakes. Seoul believes,  incidentally, that such "better times" will inevitably come in  Moscow.    It remains to add that Poltoranin, former vice premier and  current parliamentarian, has been noticed in Seoul instead of  the restricted Vice Premier Shokhin. He has been noticed in the  trading rows in the market. Diverse sources, however, are so  far failing to mention the purpose of Poltoranian's visit to  Korea. Surely not a new vaudeville act?...</p>

Documents determining the nuclear-free status of Ukraine were  signed at the tripartite consultative (?) meeting in Moscow. We  had already written in the last issue of NEZAVISIMOST that these  decisions had been determined in advance, as attested by the  words of A. Kozyrev, minister of foreign affairs of Russia, who  by no means considers the tripartite accords the main result of  the Moscow summit, and the very vague statement of L. Kravchuk  at the news conference in Borispol, which may be formulated  briefly approximately thus: Ukraine cannot go against the wishes  of the main world powers.    Well, let us once again spread out the cards in the nuclear  solitaire to better understand what kind of legacy we are  renouncing. And why.  <H5>  Arsenal No 3 </H5>   The reader who has been following the problem closely might  have noticed that Ukraine's nuclear potential has frequently  been defined as third in importance after the United States and  Russia. What did this arsenal No. 3 represent?    Of the components of the strategic triad (ground-based and  sea- and air-launched missiles), the first and the third were  represented here. Broadly speaking, each element of the triad  worked for the others, complementing and mutually reinforcing  the others.    Strategic offensive arms (SOA) in the system of the Ministry  of Defense of the former USSR were always considered the "holy  of holies." In all the years that I have been writing on  military matters not once have I spent time on operational duty  in units of the strategic missile forces or on a nuclear-powered  submarine equipped with ballistic missiles. Nonetheless, I  learned a great deal in those, "stagnation," times. Although the  main information was still obtained when the disarmament process  was actively under way.    Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM's) were rightly  considered the basis of the Soviet SOA. Those in the fixed-site  category were deployed in launch silos--most intricate  underground structures capable of withstanding a nuclear blast.  The shaft of the silo is covered by a special metal roof, and  the launch canister, fitted with a reliable shock-absorption  system, is capable of withstanding colossal impact. The  post-boost section of the Soviet missiles could carry from 1 to  10 nuclear warheads.    Almost one-fifth of the warheads of the ground-based  component of the triad is deployed in Ukraine. This is more than  the nuclear warheads of Britain and France put together. Two  ICBM bases are known. SS-19's are based in Pervomaysk of  Nikolayev Oblast, as in the environs of Khmelnitskiy. These are  quite powerful two-stage liquid-fuel rockets. A very important  detail: The three-stage solid-fuel SS-24's--the main part of the  Soviet ICBM's of this type of silo basing--are deployed in  Pervomaysk also. It is these missiles that were manufactured in  Pavlodar, which is in the Dnepropetrovsk region. And SS-18's are  manufactured in Dnepropetrovsk itself, at the celebrated  Yuzhmash. These missiles, the world's only heavy type, were with  good reason christened Satan. Each of them is capable of  delivering to target up to 10 one-megaton warheads.    The air component of the triad, less significant (but with  its advantages), was composed of heavy bombers capable of  carrying nuclear bombs or long-range nuclear cruise missiles.  Note that each "cruise" could carry one nuclear warhead, but  each bomber could be fitted with 16 such missiles. There are two  major heavy bomber air bases in Ukraine--in Kiev and Poltava  Oblasts.    Although we have no test ranges or centers for instruction  in  work with ICBM's, there is a facility for converting and  eliminating ICBM's in Sarny.  <H5>  Heroic Surmounting of Difficulties </H5>   In May 1992 in Lisbon the heads of the foreign policy  departments of the four "nuclear" republics of the former USSR  and the U.S. secretary of state signed a protocol to the  Soviet-American Treaty on Strategic Offensive Arms (START I),  which was to have been followed by the ratification of START I  by the parliaments of these states. Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and  Belarus not only confirmed the USSR's START Treaty obligations  but also undertook to completely eliminate the strategic  offensive arms deployed on their territory within seven years.  In addition, the three states promised to subscribe to the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as nuclear-free states. This  step afforded Russia the opportunity to lay claim to the status  of "sole legitimate nuclear successor of the USSR."    Handsome gestures, splendid declarations.... How much in our  history have we lost on account of the ineradicable passion for  political posturing! Without murmur, almost, we allowed the  tactical nuclear weapons on our territory to be withdrawn. And  although in March 1992 L. Kravchuk announced a suspension of the  withdrawal of the tactical nuclear weapons, many observers  merely smiled ironically at this inasmuch as they believed that  the withdrawal was wholly controlled by Moscow. In addition,  from the formal viewpoint this decision of the president's was  contrary to the declaration on the nuclear-free status of  Ukraine. Thus was the first step en route to the world  community's distrust of Ukraine's ability to keep its word taken.    The euphoria from the proclamation of independence caused  problems. We should, oh how we should, have consulted  specialists. And then, perhaps, events would have developed  differently. While having agreed to the destruction of our part  of the SOA's, we could perfectly well have kept for ourselves  the tactical missiles. We would not here have acquired so mighty  an opponent as the United States (the strategic missiles  deployed in Ukraine are targeted against the United States, and  fighting Russia with them is impossible). The nuclear warheads  would not have needed to be replaced for a very long time or the  missiles could have been converted to deliver point weapons,  say. There would doubtless have been problems in the  international arena here also. Nonetheless, I believe that  mobile and efficient tactical nuclear weapons would have been  far more suitable for us from the viewpoint of deterrence than  the strategic missiles, which are not only a target for the  ICBM's of a probable enemy but which also, if launched, would  cause the deaths of the inhabitants of the villages in the  vicinity of the silos.    But the tactical missiles were removed, and only then did  the  bargaining over compensation begin. Bitter arguments arose over  the SOA's also. In a word, the Ukrainian state followed the  distressingly well-known principle: Having initially created the  difficulties, it set about heroically overcoming them.  <H5>  `For'... </H5>   The West's policy in regard to the nuclear weapons that  constitute the legacy of the USSR has in this time been quite  clearly defined. This is how it was formulated by B. Clinton:  Europe would be more stable were Russia to be the sole nuclear  power-successor of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, certain  political scientists advocated Ukraine's nuclear status. They  adduced as the main argument the historically difficult  relations between Ukraine and Russia. Giving our country serious  guarantees of its security was proposed, therefore. Forecasting  the course of events, the scholars examined several possible  causes of a significant deterioration in the mutual relations of  Ukraine and Russia. They include the common unprotected border,  the danger of hyper-nationalism, an escalation of existing  tensions (Crimea, the Black Sea Fleet), and the problem of  Russians in Ukraine and Ukrainians in Russia.    The supporters of nuclear deterrence believe that Ukraine's  nuclear weapons could be an effective means against an attack  involving the use of conventional armed forces or against  nuclear blackmail. Their arguments were approximately as  follows: In the pre-nuclear world between 1900 and 1945 there  were two world wars, in which approximately 50 million Europeans  died. In the nuclear era only 15,000 Europeans died in small  wars between 1945 and 1990. And to speak of the superpowers, on  the other hand, there was a stable peace between them. It is  nuclear weapons, in their opinion, that have been the firm basis  of this peace (the concept of "nuclear stalemate," when neither  side can win inasmuch as it would itself perish, is well known).  <H5>  ...and `Against' </H5>   Who could have guaranteed that Russia would have handed over  to us its nuclear weapons unimpeded? After all, we are not in  command of them even now, essentially. Would we have had the  experience and wisdom sufficient for correctly disposing of the  nuclear legacy of the USSR? Their storage and maintenance have  constituted a serious problem. And were we, for all that, to  take over the command and control of the SOA's, Russia would  know full well how to paralyze the launch complexes, and nuclear  espionage would develop to exaggerated proportions, which would  only poison the two countries' mutual relations. Add the  political instability in Ukraine: What if forces that might want  to make use of the missiles were to come to power?    It is most unlikely, observers believe, that nuclear weapons  could resolve all the problems of Ukraine's security. The  missiles of the nuclear powers would be retargeted on it in an  instant. It is perfectly possible that the possession of SOA's  would lead Ukraine's leaders into the temptation to brandish the  "nuclear nightstick" a little. And preservation of the nuclear  status would hardly contribute to our country's integration in  the European process. And in conclusion, some calculations. Were  Ukraine to want to become a medium-sized nuclear power (like  France or Britain), it would have to spend up to $5 billion  annually on its nuclear programs.    According to some estimates, Ukraine would need no fewer  than  10 years and expenditure put at hundreds of billions of dollars  to make good the supplies of components and fuel for the missile  plants, create its own enterprises manufacturing nuclear  warheads and guidance systems, and develop the facilities and  methods of the control and safe operation of strategic systems  and an early-warning system, space-based missile-targeting  facilities, and sites for testing nuclear munitions, spacecraft  launches, and missile testing (it would, in addition, be  necessary to obtain the consent of neighboring countries to the  flight over their territory of the missiles being tested).  <H5>  Blackmail and Threats </H5>   Peering into the future, political scientists have observed  that the basis of the new multipolar Europe will be rivalry  between Germany and Russia in the field of security. An  independent Ukraine could ease this rivalry. It is, after all, a  considerable barrier between Germany and Russia. But take away  this key barrier, and the borders of the two strongest states of  Europe draw closer for there are weak countries between them,  after all. Thus Ukraine becomes an arena of new political  rivalry.    In the case of the nuclear weapons it is absolutely clear  that Russia (and, broadly speaking, the United States inasmuch  as it is the latter that is the rival of Germany in the world,  as Russia is in Europe) has bested the FRG. Everything has been  used to achieve this goal: from disinformation of world public  opinion and economic blackmail through a refusal to maintain  Ukraine's nuclear arsenals, despite current agreements.  <H5>  One Further Option </H5>   At the time when Russia was attacking Ukraine's nuclear  policy "on all azimuths," in de Gaulle's well-known expression,  the United States was deafeningly silent. But this could not  have lasted long, and new approaches were manifested at the time  of Les Aspin's visit to Kiev, apparently. What was Ukraine's  nuclear potential at that time? Some 130 SS-19 missiles (six  warheads each), 46 SS-24's (10 warheads each), and 30 strategic  bombers, which all together can carry 416 bombs. It was rumored  that Ukraine could aspire to definitive control of the strategic  bombers and could launch those SS-24's that had been built in  our country. And, indeed, had things turned out differently,  this could have been a prospective program. Even in this case  Ukraine's nuclear potential would have remained the third in the  world.    There is reason to believe that these matters were discussed  during the negotiations with Les Aspin. It was at this time that  the idea of international control of the nuclear warheads from  the missiles stood down from alert status, which would have been  warehoused on the territory of Ukraine until a decision on the  amounts of compensation for them had been adopted, was advanced.    Observers allow that Aspin's negotiations were a deft  maneuver aimed at increasing the political isolation of Ukraine  as a "latter-day European aggressor." This worked in the Western  press. Many publications appeared on this subject.    This is why B. Clinton's speech in Brussels and,  subsequently, his meetings in Kiev and Moscow assumed the nature  of a sensation.  <H5>  Way Out of the Impasse. But Which? </H5>   Ukraine has, for all that, I believe, emerged from the  impasse to which it had been brought by irresponsible petty  "peacemaker" politicians. Russia has agreed to compensation for  the withdrawn tactical nuclear weapons, the amounts of which  will be determined by experts. On the basis of an agreement  between Ukraine and Russia the uranium from the warheads of our  strategic missiles will be compensated by fuel for the nuclear  power stations. Technical assistance in the dismantling will be  rendered. Ukraine's rating in the international arena has risen.  Economic assistance has been promised. True, all this is  possible, in my view, only if Ukraine sails, if not in the wake  of Russian (or, rather, Russian-American) policy, at least a  parallel course.    And whereas what we noticed at the meeting in Borispol was  our president's forced smile, in Moscow it was his shifty eyes.  Of what was agreed there is, as before, much that is unclear.  The security guarantees, for example. The Treaty on Nuclear  Nonproliferation cannot be deemed such on account of the  imprecision and vagueness of the wording contained therein. L.  Kravchuk's references to the "honest word" of the presidents of  the United States and Russia are naive.    Or take the problem of the missile silos. How are they to be  destroyed? Explosions would cause the region's ecology  irreparable damage.    One way or another, the deed is done. In acquiring (de  facto)  nuclear-free status Ukraine is, it would seem, losing part of  its independence. Ukraine has never yet throughout its history  been absolutely independent, for that matter. The question is to  what extent and on whom we will be dependent today.</p>

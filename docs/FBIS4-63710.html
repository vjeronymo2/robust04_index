			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 506] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, May 24, ELTA -- Russian Federation Embassy  in Lithuania gave over to ELTA the statement of the Russian  Foreign Ministry concerning the 4th session of the Baltic  Assembly.    The statement said: "The results of the 4th session of the  Baltic Assembly have confirmed Russia's fears that normalization  and further development of relations between Russia and the  three Baltic countries were not included into the plans of  certain political forces in these states.    "Although there are real problems concerning the situation  of  the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and Estonia...  parliamentaries of the three countries decided to accept the so  called common statement 'On Russia's pressure on the Baltic  states'. It is quite evident they were not looking for  constructive decisions, necessary for the negotiations with  Estonia, but were led by purely political motives.    "The resolution on the relations with Russian Federation  went  even further. Calling Russia to admit there are 'unresolved  territorial questions' and to bear the responsibility for damage  done to the Baltic states since 1940 and to compensate it, the  parliamentaries made a dangerous step -- they are trying to  transfer events of these years from historical plane to that of  financial, material, etc. claims to Russian Federation,  although Russia is not and will not be responsible for actions  made by Stalin's regime.    "The Baltic Assembly proved some Baltic politicians try to  find new pretexts to base their anti-Russian policies instead of  historical estimations of the past events", the statement said.</p>

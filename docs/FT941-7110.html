			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: 'Arrogance' of west riles a maverick - Malaysia today / Malaysia's ban on state contracts for British companies in protest at reports of corruption by the UK media has taken John Major's government by surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau dam affair. FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of the troubles now facing UK companies To many in the west, Dr Mahathir Mohamad might seem a maverick. The Malaysian prime minister's action against Britain might seem out of proportion to the offence Malaysia says the British media has committed. Dr Mahathir has made outspoken attacks on the west on a range of issues. He, and Malaysia generally, have gained a reputation as difficult to deal with. Dr Mahathir does not care. 'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be famous,' said Dr Mahathir recently. But at the same time the Malaysian prime minister has shown himself sensitive to criticism. Despite Dr Mahathir's firm grip on power, reports do circulate of large scale financial scandals and pay-offs. A government anti-corruption agency is widely perceived as ineffective. Politics and business are closely interlinked in Malaysia: Dr Mahathir's United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant political party in Malaysia, exercises enormous power over the corporate sector. Foreign companies operating in Malaysia find that connections are all important to winning business deals. The concept of conflicts of interest between state and corporate sectors rarely applies. But behind Dr Mahathir's attacks on the west, there is another message: Malaysia, and other fast developing countries in east Asia, are growing increasingly intolerant of what they consider to be the patronising and arrogant behaviour of the west. 'We believe the foreign media must learn the fact that developing countries, including a country led by a brown Moslem, have the ability to manage their own affairs successfully,' said Mr Anwar Ibrahim, deputy prime minister, yesterday. Malaysia's economy has grown more than 8 per cent in each of the past six years. The Kuala Lumpur stock exchange is one of the biggest in east Asia. Malaysia makes its own cars and is a leading computer parts manufacturer. Economic success has bred confidence, some would say arrogance. Dr Mahathir believes in strong leadership. He rejects western ideas of press freedom. He attacks western attitudes on human rights questions. He rails against what he perceives to be - as in this instance - interference in Malaysia's internal affairs. Dr Mahathir has some powerful supporters. Indonesia and Singapore and China would have very similar views. Within Malaysia the prime minister probably has more to gain than lose from this fracas. While Dr Mahathir is perhaps not liked by all Malaysians he is respected by many. They see him as the great moderniser - the man who has propelled the country towards industrialisation and greater prosperity. The Malaysian opposition is small and ineffective. But it has created some government angst by questioning senior officials about British media allegations of corruption in high places. The Malaysian media is very carefully controlled and the message that Dr Mahathir, and the Malaysian people, have been insulted by the British press is being pressed home. With general elections likely this year, Dr Mahathir might be hoping the move against Britain will rally domestic political support. But this should not be overemphasised. Dr Mahathir's national front coalition would appear certain of victory in any poll. Dr Mahathir is not a man for turning. It took more than six years for Britain to persuade the Malaysian leader to change his 'Buy British Last' policy of the early 80s. A personal friendship which developed between Dr Mahathir and Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, was largely responsible for healing ties. But Dr Mahathir and Mr Major are not close. Mr Major was angered by a forthright attack on British policy on Bosnia made by Dr Mahathir during a visit to Kuala Lumpur late last year. Bosnia is a subject on which Dr Mahathir holds very strong views: little common ground seems to exist between the two leaders. It is very difficult to see how relations can be brought back to normal. Yesterday Mr Anwar said he was not expecting or seeking any apologies from the British government. He seemed at a loss to suggest what could be done. But he was clear that Malaysia would continue with its action against British companies.</p>

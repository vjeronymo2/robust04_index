			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETROSPECTIVES / POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> LED ZEPPELIN: THINGS HAVE COME FULL CIRCLE  </P> <P> More than 15 years after Led Zeppelin released its last listenable album  ("Physical Graffiti") and 11 after the band released anything new at all,  Robert Plant's keening wail still threatens to follow any Warrant or Guns N'  Roses song on any rock radio station anywhere. The arty Zep-isms of neo-metal  also rule college radio.  </P> <P> The half-dozen or so Zeppelin songs that still get saturation airplay sound  terrific: intense and bluesy, powerful and dark, riffy and individual.  Posterity has been kind to the Zep.  </P> <P> Atlantic Records just released "Led Zeppelin," a comprehensive Box Set of the  Gods, nearly five CD hours of remastered Zeppelin, Inc., complete with arcane  runic cover art and a trio of hagiographic liner-note essays from Rolling Stone  magazine all-stars.  </P> <P> Do we need five hours of the stuff? Ten years ago, five minutes would've seemed  too much.  </P> <P> In the spring of 1980, playing a version of "Communication Breakdown" could get  you thrown off the stage at the Anticlub or your nose broken at the beach-punk  Fleetwood. Two minutes of "Black Dog" could empty any hip dorm party in the  land.  </P> <P> At a time when a night of rock 'n' roll could mean anything from  neo-retro-country to a bunch of art students attacking oil drums with belt  sanders, Led Zeppelin was about the only taboo . . . well, Led Zeppelin and  disco -- and the Pet Shop Boys would soon bring disco back bigger than ever.  (Punk bands could, and did, play even Black Sabbath songs with impunity.)  </P> <P> Turgid stadium rock had so poisoned rock 'n' roll by that point that almost  anything that wasn't Zeppelin sounded fresh. Well-crafted pop felt new again --  listening to the Kinks or early Beatles seemed like a revolutionary act -- and  so did the unaffected heavy metal of bands like Iron Maiden and Def Leppard.  </P> <P> Stripped-down, singles-oriented, bombast-free new wave was a specific reaction  to the overblown album rock of Zeppelin and its school. Reggae, ABBA, George  Jones were suddenly cool as well, and "alternative" rock radio meant pretty  much this: no "Stairway to Heaven."  </P> <P> Things have come full circle. Led Zeppelin is now acknowledged to be the  greatest hard-rock band in the history of the world, mostly by people too old  to really appreciate Metallica.  </P> <P> Zep revisionism is understandable. In retrospect, the band represents an era of  rock as surely as Elvis or the Beatles.  </P> <P> Zeppelin was in its time a reaction to the vapid tyranny of the three-minute  single; a decade later, the rock 'n' roll intelligentsia were celebrating the  prospect of a Zep-free planet, and only long-haired, working-class dolts seemed  to prefer "Houses of the Holy" to Prince's "Dirty Mind."  </P> <P> With the '80s, the three-minute radio song became more dominant than it ever  had been in the '60s. Bands like the Go-Go's were not only as popular, but more  credible than their '60s equivalents. Pop singers like Madonna and Michael  Jackson were seen as artists.  </P> <P> Where Led Zeppelin defined the terms for hard-rock bands of the '70s from  Boston to Rush, the tight, commercial sound of Aerosmith became the model for  '80s hard rockers from Van Halen through Guns N' Roses and beyond.  </P> <P> Lyrics in the '80s were about sex, school, the everyday -- not about ancient  Celtic battles. If the new generation of rockers weren't exactly one with its  audience, at least it felt it had to try to be. Zep-style posing -- arched-back  singer, long solos, lyrics that could conceivably be illustrated by Frank  Frazetta -- was just silly, Spinal Tap stuff.  </P> <P> At the end of the decade, the artists most often compared to Zeppelin were  those riffy art bands, Soundgarden and Jane's Addiction, who offered abstract  lyrics, songs based more on moods than hooks, and something of the Zep's sheer  power.  </P> <P> New-metalists Metallica -- who rivaled Zeppelin not only in influence but in  the utter incomprehensibility of their appeal to the uninitiated -- had  rehabilitated not only album-oriented rock but the potent communal high of the  arena concert. A lot of Led Zeppelin suddenly started to sound pretty good.  </P> <P> In light of David Byrne and Peter Gabriel's musical wanderings, the Zep's  penchant for tablas and Celtic folk tunes seems more prescient than  self-indulgent, the sort of thing that would earn them a guest spot on KCRW's  "Morning Becomes Eclectic."  </P> <P> Zep's erratic song structures sound merely eccentric alongside the artful  meanderings of Jane's Addiction. If in interviews Jimmy Page mewled about  Stravinsky and Gustav Holst, he'd at least heard of those composers, which is  more than you can say for most rock stars.  </P> <P> "Led Zeppelin" and "Led Zeppelin II" are in retrospect awesome British blues,  as pure as anything this side of the first Stones album but with a swamp-blues  intensity new to white rock 'n' roll.  </P> <P> "Led Zeppelin III" might have been a failed trope on the misty-heather  acousticisms of Traffic and Pentangle, but led off with the extremely  influential "Immigrant Song." The untitled fourth album, though it included the  stultifyingly pretentious ballad "Battle of Evermore," is the masterpiece of  the genre, as unassailable within the context of '70s hard rock as Marvin  Gaye's "Let's Get It On" is within the context of '70s R&amp;B.  </P> <P> "Houses of the Holy" and "Physical Graffiti" were less consistent -- only half  the songs hit -- though only compared to earlier Zep, not to, say, Bad Company.  (Of everything on the last four albums, only one song, "Nobody's Fault but  Mine," was up to the standards of the first four.)  </P> <P> Time has softened memories of satin bell-bottoms, half-hour drum solos, and  drippy 45-minute versions of "Dazed and Confused" that always climaxed with a  quarter hour of Page's guitar-noise party tricks. Not to mention the inevitable  bass solo on "No Quarter." The universe of bong hits, converted vans and Jimmy  Page posters universally used as white-male-teen wallpaper doesn't seem quite  so awful anymore.  </P> <P> But in a way, the new Led Zeppelin set can remind you of how bloated and  directionless the band's live show used to be -- you can almost imagine  producer Page cuing the re-mastering guy with an outstretched violin bow.  There's about four hours more than anybody really needs, two-thirds of  everything they ever did arranged more or less chronologically, and with only  two of the 54 songs previously unavailable on album.  </P> <P> A better-culled selection might have presented a more coherent portrait of the  band. As it is, you emerge from a couple of hours with these CDs feeling as if  you've been gorging on Chee-tos.  </P> <P> There seems to be less from the first two albums and way more of the late stuff  than the quality of the material dictates. You'd think that a decade of  hindsight would've persuaded Page of the merits of "The Lemon Song" and the  horrors of "Achilles Last Stand."  </P> <P> The sound is richer than the thin, tinny timbre of the currently available CDs.  The track order is mildly interesting -- it's almost shocking to hear  "Heartbreaker" instead of "What Is and What Shall Never Be" roar into your  speakers after "Whole Lotta Love," but the effect is nothing any Zep fan  couldn't do himself with a tape deck and a spare afternoon. Even the two "new"  tracks have been widely available on bootlegs since the early '70s.  </P> <P> Still, there's not a hard-rocker alive who can resist cranking up his Alpine  when the first low moans of "Whole Lotta Love" come blasting across the room.  And maybe that's the way it's supposed to be.  </P></p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Banking on two-way checklist I refer to Ian Hamilton Fazey's article on the subject of NatWest Bank's checklist ('Campari for accountants', June 14). Naturally enough, we also use Campari as our checklist for assessing which bank we wish to use - such assessment should also be two-way. Our version reads as follows: C = Compatibility (It is easier to do business with people who are on your own wavelength); A = Adaptability (We live in a changing world - flexibility is the keynote); M = Managers (We have quality people - likewise, so should the bank); P = Performance (We have to perform, but so do the banks on our behalf); A = Accessibility (We need computer access to our account data); R = Rationality (We run our business on our principles, and not the bank's); I = Interest (No, not what it charges, but its interest in us). Oh, and by the way, when I sit down with our bank manager to enjoy a refreshing Campari, he is from NatWest] Martin Watts, managing director, Campari GB, 45 New Street, Henley on Thames, Oxfordshire RG9 2BP</p>

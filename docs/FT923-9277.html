			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Nippondenso in 25% fall as car demand weakens NIPPONDENSO, Japan's largest maker of electronic and electrical car parts which is affiliated to Toyota Motor, incurred a 25 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y30.42bn (Dollars 239m) for the first half to June, showing the effects of declining domestic car demand. Sales rose 4.3 per cent to Y681.9bn, but the company blamed the fall in earnings partly on an increase in labour costs and research and development spending. It said profits would have been more than halved were it not for rationalisation moves and efficiency improvements already in place. Apart from Toyota - its main customer and 23 per cent controlling shareholder - Nippondenso supplies all Japan's other carmakers except Nissan. The industry is likely to have been seeking to squeeze supplier margins to help shield the car manufacturers from the downturn. For the full year, Nippondenso is projecting flat sales of Y1,350bn and taxable profits of Y65bn, down 21.7 per cent from the Y83bn achieved last year. Previously the company had expected to maintain or slightly improve on the 1991 level. Nippondenso said equipment investment would be cut to Y100bn from Y120bn last year and an originally budgeted Y126bn this time. A breakdown of its interim revenues showed the greatest gains in sales of electrical parts and electronic control products, its second largest segment. These showed a 7.2 per cent rise - Japanese makers have been packing their vehicles with technology as one effort to stimulate customer demand. Sales of car heaters and air conditioners, its mainstay representing more than one-third of business, were a bare 0.2 per cent higher. Daihatsu Motor, the Japanese compact car and minivan manufacturer, and Tianjin Automobile Industrial, the mainland Chinese carmaker, are considering setting up a joint venture, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Daihatsu, 14.7 per cent owned by Toyota Motor, already supplies technology and parts to Tianjin, while the Chinese company produces Daihatsu's Charade cars and Hijet commercial vehicles for the local market. It produced about 20,000 Charades and about 14,000 Hijets in 1991.</p>

At  your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondewnt's request he gave his  version of the political amnesty declared by the State Duma.  Who gained from it? I believe, Shakhray said, that the prime  benefactor of this amnesty is Russian society. But, he  stressed, both the president and the prime minister gained, too.  What form does this take? When the passions and emotions  subside it will perhaps transpire that the interests of the  president and the Duma coincided, albeit tactically. Some Duma  deputies have achieved their aim in entering the Duma -- to  secure the release of the participants in the October events.  Subsequently the Duma's interests will diverge from those of  the ex-prisoners because the Duma has leaders of its own who do  not want the reinforcement of Rutskoy, Khasbulatov, and the  rest. They have no interest in that. In addition, they are not  averse to preserving their image as initiators of civil  reconciliation. After all, that is also politically very  advantageous.    The president and the government, in turn, benefit more from  having Khasbulatov and Rutskoy at liberty than in Lefortovo  prison. Why is that? So long as they remain in jail they  create the impression of an imprisoned vice president and an  imprisoned Supreme Soviet chairman. But once they have accepted  the amnesty from the Duma's hands then, no matter what  reservations they may have, they will have admitted a degree of  political guilt. Now each of them can return to power only  after elections have been held.    In addition, the amnesty act averted the acute political  crisis that was expected in April-May. Society has been given a  respite of several months. That respite must be used by all  political forces to prevent clashes. I believe, Sergey Shakhray  said, that the political amnesty saved Chernomyrdin's job as  premier and strengthened the president's position because it  muddled the political alignment of forces which were prepared  for a crisis this spring.</p>

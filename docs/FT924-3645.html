			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Low poll turnout likely in Venezuela VENEZUELANS, who have seen two military uprisings against their government this year, went to the polls yesterday in nationwide elections for state governors, mayors, city councils and parish councils. But politicians are concerned that long-standing disaffection with Venezuela's democracy will translate into low voter turnout. Only 10.39m Venezuelans, about half the country's population, are registered as voters. This would suggest that most voters do not believe that their ballots will change anything, despite exhortations by the media and politicians to go out and vote. Voter abstention nationwide stood at more than 54 per cent during the last state and local elections, in 1989, although voting is compulsory. Abstention in the Caracas metropolitan area, where much of the country's population is concentrated, reached a record 73 per cent. Even though the great majority of Venezuelans rejected a call by military rebels and leftist extremists to join a popular rebellion on November 27, most people still appear to have a very low opinion of the country's democracy. Moreover, doubts exist as to whether voters will continue to opt for the 'establishment' parties, or throw their support to the left and to independent candidates. In past elections, Venezuelans tended to cast most of their votes for the two mainstream political groups: the ruling Democratic Action party and the main opposition force, the Christian Democrat Copei Party.</p>

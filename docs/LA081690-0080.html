			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> GRANTS FOR SENIOR SERVICES UNCHANGED  </P> <P> The city of Oxnard will give $29,700 in grants to organizations providing  services to local senior citizens in fiscal 1990-91.  </P> <P> That is the same amount budgeted for the program last year.  </P> <P> "Usually you go into a new year hoping to get a little more money than the last  time," said Karen Burnham, senior services supervisor for the Oxnard Commission  on Aging. "But in light of all those budget cuts, we felt lucky to have things  remain status quo."  </P> <P> Of the about 16 organizations that applied for grants last year, 12 received  money, Burnham said. Money is given first to nonprofit groups that directly  serve senior citizens, Burnham said.  </P> <P> In the past, grants have been used to provide legal services for the elderly;  an ombudsman to mediate disputes, such as between a patient and a convalescent  hospital; and home care, such as bathing and dressing, so the senior citizen  does not have to be institutionalized.  </P> <P> Applications, available at the Senior Services Office at Wilson Park, must be  postmarked by Aug. 31. Funds are expected to be distributed in November. MAJA  RADEVICH  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Sychev report: "Russia Could Again Be Competing </F> Against Itself in the Arms Market"]    [Text] "Be in no hurry to engage in the arms trade  independently. You are not ready for foreign markets."  Contrary to expectations, that warning from Yevgeniy  Shaposhnikov, the Russian president's personal representative at  the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, did not give rise to any  objections from the leaders of manufacturing enterprises or  Russian weapons designers who are striving for the right to  independent foreign economic activity.    The conference on the problems of further cooperation  between  "Rosvooruzheniye" and military-industrial complex enterprises  was prompted by the dual position which the Russian arms trade  has been in for a month now. On the one hand, the president's  edict of 18 November last year brought in a state monopoly whose  implementation prescribed the formation of the "Rosvooruzheniye"  State Company. On the other hand, the government decree of 6 May  this year to all intents and purposes abolished the state  monopoly. The right to trade on foreign markets will once again  be granted to enterprises -- provided, admittedly, they are  successfully certified for the purpose.    Russia's military-industrial complex, Shaposhnikov stated,  is  rapidly collapsing. The programs to convert production and to  recycle accumulated weapons are not being implemented, state  orders continue to fall, skilled cadres are leaving the sector,  and production of a whole host of components -- specifically,  certain types of munitions -- is being stopped. Some 400  military-industrial complex enterprises have been shut down. In  the first five months of 1994 the Defense Ministry owed the  defense sector over 4 trillion rubles [R] -- not counting the  R700 billion that was not paid last year. One way to avert  collapse is to try to win a slice of Russia's exports pie, which  has shrunk from $22.6 billion in 1987 to just $2 billion in  weapons sold in 1993. Government Decree No. 479, which created  another moot case in Russian legislation, was also a reflection  of these interests.    The top state authorities seem not to have noticed the  contradictions between the two acts. A Security Council session  was scheduled for 8 June at which it had been proposed to set up  a certification commission to study applications from people  claiming the right to establish direct ties with foreign  partners. The session was postponed to July -- only because the  same day sees the signing of contracts on the basis of plans for  the delivery of MiG-29's to Malaysia, to which many of the  people invited to the council session will have traveled.    Optimists at the session gave assurances that we are no  strangers to differing interpretations and contradictions and  that the system of Russian military-technical cooperation will  be improved. Aleksey Shulunov, president of the League to  Assist Defense Enterprises, believes that the end product will  be to combine a state monopoly with broader involvement of  manufacturers and developers in military-technical cooperation.  And the conference participants could not conceive of the arms  trade without "Rosvooruzheniye," which has warned that it will  not service firms that "strike out" on their own.    But pessimists recalled the recent period when there was a  liberal attitude toward arms exports. Nobody has calculated how  much Russia lost through the free-for-all that prevailed then.  When Malaysia expressed interest in buying a major batch of  MiG-29's, around 50 firms, state institutions, and ordinary  Russian citizens vied with each other to offer it their services.    Not a single military-industrial complex enterprise has yet  applied for a license. Stanislav Filin, deputy general director  of the "Rosvooruzheniye" State Company, believes that there will  be few applicants, and that even fewer licenses will be issued.  Nonetheless, powerful science-and-production associations are  pressuring small firms in an attempt to win their consent to  have them represent their interests in foreign markets. It  cannot be ruled out that these giants will once again start  stealing clients from each other. After all, apart from the  contradictory presidential edict and government decree, there  are no other acts of legislation in Russia regulating the arms  trade. Under these circumstances Russia will hardly be able to  count on increasing its share of the world arms trade.</p>

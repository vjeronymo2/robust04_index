			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sanjaya Baru: "Indian Stress on Human Rights at </F> U.N. Summit"]    [Text] New Delhi, February 18--India has declared its  commitment to the "eradication of poverty by the end of the  century," emphasised the importance of the "political  sustainability of economic reforms" and has called for the shift  of "power to the people" in its presentations at the first  substantive session of the preparatory committee of the world  summit for social development at the United Nations headquarters  in New York last week.    In its statement on "A vision for the summit," India stated  that poverty was a challenge for all mankind, and not merely the  problem of the developing countries. India reiterated its  commitment to human rights and emphasised that the concept must  include "human security" which implied the rights to work, food  and nutrition, education, health and shelter.    Significantly, the Indian statement also added: "While  talking of sustainable economic growth, recognition must be  given for political sustainability of economic reforms in the  context of social consequences if the essential aspirations of  the poor and the deprived are not pari passu taken  care of, for fulfilment of these aspirations are absolutely  fundamental to the stability of the developing world."    The U.N. social summit is scheduled for 1996 in Copenhagen.  At last week's first PrepComm meetings in New York, Indian  interventions were on five themes, namely, on the political  declaration, on eradication of poverty, on expansion of  productive employment, on social integration and on the role of  the UN and the international financial institutions. The Indian  statements were drafted with the concurrence of the Prime  Minister's Office.    Emphasising the vital role of decentralisation of  governance,  the official Indian position underscored the role of the  panchayati raj institutions as well as non-governmental  organisations in "empowering people."    The statement says: "The lead role of the national  governments in the developing world at all times in the matter  of poverty eradication, in promoting social integration and  sustained and sustainable full employment, and in creating the  emvironment needed in terms of resource allocation and relevant  policies should be emphasised but with the knowledge that the  state and government structures cannot successfully handle all  problems of social development and that, therefore, at all times  their vision should keep the people at the centre of the  strategies of implementation so that people themselves are  enabled and empowered through organisations of the poor, on the  basis of awareness generation and empowerment techniques,  assisted by the support structures provided by non-government  and voluntary organisations, to deal with their own problems. In  other words, a bottom-up approach with people at the Centre,  with power to the people."    While acknowledging the helpful role that the World Bank has  played in supporting social development programmes in India, the  Indian statement on the role of the UN and its agencies is also  critical of the impact that Fund-Bank inspired adjustment  programmes have had on social sector spending. "We have a  suspicion that the Fund or the Bank do not overly bother how  deficits are cut so long as they are indeed cut. That is no way  of helping the poor while simultaneously pleading lack of  resources for new programmes, especially on the soft window--the  IDA resources," says the statement.    In a hard-hitting passage read in New York but clearly  intended for audiences at the IMF and the World Bank in  Washington, D.C., the Indian delegate said: "There can be no  deliberate, cold, dispassionate divorce of the micro needs of  the poor from the macro needs of the economy. They have to go  hand in hand and hence there is need for additional resources on  soft terms for social development programmes.    "The Bank should not win battles while losing the war. For,  the war against poverty is about 50 percent of the people of the  underdeveloped world, while the main thrust and results  projected from the economic reforms at least  initially--initially could even mean a decade--seem to be about  15 percent to 20 percent of the population of the developing  countries. Let us not have souths and norths within the south  itself."    Drawing attention to the problem of mass unemployment in a  populous developing economy like India, the Indian statement  emphasised the role of "labour-intensive" industrialisation, of  land reforms, peasant agriculture, self-employment schemes and  the growth of the informal sector.    "But all this will have to be supported by  productivity-raising technology," says the statement, adding:  "And hence the importance of the role of governments and of  support structures, including the giant corporations, which  could play a very fulfilling and, in enlightened self-interest,  perhaps also a profitable role as support structures."    India has asked for a special fund to be created by the Bank  to assist governments tide over the problems of adjustment,  poverty-eradication and creation of full employment. While the  government will allow foreign investment to replace public  investment in industry, it still requires international aid to  enhance public expenditure on social sectors, says the Indian  statement.</p>

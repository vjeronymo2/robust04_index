			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 9 (TASS) -- "Privatisation in Russia  has been carried through," said chairman of the Russian  committee for state property, Anatoliy Chubays, an interview to  the "Publicist" studio broadcast by the First Television Channel  on Thursday.    According to Chubays, "the privatisation has been carried  out  despite numerous experts' forecasts and stormy political  developments around it."    At the same time, Chubays believes that as far as the state  property committee is concerned, and for him personally, the  goal of privatisation goes far beyond the framework of  privatisation itself. He described privatisation as a very deep  process "which modifies processes taking place in an economic  organism at a molecular level."    According to Chubays, a total of 70 percent of Russian  enterprises will be auctioned for vouchers, 20 percent for money  and 10 percent will not be subject to privatisation at all.  According to Chubays, enterprises excluded from monetary and  voucher privatisation include those connected with the  production of nuclear splitting materials, cipher equipment and  special kinds of armaments.</p>

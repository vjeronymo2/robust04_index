			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wang Hongyang (3076 3163 3152)] </F>   [Text] Shanghai, 4 Apr (XINHUA) -- The China Foreign  Exchange Trading Center [CFETC] officially began its trading  operations here today.    This means that beginning today the interrelation between  supply and demand reflected on the national foreign exchange  open market with this center as the core will become the  authoritative basis for deciding exchange rates in China; and  that the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Market, which was established  in 1988 as a regional trading center, has been promoted to a  national foreign exchange trading center.    This national unified foreign exchange trading system, which  links up with such big cities as Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou,  Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, began operation at around 0900. Only  the dollar was traded today. On a huge computer screen, the  opening rate was displayed as 8.681 yuan to the dollar; the  day's high, 8.7265 yuan; the day's low, 8.681 yuan; and the  weighted average, 8.6967 yuan. At 1100, trading closed for the  day at a rate of 8.6908 yuan to the dollar.    Dressed in yellow vests, traders representing some 70  brokerages and operators [zi ying shang 5261 3602 0794] took  part in the first trading session today. Liu Guanghua [0491  0342 5478], a trader from the international business division of  the Agricultural Bank of China's Shanghai City branch, told this  reporter in the trading hall: "Trading was relatively smooth  and steady throughout the day." As a broker, he concluded on  behalf of his clients two buying contracts amounting to $50,000  at the respective rate of 8.68 and 8.69 yuan to the dollar, and  17 selling contracts worth a total of $840,000 at rates ranging  from 8.71 to 8.72 yuan.    According to an authoritative person from the center, the  official inauguration of trading at the CFETC is a major step of  substantive significance in China's financial reform this year  and has laid solid material groundwork for establishing in China  a single, managed floating exchange rate system based on supply  and demand.    The reform of the foreign exchange system launched at the  beginning of the year has passed its transitional period  smoothly in the first quarter. With the unification of the  dual-track renminbi exchange rates, steady market operations,  and stable exchange rates during the transitional period, the  transitional goal has been basically attained. Coming into the  second quarter, we are to carry out full-scale reform of the  foreign exchange control system and implement a system of  interbank exchange settlement and selling. The CFETC was  officially inaugurated in conjunction with this process.    According to a briefing, the CFETC, adopting an independent  accounting system and a membership system, is a nonprofit,  self-managed market organization, in which designated foreign  exchange banks act as the main traders. With its advanced  communications network and computer system, the center becomes  the first of its kind in the world to be able to simultaneously  conduct transactions and settlements based on the principle of  "separate price quotations -- matching and transacting --  centralized settlement." The U.S. and Hong Kong dollars are the  two currencies traded there for the time being.    It has been learned that 13 major domestic banks and more  than 80 other Chinese and foreign banks and nonbank financial  institutions will become members of the CFETC. Existing foreign  exchange swap markets at various localities across the country  remain open after the trading center was put into operation.</p>

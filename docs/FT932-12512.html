			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Tide of anger rises at the cost of clean living - Worldwide water / Sewage laws and reunification HERBERT Losem from Konigswinter, a sleepy town on the Rhine, has bitter words to say about water pollution controls in Germany. Already paying a high price for drinking water, he now faces heavier taxes for sewage treatment. With some of the most stringent environmental laws in Europe coming into effect and public finances under strain, Losem and other German citizens find they have to foot a heavier than expected bill for a clean Germany, especially with the costs of reunification. 'Environment is our national ideology. It is completely political and economics have little to do with it,' says Losem, who is also Konigswinter's finance director. Konigswinter, best known for its annual Anglo-German parliamentary seminars, once took all its water from the Rhine and returned it there. Today, despite recent announcements that 50 species of fish are once again swimming there, the Rhine remains too polluted to be used as drinking water along much of its length. Instead, the town takes its water from the hills, and households pay some of the highest prices in Europe. Waste water ends up in sewage plants, which have to meet ever stricter anti-pollution requirements. As tougher environmental laws bite, Konigswinter faces massive investments in water infrastructure and waste water treatment. Like other municipalities in Germany, it has been fighting a bitter political battle to gain time and ease legislative pressure. With six river basins, a humid climate and Europe's two largest rivers running across its territory, Germany hardly faces water scarcity. Instead, water management efforts have focused on the legal protection of existing sources against pollution. Germany has some of the toughest environmental laws in Europe and has been at the forefront of efforts to promote similar directives in Brussels to gain Europe-wide implementation for its anti-pollution standards. Concern for the environment grew in the 1960s and 1970s with fears that pollution control was being outpaced by the country's fast post-war re-industrialisation and it is now an important issue for all German political parties. Recent environmental laws have been very successful in reducing water pollution. Following the introduction of the 1975 Washing and Cleaning Agents Act, which means detergents contained in washing products must be 90 per cent biodegradable, products containing phosphate have almost disappeared. In 1957, the Federal Water Act *something in here (HP) * laid down anti-pollution controls whose standards are far stricter than anything found in other countries. Recent amendments on waste water are forcing sewage plants to have not only mechanical and biological water treatments, which clean an estimated 85 per cent of waste water, but also very complex new chemical treatments. Between 1970 and 1990, local authorities spent more than DM100bn (Pounds 40bn) on the construction, extension and overhaul of the sewage system and treatment plants. More than DM12bn is spent annually on effluent disposal. In the 1990s, compliance with these requirements by all municipal and industrial treatment facilities will still require considerable investment by local authorities and industry. Municipal sewage plants alone are likely to cost more than DM10bn in west Germany and more than DM40bn in the east. Similar investments are needed to extend the sewage system. An estimated DM60bn to DM70bn is required for maintenance and repairs on existing sewers. For industry, these requirements translate into charges for remaining pollutants which have more than tripled between 1981 and 1991 and are expected to be twice today's level by 2000. Households pay their share. By the end of the decade, Losem, who pays DM1,200 of his annual taxes to help provide sewage plants, expects this charge to double. And to implement the law on waste water treatment, Konigswinter, with 41,000 inhabitants, will have to find an estimated DM40m in the next two to three years to upgrade its existing sewage plant and a further DM130m to link all households to it by 2000. Until 1993, state subsidies covered between 30 and 40 per cent of investment in new plants and large infrastructure projects connected to water management. Since the beginning of the year, these subsidies have been abolished in most Lander (states). 'The state purses are empty. Who will pay now?' says Wilfried Teuber, state official responsible for water management at the federal environment ministry. Another problem hindering lower costs is the lack of competition, explains Teuber. Most water management in west Germany is handled by state enterprises run by municipalities, though in the east foreign companies such as Lyonnaise des Eaux of France tender for local contracts. The federal environment ministry estimates that DM100bn is needed to clean up polluted waters and implement existing anti-pollution standards in east Germany where pollution controls were ignored in the communist era. For Losem, the additional taxes he will have to pay for waste water treatment add to the list of financial burdens he and other west Germans must pay for reunification. 'The state coffers are empty because we have to pay for east Germany as well,' he says.</p>

He was welcomed at the  airport by Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso. Rabin did  not say much on arrival, but he did say that any statement on  the withdrawal of Israeli soldiers from the Gaza Strip and  Jericho can only be made after the meetings with the Portuguese  authorities. Raquel Abecassis reports.    [Abecassis] The Israeli prime minister said he did not want  to speak to journalists, but ended up agreeing to a news  conference later after, his meetings with the Portuguese prime  minister and foreign minister.    [Begin Rabin recording, in English] First, I am in Portugal  as a guest of the prime minister. I am just now beginning my  visit. I believe it will be better to discuss questions  relating to the peace negotiations first with the prime minister  and government officials; only then will I make a public  statement. Thank you. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

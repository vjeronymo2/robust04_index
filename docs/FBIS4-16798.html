			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Borovkov] </F>   [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky April 19 TASS -- "The  status of border troops is rising, and I believe that the very  concept of this structure is changing," Andrey Nikolayev,  commander-in-chief of Russian border troops, said in an  interview with ITAR-TASS here on Tuesday. He said this,  replying to the question of whether his appointment a member of  the Russian Security Council means a higher status of border  troops within the system of ensuring the state's security.    "While the border was earlier the only boundary designed to  fight single infiltrators," Nikolayev continued, "now we face an  all-out 'offensive' of smugglers, drug and arms dealers as well  as mobs. We need new border troops, and we are now working on  this issue."    Nikolayev who was recently appointed a member of the  Security  Council by the Russian president's decree, is now making an  inspection tour of the Russian Far East.    "The Russian Far Eastern bounderies have some features  distinguishing them from other parts of the state border,"  Nikolayev noted. Their main part runs across sea expanses,  forcing us to keep here powerful coast guard forces. "The main  problem here is that it is an area of constant violations of  fishing regulations. "We should find a way to settle this  problem not by force but legally," Nikolayev stressed. "This  area is of interest not only to Russia but to other states as  well which should understand that they upset the ecological and  biological balance in this part of the world ocean by destroying  rich marine resources."</p>

			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (15): Closing the gaps - Refocusing on customers / John Kavanagh looks at how a standard package forced change on a manufacturer of trailers, tankers and tippers Installing a new manufacturing software package has meant so much to Crane Fruehauf that one director has said: 'Without it we'd be dead.' It is not the package itself that has made the difference but the exercise of examining the way the company works. Crane Fruehauf is Europe's leading manufacturer of heavy goods trailers, tankers and tippers. It has operations in Norfolk, France, Germany and the Netherlands. The former US parent was formed in the late 1980s from a management buy-out, a project which UK finance director Paul Logie believes distracted the managers from running the business. By the time the US group sold the European operation to fund debt, the business was losing its market lead, largely as customer service was slipping and costs were too high. The business was not helped by its ageing systems. 'In the UK we had separate systems for different functions and some people ran their own informal systems too,' Mr Logie says. 'If you asked three departments for information, you got three different answers, because the data was not as accurate or up-to-date as it should have been. There was generally a lack of discipline in the way we worked.' In 1992 the UK company decided to move from a traditional hierarchy, with directors of sales, production and so on, to smaller units based on product groups. This has focused people's activities on their products and customers. Today, there are fewer layers of management. Closing the gap between the top and bottom of the company has seen the executive car park disappear, extended clocking-in to everyone (although it will probably be phased out), brought senior managers out of exclusive offices into an open-plan set-up, and made them more accessible. The package chosen to support this extensive reorganisation was the SIM/400 MRP-II (manufacturing resource planning) system from Hoskyns, running on an IBM AS/400. The product was chosen partly because it was being installed in sister companies in Europe. 'MRP-II through a single system has given us control and stability in our day-to-day operations,' Mr Logie says. 'From here we have moved to just-in-time working, geared to cutting waste, reducing inventory and shortening lead times. Meanwhile our total quality, cell manufacturing approach has generated a feeling of involvement and ownership of products and customers.' Electronic data interchange is being introduced as part of the just-in-time approach. Orders are sent electronically to a growing number of suppliers and some deliver directly to the production line. Crane Fruehauf has taken the standard SIM package as it is. 'We were determined not to tinker with it,' Mr Logie says. 'It is a proven product with many users, so we regard it as adequate for us, too. In fact we saw it as a catalyst for change, in that we changed the way we operate to fit the system: this forced us to challenge the way we did things.' Benefits have emerged quickly. 'We have certainly cut our inventory by Pounds 1m,' Mr Logie says. 'Our market share is increasing again, not least because of the dramatic change in our view of our customers, products and suppliers.'

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Dutch bank chief takes government to task THE HEAD of the Dutch central bank, Mr Wim Duisenberg, yesterday called for wage restraint in industry and for greater financial discipline by the country's centre-left government. Real labour costs, relatively stable throughout the 1980s, threatened to rise by up to 2.5 per cent a year between now and 1994, causing a severe slowdown in the number of new jobs and pushing up inflation, he said. The rise in wages also had a direct impact on state finances because of the government's promise in 1989 to raise social-security benefits in line with private sector salary increases. Mr Duisenberg, presenting the bank's 1990 annual report, said the government had to do more to control its budget deficit without resorting to large increases in the burden of taxation and social security contributions. However, he 'feared the worst' because the financing deficit so far this year had already exceeded government targets, complicating efforts to cut the deficit to 3.25 per cent of national income by 1994. 'The targets for 1994 will never be realised if we do not manage to extract ourselves from the quicksand of 1991,' he said.</p>

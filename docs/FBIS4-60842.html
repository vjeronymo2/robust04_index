			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal </F> Democratic Party of Russia: "My Plans for Germany"]    [Text] When I read what some German publications and  politicians say about me, the following strikes me first and  foremost: I am accused of directly interfering in internal  German affairs. That is why I even received an "entry ban" for  a time, as if I were a worse sort of person than mafia bosses  and drug dealers from other countries who are evidently viewed  by certain forces as providing a valuable contribution to social  life, people from whom one does not have to be cut off in the  same way as one has to be cut off from me.    So I find it difficult not to write in a satirical vein  about  some German decisionmakers who emphasize national sovereignty  vis-a-vis Russia and myself on the one hand, and even conduct a  form of verbal gunboat policy, while on the other hand, they  bitterly fight any sign of national self-awareness on the part  of the German people, and want to give up every last trace of  German national independence vis-a-vis the Western powers, that  is to say, they are prepared to kowtow to foreign countries in a  way that I find incomprehensible.  <H5>  Against Any Kind of Interference </H5>   Second, the uproar about my supposed interference in German  affairs is being fanned by media that do not shrink from playing  the part of guardian and censor of the Russian nation. It is  certainly of no benefit to Russo-German relations to condemn  what has been decided by the Russian people, who have placed the  greatest degree of trust in my party and in myself. Since the  parliamentary elections last December, which saw my party become  the strongest political force, irresponsible media demagogues in  the FRG have interfered in Russia's internal affairs in an  insolent manner on numerous occasions. In any event, it would  not occur to me to attack the chairman of the strongest  political force in Germany in the offensive manner that I have  had to accept from certain gentlemen in Germany for months now.  At the same time, I cannot imagine that they speak for the  majority of the German people, who, I assume, deeply desire  Russo-German reconciliation and accept the democratic decision  made by the citizens of my country.    Third, the charge of interfering in Germany's internal  affairs leveled against me is factually inaccurate. How the  Germans deal with their internal affairs is solely a matter for  the Germans. We Russians urgently request that there be an end  to telling us what to do. As a Russian politician, I have  enough to do without having to worry about Germany's internal  affairs.  <H5>  There Are More Options </H5>   However, as a Russian politician, I do feel responsible for  Russo-German relations, if only because bilateral relations with  the strongest economic power in Europe are of substantial  interest to us, and because I have arrived at the following  conclusion, having studied the history of both our peoples: The  outcome for both my nation and for the Germans was always bad  when we opposed each other or even used force against each  other. By contrast, close cooperation has always a blessing for  both nations. With this in mind, I have made a series of  suggestions about the future form of Russo-German cooperation.    I do not want to tell the Germans what to do. Germany may  like my suggestions or it may reject them. It is for Germany to  decide freely and independently whether it wants to accept the  hand that I have extended in friendship or not. That is  because, despite being familiar with the mutual advantages that  good Russo-German relations yield, there are also other options  for my country, which is the largest state in the world. I  would like to play the German card should I become president.  However, I cannot continually explain to people in Russia why I  am offering the Germans trump cards, when the answer that I  always receive from there is a rejection.  <H5>  More German Than the Germans? </H5>   I would like mention some instances of hypocrisy: I am  continually being attacked by certain German forces, and the  more I offer the Germans, the more I am condemned (when I put  forward the solution to the question of Koenigsberg, one that  was based on agreement, there was an enormous outcry in the  German media!), and then there is outrage when I -- out of a  feeling of responsibility for my country -- test various  possible options for foreign relations. I ask of the Germans  that they understand that, despite my great affection for that  great people in the heart of Europe, I am a Russian and a  Russian politician first and foremost. To expect me to be more  German than the Germans is, to put it mildly, completely  unrealistic. The fact that many Germans view the world through  foreign eyes does not mean that one can conclude that this  illness is widespread outside the borders of the FRG.    In print runs that are probably larger than those of the  Grimm Brothers' fairy tales -- incidentally, I value their works  very much for reviving German national consciousness at a time  when the nation was being forgotten, and their stories are much  loved in Russia -- it is being said in Germany that I want to  destroy the FRG with nuclear weapons, and without batting an  eyelid, this accusation is often made in the same breath as the  assertion that I, as a kind of "junior partner," want to seek  world domination along with the Germans. It would, of course,  be "logical" that I should want to turn the Germans into  millions of skeletons first of all and then, in a joint  formation with those skeletons, seek to conquer the world. It  is also just as "logical" that, while maintaining a friendship  with Dr. Frey, whose person and policies stand for a strong  Germany, who, in accordance with the national anthem, loves  "Germany above all else," I should want to kill the German  people.    Both of these assertions are total nonsense. Both my  supposed intention to want to destroy Germany with nuclear  weapons as well as my supposed desire to achieve Russo-German  domination over the world.  <H5>  The Recipe Is Understanding </H5>   It is true that in the event that I become president, if  need  be, I would not hesitate to use all the weapons available in my  country against an aggressor, regardless of where he should  happen to come from. Over decades, it has been sought to  impress upon the Germans that nuclear deterrence against a  potential aggressor represented the highest degree of wisdom in  statesmanship. I am surprised that I am now supposed to be the  big bad wolf in the world, because I am following the deterrence  doctrine of the Western powers in general, and West Germany in  particular. Whoever wishes us no evil can sleep in peace.  However, we do indeed want to cause fear among those who are  hoping to be able to carve up my country into pieces and to  condemn it to slavery.    As for wishing to dominate the world, in the event that I  become president, I would be far from inclined to copy the U.S.  head of state, who, on assuming office -- like his predecessors  -- literally laid claim to "leadership of the world" for his  state. In no hemisphere other than its own do I want Russia to  play the first violin -- in what is hopefully a peaceful concert  -- accorded to Russia by history and power.    Despite all the attempts at sabotage made by irresponsible  circles, I am firmly convinced that in the long-term, those  forces that support Russo-German understanding, Russo-German  cooperation, will gain the upper hand. The Germans will not  fail to seize the opportunity when it arises, to quote Bismarck,  whom I deeply admire.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Governor who? Sir, Your editorial, 'Choosing a new governor' (January 7), in reference to the Bank of England courageously suggested that it was the economy that was important, not the views of the prime minister and the chancellor. You also described the new governor (whoever he or she may be) as a 'he' which, I trust, was unintentional. A Spence, 33 Leyfield, Worcester Park, Surrey</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Karl Lamers, foreign policy </F> spokesman for the CDU/CSU Bundestag group, by Friedbert Meurer;  Meurer is in the studio in Cologne, place of Lamers not given --  live]    [Text] [Meurer] What do you think of the fact that NATO  shot down four Serbian aircraft over Bosnia?    [Lamers] It was a necessary and consistent step. Although  Mr. Kinkel is, of course, right when he says that this was an  isolated operation, I would like to point out that the measure  is part of the policy NATO has pursued with its ultimatum in  accordance with the United Nations, and, for example, also in  accordance with the opening of the bridge in Sarajevo.    [Meurer] Mr. Lamers, does this mean that by shooting down  those aircraft this morning, NATO wanted to show that it was  taking the ultimatum of last Monday [21 February] seriously?    [Lamers] Yes, and NATO, first of all, wanted to demonstrate  that the Serbs were wrong in thinking that they could make  partial and regionally limited concessions -- limited to  Sarajevo -- while continuing their activities and attacks  elsewhere to create facts. I think that this is a most decisive  point. Now it will depend on their reaction -- the reaction of  the Serbs, which, incidentally, will essentially depend on the  reaction of the Russians. The choice is one between cease-fire  and really serious efforts for peace and escalation.    [Meurer] What is the importance of the military flights, the  flights by the Serbian Air Force, for the war in Bosnia?    [Lamers] This question is difficult to answer. There have  been innumerous violations of the no-fly decision. Still, if I  see and interpret things correctly then the attack against the  ammunition factory was a very serious escalation by the Serbian  side, which is, of course, of significant importance, because  the Muslims and the Croats do not have such heavy weapons, and,  in particular, no aircraft.    [Meurer] In connection with the NATO ultimatum, which called  for withdrawing all heavy arms from around Sarajevo, there has  been some controversy with Moscow, which did not really approve  of NATO's policy. What reactions do you now expect from Moscow?    [Lamers] The first reaction of which I have heard is  moderate, and absolutely all right. The Russian Foreign  Ministry spokesman said that if things really happened that way,  if there really was a Serbian attack against the ammunition  factory, then it was a violation of the UN resolution, and then  NATO's reaction was O.K. I hope that this position will not  change. There can be no doubt that this is also a test of the  constructive nature of Russia's role in Sarajevo. That there  are some question marks in this connection is obvious; I also  have some doubts. I do, however, hope that the Russians will  continue to react in the way that is now beginning to show -- I  have to put that very cautiously -- otherwise it would be  problematic -- beyond Bosnia -- for relations between Russia and  the West.</p>

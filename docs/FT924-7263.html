			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (13): On track for change - Richard Tomkins looks at BR's monopoly FIRST, the bad news for rail travellers in Britain. Remember all that talk about Richard Branson's Virgin Group setting up a luxury inter-city train service featuring hostess service, seat-back video and on-board business centres, all for the price of a normal British Rail fare? The plan's off. It foundered on the rock of a provision in the Transport Act 1962 requiring BR to operate with due regard to efficiency and economy of operation. That, said BR, meant that it could not allow Virgin on its tracks unless Virgin undertook to compensate it for every penny of profit it lost as a result. Clearly, any such arrangement was a non-starter from Virgin's point of view. The result is that business travellers are stuck with BR's monopoly over train services, at least until privatisation. But now, the slightly better news: BR seems to have picked up ideas from the private sector in its latest marketing campaign. For this, passengers must thank the recession. In the present financial year BR's InterCity sector is looking at a Pounds 50m hole in its revenues, partly because the number of passenger journeys has fallen and partly because people are trading down from first class to standard class. InterCity has responded by tightening its belt, cutting costs and paring investment to the bone. But that, it says, is not enough: so beyond that, it is also fighting to fill empty seats by launching the biggest package of marketing measures it has ever deployed. One prong of the campaign is to widen the range of bargain fares - for example, through a re-introduction of the Boots promotion, giving shoppers at Boots stores vouchers that they can trade in for tickets. These offers, however, are aimed at leisure travellers more than the business market. The main benefits for business travellers are improvements in service. For example, customer welcome teams will be introduced to station concourses at big InterCity stations. These will consist of hosts and hostesses dressed in a distinctive claret uniform, walking the concourses and offering help to passengers. The first teams are already in action at London's Euston, King's Cross and Paddington terminuses and Bristol Temple Meads. Meanwhile, the most frequent InterCity services, such as those between London and Gatwick, Bristol, Leicester, Birmingham and Norwich, will be re-packaged as InterCity Shuttles from next year. The idea is that passengers intending to travel these routes, at least from the London end, will no longer need to worry about timetables. Instead, they will be able to turn up at a designated platform at any time of day in the knowledge that a train will be there, ready to depart and with its buffet open. There are big changes to on-board catering, too. The traditional dining-car with its set menu will largely be replaced by so-called Express Diners - restaurant cars offering an all-day menu aimed at meeting a perceived demand for lighter meals. People will be able to make up their own meals from a choice of starters, main courses and desserts. On Pullman trains and some other services timed for business travel, the more traditional menu will be retained. But it will be improved, with a wider choice of dishes: the autumn menu in Pullman, for example, will include 'Best of New British' cuisine alongside international and vegetarian dishes, and a new wine range is to be introduced later. A number of improvements are being made to the frills of business travel. There will be a new look for table settings in Pullman and first class, with brighter and warmer colours. First class passengers were last month being given a free copy of a novel - The Firm by John Gresham. A series of exclusive telephone numbers is being introduced across the country for booking first class tickets. And for Silver Standard travellers - typically, the cost-conscious younger business traveller paying the full standard class fare - there is free tea or coffee in china cups instead of plastic ones, a choice of free biscuits and pastries, and the addition of hot toast to the Pounds 4.95 breakfast. There are also improvements to sleeper services. On all sleeper trains the first class sleeper fee now includes a continental breakfast and newspaper, with a full breakfast available in lounge cars; and a lounge car has been added to the Fort William sleeper, which is renamed The West Highlander. One reason why InterCity has reacted to the downturn in business in this manner is that it operates in a ferociously competitive market. Surprisingly, railways account for only 10 per cent of UK passenger journeys exceeding 50 miles: of the rest, cars account for 88 per cent, air 1 per cent and coaches 1 per cent. However, the big question this marketing campaign is likely to raise in the mind of most business travellers is whether it is not simply a case of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. What is the point of making minor changes to the quality of service, they may ask, if people cannot rely on the trains to run on time? Certainly, there is nothing to be proud of in InterCity's record. Last year only 84 per cent of its trains reached their destinations within 10 minutes of the scheduled time, against a government target of 90 per cent; and the cancellation rate of 2.2 per cent was far above the target of 0.5 per cent. One reason for this poor performance is the increasingly decrepit state of InterCity's assets. Although the London King's Cross to Edinburgh line has recently emerged from an extensive modernisation, plans for a Pounds 750m upgrade of the London Euston to Glasgow line are on indefinite hold, and the InterCity 125 trains running on the Great Western lines out of London Paddington will soon be due for replacement. Unfortunately for passengers, the present pressures on public spending leave little likelihood that these investment needs will be fulfilled by the government in the foreseeable future. The result is that passengers may have to wait for rail privatisation before they get the trains they want - and that is not due to draw into the platform until at least April 1994.</p>

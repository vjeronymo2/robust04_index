			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- China's rural firms had  an output worth 474 billion yuan in the first quarter of this  year -- a 47 percent growth over the same period of last year,  said the Ministry of Agriculture.    The ministry officials said this formed a sharp contrast  with  the state-owned sector, which chalked up a growth of only 2.2  percent during the first three months.    The officials estimated that rural industries will have an  annual growth of 25 percent to 30 percent this year.    Meanwhile, rural firms have seen a remarkable improvement in  their product quality, thanks to an investment of more than 100  billion yuan in fixed assets last year, mainly for improving  manufacturing technology.    Facing market competition that is getting fiercer and  fiercer, the rural firms have been improving their management  and adopting a flexible market policy, the officials noted.    In the first quarter of this year rural firms sold more than  83 percent of the products made during that period, making a  sales income of 395 billion yuan.    In the first three months the exports of rural firms  skyrocketed by 72 percent over the same period of last year, to  reach 48.5 billion yuan.    According to the officials, rural firms now employ one tenth  of the nation's population. In 1993 alone the number of their  employees increased by six million.    The officials said they expect that rural firms will be able  to absorb more surplus rural labor. The government estimates  that China will have five million more people in need of jobs by  the end of this year.    The officials said rural firms in Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan and  Sichuan Provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region  showed the fastest growth in the first quarter.    Rural industrial enterprises in east China reported a 50  percent growth in the first three months, three percentage  points higher than the national average in the same period, the  officials added.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / BBC strikes start next week Unions at the BBC yesterday announced a schedule of two strikes a week starting from next Tuesday in an increasingly bitter dispute over pay and conditions. Tuesday's planned strike of technicians and journalists will last 24 hours, although subsequent strikes will last for varying periods - some could be for as little as 10 minutes. Live radio and television programmes such as news, current affairs and sport are expected to be the worst affected. The unions said there would be strikes on June 10, the day after polling in the European elections and parliamentary by-elections, and June 12, when counting begins for the European elections. The BBC's management last night began drawing up contingency plans for emergency coverage. The dispute is over plans to introduce performance-related pay and to end comprehensive collective bargaining and conditions of employment. Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the BBC technical union, said his members had sweated to keep programmes going since the introduction of an internal market at the corporation, and now the management 'wants blood'. Ms Margaret Salmon, the BBC's director of personnel, said she was disappointed at the call for action. The management had wanted to continue talks, she added. 'We are prepared to talk as soon as the unions are prepared to talk too.'</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH BEAT: HELP FOR JOB SEEKERS  </P> <P> Students who want to work abroad can get help in obtaining a work permit  through the Council on International Educational Exchange.  </P> <P> The council is a private nonprofit organization involved in international  education and student travel. It was founded in 1947 to help re-establish  student exchanges after World War II.  </P> <P> Last year 5,000 students participated in the council's "Work Abroad" programs.  This year it will help students get permits for temporary work in Great  Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Costa Rica and Jamaica.  </P> <P> Although the council does not find jobs, it does give participants handbooks  that include information about countries, job hunting and accommodations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Orientation and Advice  </P> <P> Participants are invited to a meeting upon arrival in the country in which they  wish to work, conducted by an affiliated foreign student travel service. Bureau  members only act as advisers if problems arise.  </P> <P> The fee for the program is $82.  </P> <P> The foreign student travel services also can help with information on tax  exempt situations. For example, if you live less than 84 days in Britain you  gain a tax-exempt status. The usual tax deduction would be about 25%.  </P> <P> Contact the British affiliate BUNAC (British Universities North America Club)  for more information.  </P> <P> The Irish student travel service (USIT) can help with temporary budget  accommodations. It operates a new central accommodations center called Kinlay  House. It can be used as a base.  </P> <P> Even with tax breaks and budget accommodations, chances are that you won't be  paid enough to save for the next school year. For example, last year's average  weekly wage in New Zealand was about $150 U.S. An English teacher in Paris  earned about $250, a bank clerk in Galway $170 and a secretary in London about  $305.  </P> <P> If you speak English you won't have to worry about the language in Great  Britain, Ireland, New Zealand or Jamaica. But if you want to work in France,  West Germany or Costa Rica you must know at least an intermediate level of  French, German or Spanish.  </P> <P> The Great Britain program is available any time of the year, for up to six  months. The Irish program is open all year, and you can work for up to four  months. The French program is also available at any time of the year, but you  can only work for three months.  </P> <P> The West German program operates from June 1 to Oct. 1, the New Zealand program  from April 1 to Oct. 31. The Jamaica and Costa Rica programs operate from June  1 to Oct. 1.  </P> <P> For more information, contact CIEE's Council Travel Services, 1093 Broxton  Ave., Suite 220, Los Angeles 90024; (213) 208-3551.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Helpful Books Available  </P> <P> Vacation-Work, a British publisher, has several new editions of books for  temporary job seekers, due out shortly.  </P> <P> "Overseas Summer Jobs" lists employers, job descriptions and sample salaries  for casual work in about 40 countries. The 1989 edition is due this month, for  $9.95.  </P> <P> Also due this month at the same price is the similar "Summer Jobs in Britain."  A new edition to the series this year is "Au Pair and Nannies Guide to Working  Abroad" by Susan Griffith and Sharon Legg ($10.95).  </P> <P> Vacation-Work's 1989 edition of "Work Your Way Around the World," also by Susan  Griffith, will be available in February for $10.95.  </P></p>

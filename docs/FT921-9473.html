			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Foreign Affairs: All Atlanticists now - A close and more balanced partnership between the US and Europe will cement the alliance J Danforth Quayle has cut a more impressive figure on his current European tour than the bumbling image long projected in the US and elsewhere. Last weekend I heard him deliver a spirited address, quite different from the text issued in advance, to the Munich Conference on Security Policy, and then field questions with a coherence and punch that President George Bush might well envy. As one US observer who was also present put it: 'People are always surprised that he can walk and chew gum at the same time. He's no genius, but you can't go through a swing door in Congress without knocking into several people dumber than Dan Quayle.' Mr Quayle did not threaten, as newspaper headlines (including the FT's) suggested, that the US would pull out of Nato if the EC failed to make concessions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Some of the Republican legislators present came closer to it. Senator William Cohen, for instance, warned of a 'prevailing and popular view in the United States that Nato is no longer relevant, necessary or affordable'. Senator Richard Lugar, a former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, interpreted a statement made the previous day by the Dutch foreign minister, Mr Hans van den Broek, as meaning that Europe had come together on the 'lowest common denominator' in the Gatt talks, 'and this put them further away from the US'. This, Mr Lugar said, 'will undermine all that we are talking about in terms of the US and Nato . . . Americans will not stay where they are not wanted'. Compared with this, Mr Quayle's remarks were very positive. He did say that the Gatt round was 'critical to the security of Europe, the security of the United States (and) the security of Asia', because a world fragmenting into trade blocks with no 'comprehensive understanding' between them would be a less secure one. He did say that the compromise framework proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, the Gatt secretary-general, represented the way to go. People on both sides 'are going to nitpick that', he added, 'but friends, we have to get on with it'. It is hard to imagine any American official saying less than that to a European audience in present circumstances; and, so far from threatening a withdrawal from Nato, Mr Quayle went out of his way to play down the importance of isolationism and protectionism in American politics. Unlike Mr Cohen, who had warned that 'many would like to retreat into a continental cocoon and zip out the rest of the world' and that more statesmanlike attitudes would not be rewarded by the electorate, Mr Quayle said: 'Protectionism may in some districts be advantageous to getting elected, but I'm telling you that is not the way to get elected president of the United States.' He claimed it had backfired against both Mr John Connally in 1980 and Mr Dick Gephardt in 1988, and that in the current New Hampshire primary Senator Bob Kerrey had withdrawn a protectionist TV commercial, admitting it was a mistake. It was in reply to this that Mr Lugar - perhaps playing hard cop to the vice-president's soft one - said that 'the tides towards isolationism and protectionism, even though beaten back, are very strong'. After listening to all this it seemed quaint to hear Mr Martin O'Neill, defence spokesman of the British Labour party, declare at the same Munich conference that the 'single largest threat' to the Atlantic alliance was 'the uncertainty created by the floating of the concept of a Franco-German force'. This, Mr O'Neill said, 'creates problems going to the very heart of the alliance'. How, he asked, would it relate to Nato's command structure, in which Germany at present participates while France does not? Who, he went on - apparently supposing that Bonn and Paris were bent on a complete merger of their entire armed forces - would have responsibility for French nuclear weapons? And he concluded with a solemn warning that 'those who use their Europeanism to cloak their continental chauvinism do no service to either cause'. Very strange. Mr O'Neill, spokesman of a party which has often been critical of US leadership, and which now regularly accuses its Conservative opponents of being half-hearted about European integration, appeared to be supporting Mr Richard Perle, the ultra-hawk or 'prince of darkness' of the Pentagon during the Reagan years. Mr Perle had warned that 'French policy is aimed at the destruction of the alliance which has served us so well', and chided the Germans for their apparent unwillingness to lead the resistance to this Gallic iniquity. The explanation is, no doubt, that the Labour party is so terrified that it might again be portrayed as 'weak on defence' in the UK election campaign that it is determined to appear more royalist than the king, or in this instance more Atlanticist than the president of the United States. (Mr Bush, after all, signed a Nato declaration last November welcoming 'the developing European security identity and defence role'.) Not surprisingly both General Klaus Naumann, inspector-general of the German armed forces, and Mr Serge Boidevaix, the French ambassador in Bonn, leapt to the defence of their countries' plans, protesting that so far from being a threat to the alliance these represented a sincere attempt to strengthen it, which they hoped other European countries would join. More interesting was the reaction from Mr Jacques Baumel, a veteran Gaullist leader, who said that the changes now in progress had removed the grounds of General de Gaulle's original objections to Nato's integrated command structure back in the 1960s. France, he said, already took part in numerous Nato groups and committees, and had 'no ambition to be the Albania of the western alliance'. As for Franco-German friendship, 'one of the post-war miracles', this was the last thing anyone should be reproached for. The vast majority of French people wanted the Americans to stay in Europe. 'But the Europeans can play a bigger role in the alliance. It would be very unfortunate if the Atlanticists and the Americans were to reject this gift that they're being offered.' It is a pity that the French government, which has to make policy on the basis of nods and winks from the ever inscrutable President Francois Mitterrand, does not express itself so clearly on this issue. If the British Labour party is now more Atlanticist than the Americans, one could perhaps say that the French Socialist government is now more Gaullist than the Gaullists. For while it frequently proclaims its support for the alliance and its desire to see the US remain involved in Europe, it also gives the impression that it fears American hegemony and wants to see Europe develop a political and military identity completely independent from the US. To that extent Mr Perle and Mr O'Neill are right. Where they are wrong is in failing to understand and support the efforts of the Germans, and more generally of France's European partners, to wean France away from this anachronistic attitude and engage it in building Europe on the only realistic basis, which is that of a close, even if more equally balanced, alliance and partnership with the US. In accepting the role of the Western European Union as defined at Maastricht last December, the French have in fact come a long way in that direction. They should be encouraged, not rebuffed.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Cookery: Mixing it in the backwaters of Thailand - Kieran Cooke recalls dazed nights sipping an electrifying rice whisky with the kick of a mule YOUR starter for 10: What is Mekong? Ah, you say, no problem. 'Mighty river flowing through Indo-China, for centuries one of the great arteries of the world, dividing baking-hot rice fields, plains and mighty jungle covered uplands . . .' But hold on. Listen again. It was not Mekong. It was Mae Khohng. Something different altogether, though from the same part of the world. If you have the answer then you win a pair of dark glasses and a lifetime supply of liver salts. Mae Khohng is a form of whisky made of rice and various electrifying ingredients, including molasses, a special mould and yeast. It is unique to Thailand - though once I stumbled on a bottle on the back shelf of a dingy wine shop in Paris. It is a drink to be approached carefully, like a dangerous looking animal. But treat Mae Khohng the right way and it is magical. I first came across Mae Khohng in the northern Thai town of Chiang Mai in the early 1970s. Beer was too expensive an accompaniment for long evening meals at the night market. Mae Khohng was the local tipple. One sip and I was hooked. For starters, it was cheap: 25 Thai Baht - about Pounds 1 at the time - a bottle. The mix is the most vital part of the drink. Mae Khohng drunk straight is lethal, equivalent to a hefty kick from a very angry mule. Instead there is a ritualistic mixing process. For this, you could have no better guide than Major Roy Hudson, a great character in the 1960s and 1970s in Chiang Mai. He wrote a guide to Chiang Mai, and dealt extensively with the mysteries of Mae Khohng. The mixture he favoured was the Barkowsky, named after a renegade Polish artist who lived and drank in the town. 'Pour one and a half fingers (a generous peg) into a crystal glass. Add ice and (this is the master touch) a squeeze of lime. Top up with sparkling soda. Float on a couple of slices of lime (optional).' Major Hudson, Poona Club member and former commander of the Nawab of Malerkotla's Engineers in Burma, described Mae Khohng as 'probably the best drink east of Suez.' It was certainly seductive on those long evenings, as a few of us would sit watching the world go by, breathing in a heady mixture of night jasmine and exhaust fumes. One of the difficulties was that the Mae Khohng and the soda would never keep an even pace with each other. You would buy a quarter bottle of Mae Khohng (for about 30p) and order a bottle of soda. After a while you would need more soda (which cost about the same as the Mae Khohng). Then you would discover that the Mae Khohng was finished but there was still most of a bottle of soda left. More Mae Khohng would then be ordered. Soon, one could develop what Americans would refer to as 'a problem'. Meals would often be shared with Bob Cooper, an anthropologist who does worthy work running a refugee camp in the far north of Thailand. We used to bet the bill on the one who guessed the date of the Mae Khohng vintage. The production date, according to the Buddhist calendar, would be visible on the inside of the label. It was always very young, sometimes premature, with a date still to come showing through the amber liquid. Since the early 1970s Thailand has changed a great deal. The country's economy has boomed. The tourists have flooded in. Bangkok now vies with Mexico City for the title of world's most polluted capital. Chiang Mai has been transformed from sleepy town to bustling metropolis. Thais have taken to consuming more sophisticated, imported drinks. Mae Khohng is not so widely available as it was. I know Cooper is still going strong. I hope Major Hudson is, too. If so, somewhere in northern Thailand there will be a table covered with Mae Khohng, soda bottles and lime skins. And two figures, looking a little dazed, discussing Burma, Buddha and the date on the inside of a bottle. More food and wine on Page XII</p>

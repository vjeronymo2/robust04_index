			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: Four options exchanges in European link-up FOUR European futures and options exchanges yesterday signed a co-operation agreement which could lead to wider international distribution of listed derivative financial products. The Amsterdam-based European Options Exchange, OM Group, which has exchanges in both London and Stockholm, and the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) signed the agreement in London. The members of the alliance, known as First European Exchanges (Fex), hope to offer local access to derivative financial products developed in other countries. For example, the OMX index of Swedish equities could be traded from Amsterdam. A number of cross-listing agreements between national exchanges are already in place. For example, EOE has co-operation agreements on the cross-listing of products with the American Stock Exchange in New York and with several other European exchanges. Its biggest 'exported' product is the Eurotop 100 share index, which tracks equity prices across the continent. However, until now such deals have stopped short of full fungibility: although futures or options contracts have the same specifications on each exchange, trading is separate and prices can differ between exchanges. The Fex alliance hopes to offer fully fungible access to contracts by developing technology links and sharing market information. The three exchanges together attract an average daily trading volume of around 140,000 contracts, similar to the turnover of the London International Financial Futures Exchange or the Matif, the Paris exchange, which are Europe's biggest derivatives markets. However, there is a trend for business to become concentrated in the larger exchanges. The participants in Fex said yesterday they expected more European exchanges to join the alliance. The agreement is the first step towards a fully fledged alliance. The individual exchanges will research local demand for each other's financial products and examine the potential for developing common dealing systems.</p>

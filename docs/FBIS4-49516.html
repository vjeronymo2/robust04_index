The newspaper added that the visit of the most  honorable guest from China to Mongolia at this juncture in which  the bilateral relationship is moving ahead in line with the new  era and the new concept has contributed greatly to enhancing the  friendly and cooperative relationship between the countries.    The commentary notes that because China has been  accelerating  the pace of its development and expanding its scale of  development in recent years, it is playing an increasingly  larger role in international politics and in the world's  economic life.    The commentary points out that during his visit to Mongolia,  Premier Li Peng stressed that the Chinese Government has always  attached importance to Sino-Mongolian ties, that China will not  interfere in Mongolia's internal affairs, and that China is  willing to work together with the Mongolian Government to  develop lasting good-neighbor, friendly, and cooperative  relations which look to the 21st century.

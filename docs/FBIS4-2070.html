			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, April 6 (XINHUA) -- The Shenzhen  Securities Exchange in one of China's earliest special economic  development zones will underwrite 700 million to 800 million  yuan worth of "B" shares of stocks in the days to come.    The B shares targeted at overseas investors will be listed  by  companies and corporations from both in and outside the special  zone.    Two companies in Shenzhen plan to issue stocks in the United  States in the form of the American depositary receipts (ADR).    The Shenzhen Infrastructure Fund, a cooperative one with  foreign investors, is expected to enter the capital markets  overseas, too.    Experts in the city are now discussing relevant issues on  the  underwriting of stocks abroad.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: WRIGHT QUITS ASSEMBLY RACE  </P> <P> Political consultant Rod Wright has dropped out of the race for the 50th  Assembly District seat of the late Curtis R. Tucker. He endorsed Tucker's son,  Curtis R. Tucker Jr., in the Feb. 7 election.  </P> <P> A longtime campaign consultant, Wright said Wednesday that the short campaign  period and the backing of powerful Democrats make Tucker unbeatable.  </P> <P> "I'm not interested in being a spoiler," said Wright, who had never run for  office before. "I don't want to run in a race when I don't feel there's a  chance I can win."  </P> <P> Wright's name will still appear on the special election ballot, along with  fellow Democrats Tucker, Inglewood school board member Lois Hill-Hale and Los  Angeles police officer Carl McGill. Business consultant Michael Davis is the  only Republican. Wright said his withdrawal makes it more likely that Tucker  will get more than 50% of the vote. If he does, Tucker will win the seat and  avoid an April runoff against Davis.  </P> <P> The district encompasses El Segundo, Inglewood, Lennox, Westchester and parts  of South Los Angeles.  </P></p>

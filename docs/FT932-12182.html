			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fasteners side puts Reece in the red REDUCED demand in its fasteners division left Reece, the cycles group which also makes door panels and machinery for the ceramic industry, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 662,000 for 1992 compared with restated pre-tax profits of Pounds 373,000. Operating losses from fasteners were Pounds 691,000 (Pounds 215,000 profits). Door panels suffered a Pounds 12,000 loss (Pounds 127,000 profits) while profits in the cycle division fell by Pounds 78,000 to Pounds 258,000. However, the company said that because of the continued growth of Probike cycle sales, new warehousing facilities had been required and part of the Solihull fastener depot had been released for that purpose. Reece added that it had responded to the harsher economic environment by cutting costs, rationalising operations and reducing working capital and capital expenditure. Stock levels in fasteners had been reviewed and additional provisions made where necessary. Turnover slipped to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 14.2m). Losses per share worked through at 0.52p (0.43p earnings) and there is no dividend.</p>

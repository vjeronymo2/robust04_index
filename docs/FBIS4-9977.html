			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Raquel Stenzel] </F>   [Text] Brasilia -- The Finance Ministry announced late in  the afternoon on 30 March that it managed to reach an agreement  to sign contracts to reschedule the debts of the states and 60  percent of the municipalities that owe money to the government.  With this step, the federal government concludes the internal  debt renegotiation process that began in 1991; reestablished the  repayment flow between the federal government, the states, and  municipalities; and ensured that the contracted debt -- which  amounts to $23 billion -- will be paid in 20 years.    As payment guarantee the federal government will receive  quotas from the states' and municipalities' Participation Funds  besides their own budgets. Eleven states and many municipalities  signed their debt rescheduling contract on 30 March. They are:  Goias, Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, Para, Tocantins,  Rondonia, Roraima, Amazonas, Parana, Rio Grande do Norte, and  Acre. The official deadline to sign the contracts is 7 April,  but the federal government made an effort in the past few days  to have them all signed by 1 April because with the inclusion of  the new month, all the calculations would have to be redone.    The municipalities that have few debts may perhaps still be  able to reschedule them before the final deadline, given that  their main creditor, the Federal Savings Bank (CEF), is updating  their debts and interest based on 1 April.    The capitals that already had signed debt rescheduling  contracts by 30 March were: Maceio, Goiania, Campo Grande,  Porto Alegre, Natal, Sao Luis, Rio Branco, Cuiaba, Fortaleza,  and Belo Horizonte.    According to federal government experts, the big absence in  the list is the city of Sao Paulo.    According to the national Treasury, only $8.3 billion out of  a total $23 billion in debt had been renegotiated by 28 February  -- that is, just seven municipalities had rescheduled their  debts out of a total of 200 municipalities.    The reestablishment of the repayment flow will mainly  benefit  the CEF, which is the greatest creditor of states and  municipalities. Out of the $8.3 billion renegotiated by the end  of February, 85.4 percent is debts contracted with the CEF.  Government experts believe the CEF will be able to grant more  credits now that it has the guarantee of repayment by its  debtors.</p>

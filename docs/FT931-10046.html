			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: South African steel group cuts dividend HIGHVELD Steel and Vanadium, the South African steel producer which is part of the Anglo American group, reported steeply lower profits for 1992 and is to cut its dividend. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said demand for all products had deteriorated. He did not make a specific profit forecast for 1993 but said he expected the bottom of the cycle would be reached during the current year. Although 1992 turnover rose by 8 per cent to R1.49bn (Dollars 477m), pre-tax income declined by 32 per cent to R74.4m. A sharp fall in the tax bill to R3.6m, from R13.6m, limited the decline in attributable income to R70.8m from R95.6m. An increase in the number of shares in issue, however, saw earnings per share fall to 80.1 cents from 130 cents. The overall dividend was cut to 45 cents from 70 cents per share. On the steel side, Mr Boyd said the group had faced poor export conditions owing to oversupply, while a weak local economy and destocking by merchants had caused a significant decline in local sales. Vanadium consumption - Highveld is the world's largest producer - remained weak, and Mr Boyd noted that the Vantra division operated at only 25 per cent of capacity. Mr Boyd said the R3.5bn Columbus stainless steel project, in which Highveld is a one-third partner, offered 'significant' future benefits for Highveld's profits. When completed, it will be the world's sixth-largest producer of stainless steel.</p>

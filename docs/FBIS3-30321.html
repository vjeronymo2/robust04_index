In an interview with the correspondent of MTI and Hungarian  Radio, Jeszenszky said that talks went beyond the expectations  of cautious optimism. The leaders of Serbia and Yugoslavia are  ready to fulfil the wishes of the international community, yet  how these are realized in Sarajevo and Bosnia is a different  matter.    "It is even more important for us that not merely the  readiness, but the will also exists to improve and settle  bilateral relations on the part of both sides, and this can take  place amidst the current upholding of sanctions. The end of  sanctions, after fulfilling the requirements of the  international community, is in the interest of all," Jeszenszky  said.    "There were talks about high-level negotiations, but the  priority now is practical steps. Serbian President Milosevic  reported on the situation of Hungarians in Vojvodina, and I am  curious to see how the promises are fulfilled in the future.  This theme is on the agenda of talks between Serbian leadership  and Vojvodina Hungarians, however, I indicated that the  legitimate representatives of the Vojvodina Hungarians enjoy the  support of the Hungarian Government," Foreign Minister  Jeszenszky said.    Speaking to MTI, president of the Democratic Community of  Hungarians in Vojvodina, Andras Agoston, said the meeting held  with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic forms part of a series  of consultations which have not yet been concluded.    "This means quite a lot for us, as on the one hand they  recognize us as a political factor, and on the other, we can  show a responsible approach to Yugoslav politics," Agoston said.    In his statement, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic stressed that a political and psychological turn had  taken place in the Hungarian-Yugoslav talks, which should lead  to the stabilization of relations, to normalization, and  ultimately bring peace to the entire region.    "Agreement was reached on numerous issues, and we must  immediately implement these in order to be able to regard these  talks as genuinely historical later on. Talks covered all  essential topics, stressing there is a mutual intention for the  sanctions to be lifted, and for us to prepare expanding  relations. We agreed to eliminate all phenomena which could  threaten this process," Jovanovic said.</p>

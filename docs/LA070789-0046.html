			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Police found small-caliber ammunition -- similar to that used in three shooting  deaths in Balboa Park last November -- in the same area of the park where six  men were arrested Wednesday in connection with the fatal stabbing of an  apparent robbery victim, authorities said Thursday.  </P> <P> Despite the find, police said there was no strong evidence to link the crimes  last November with Wednesday's killing, said homicide Sgt. Frank Martinez.  Though it had not been ruled out, such a connection was "like reaching in the  dark," Martinez said.  </P> <P> Franklin James Black, 34, a San Diego resident, died of multiple stab wounds  early Wednesday after an apparent robbery near Balboa Drive and Maple Street.  He might have been walking or jogging in the area, Martinez said.  </P> <P> Police combed the park and arrested six men who had been living in the park's  canyons. Some of the men had blood on their clothing. Fourteen people were  initially detained for questioning.  </P> <P> Officers found Black's wallet and the weapon believed to have been used in his  death close to where the men were apprehended, Martinez said.  </P> <P> The six men, who identified themselves to police as Mexicans, are being held in  County Jail downtown. The men, who told police they entered the country  illegally, gave their names as Juan Sanchez Valenzuela, 18; Arnulfo Garcia  Gonzales, 21; Javier Garcia Gutierrez, 19; Jamie Valdez Villareal, 22; Angel  Munoz Espinosa, 18; and Jose Lopez Montaina, 21.  </P></p>

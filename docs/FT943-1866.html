			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Overall accounts watchdog proposed One of the six leading bodies for accountants will today propose the creation of a new supervisory and controlling council for the profession. Mr John Moore, president of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, said: 'The General Accounting Council will provide a single, prestigious and authoritative organisation to deal with those areas where the profession has shared a responsibility to the public, and common professional interests.' The move follows a series of consultation meetings with chartered association members in the current talks on the future structure of the profession. Only 19 per cent backed a merger plan put forward by the working party of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, the existing supervisory body for the profession. That proposal was to create three institutes splitting the UK into three geographical areas. Mr Moore said the consultation programme showed that the committee plan had 'too many drawbacks to be taken any further'. Problems identified by the chartered association included the need to find a common 'designation' for all accountants, how to serve the needs of students overseas, and how to represent effectively the 200,000 accountants affected in England and Wales. The chartered association said that the proposal would protect its own core values of open access and flexible entry.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Italy leads June turnover recovery - But Switzerland showed the real strength Far from selling in May and going away, investors came back to European bourses in June as the FT-Actuaries Europe index rose by 3 per cent in local currency terms. After month-on-month falls of 25 per cent in April, as political and economic worries took their toll, and 2.3 per cent in an indecisive May, aggregate turnover in Europe's eight biggest equity markets increased by 20 per cent over the month. There were signs that domestic investors were returning to their markets, says Mr James Cornish, a strategist with NatWest Securities, which produces the figures. Seaq International, the London-based screen trading system, showed a rise of 8.9 per cent on the month, indicating that international investors were relatively quiet. Recording the greatest turnover increase for the month was Italy, a rise of 56.9 per cent taking it back to the levels it enjoyed in March and April. This was no small thing. Turnover of upwards of L30,000bn a month in Italy takes it to three or four times the level it averaged in the first half of 1992; and there had been fears that Italian volume would not recover, as the ever-widening corruption scandal blighted hopes of a post-devaluation economic recovery. Switzerland, once again, outperformed a rising Europe in share price terms with a gain of 4.7 per cent on strong fundamentals, a rising dollar, the view that its banks were still quite cheap, and a recovery in the pharmaceutical sector after worries about President Bill Clinton's healthcare package in the US. Swiss turnover showed a rise of 48.5 per cent on the month. The question arising from this is why Dutch turnover only increased by 7.6 per cent in June: Amsterdam bourse performance ran parallel with that of Zurich, showing a gain of 4.7 per cent in local terms on the month and 15.7 per cent for the six months to June, compared with 9.7 per cent for Europe as a whole. Mr Cornish reckons that the turnover arose from the quality of the stocks underlying the gains in the market. So, while Switzerland's winners had strong defensive qualities, the Netherlands saw a highly cyclical upturn based on shares such as those of DSM, the chemicals group, or Hoogovens, in steels. In this instance, he thinks, there was more of a trading quality to the gains. Germany rose by 26.2 per cent on the month, just ahead of the French 25.5 per cent increase on the post-election sell-off. Foreign buying of German stocks increased on signs that the west German economy was bottoming out; but there, the fun is still to come, with turnover in the first nine trading days of July up by 49 per cent from the average for June.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                      EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse            Mar       Apr      May       Jun      US                  1993      1993     1993      1993   Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium         70.30     58.18     40.98     50.65      1.45 France         159.17    117.45    122.95    154.32     26.85 Germany        168.06    113.50    104.40    131.80     77.30 Italy        31,337.6  31,098.4  19,665.6  30,864.8     19.97 Netherlands     21.80     16.80     15.70     16.90      8.83 Spain          856.96    598.87  1,116.74    844.84      6.49 Switzerland     18.90     14.00     16.70     24.80     16.42 UK              51.82     38.79     40.62     41.86     62.47  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

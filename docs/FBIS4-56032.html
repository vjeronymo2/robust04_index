			<p>BFN     [Text] Recent Solidarity strikes in hard coal collieries  ended in complete disaster and humiliation for the organizers  and the strike became a way of playing politics by Solidarity  leaders at the expense of miners. Such is the opinion of a  mining team of the August-80 Free Trade Union in Katowice.    For the first time the government coerced the strikers'  representatives to accept the fact that strikers would not be  paid for the period of the strike. In the team's opinion  Solidarity leaders promised the strikers that they would be paid  for the period of the strike. Currently, however, they are  avoiding responsibility for the effects of the protest.</p>

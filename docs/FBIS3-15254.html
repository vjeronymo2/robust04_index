The talks  ended in signing an ample package of Russo-Uzbek documents.    The documents include intergovernmental agreements on  principles of mutual technical and material supply of armed  forces, on cooperation in air transport, on avoiding double  taxation.    Russian and Uzbek plenipotentiary envoys signed a consular  convention, a programme for cooperation between the foreign  ministries for 1994, agreements on cooperation and mutual  assistance in customs affairs, on cooperation between customs  offices in seizing and returning illegally exported and imported  cultural treasures, as well as in customs inspection of  citizens' personal belongings.

"I am very happy about the talks outcome", he  stressed.

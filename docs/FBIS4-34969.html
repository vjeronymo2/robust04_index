			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTV" newscast] </F>   [Text] Eastern Army forces maintain full combat readiness  to quickly and effectively repel any enemy attack. This was  confirmed by Army commanders at the beginning of a tour that  began in Guantanamo Province and will extend to Camaguey  Province, with the participation of national media directors as  guests. The visit had a definite goal:    [Begin unidentified commander recording] First of all, we  want the comrades to learn about the work we do, the actions we  carry out in the territory -- not only in the Army, but also in  the territories of six provinces, where the Eastern Army is  deployed. [end recording]    The five-point rating given by the Eastern Army commander to  this infantry exercise and the satisfactory results achieved on  the shooting range by Border Guard troops showed that the  personnel's preparation has achieved even better results than  last year. Equally magnificent were the efforts exerted to  prepare the area of military operations, the implementation of  techniques, the protection of weapons, tasks in which the  Eastern Army maintains a vanguard position.    The Arturo Lince Gonzalez Agrarian and Livestock Enterprise  in Sabanetas displayed the efforts carried out by local leaders  to achieve food self sufficiency. It suffered losses last year,  but it hopes to become feasible this year with higher  production. We must not forget that the Eastern Army intends to  double its food production, and finance almost a fifth of its  budget.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified female speaker] I am quite  pleased to verify that the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces] are  very productive for the country; that it is an Army permanently  involved in production activities for the country, thus setting  an example of how to carry out production activities with  controls, economic analyses, and efficiency.    [Unidentified male speaker] I have seen what the other  Armies  are doing,and I believe it will be a close tie because any of  the three Armies can win. I, however, think there is a strong  contingent -- the Eastern Army. [end recording]    The Eastern Army's commander said it is rightfully called  the  best FAR command, and others will have to work hard to win that  title.    [Begin Division General Ramon Espinoza recording] The FAR  will be the winner even if we lose our title. [end recording:    Guantanamo has proven that this is possible, meaning that  the  Eastern Army will again win the title of best FAR command.</p>

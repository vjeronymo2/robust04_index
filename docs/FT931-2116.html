			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Helping Russia to decide PRESIDENT Yeltsin could not have been clearer, in his televised address on Saturday, about the choice now facing the Russian people. In the plebiscite planned for April 25, they have to decide whether the leader they elected by a 57 per cent majority in June 1991 is to be allowed to get on with the economic and democratic reforms he then pledged to undertake, or whether they prefer to be ruled by an assemblage of anti-democratic relics from the old Soviet state. In putting the question, and in giving himself 'special powers' between now and the plebiscite, Mr Yeltsin is taking an enormous gamble. It comes perilously late in the day, when much of his political capital has already been spent. It is also not clear if he has thought through precisely how to frame the vote or to proceed thereafter: on Saturday he vowed to seek approval for a new draft constitution and electoral law on top of a vote of confidence, an agenda which may prove unmanageable. What is certain is that the Russian president has no choice but to seek a renewal of his popular mandate if he is to retain any capacity to pursue his reforms - and that the west has no option but to swallow any discomfort about the constitutional niceties and support him in the attempt. In doing so, western governments need to be aware of the dangers. They cannot afford to become so entwined with particular personalities in Russia's internal struggle that they lose their freedom of action or judgement. They cannot ignore the possibility that power has seeped away from the centre to such an extent that neither Mr Yeltsin nor anyone else can now prevent chaos in Russia. They can and should, however, make emphatically clear that they believe the reforms President Yeltsin symbolises to be the only path towards a peaceful and prosperous Russia in the long term; that the alternatives propounded in the Congress of People's Deputies are a recipe not for 'order' but for increased disintegration and conflict; and that assuming the plebiscite results in the creation of a more legitimate and coherent power structure in which reforms can be pursued, a serious, concerted and highly visible programme of financial assistance will be made available. The key words here are 'in the long term'. Mr Yeltsin's gamble can only pay off if it is the start of a sustained process. He cannot expect to produce a satisfactory constitutional settlement in a rush, and he cannot wait until a new constitution is in place before taking steps to make economic reform and financial stabilisation begin to work. That will almost certainly mean having to ask in the plebiscite for the extension of his special powers for a finite period while elections are held and deliberations completed on Russia's political future. It is a daunting challenge. The west should do what it can to secure success, but should start thinking now about the consequences of failure.</p>

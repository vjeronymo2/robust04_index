			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Bitter Lamont savages Major: Speech plunges premiership deep into crisis A SAVAGE attack by Mr Norman Lamont last night plunged Mr John Major's premiership into its gravest political crisis since he replaced Mrs Margaret Thatcher in 1990. The former chancellor, sacked two weeks ago in a cabinet reshuffle, told a spellbound House of Commons that Mr Major's beleaguered administration acted as if it was 'in office but not in power'. Clearly relishing his revenge, Mr Lamont warned that unless it abandoned its preoccupation with opinion polls and newspaper headlines, 'the government will not survive and will not deserve to survive'. Directing his comments at the prime minister's leadership, he said: 'There is something wrong with the way we make our decisions. The government listens too much to the pollsters and the party managers . . . There is too much short-termism, too much reacting to events, not enough shaping of events.' His speech lacked the devastating political force of those delivered by the then Mr Nigel Lawson and Sir Geoffrey Howe in the final stages of the Thatcher era. After the crises of the past few months, ministers and Conservative MPs were left wondering nonetheless whether Mr Major's premiership would now survive the rest of the year. But there is no obvious challenger to the prime minister. His close friends were also taking comfort last night from signs of a backlash against Mr Lamont for what one minister described as the former chancellor's 'self-serving disloyalty'. With the prime minister sitting, white-faced, in the Commons chamber, Mr Lamont said he had tried vainly for two-and-a-half years to persuade him to give independence to the Bank of England. As the bitterness seeped slowly through his 20-minute resignation speech, Mr Lamont also accused the prime minister of undermining the credibility of economic policy by allowing bad political news to dictate the timing of interest rate cuts. Friends said later he had been referring to the 1 percentage point cut in rates to 6 per cent at the start of this year. Exposing the struggle which led eventually to his dismissal, Mr Lamont claimed that, after the humiliation of sterling's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism last September, Mr Major had told him not to resign. By implication he also blamed Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, and Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, for forcing Mr Major to sack him. Mr Lamont's attack - the latest in a series of blows to Mr Major's political authority - overshadowed a concerted attempt by the prime minister and by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, to relaunch the government's economic strategy. Mr Major told MPs that he saw little prospect of sterling's return to the ERM during this parliament, while Mr Clarke emphasised in a series of interviews and speeches that his priority was to sustain the economic recovery. Mr Lamont's speech also provided a perfect platform for Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, to launch a scathing personal attack on the prime minister's leadership. While Mr Smith ridiculed the government's economic management, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, predicted that Mr Lamont's on-slaught marked the beginning of the end of Mr Major's leadership. The prime minister struggled to play down the significance of the attack - suggesting, for example, that he would have supported the idea of an independent central bank if ways could have been found to preserve democratic accountability. Mr Major was driven to respond to Mr Lamont's uncompromising defence of his record in the Treasury with the sharp retort: 'A strong government needs political skills as well when leading a democratic society and, in particular, handling a lively House of Commons with a small majority.' Mr Clarke strongly defended the prime minister and dismissed suggestions that he was poised to replace him. He said he did not recognise the former chancellor's description of the way the government operated. But the grim faces on the Tory benches and the lack of conviction with which many called on colleagues to rally round the prime minister suggested that Mr Lamont's charges had struck a dangerous chord. Mr Lamont's accusation that Mr Major prefers to react to events rather than shape them mirrored recent grumbling among Tory MPs. Some senior figures warned that unless Mr Major re-established his grip on the government by autumn there would be strong pressure for him to stand down. During a speech in which he absolved himself of any blame for the economic problems of the past few years, Mr Lamont dwelt on the events which had led to last September's ERM debacle. He said that at one point he had suggested sterling's suspension from the system, although he admitted that this would not have been in time to prevent Black Wednesday. Suggesting that he had then been ready to resign, a view rejected immediately by the prime minister's office, Mr Lamont said he had remained as chancellor because of loyalty to the prime minister.

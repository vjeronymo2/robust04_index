			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Cheap and cheerful: Changing patterns of Japanese retailing When Mr Yukio Higuchi started Kawachiya, Japan's first discount liquor store, 30 years ago, he had a hard time fending off gangsters sent by competitors to loiter around his warehouse. Discounting was virtually unheard of and shoppers were sceptical about the quality of his beers and whiskies, drastically cheaper than in other retail outlets. Today, however, his business in the east end of Tokyo is buoyant. Annual sales have more than doubled over the past three years to Y15bn (Pounds 95.5m), and it is not the thugs he has trouble keeping out from his stores anymore, but the swarm of shoppers attracted by the cheap prices. Kawachiya is just one example of the many Japanese discount retailers now experiencing a surge in sales. Hit by the sharp downturn of the economy and subsequent declines in overtime and annual bonus payments, consumers have curbed spending and are looking for bargains. The shift in consumption patterns has begun to alter the archaic landscape of Japan's retail industry. Until now, Japan's traditional small corner shops and upmarket department stores have, unlike their western counterparts, seen only limited competition from supermarkets and specialist discounters. The start of a shake-out is evident in the sharp rise in earnings of discount retailers such as Aoyama, the men's suit retailer, which have used their bulk purchasing power to cut prices and threaten manufacturers' dominance. Taxable profits at the top five discounters last year were 94 per cent higher than in 1990 (see chart). Success has been at the expense of Japan's upmarket but sleepy department stores, where sales fell an average of 2.5 per cent in January from the previous year, the 23rd consecutive monthly decline. Mitsukoshi expects to report losses for the year to the end of February, the second year in a row. Apart from Japan's recession, several domestic and foreign factors account for the rise of discount retailing: first, pressure from the US to cut Japan's Dollars 8.26bn trade surplus has led to the deregulation of Japan's multilayered distribution and retailing system. In 1990 the Japanese government responded to US complaints by curbing the 'anti-competitive practices' employed by manufacturers to maintain retail prices at artificially high levels. In the past manufacturers would threaten to stop deliveries if a retailer failed to apply the 'suggested retail price' set by the manufacturer. Not surprisingly, the habit had proved intractable because the pre-set retail price traditionally included profit margins for the four to five wholesalers along the distribution line, all of which lost out when prices fell. The reforms of three years ago gave more power to the Fair Trade Commission, the country's previously toothless anti-monopoly watchdog, to clamp down on overpricing. The commission forced leading Japanese beer companies, including Kirin Brewery and Asahi Breweries, to place advertisements in newspapers announcing that retailers and wholesalers were allowed to set their own prices. Last year, the commission told the sales subsidiaries of leading consumer electronics companies, including Matsushita and Sony, to allow retailers to discount their products without fear of losing supply contracts. American pressure for access to Japanese consumer markets can also take much of the credit for liberalising the laws which protect small retailers from new high street competitors. As a result, retailers can now open stores with floor space of up to 1,000 square metres without the approval of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Existing small shopkeepers, often operating in premises of less than 100 square metres, tried unsuccessfully to resist this change. Second, the first foreign retailers to set up in Japan since the retailing law was reformed in 1990, are breaking the links between the manufacturers and the high street. In 1991, Toys 'R' Us, the US discount toy store chain, became the first retailer to skip over the intricate web of wholesalers to deal directly with one of its suppliers, Nintendo, the video game maker. Toys 'R' Us undercut Japanese toy prices by leaving out the middle man. This approach has gone down so well with customers that its Japanese turnover per store is Dollars 15m to Dollars 20m a year, double the sales per store in the US. More foreign retailers can be expected to follow this example if only because the number of wholesalers is expected to decline sharply through bankruptcies and mergers. Britain's Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, and The Gap, the US-based clothing chain - long accustomed to dealing directly with their suppliers in their own markets - are expressing interest in Japan. Third, the expansion of national supermarket chains with greater bulk purchasing power has led to price cuts of imported clothing and foods. Some supermarkets have seized on this advantage, magnified by the strength of the yen, to promote their own discount brands. For example, Daiei, the country's largest chain, has launched a private label orange juice imported from Brazil at half the price of national brands. Now its own label product accounts for 80 per cent of Daiei's total orange juice sales. The company has been a pioneer of the profound changes affecting Japan's conservative high streets. Mr Dean Perry, who studies the retail market for Lehman Brothers, the broker, in Tokyo, says 'Walmart wannabes' will continue to take market share from 'mom and pop' corner stores and department stores. These are price-efficient discount chains modelling themselves after Walmart, the largest discount chain in the US. Mr Paul Heaton, retailing expert at Baring Securities in Tokyo, agrees that the outlook for department stores is poor, but notes that their malaise may not be terminal because they are flush with cash from many years of overpricing. Isetan, a leading department store, reckons that one way to attract consumers is to specialise. So it has formed a joint venture with Barneys, the upmarket fashion store in New York, to open a Tokyo shop for high-fashion customers. Most observers believe that Japanese retailing will follow a pattern similar to that in the US in the 1980s, when the advance of supermarkets and discount stores forced independent retailers to specialise, become more efficient or go out of business. With structural changes in place and consumers more aware of value than in the past, it is difficult to see how the cozy, cartel-like links between manufacturers, distributors and retailers can be reforged even when the country emerges from its present slowdown.</p>

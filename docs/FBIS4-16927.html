			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 16, 11-17 April </F> 94]    [Text] According to reliable sources in Simferopol,  Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov signed a package of documents on  14 April, which in many respects contradict Kiev's basic  economic guidelines. No official response from the central  authority followed, however.    The Crimean President's Decree on currency regulation and  control provides, in particular, for establishment, within a  two-month term of the Crimean Interbank Currency Exchange, which  is supposed to sell the mandatory 50-percent share of Crimea's  aggregate hard currency incomings to Crimea's residents.    Prior to the hard currency trading onset Crimean residents  are free to opt for one of the following modes:    (a) Effect mandatory 50 percent currency sales and purchases  on the Crimean interbank market at a free rate, or    (b) Pay the currency tax at rates set by the Crimean  Government.    The remainder of hard currency incomings is supposed to be  used by Crimean residents at their discretion.    Foreign currency means derived by natural person-residents  by  way of their labor remuneration, except those earned through  business activities, are exempt from the otherwise mandatory  sale.    The Crimean Republican Bank sets exchange rates for  currencies on a daily basis.    So, if this decree proves viable and working, Crimea's  currency regulation mode will radically differ from the  Ukrainian government-imposed practices, which imply mandatory  selling a half of all the currency earned by Ukrainian  producer-exporters at the NBU [National Bank of Ukraine]-set  rate maintained at the very unrealistic 1,2610 krb.  [karbovonets]:1 USD rate for over five months by now. The other  half of hard currency earnings may be used only by the agreement  of the Cabinet's body, which was specifically set up for this  purpose.    Crimean President Meshkov's decree on improving taxation and  settling in Crimea's national economy contains some innovative  provisions, not consistent with Ukraine's active legislation, in  particular, abrogation of the income tax and introduction of a  30 percent tax on juridical persons' profits, consumption funds  for all tax-payers, irrespective of their proprietorial form  status, reduced VAT and excise for a number of commodities to  spur their marketing.    The decree's preamble states that their issuance was by way  of compliance with President Kravchuk's decree of 23 June 1993  "On the open economy regime on the Crimean Republic's territory."    In view of Kiev's lacking official comments it's a matter of  pure guess-work and sheer conjecture to try to both determine  the Crimean presidential decrees' politically declarative  content and predict how soon, if ever, they will be nullified by  President Kravchuk.    However, if really implemented, they are certain to attract  a  massive flow of banking capital into the peninsular republic.    Many analysts tend to trace the decrees to Chairman of the  Crimean Council of Ministers Saburov, who more likely than not  is their architect.</p>

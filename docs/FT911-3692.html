			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 2,500 level lost in slow trade UK STOCKS suffered another sharp reversal yesterday, falling nearly 30 points to close below the FT-SE 2,500 mark as investor optimism melted away on both sides of the Atlantic. Selling pressure remained fairly modest but buyers continued to avoid UK equities, believing that further cuts in UK interest rates may be delayed and that the domestic economy remains depressed. The Footsie Index ended 29.3 down at 2,490.8, the low of the day and the first close below 2,500 since the beginning of the month. Concern over interest rates and economic uncertainties mirrored those in New York. London, already depressed by the fall of almost 34 Dow points in New York on Friday, fell sharply in late dealings yesterday as Wall Street recorded a loss of a further 32 Dow points early in the new session. Having failed to show much enthusiasm last week for Wall Street's successful, albeit brief, move above Dow 3,000, the UK market now seems to be reacting quickly to the fall in the US market. As often when the underlying equity market lacks certainty, share prices reacted to movements in the June futures contract on the FT-SE Index. In late trading the futures contract turned down and led the underlying equity market below the 2,500 mark. However, equity trading volumes were moderate in London yesterday, with Seaq recorded turnover at 403m shares, compared with 465.8m on Friday and as much as 700m shares daily during last month's bullish period. Lower volume is disturbing for the securities industry; London Stock Exchange data shows that retail business fell to the Pounds 700m to Pounds 800m daily range last week, after running well above Pounds 1bn daily in March. The latest Confederation of British Industry/Financial Times survey of distributive trades did little to change views on the underlying sluggishness of consumer business - an unexpected rise in high street sales appeared to reflect special factors, chiefly the sharp increase in value added tax announced in the UK Budget in mid-March. Today brings the UK trade figures for last month, which equity market analysts predict will show little change from the Pounds 0.7bn monthly deficit recorded in February. Wall Street's influence brought widespread falls in the blue chip internationals, where the dollar's strength proved no help to such US currency earners as BAT Industries and the pharmaceutical stocks. ICI, with first-quarter trading figures due this week, fell smartly. With crude oil prices still unsettled and many analysts bearish, BP and the other leading oil producer shares could make little headway in yesterday's stock market. The retail group took the CBI/FT survey fairly well, and although there was little buying across the broad range of the sector, there were a few firm spots. Ratners, the jewellery chain, brushed off disappointing results as investors continued to show faith that there will be a recovery in the economy, and thus in consumer confidence, by the end of the year. Kingfisher, the high street stores group, managed one of the firm performances of the session. Mr Neil Mackinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi, warned that the next shock for London and other global equity markets could come on Friday, when the first-quarter GNP data for the US economy are published. 'So far there is little evidence to support the official view of an early recovery in the (US) economy,' said Mr Mackinnon.</p>

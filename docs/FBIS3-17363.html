			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 24, BNS -- Population Minister Peeter  Olesk and special representative of the government in Paldiski  Juri Tikk in an interview to BNS resolutely contradicted rumors  that the authorities are making up lists of Paldiski residents  to be deported.    Rumors have lately been circulating in Paldiski that the  number in the stamp entered in documents during registration of  the population denotes the order in which people will be  deported from Estonia. In reality the numbers 1, 2 or 3 in the  stamp indicate in which of the three registration stations in  the town a person was registered.    Olesk condemned the rumors as "utterly false" and blamed  them  on people's inner anxieties or misapprehensions. "The Estonian  nation has never attempted to deport anyone, while we know very  well how we were deported more than once," he said. "Since we  know what deportation means, we never planned anything like that  for others."    Tikk voiced the opinion that the rumors were launched with a  definite goal in view. "The number in the registration stamp  has no ulterior meaning," he affirmed. "The documents of the  Russian military, for example, are marked with a stamp bearing  number 4. We have no intention of repeating what Russians,  Germans or whoever did here in their time."    On Wednesday [23 March], the second day of population  registration in Paldiski, 906 people were registered. Tikk told  BNS there were no incidents, except that some forged documents  came to light. On Tuesday 689 residents were registered in  Paldiski. Both Tikk and Olesk told BNS there's no particular  opposition to registration in the town.    "The residents of Paldiski themselves wish to be registered,  since it will increase their security during the dismantling of  the nuclear reactors when checks on people staying in the town  are unavoidable," Olesk said. "The stamps allow people to move  freely in Paldiski under the special regime."    Registration of Paldiski residents ends on March 26.</p>

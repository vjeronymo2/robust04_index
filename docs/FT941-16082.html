			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Finance Bill: Labour warns it will give bill rough passage - Commons Battle The Labour party warned yesterday that its current refusal to co-operate with Tory whips over the government's legislative programme would give the finance bill a difficult passage through the House of Commons. In previous years Labour and Tory whips have agreed to argue over a limited number of clauses to get the legislation through. This time the Labour party has withdrawn co-operation with the government on parliamentary matters, in protest at the speed with which the statutory sick pay bill was pushed through all its Commons stages last month. Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that government ministers would acquire 'a serious headache' trying to implement the bill, which at 417 pages will be the largest of this session. 'We are seeking to create difficulties for this bill,' she said. The main measures Labour plans to oppose are the insurance premium tax, the air passenger tax, the freezing of personal allowances and the reduction in the married couples' allowance. She also claimed that the introduction of a unified Budget in November meant that the timetable for the finance bill was to the Conservatives' disadvantage. Under the old system the finance bill was debated after the implementation of many of the Budget's measures. But Ms Harman claimed that, on this occasion, Tory MPs would be asked to vote for tax-raising measures yet to take effect. 'This will put more pressure on Tory MPs who could rebel,' she said. Tory ministers were confident, however, that Labour's policy would pose no threat to the bill. Many of the bill's provisions are due to take effect at the start of April but some were enacted by a resolution at the end of the budget debate last month.</p>

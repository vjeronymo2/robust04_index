			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> COOLING SEEN IN ASIAN ECONOMIES  </P> <P> A looming global capital crunch will hit most Asian economies, except for  Japan, in 1991, Merrill Lynch (Singapore) said in its latest Asian economic  commentary report, released today.  </P> <P> "A slowdown in United States and other OECD (Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development) economies, volatile energy prices, the prospects  of a breakdown in the Uruguay Round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade) talks and a looming global capital crunch will make 1991 a difficult  year for the Asian economies," Merrill Lynch said.  </P> <P> The countries surveyed were China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, South Korea,  Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.  </P> <P> "Our latest estimates are that the 10 major Asian economies, outside Japan,  will post an average real GDP (gross domestic product) growth of 4.7% in 1991,  compared with 5.1% in 1990 and 5.7% in 1989," the report said.  </P></p>

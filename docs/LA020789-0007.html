			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The South Africa government cracked down for the first time on the country's  most powerful white extremist group, banning displays of firearms at meetings  of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok  imposed the ban on the neo-Nazi group under the same emergency regulations used  to restrict many anti-apartheid movements. Vlok said that meetings of the  resistance movement have been "characterized by emotion-laden speeches . . . in  which remarks about the use of violence were uttered." The movement, founded in  1973, regularly draws thousands of whites to its rallies.  </P></p>

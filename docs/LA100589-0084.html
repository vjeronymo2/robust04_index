			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARASAIL COMPANIES RUN INTO TURBULENCE  </P> <P> Flying-Hi Enterprises put two people high in the sky last week.  </P> <P> Dangling gently under a huge red and yellow parachute, the passengers bounced  gracefully in the wind about 600 feet over San Pedro Bay in Long Beach.  Tethered by steel cable to the deck of a 300-horsepower boat, they angled back  and forth in the air like the flying sailors they had become.  </P> <P> "I'm scared," Carey Mayberry said before climbing into the two-seat open  compartment beneath the parachute. Using a winch, crew members began reeling  the chute and its human cargo out like a kite directly from the moving deck  into the flapping breeze behind. "I'm afraid of heights," Mayberry said.  </P> <P> A 23-year-old cocktail waitress from Sunset Beach, she had won this ride for  herself and companion Paul Scaringe by placing second in a local beauty  contest.  </P> <P> Thus it was business as usual for the parasailing concession in this city on  the ocean. For Flying-Hi Enterprises, "business" these days means providing its  services for free. Long bureaucratic delays, its owners say, have prevented  them from obtaining the city permits necessary to operate for profit in Long  Beach.  </P> <P> So the company is giving occasional promotional rides to people like Mayberry  and Scaringe and planning to move to Mexico. When that happens, it will become  the second local parasailing concession to disappear this fall, leaving the  city's would-be parasailers with nowhere to turn.  </P> <P> "It's very frustrating," Flying-Hi president Bill Kimball said. "Very  disheartening."  </P> <P> Said Lorraine June, spokeswoman for the Long Beach Area Convention and Visitors  Council, which three months ago was touting the city's two parasailing  concessions as major tourist attractions: "I'm very sad. (They) were helping  make our waterfront come alive again with visitor activities. We've got these  tremendous waterfront facilities, and it's a shame that they're not being taken  advantage of."  </P> <P> The city's brief stab at becoming a year-round parasailing center began last  year with the arrival of a company called Parasail Adventures. Southern  California in recent years has seen an increase of interest in the sport, in  which customers pay to be strapped or seated under parachutes that are pulled  behind fast-moving boats.  </P> <P> In very short order, according to June, Parasail Adventures was able to get an  exclusive contract to operate out of one of the city's prime locations, a dock  near Shoreline Village by the downtown marina.  </P> <P> That did not dissuade Kimball's competing Flying-Hi Enterprises from setting up  shop a short time later. Because Shoreline Village was already spoken for,  Kimball said, he obtained a temporary permit to operate out of nearby Shoreline  Aquatic Park and embarked on negotiations for a permanent berth at a city-owned  marina near the Viscount Hotel and Queen Mary across the Los Angeles River  channel.  </P> <P> For awhile things seemed to be going smoothly for the city's fledgling  parasailing industry. Then two weeks ago, the industry hit turbulent waters:  Parasail Adventures announced that it was going under. Company owner Kwan Lee  could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> But Terry Koenig, marketing manager of Catalina Cruises which had contracted  with Parasail Adventures for use of the dock near Shoreline Village, attributed  the company's failure simply to its inability to attract enough customers to  stay afloat. "Between advertising and running the boat," Koenig said, "they  weren't able to make a go of it."  </P> <P> Kimball's company, meanwhile, had developed problems of its own.  </P> <P> The firm's temporary berthing permit expired Sept. 4 after only one month of  operation. And negotiations for permanent use of the marina near the Viscount  Hotel appeared to him to be hopelessly mired in red tape.  </P> <P> Kimball blames the delay on foot-dragging by the hotel, which leases the marina  from the Port of Long Beach and must formally request permission from the  port's board of directors to allow parasailing there.  </P> <P> Dave LaPort, manager of the Viscount Hotel, on the other hand, attributes it to  Kimball's own delays early in the process in obtaining proper insurance and  registering his boat with the Coast Guard. "The problem is that (he) started  too late," LaPort said.  </P> <P> Whatever the cause, Kimball now says that he cannot remain in Long Beach. With  no income and expenses of nearly $2,000 a month, he says, his small  family-owned firm is on the verge of collapse. To stave off bankruptcy, Kimball  says he plans within a few weeks to move to Baja, California, where he hopes to  contract with a tourist resort to offer rides for about $35 apiece.  </P> <P> But he has not given up on Long Beach. "We'll be back next year," he said,  adding that he will begin negotiations early enough this time to be  well-established by the beginning of the summer tourist season.  </P> <P> For the time being, though, he is mainly giving free rides to friends, family  members and occasional contest winners.  </P> <P> "That was great!" Scaringe, the contest winner's friend, enthused after his  recent experience in the sky. "I'd do that again."  </P> <P> Mayberry, for her part, seemed a bit less certain. "If people like roller  coasters, they'll love this," she said, looking slightly pale. "My stomach  hurts."  </P></p>

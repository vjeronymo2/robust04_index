			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Profits drop for Nykredit NYKREDIT, the large Danish bond-issuing mortgage credit institution with total assets of about DKr351bn (Dollars 55.7bn), reported a fall in pre-tax profits last year to DKr263m from DKr1.10bn in 1991. Write-offs and provisions for loans increased from DKr1.43bn to DKr1.78bn, while a gain in 1991 of DKr625m on the value of the securities portfolio became a loss in 1992 of DKr308m. Operating profits increased by 23 per cent from DKr1.91bn to DKr2.35bn. The result was described by the group as acceptable in view on the long economic recession, which is also expected to affect the 1993 results. Equity capital and reserves showed little change at DKr17.93bn, which gave a capital adequacy ratio of 9.3 per cent compared with the 8 per cent legal minimum, said the group.</p>

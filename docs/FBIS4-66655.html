Kheireddine: "The Devaluation: The Fallout </F> and the Consequences"]    [Text] Since the Algerian economy is too dependent on  imports, as exports with the exception of hydrocarbons have  barely much importance, the effects of an increase of the value,  in dinars, of petroleum receipts (an increase in tax receipts  and a reduction of the budget deficit) are blurred in the face  of the negative fallout of this harsh devaluation.    First negative effect: an increase in prices for imported  products. This measure will affect products that are widely  consumed: bread, milk, semolina, and flour.    The recent price increases for these subsidized products,  which conveyed the determination of the government vis-a-vis the  IMF, anticipated the present devaluation. The Economy Minister,  Mr. Benachenhou, had said regarding this first increase that  prices were still far from their real cost. Given the extent of  this devaluation, it is certain that these basic products will  again experience a major hike.    Other essential products such as cement, wood, iron, and  cement will rise in price, thus worsening difficulties for those  who do their own building.    The slim hope of getting housing cherished by a large part  of  the population would seem to evaporate with this evaluation. The  1991 dinar devaluation experience can enlighten us about the  devastating effects of a major depreciation of the local  currency. That depreciation had led to a major price hike and  made the financial difficulties of businesses more acute. Public  and private sector businesses, which have not yet recovered from  the effects of the dinar's 1991 devaluation, risk going under  and not escaping from the collapse. Unless the government  decides to cover businesses' exchange losses and thus give them  new financial support, which is something that risks aggravating  the budget deficit, an outcome that is opposed to the objectives  of the measures drawn up jointly by Algeria and the IMF, i.e.,  seeking to control the budget. When businesses' financial  difficulties are aggravated, they will also be tempted into  compensating for exchange losses by increasing production costs.  Roughly speaking, if today a mechanism to protect the less  fortunate is foreseen, the process of erosion on the purchasing  power of that segment of the population with low income  resulting from the devaluation cannot be halted by a similar  arrangement.    At best, the social safety net softens the consequences of a  deterioration of their purchasing power.    Furthermore, the fallout from a devaluation of the dinar  will  especially affect the middle class. The pauperization of this  large swath of the population, which accounts for the  "mainspring" of Algeria, will not take place without there being  damage to the country's activity.    The goal pursued by the IMF through its Structural  Adjustment  Program (SAP), which will be applied to Algeria--the devaluation  being a measure that is part of the SAP--is to contain demand by  households and businesses.    In simple terms, Algeria is living beyond her means. She  needs to reduce consumer needs and achieve a balance between  demand and goods put on the market. This return to universally  accepted economic rules constitutes, according to the  international financial institution, the sine qua non to regain  the path to growth.    In exchange for this sacrifice made on the population as  represented by the loss of its purchasing power, Algeria will  receive the financial support of the IMF and her traditional  creditors and will be able to reschedule her debt.    This will avoid stopping payments during the second quarter  of 1994.</p>

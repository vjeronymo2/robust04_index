			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "More Ganja Found on the Beach"] </F>   [Excerpt] Less than one week after 850 pounds of ganja was  found washed up on a Cayman Brac beach, a further 110 pounds of  the drug was discovered on the beach at Old Man Bay in North  Side early Wednesday morning (9 February).    The initial police report said the ganja appeared to have  been in the water for some time. Drugs Squad officers were to  examine the ganja Wednesday and Thursday to determine if the  drugs were originally destined for Cayman or part of a shipment  dumped at sea and washed ashore by accident.    The 110 pounds of ganja would have a street value of  slightly  more than CI$105,000. [passage omitted]</p>

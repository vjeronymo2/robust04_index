			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET MILITARY TESTS BRAND NEW POSITIONS ;  </P> <P> KREMLIN: THE WARSAW PACT RANKS MAY BE BREAKING. SUDDENLY A SOVIET WITHDRAWAL  FROM EASTERN EUROPE SEEMS A REAL POSSIBILITY.  </P> <P> While President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was meeting the Pope and proposing a new  human- rights accord in Rome last week, the stationing of Soviet troops in  Warsaw Pact territories became a problem of paramount importance. As political  earthquakes shake the Eastern countries, what place have those soldiers?  </P> <P> If East Germany and Czechoslovakia, following Poland and Hungary, are to have  governments in which the Communist Party is represented -- but with only  limited power -- then these countries could become politically similar to  France or Italy, nations where Communists are in Parliament but not in  government. Then the problem would not so much be the legal status of Soviet  armed forces, but their adaptability to an entirely new situation.  </P> <P> North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces have been in Central Europe for four  decades; their presence has generally enjoyed the favor of local populations.  But the Soviets, even if welcomed by new governments, would find themselves in  a hostile environment. Old resentments could explode in demonstrations -- even  in sabotage and terrorism.  </P> <P> Moscow appears ready to go along with internal changes in the East Bloc but  there have been no hints, until now, that the Kremlin is ready to make a  drastic change in the Eastern Europe-based structure of Soviet military power,  such as a massive withdrawal of troops. In Vienna, at the negotiations for  reduction of Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE), progress during the past  weeks has been almost incredible; a draft treaty is about ready and a final  document could be signed next spring. But the reductions of forces do not  exceed 25% of the present Soviet deployment. Not one of the Western  participants in the conference has so far dared envisage a withdrawal of Soviet  troops back within the boundaries of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Yet Gorbachev, having gone so far in allowing East Bloc nations to grasp the  fruits of perestroika, may indeed be prepared to go one important step further  and withdraw a major part of his forces. He might decide that a radical change  in relations with Western countries makes the stationing of a large number of  troops, tanks, artillery and planes outside the boundaries of the Soviet Union  both unnecessary and unacceptably expensive. He knows that the political costs  of maintaining hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a hostile environment are  huge.  </P> <P> But how would the Soviet military Establishment react?  </P> <P> The Soviet military is itself changing. There was a dramatic display of Soviet  willingness to drop old secrecy habits during an extraordinary recent meeting  at the Lenin Academy in Moscow. The academy is where "political officers" --  guardians of military loyalty to communist doctrine -- are trained.  </P> <P> The strategists of perestroika have apparently decided that change must  penetrate domains of military policy, a bastion until now more protected than  Fort Knox. "New thinking and military policy" was in fact the theme debated in  the historic Columns Hall, just opposite the Kremlin, in the presence of about  1,500 participants, most of them military officers.  </P> <P> Surprising as it may seem, outside analysts and scholars were also there, about  20 of us from Europe and the United States. Each outsider was free to address  the most delicate matters of military policy, including an eventual dissolution  of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Even the withdrawal of Soviet forces from the East  was explored.  </P> <P> However conceivable in Budapest or Warsaw, such talk is a striking novelty in  the capital of the Soviet empire. A directive must have come from the  leadership: Let the military discuss all issues and confront the new realities.  </P> <P> Soldiers are taught to resist change. Reduction of the Soviet military role in  the world -- especially in Eastern Europe -- has to make the military  Establishment uneasy. Several Western analysts have pointed out that the Warsaw  Pact is an alliance that exists partly to protect members from one another.  This is evident to us outsiders but it sounds new to the Soviet military. Now  they must entertain the possibility of wrenching changes, in the pact's role  and in their own reason for being outside the Soviet Union. For half a century  official doctrine stressed that the communist alliance is the bulwark of common  defense against imperialists.  </P> <P> There were visible signs of perplexity among the high-ranking officers we  talked to at the meeting. While the U.S. President reaffirms the American  commitment to remain in force on the Continent as long as the European allies  want such a force, Soviet military leaders begin to realize the far-reaching  implications of new thinking in Moscow. They only begin to entertain the  possibility of a withdrawal to bases within their own boundaries.  </P> <P> NATO leaders have for years been revising the strategic doctrine of the West.  An old exercise. For the Soviets, changing doctrine is a new exercise.  </P> <P> Now there are opportunities that cannot be taken for granted and should not be  postponed. Like the Malta meeting, frank military exchanges are worth the risk  and may make possible a brave new East-West relationship.  </P></p>

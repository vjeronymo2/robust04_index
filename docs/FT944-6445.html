			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (5): Empty vaults will bring new opportunities - Dematerialisation / Crest, the electronic stock market settlement system In less than two years' time Crest, the UK's electronic stock market settlement system which will largely do away with share certificates, at least for institutional investors, is due to begin its phasing-in process. Many other stock markets around the world, both in the developed world and in the emerging markets, are ahead of the UK in introducing this so-called dematerialisation. With no share certificates to look after, are custodians threatened with the collapse of their business? Not a bit of it. True, their vaults are liable to be empty. But the changes bring at least the potential for a significant expansion of their business opportunities. Plainly, though, custodians will have to be prepared to adjust their techniques. 'We are very bullish about the whole situation,' says Terry Pearson, head of external relations at the Royal Bank of Scotland's securities division in London. He draws a parallel with the developments seen in the US after stock certificates were immobilised - that is, were kept in a central depositary (the Depostitary Trust Company) as a compromise measure falling short of complete electronic dematerialisation. 'The US restructuring was thought to be the death knell of custody, but it turned out very differently,' he says. 'The US custodians expanded into many other areas. The same thing will happen here.' Thus the American custodian banks developed the Master Trust concept, which embraces many services including trade reporting, foreign currency control and elements of performance measurement. According to Richard Crampton, managing director of the Bank of New York, in London: 'From a pure custody point of view, dematerialisation won't make much difference.' Already the UK system is in important respects effectively dematerialised, he says, because certificates have no validity unless supported by entries on the company register. Regular tasks of the custodian, such as handling settlements, transferring money, maintaining records, collecting dividends and monitoring corporate actions, will be essentially unchanged. 'The bigger impact will be on the registrars rather than the custodians,' he says. Andrew Douglas, a senior account manager with Citibank, offers a similar view. 'Physical safekeeping of securities is now only a small part of custody,' he says. 'As the business has developed, the key has been to add on services.' In the UK, the original concept of Taurus, the Stock Exchange electronic settlement system which was expensively abandoned two years ago, was more worrying for the banks than Crest now is. Many of the big fund managers were planning to be their own account controllers and might have taken many processes in-house. But the failure of Taurus left them with burnt fingers and heavy cost write-offs. Moreover the successor project Crest is deliberately less powerful, because ambitions have been scaled down. Functions not performed within Crest will have to be added on elsewhere. Accordingly, some UK fund managers - many of whom have offered in-house custody to pension fund clients in the past - are now thinking about outsourcing. Strikingly, the UK's biggest institutional investor, Prudential Assurance, has this month decided to phase out in-house custody and put the portfolio administration of Pounds 40bn of UK and international securities out to tender. Dematerialisation is only one factor behind the decision, but it has played a part. According to Alistair Reid, director of custody at Barclays Bank, dematerialisation will leave a number of inefficiencies to be tackled. An institution wishing to be active in the UK investment markets will face the need to establish interfaces with at least four systems - not only Crest for equities, but other systems for gilts, money-market instruments and financial derivatives. The specialist role for custodians will therefore be secure, says Mr Reid. 'Fund managers have their work cut out competing for their primary business, let alone competing with their banks,' he observes. Around the world, Barclays covers some 70 national market places, with two or three interfaces in each. 'That's our job, not the fund managers'.' Settlement improvements within the UK are especially focused on increasing speed, and custodians are looking forward to the indirect benefits this will bring through the opportunities for expanding their business in securities lending. Already UK settlement of equity trades has moved from a fortnightly account basis to 10-day rolling settlement, and the Stock Exchange recently announced a move to five-day settlement on June 26 next year. Eventually, when Crest is running smoothly, three-day settlement will be introduced. With time constraints becoming much more pressing, London marketmakers will have to rely much more on stock lending to balance their books. 'We expect that demand for stock lending will rise fourfold,' says Terry Pearson, of RBS. As a result, custodians will have a much greater opportunity to add responsibilities such as lending on an agency basis on behalf of clients, and looking after the collateral. Mr Douglas, of Citibank, also sees plenty of scope here. 'Demand will increase dramatically,' he says, and from a starting position at which demand for stock already far outstrips supply. Lending rates may have to rise if a broad balance is to be maintained. So there could be scope for expansion of Citibank's specialist lending desk, which controls stock borrowing and lending around the world. This is an example of how custodians can aim to develop their expertise in systems and move higher up the added-value chain. Opportunities could multiply. For instance, data could be supplied directly to performance measurement specialists such as WM and Caps. At Barclays Bank, however, Alistair Reid displays a little more caution. 'Crest does present lots of opportunities,' he says, 'but the institutions may not wish to pay the appropriate price. Let's wait and see.' Terry Pearson is rather more forthright. 'The Crest system is deliberately simple and limited in functionality,' he says. 'Capability has to be added somewhere else. Custodians are the obvious ones to do it.'</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / International Company News: Westpac appoints consultants WESTPAC, the troubled Australian trading bank, has appointed McKinsey &amp; Company, the international corporate consultancy, to advise it on strategy. Announcing the appointment yesterday, Mr Frank Conroy, Westpac managing director, portrayed it as part of a new growth phase for the bank. 'We have the problem loan provisioning behind us, and with completion of the ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 871.96m) rights issue on September 30, the bank's position will have stabilised,' he said. 'We can now devote more time to looking ahead. 'I am confident the time is right for Westpac to start looking to the future. Westpac has made major changes to its operations and staffing levels over the past three years. Our focus now is to identify potential sources of future earnings growth.' Westpac also announced that its ADollars 1.2bn rights issue, which closed yesterday, was unlikely to have been fully subscribed. The bank will detail the size of the shortfall before trading opens in Australia today. CS First Boston plans to exercise its right, expressed in the underwriting agreement, to seek tenders for subscriptions to outstanding entitlements at the issue price of ADollars 3 a share. Any remaining shares will be taken up by CS First Boston or sub-underwriters. Westpac has also launched a USDollars 350m debenture offering in the United States. Underwritten by First Boston Corporation and Merrill Lynch, the issue is priced to yield 7.982 per cent. AMP Society has reduced its stake in National Australia Bank to 6.95 per cent from 8.08 per cent. AMP is Westpac's largest shareholder, with a 15 per cent interest, and also controls just under 7 per cent of ANZ Banking Group.</p>

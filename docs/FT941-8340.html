			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Postal workers reject productivity deal: Union fears Royal Mail may now impose changes Britain's postal workers have decisively rejected a national productivity plan to improve the Royal Mail's efficiency and make it more commercial in preparation for its eventual privatisation. In a secret postal ballot they voted against the deal, against the advice of their union, the Union of Communication Workers. Only 33,194 supported the productivity plan, while 37,667 rejected it. A total of 71,444 union members out of 128,874 returned completed ballot papers. Union leaders, deeply embarrassed by the rejection, are today due to meet Royal Mail executives to discuss what they can do next. Mr Alan Johnson, the UCW's general secretary, said yesterday: 'We need a period of calm reflection.' At national level, the UCW leadership has been working very closely with the Post Office to make the organisation more commercial. The union's national leadership has been willing to co-operate with the introduction of more flexible working practices in sorting offices and mail delivery. The productivity deal would have created a framework for local deals to introduce more flexible shift patterns and working practices in sorting offices. In the aftermath of the unexpected defeat, union officials fear the Royal Mail management may impose changes without union consent, in breach of national agreements with the UCW. This could involve the unilateral withdrawal by management of a number of interim productivity agreements which came into force six years ago. UCW leaders are concerned that as a result of the deal's defeat the Royal Mail will also refuse to negotiate any further on the introduction of a shorter working week. Mr Johnson said initial reports from the union's branches around the country suggested many postal workers had found the proposed productivity scheme 'too complicated and half-baked'. The UCW hopes more talks can improve the deal to make it more attractive. Under the negotiated deal that was rejected, nearly half the postal workers would have benefited financially from an increase in minimum pay rates. On top of the basic 1.5 per cent pay rise, they would have received a further 1.5 to 1.6 per cent by agreeing to the productivity changes. This would have ensured that the lowest paid workers in the Royal Mail received an increase in their basic pay of twice the current rate of inflation.</p>

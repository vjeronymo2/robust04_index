He said so in an interview with Interfax on Friday when he  commented on the signing of documents on Lithuania's joining the  program by President Algirdas Brazauskas in Brussels the day  before.    Jursenas did not think that Lithuania would be accepted into  NATO soon. He believes that "the two sides should meet each  other halfway" if the North Atlantic Alliance was to expand. In  his view, NATO itself should be prepared to incorporate Central  and East European nations.    On the other hand, Jursenas argued, those who want to join  NATO should meet certain requirements. By joining the  Partnership for Peace program, Lithuania has made serious  commitments.    "This will be a process which can take years, not weeks or  months," Jursenas emphasized.    The speaker said that even though Partnership for Peace did  not provide any unambiguous guarantees of Lithuania's security  by NATO, the very fact of closer cooperation with the North  Atlantic Alliance would reassure his country if its  independence, sovereignty, and integrity were threatened. This,  in turn, would contribute to stability in the Baltic area,  Europe, and the world.    "Lithuania's desire to integrate into Europe's political and  economic structures and collective security system is in no way  hostile to Russia or any other country," Jursenas emphasized,  and added that it would be desirable that Lithuania's neighbors  also join Partnership for Peace.    "This would be beneficial to the region, the continent, and  the world," Jursenas believes.</p>

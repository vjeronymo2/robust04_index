			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: CANDID CAMERA: BEHIND THE SCENES WITH DAVID BROWN;  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE PRODUCER HAS JUST PUBLISHED A BOOK FILLED WITH RECOLLECTIONS OF HIS  HOLLYWOOD CAREER.  </P> <P> There was a time when David Brown and a partner earned $600 for writing a  month's supply of astrological forecasts suitable for use in a penny vending  machine.  </P> <P> "We tried to be cautiously helpful," Brown said at breakfast earlier this  week'Avoid unnecessary risks,' 'Drive with special care,' that sort of thing,  or 'Your luck will soon change,' not indicating whether it would change for  better or worse."  </P> <P> Brown, now 73, has done a lot of things. Just out of Stanford and Columbia, he  was a copy editor and second drama critic on the pre-chic Women's Wear Daily.  "Our readers were the buyers and they wanted to know about the musicals and the  hits. Kelcey Allen did those. I got the leftovers -- T.S. Eliot, Odets, all the  really good stuff."  </P> <P> Among other things, he wrote textbooks on journalism, was fiction editor and  then editor-in-chief of Liberty magazine, story editor under Darryl Zanuck at  Fox and then partnered in production with Richard Zanuck. Together, they did  "Jaws," "The Sting," "The Verdict," "Cocoon" and other less conspicuous films.  Not long before they came to what Brown calls an amicable parting, he acquired  the film rights to "Driving Miss Daisy" for the partnership.  </P> <P> "It was a highly contested negotiation," Brown says. "I think I got the rights  only because my wife (Helen Gurley Brown) warned everyone that I might jump out  the window if I didn't." Then the partners went separate ways and Dick and Lili  Zanuck produced the Oscar-winning film. (As he has for 25 years, Brown writes  the lively cover blurbs for his wife's Cosmopolitan magazine.)  </P> <P> With his own company, the Manhattan Project (home base is New York), Brown has  since been producing in several areas. The first three of a series of classic  short stories he is making for HBO here and Granada in Britain have finished  shooting and will start to air in August. "Perversely," Brown says, "I call the  series 'Women and Men.' "  </P> <P> The first, Hemingway's "Hills Like White Elephants," stars Melanie Griffith and  James Woods and was directed by Tony Richardson and shot in Spain. Dorothy  Parker's "Dust Before Fireworks" was directed by Ken Russell and stars Molly  Ringwald and Peter Weller. Mary McCarthy's most famous story, "The Man in the  Brooks Brothers Shirt," has been adapted and directed by Frederic Raphael  ("Glittering Prizes") and features Beau Bridges and Elizabeth McGovern.  </P> <P> Brown has a play opening next week in London, a satire on New York dinner  parties called "Vanilla," directed by Harold Pinter from a play by Jane Stanton  Hitchcock. Running on Broadway are other Brown productions: "Tru," the one-man  show about Truman Capote for which Robert Morse just earned a Tony nomination,  and "A Few Good Men," one of whose stars, Tom Hulce, has also been nominated  for a Tony. Coming along after successful out-of-town dates in Cleveland and  Washington is "Cemetery Club," a comedy by Ivan Menschell about three women who  meet once a month to visit their husband's graves.  </P> <P> He has four films in what Brown calls active pre-production. With Joe Wizan,  Brown is co-producing "Midnight Club," which will star Sylvester Stallone, and  he is working on a screen version of "A Few Good Men." Two more thrillers are  coming along: Michael Tolkin's "The Player," about an executive threatened by  an actor whose calls he won't return, and Ruth Rendell's chilly "The  Bridesmaid," about a couple both fatefully obsessed with death, which Brown  hopes Ken Russell will direct.  </P> <P> Brown is also marketing a couple of television talk shows, one that would  feature David Frost in a kind of updated "Information Please," the other with  astrologer Joyce Jillson.  </P> <P> But Brown was principally in town in behalf of his book, "Let Me Entertain You"  (Morrow: $19.95), a roughly chronological grab bag of anecdotes and  recollections out of his multicolored career.  </P> <P> The book, he says, has been in work longer than some of the people in it have  been alive. It began at the urging of his pal, Gene Shalit, who said Brown  should set down some of his stories. "Nineteen years ago I began carrying a  tape recorder around and I'd talk to it on planes, everywhere, as stories came  back to me."  </P> <P> The tapes transcribed out at more than a million words. "It was sort of like a  data bank. Two-and-a-half years ago, I started writing it out as a book. I had  some role models: Alexander Kings's 'May This House Be Safe From Tigers,' Harry  Golden's 'Only in America' and what I think is a classic, Alexander Woollcott's  'While Rome Burns.' It's not an autobiography, just selective memories. Given  the attention span of present audiences, I thought it might be a sensible  form."  </P> <P> It is a charming exercise in recollection, glimpses of everyone from J. Paul  Getty to John Belushi. But Brown says, "I try not to be a Shintoist, worshiping  ancestors." In particular, he does not really yearn for the Hollywood past,  although he was part of it in the waning days Kafkaesque qualities, you have to  believe somebody in the San Fernando Valley did a report."ELLEN JASKOL / Los  Angeles Times  </P></p>

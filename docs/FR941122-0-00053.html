			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary signed the EIS Record of Decision on June 15, 1994. A letter of concurrence was signed by the Secretary of Agriculture on July 13, 1994. The decision directed the Service to implement its proposed action plan as soon as practical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two nonessential experimental population proposed rules, one for the Park and one for central Idaho, were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 16, 1994 (59 FR 42108 and 59 FR 42118, respectively). On September 6, 1994, a brochure containing the Record of Decision, proposed rules, and schedule of public hearings was mailed to about 50,000 people. From September 14&hyph;22, 1994, a legal notice announcing the proposed rules, hearings, and inviting public comment was published in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Olympia Olympian, New Paper Agency (Salt Lake City Papers), Washington Times, Lewiston Morning Tribune, The Idaho Statesman, Wyoming Tribune, Casper Star Tribune, Bozeman Daily Chronicle, and Billings Gazette.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service held six public hearings on the proposed rules. The availability of the Record of Decision, public hearings, and proposed rules was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 14, 1994 (59 FR 47112). Copies of the proposed rules were distributed to all interested parties. Public hearings were held on September 27, 1994, in Boise, Idaho; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Helena, Montana, and on September 29, 1994, in Salt Lake City, Utah; Washington, D.C.; and Seattle, Washington. About 90 people testified at these hearings and about 330 people submitted written comments. Comments on the proposed rules were accepted until October 17, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Montana, the Service has an active wolf management program due to the presence of breeding pairs of wolves. The Service's program monitors wolves to determine their status, encourages research, provides the public with accurate information, and controls wolves that attack domestic livestock. Wolves that depredate on livestock are translocated or removed. Such action is required to reduce livestock losses, to foster local tolerance, and promote and enhance conservation of wolves. The relocation of wolves under the control program is not intended to accelerate the natural expansion of wolves into unoccupied historic habitat. Although 19 wolves have been removed under the control program, the number of wolves has continued to expand in Montana at about 22 percent per year for the past 9 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reintroduction Site: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Service decided to reintroduce wolves into the Park because of the following factors. The Park is under Federal jurisdiction, it has high-quality wolf habitat and good potential wolf release sites. It is also far from the natural southern expansion of wolf packs from Montana. Thus, any wolf pack documented inside the Yellowstone experimental population area would probably be from reintroduction efforts rather than from naturally dispersing extant wolf populations in Canada or northwestern Montana. The Service will also reintroduce wolves into central Idaho as a nonessential experimental population published under a separate rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service determined that reintroduction of wolves into the Park had the highest probability to succeed due to ecological and political considerations (Service 1994). The reintroduction effort will enhance wolf viability by increasing genetic diversity through genetic interchange between segments of the population. The reintroduction plan for the Park should help in achieving wolf recovery goals 20 years sooner than under current natural recovery policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because reintroduced gray wolves will be classified as a nonessential experimental population, the Service's management practices can reduce local concerns about excessive government regulation of private lands, uncontrolled livestock depredations, excessive big game predation, and the lack of State government involvement in the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishment of gray wolves in the Park will initiate wolf recovery in one of the three recovery areas described as necessary for the species recovery in the northern Rocky Mountains. No existing or anticipated Federal or State actions identified for this release site are expected to have major effects on the experimental population. Central Idaho is identified as the only other alternative site, and it will also receive wolves for reintroduction which will facilitate recovery in that experimental area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

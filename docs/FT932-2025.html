			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / The towering bureaucracy: The case for streamlining the European Commission appears overwhelming Mr Jacques Delors intends to deliver a dazzling presentation on Europe's unemployment crisis when he addresses the EC summit in Copenhagen today. His speech is expected to be part tutorial, part clarion call - the result of prodigious reading and tortured reflection on why Europe is failing to create jobs at the same rate as the US and Asia. The ability to synthesise ideas on a grand scale has been Mr Delors' strength during eight and a half years as president of the European Commission. But intellectual audacity has come at a price. He has shown a reluctance to confront the practical task of reshaping an organisation which, in many respects, has remained unchanged since the Community was founded 36 years ago. The case for reform appears overwhelming. The Commission employed 14,533 officials at the end of last year, about the same size as the UK agriculture ministry. Yet the ambitions of the hautes fonctionnaires go much further. Encouraged by the member states, the Commission has steadily accumulated new tasks. Today, officials in Brussels are dealing with issues ranging from the safety of nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union and the disbursement of aid to central and eastern Europe, to the deregulation of the European telecommunications industry. The question is whether the present two-year Commission can do all its jobs effectively. As ratification of the Maastricht treaty draws closer and the Community prepares for the next phase of enlargement, the challenges are becoming more pressing. As one official says: 'We cannot go on with business as usual.' By any measure, the European Commission is a complex organisation. With 17 commissioners from 12 member states, it resembles less an executive branch and more a mini-parliament. The bureaucracy itself is divided into a host of competing power centres: the president, who controls his own cabinet and a secretariat general; 16 commissioners, each with a cabinet or legislative support staff; and the director-generals, the Brussels equivalent of UK permanent secretaries. The striking feature of the Delors era is that its chief successes - the European single market, the plan for European monetary union, the creation of the European Economic Area encompassing the EC and the Efta countries - were achieved almost in defiance of the system's own internal weaknesses. Mr Delors simply bypassed the old bureaucracy. 'He created a parallel government,' explains a retired senior EC official who has worked closely with the president, 'but in doing so, he made the Commission structures more complicated than ever.' Mr Delors has inserted his own people in the higher ranks of each of the 23 directorates. Sir Roy Denman, former EC ambassador in Washington, calls the Delors regime 'Tammany Hall with a French accent', in a reference to the powerful political machine that once ran New York City. This captures the atmosphere of intrigue and occasional vendettas inside the Commission. The broader criticism is that the member states, rather than Mr Delors, have put patronage first and competence second. Mr Delors has simply been worn down. In his early days as president, he railed against member states exporting mediocrity to Brussels. He once accused a Mediterranean commissioner of not being fit to run a taverna. His views on the present Commission are more discreet, though there is some grumbling about the amount of time Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the former Portuguese foreign minister, has spent back in his native country since arriving in Brussels in January. Mr Pinheiro may complain, with justification, that he does not have a real job. He is charged with introducing transparency into EC decision-making, but few top officials in Brussels take this very seriously, knowing that it is a sop to critics. As Mr Bruno Dethomas, the president's chief spokesman, observed: 'La transparence est un etat d'esprit (a state of mind).' The Commission still looks to be of slightly higher quality than its predecessors. Mr Hans Van den Broek, in a new job covering external political relations, is a former Dutch foreign minister; Sir Leon Brittan, in charge of the trade portfolio, remains a heavyweight; Mr Karel van Miert, the Belgian who took over Sir Leon's competition portfolio, is proving to be tougher than expected on curbing state aid. The quality of top officials is impressive, though perhaps thinly stretched. Among the most outstanding are Mr Riccardo Perissich, the Italian head of the industry directorate; Mr Carlo Trojan, a Dutch-Italian who played a crucial role in co-ordinating EC policy during German unification; and Mr Eneko Landaburu, the Basque head of regional policy. But the division of labour among the commissioners and directorates is unequal. Sir Leon's territorial clashes with Mr van den Broek have passed into Brussels folklore. Both co-operated effectively on policy towards eastern Europe, but both have behaved at times like feuding medieval barons. Such folies de grandeur encourage the commissioners' cabinets to run rough-shod over the Commission civil servants, who work in the directorates. One German director-general resigned in protest at his treatment by Mr Manuel Marin, the prickly Spaniard who heads development policy. The problem of young, inexperienced cabinets ignoring professional advice is viewed as so serious that Mr Delors is likely to prepare an edict ordering that the advice of directors-general must be taken into account before framing legislation. The lack of policy co-ordination between commissioners and civil servants is symptomatic of a deeper problem which goes to the heart of the schizophrenic relationship between the Commission and the member states. At this week's Copenhagen summit, Mr John Major, UK prime minister, will champion the cause of 'subsidiarity' - the principle that power must be devolved from Brussels to the lowest appropriate national, regional or municipal level. British officials confidently expect support from Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany as well as Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister. Subsidiarity is supposed to be the antidote to Brussels meddling, but as an EC official explains, whatever the Commission's reputation for perpetrating legislative 'Euro-lunacies', the truth is most legislation is driven by member states. One topical example is animal welfare. A new directive would set strict conditions on the transport of horses. The Commission is reluctant to proceed on the grounds of 'subsidiarity', but Mr Major and Mr Kohl, worried about the animal-lovers' vote, insist that the Commission presses ahead. The member states are also held responsible by some officials for inserting unnecessary details into directives. A senior EC official, who has worked in Brussels for 20 years, says the member states 'do not trust each other'. Mistrust also explains why the 12 EC member states have never shown much interest in transforming the Commission into a lean executive branch of European government. Their preference for protecting national powers remains stronger than ever. There are, however, reasons for assuming that the status quo cannot last, and that some reform of the Commission is likely to take place before the next inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty in 1996. Last March, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Commission was breaking EC rules by using national quotas rather than merit as the gauge for recruiting high-ranking professional civil servants: it overruled the appointment of an Italian and a Spaniard to senior posts in the Commission's fisheries directorate. The court's ruling could have a profound impact on hiring personnel. An obvious reform is to reduce the number of commissioners to one per country and streamline the directorates. Viscount Etienne Davignon, himself a former industry commissioner, believes that nine or 10 directorates would be enough. The next step would be to create two vice-presidents, with heavyweight portfolios such as trade and economics; and to strengthen the position of the president, subject to greater accountability to the European parliament. It sounds logical, but as Mr Delors has discovered, occasionally it suits weak EC leaders to point to an inefficient Commission as a scapegoat for their own inadequacies.</p>

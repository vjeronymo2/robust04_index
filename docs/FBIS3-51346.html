Pinilla at the Council of State  offices in Santa Fe de Bogota on 18 January; from the "National"  newscast -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Pinilla] Your attention, please. The Council of  State has just asked the government for an explanation regarding  the overflight of foreign aircraft and the presence of U.S.  troops in our country. Mr. Amado Gutierrez, president of the  Council of State, what have you requested of the president?    [Gutierrez] The petition, which was approved unanimously  during a plenary Council meeting, requests the president to  inform us about the legal conditions under which he granted  authorization for several military aircraft to overfly the city  of Barranquilla and for foreign troops to remain in several  areas of the country.    [Pinilla] Why has the Council of State made such a request?    [Gutierrez] The Council of State made the request because  the  Constitution expressly states that while the Senate is in  recess, the movement of foreign troops may only be authorized by  the president, with prior approval by the Council of State.    [Pinilla] Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Amado Gutierrez,  new president of the Council of State.</p>

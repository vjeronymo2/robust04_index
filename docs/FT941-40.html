			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: CIBC plans growth in world capital markets Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's second biggest financial institution, yesterday unveiled plans to expand in global capital markets through an overhaul of its investment and corporate banking services. The move is designed to shift CIBC away from its core business in Canadian dollars, which account for 80 per cent of investment banking revenues. Instead, it aims to offer a wider range of services in other currencies to its North American corporate customers, and to increase its business with European and Japanese institutional investors. Mr John Hunkin, who heads the bank's investment and corporate banking division, said: 'The problem is that both on the institutional investor side and the issuing side, our clients have access to global markets and to global competitors, and they want a broader range of capability.' He pointed to the lengthening list of Canadian companies tapping US and other foreign markets for funds. Canadian financial institutions were especially taken aback this year when Rogers Communications, the country's biggest cable-TV operator, sold a high-yield debt issue denominated in Canadian dollars mainly to US investors. CIBC said it aimed to become more active in high-yield debt markets, derivatives and proprietary trading. At home, it would seek to expand the fast-growing Canadian market in securitised products, especially in the real estate sector.</p>

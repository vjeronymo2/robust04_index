			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Florida Sheriff vs. Crew: The Ft. Lauderdale sheriff who arrested three members  of 2 Live Crew said the rappers would be arrested again if they gave another  performance like the one a jury ruled Saturday was not obscene.  </P> <P> Although a Broward County jury found three group members innocent of giving an  obscene performance at Hollywood's Club Futura on June 10, Sheriff Nick Navarro  said the verdict did not change Florida's law banning obscene performances.  "It's against the law. Nothing has changed," Navarro said. The group said it  plans to perform again in Broward County, although no date has been set.  CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

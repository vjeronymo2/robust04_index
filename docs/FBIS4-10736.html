			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Professor Ruben Dario Carles, Change '94  presidential candidate, has said he was moved by President  Guillermo Endara's video clips broadcast via national network  last night.    [Begin Carles recording] Last night in Chitre, I interrupted  two important meetings scheduled with area doctors and teachers.  I watched the documentary on television. I confess I was  horrified and shocked, and I cried out of shame. What I watched  and all Panamanians saw as well was the confirmation of what we  all knew: the disaster and corruption of the military  dictatorship and their civilian clerks in the PRD [Democratic  Revolutionary Party].    It matters little that Mr. Perez Balladares now wants to  downplay the presented documents. Panamanians know this is how  it happened. The most surprising thing is these individuals who  appear in this documentary are Ernesto Perez Balladares' closest  aides today in his desire to deceive democracy and return to  power.    What we Panamanians heard was disaster, inefficiency, and  corruption, which confirm the efforts we made from the  Comptroller General's Office to impose fiscal discipline and  order in the handling of public property, and funds are what was  needed in the face of PRD actions. Events have proved me right,  and the Comptroller General's Office was correct.    Today, in the face of the embarrassment that affects not  only  Panamanians but all citizens of the world, we must think these  events can never be repeated. Those individuals who want to  distance themselves from these criminal and immoral acts cannot  change, because they and their closest allies worked together  before and will work together again. We cannot allow ourselves  to be deceived.    Civilian and democratic Panamanians who fought together  against the military dictatorship and against the PRD and all  their corrupt practices should encourage unity among civilian  parties to work together and prevent the return of shame and  dictatorship. We must work together to find a solution to the  problems that afflict Panamanians, especially those that mean  poverty and social and economic inequality. This is something  we should do together.

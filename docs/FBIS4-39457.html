			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has as yet sent to  the Russian Defense Ministry no orders to begin the operation on  separation of the Georgian and Abkhazian troops, a Russian high-  ranking military official told Interfax.    The general asked not to disclose his name. He did not rule  out that the peacekeeping operation in the conflict zone might  begin in the next few days. However, he underlined that the  Defense Ministry could not decide on this independently.    IF Note: Last week the Russian Federation Council rejected  the request to send a 1,500-people Russian military contingent  to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, put forward by  Yeltsin. One voice was lacking to send Russian peacekeepers to  the conflict zone. Deputies considered the present legislative  basis defining the status of Russian troops abroad to be  insufficient. Moscow does not rule out that the Federation  Council will go back to discussion of this issue at its next  session on June 21. The leaders of the CIS states participating  in the treaty on joint security have backed the decision to  bring the peacekeeping forces to the zone of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. Georgian leader Eduard  Shevardnadze and Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba also  supported this decision.    Officials close to Yeltsin have no doubt that for the second  time the Federation Council will back the proposal made by  Yeltsin. Some experts from the president's administration  suggested that the president better not force the developments.  Experts repeated that in accordance with the Russian  constitution, only the Federation Council can decide on  performance of Russian servicemen abroad.    Today well informed sources in the Georgian leadership told  Interfax that the Russian peacekeeping forces could start  implementation of the operation in the zone of the Georgian-  Abkhazian conflict in the next few days. The same sources  suggested that the peacekeeping operation could begin during the  visit of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Caucasian  republics on June 8-11.    IF Note: During his visit to the Caucasian republics Grachev  intends to meet Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan,  Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev and Georgian leader Eduard  Shevardnadze. Grachev wanted to discuss with the leaders  establishment of Russian military bases in these republics and  implementation of the peacekeeping operations in Nagorno  Karabakh and in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict.    The same sources told Interfax that at the first stage the  peacekeeping operation might be carried out only by the Russian  units stationed in Caucasus since the Federation Council had not  approved of the decision to send Russian "blue helmets" to this  region. Discussion of this issue by the Federation Council was  put off till June 21. "However, the situation may deteriorate  if we keep waiting by this term," the sources suggested.    Georgian Interior Forces Commander Vladimir Chikovani said  that the first stage of the operation on separation of the  troops in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict must begin  within the next five days after the trilateral  (Georgian-Abkhazian-Russian) working group on deployment of  peacekeepers in this region completed its work. Chikovani  emphasized that military units of practically all CIS countries  would take part in the peacekeeping operation. However, in the  very beginning battalions from only the Leningrad, Ural and  Privolzhsky military districts of Russia will be used.    IF Note: A peacekeeping battalion has been composed from  volunteers on the basis of the Ural military district. It will  be brought to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict along  with other Russian formations, well informed sources in the  command of the Ural district announced to Interfax. Ural  Military District Commander, Colonel-General Yuriy Grekov  already checked the battalion. However, no exact term for its  introduction into the conflict zone has as yet been established.</p>

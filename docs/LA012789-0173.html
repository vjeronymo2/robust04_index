			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> STOCKS ADVANCE ON BROAD FRONT; DOW UP 31.79 IN HEAVY TRADING  </P> <P> The stock market ran up another strong gain in heavy trading today, capping off  the best week so far in a rally that began more than two months ago.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 31.79 to 2,322.86, bringing its  gain for the week to 87.50 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> Big Board volume came to 254.87 million shares, against 212.25 million in the  previous session. The NYSE's composite index gained 1.18 to 164.78.  </P> <P> Before the market opened, the Commerce Department estimated that the gross  national product grew at a annual rate of 2%, after adjustment for inflation,  in the fourth quarter of last year.  </P> <P> The figure came in below most advance estimates on Wall Street, and provided a  fresh bit of evidence for the case that the economy was slowing to a  sustainable, not-very-inflationary pace.  </P> <P> Bond traders welcomed the news by bidding up prices of long-term government  bonds.  </P> <P> That, in turn, provided fresh momentum for an advance in stock prices that has  already been gathering steam of late.  </P> <P> Brokers said a strong dollar in foreign exchange also helped stir up investors'  enthusiasm for stocks.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 5/8 point, or $6.25 per $1,000 in  face amount, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to  8.74% from 8.79% late Thursday.  </P> <P> Corporate bonds also made gains.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term government  issues were up around 1/8 point, intermediate maturities rose about 5/16 point,  and long-term issues gained 5/8 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial  information service.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, increased 4.09 to 1,143.75.  </P> <P> In corporate trading, industrials rose slightly. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with  maturities of five years or longer, increased 0.60 to 299.97.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at midday at 9 3/16%, unchanged from late Thursday.  </P></p>

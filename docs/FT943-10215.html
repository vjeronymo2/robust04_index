			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Man In The News: Lawful leadership and legendary favours - Chief Moshood Abiola Chief MKO Abiola - Anytime,' said the appointment book in the guardhouse to the Nigerian president's compound. That was three years ago. The wheel of fortune has since taken a dramatic turn. Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, the man who once enjoyed instant access to the presidency, ended up in jail, charged with treason. Last night, however, in an attempt to defuse the country's deepening crisis, the government offered to set Chief Abiola free on bail, aware that his fate could determine the future of Africa's most populous nation. The pressure had been intense: strikers demanding his release had cut vital oil exports by a fifth since their action began four weeks ago. A national strike had been called for Monday if the military government did not comply. It is still far from clear, however, as to how the crisis will ultimately be resolved, for the military government does not seem prepared to step down and Chief Abiola is unlikely to surrender his claim to be head of state. He won the June 1993 presidential elections only for Nigeria's military rulers to declare the contest void. To his supporters, the 58-year-old tribal chief, millionaire businessman, newspaper magnate, airline owner, philanthropist and father of 63 children is a valiant standard-bearer of democracy. Yet to Chief Abiola's critics, he personifies the weaknesses of the nation he wants to lead. They see him as gripped by delusions of grandeur, his judgment distorted by a vanity that encourages him to distribute signed copies of a hagiography entitled Legend of Our Time: the Thoughts of MKO Abiola. His current status owes less to democracy, they argue, than to the chief's shrewd political timing, only entering the presidential race when other contestants had been banned by the man he saw as his patron - General Babangida. When the general seized power in 1985, he promised a return to civilian rule  -but on his terms. The 13 parties that sprang up in the late 1980s were banned. The reason, said Gen Babangida, was that they were ethnically based, competing for support of the Hausa Fulani of the Moslem north, the Yoruba of the Christian south, and the Igbo of the east. In their place Gen Babangida created the National Republican Convention and the Social Democratic party, their manifestos written by government officials. Chief Abiola, who had served as a senator in the last civilian administration in the 1970s, stayed on the sidelines in the late 1980s. Politics was a costly business in Nigeria, he explained in an interview: so many cars to buy, offices to be established, and favours to dispense. But there was more to his decision: it was all too risky, the process too uncertain, he hinted. It was a shrewd appraisal. Not long after that interview, Gen Babangida changed the rules again. All 13 candidates seeking presidential nominations by the two parties were banned for alleged electoral malpractices. Only then did MKO, as he is widely known, make his move for the presidency. He was not short of funds. His personal fortune, estimated to be multi-millions of dollars, had been built up during a business career with International Telephones and Telecommunications (ITT), the US communications giant. But it had required determination to acquire the skills that brought such wealth. Born in 1937 in Abeokuta, an hour's drive from Lagos, he was his father's 23rd child and the first to survive. The rest died at birth or before they reached their first birthday. A Nigerian government scholarship took him to Glasgow University in 1961 to study accountancy. His break came in 1968, when he joined ITT as finance controller. Quite how the chief became so rich has been subject of much speculation. 'He used his connections with friends in government, among them the late General Murtala Muhammed (Nigeria's military leader in the mid 1970s), to win key business concessions for ITT,' is how a chapter in Legend of Our Time puts it. These 'connections' paid off, it seems, during the 1970s, when the rapid expansion of Nigeria's oil industry funded the country's multi-billion telecommunications programme and ITT (Nigeria) flourished. By the time Chief Abiola finally entered the political arena, the electoral process initiated by Gen Babangida had been widely discredited, but with ample funds and with the general's blessing, the chief seemed well placed to win the presidential election set for last year. He managed to straddle the regional, ethnic and religious divisions: as a Yoruba, he could expect solid support from his kinsfolk in the south; as a Moslem, he could appeal to the Hausa Fulani north. According to leaked unofficial figures, he won the June 1993 election comfortably, with 58 per cent of the vote, only to have it snatched away by Gen Babangida himself. In the weeks that followed, his relations with the military government deteriorated to such a point that the chief felt that his life was in danger. He fled the country for London in his private jet. At breakfast in London's Savoy Hotel almost a year ago, Chief Abiola still seemed stunned by the turn of events, yet confident that one day he would win the presidency. Of his betrayal by Gen Babangida, personal as well as political, he said hardly a word. Gen Babangida, by then replaced by Nigeria's current military leader, General Sani Abacha, had been more than a patron. He had mourners at the funeral of the chief's wife. One of the chief's sons was courting one of the general's daughters. The reason for the betrayal remains a mystery. 'Babangida is still a family friend', said the chief, refusing to say more. Meanwhile at home he was criticised by supporters for deserting the democratic cause. Perhaps stung by the attacks, he returned to Nigeria, and in an act of defiance which set him on a collision course with the military, announced that he was Nigeria's only lawful leader. He was arrested last month. Chief Abiola's views on how Nigeria may recover from its economic crisis have been buried in the controversy that has gripped the country: his support for privatisation, the need for an agricultural revival, the importance of the private sector - all set out in his book. In the 15 months since his election victory, strains have intensified in a country gripped by an economic crisis. Ethnic and regional tensions mount by the day, as illustrated by the recent strikes which paralysed the Yoruba heartland around Lagos, but have been poorly supported in the north. The conditional offer to release Chief Abiola last night suggests the military leaders are trying to pull back from a confrontation that had seemed inevitable. But the real test is yet to come for a country that likes to call itself Africa's giant: since independence in 1960, Nigeria has been led by men not equal to the responsibility. This week 90m Nigerians will be hoping that Chief Abiola and Gen Abacha are capable of finding the compromise necessary to break with this tradition.</p>

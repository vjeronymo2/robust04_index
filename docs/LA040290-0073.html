			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STREET SMART: A TIP FOR LIFE IN BIKE LANE: KEEP WITS ABOUT YOU  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> I've been riding my bike more and more recently. It bothers me when cars park  in the marked bike lane. When is it, if ever, all right to park or drive in a  marked bike lane? It seems dangerous for me to have to veer outside the lane.  </P> <P> Phyllis Tucker  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano  </P> <P> Life in the bike lane isn't always so pleasant. If there isn't some Beemer  veering willy-nilly across the painted white line, there's a Coupe de Ville  crammed against the curb, its rear bumper waiting to gobble up any errant  cyclist who happens by.  </P> <P> While the rules of the bike lane can vary from city to city, most  municipalities allow cars to pull into the paths about 200 feet before a corner  to make a right turn. Moreover, cars generally can park in the paths as long as  there are no signs posted prohibiting it. In some spots within the county, this  can virtually eliminate the lanes, forcing cyclists out into the street along  with the growling packs of cars.  </P> <P> A few tips from the experts: If you have to veer around a parked car, avoid  darting into the traffic lane. Instead, try to anticipate the move and begin  gradually moving out so any cars can see you well in advance and avoid you  accordingly. Also, be careful to swing wide enough around the parked car so  you'll avoid the door if a motorist swings it open.  </P> <P> At times, of course, motorists won't take kindly to a cyclist using the traffic  lane to avoid a parked car. They'll honk. They'll scream. They'll cuss. But the  fact of the matter is, cyclists have as much right to the traffic lane if  they're steering around an obstacle.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, conflicts between cyclists and motorists can sometimes escalate  into something just short of war. Some stories have become legend.  </P> <P> One recent day, a cyclist in South County was tooling along a remote road when  a car began veering into the lane repeatedly. The cyclist yelled at the driver,  who in turn rolled down his passenger-side window and shouted obscenities at  the cyclist.  </P> <P> The cyclist returned fire by pulling out his water bottle and squirting the  motorist and his female passenger. Outraged, the driver cut off the cyclist,  jumped from the car and began pounding on the befuddled cyclist. The melee was  broken up only when the cyclist's riding partners caught up.  </P> <P> This, of course, was a relatively rare incident that escalated well beyond  reason. But the point is clear: When cycling, keep your wits about you. A  person on a bicycle is a lot more vulnerable than someone strapped into a ton  of sheet metal.  </P> <P> Dear Street Smart:  </P> <P> Does Caltrans have any plans to build a grade separation that would allow  drivers on the northbound San Diego Freeway to exit at Bristol Street in Costa  Mesa without having to cross two lanes of high-speed traffic coming off the  connector road leading from the Costa Mesa Freeway to the northbound San Diego  Freeway?  </P> <P> Building such a grade separation will not merely remove a nuisance. When  traffic backs up from the Bristol off-ramp (as it frequently does), a serious  conflict is created between cars moving at full speed on the connector road and  cars slowing (or completely stopping) for the Bristol off-ramp.  </P> <P> There also appears to be plenty of right of way for Caltrans to build the  necessary bridge for the freeway connector road to pass over traffic moving  into the Bristol exit's lanes.  </P> <P> Greg Shank  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> That stretch of roadway is indeed a problem for motorists eager to pull  smoothly off the freeway at Bristol Street and hit the Nordie racks at South  Coast Plaza.  </P> <P> The good news is that transportation officials are eyeing the strip for  improvement. The bad news is that any solutions are probably still far off.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa authorities are planning to use developer fees to build a new,  elevated connector road so Bristol Street-bound motorists won't have to mix it  up with folks trying to head north from the Costa Mesa Freeway onto the San  Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> Just don't look for it any time soon.  </P> <P> "We're just now getting the ball rolling," said Bill Morris, Costa Mesa public  services director. "We are years away."  </P></p>

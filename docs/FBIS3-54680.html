			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The center of Sociological Research at the Armenian  Academy of Sciences headed by Gevork (Bobosyan), based on the  opinion polls conducted in November and December 1993, have come  to the conclusion that about 80 percent of the urban population  of Armenia are incapable of purchasing the basic foodstuffs  after the introduction of the national currency, the dram.    The level of monthly income is insufficient to buy the  necessary food in the minimal amounts. One kilogram of butter,  1kg of sugar, 1kg of cheese, meat, and at least 5kg of potatoes,  to say nothing of the expenses (?and) public utilities  transportation, and which is most important today, kerosene and  wood for heat.    According to the experts at the center the coming indexation  of wages will lead to greater forestalling increase in prices on  the market which will only make things worse. [sentence as  heard] The state of the Armenian economy nowadays is such that  a sweeping indexation of wages for all budget enterprises  without a differentiation by the level of income will result in  further decrease in living standards the growth of inflation and  the fall of the dram rate. In such a situation it would be more  advisable to redistribute the money reserved for indexation and  spend it on guaranteed rationing of basic foodstuffs in minimal  amounts at least for that part of the urban population whose  income is not higher than 100 drams per family member.    The introduction of food cards for low income families  proposed by the analysts of the center will not affect the other  groups of population (?so it) would not promote the further  growth of prices and hyperinflation. On the contrary, it will  to some extent soften the disastrous situation we are facing  this winter.</p>

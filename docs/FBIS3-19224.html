For  Labor Minister Gino Giugni, the grave problem of unemployment  will lessen if growth picks up and if flexibility is introduced  into the labor market. Giugni was leaving for Detroit to take  part in the summit of the 7 most industrialized countries (G-7),  devoted entirely to employment. He is flying to the United  States with a recipe under his arms: "Italy," he says openly,  "is going to the summit with an original contribution. We  believe that the problem of employment should be confronted  either in macroeconomic terms or in terms of labor market  intervention based on social consensus. An objective which we  achieved in the July accord." The Minister explains: "If in  the coming five years Italy is able to attain an economic growth  of 3 percent, it will be possible to create 600,000 new jobs  every year. Not many, certainly, but one can do more only by  adopting policies of labor flexibility, and by achieving  transparency of the hidden sector. In this way it will be  possible to achieve European Commissioner Jacques Delors'  objective of 3 million jobs."    In the meantime, Finance Minister and progressive list  candidate Luigi Spaventa has launched a new and concrete  proposal: an extraordinary three-year plan to invest 30 trillion  lira, concentrated in the transport, telecommunications, and  environmental sectors. The project, to be financed by  fixed-rate long-term securities issued through an appropriate  agency and guaranteed by the state, would increase employment --  300,000 jobs, Spaventa forecasts -- and would raise GDP (gross  domestic product) by 1 percent a year. Investments, economic  growth, and flexibility. But industrialists are asking for an  additional effort to liberalize the labor market. "Development,  which is necessary, is not enough on its own," Confindustria  [General Confederation of Italian Industry] Director General  Innocenzo Cipolletta stated. The July accord represents an  income policy which has proved particularly effective for Italy.  But one must push more for the liberalization of the labor  market: Instruments such as part-time work and short-term  contracts exist, but are exceptions. If, now that we are at the  beginning of a positive phase in the economic cycle there were  to be greater liberty, we will be able to create new jobs at a  speed which is unknown in our country, but which is known, on  the other hand, in America.

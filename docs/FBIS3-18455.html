			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Today the parliament adopted one of its most  sensitive decisions in recent years. It lifted the immunity of  four deputies--three from the DEP [Democracy Party] and one  independent. The immunity of the following deputies has been  lifted: DEP leader Hatip Dicle, Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan, Mus  Deputy Sirri Sakik, and Sirnak independent Deputy Mahmut Alinak.    Following the speedy decision, DEP leader Hatip Dicle and  Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan were detained by police at the door to  parliament. [passage omitted]    Following the detention of the two deputies who had been  stripped of their immunity, the police issued an alert  preventing all the deputies who are under investigation from  going abroad. Restrictions were imposed to prevent the deputies  from going abroad.    Nusret Demiral, chief public prosecutor of Ankara State  Security Court, said that death penalty will be asked for the  detained deputies. Nusret Demiral indicated that the case  against the deputies, who have had their immunity lifted and  been placed under arrest, will be conducted in accordance with  Article 125, which deals with treason and crimes against the  sovereignty of the state and which entails capital punishment.  Demiral also said that all the deputies whose immunity has been  lifted will be called to the State Security Court to testify.  [passage omitted]    DEP deputies will take recourse to the Constitutional Court  to challenge parliament's decision to lift their immunity.  Sirnak Deputy Orhan Dogan said that their immunity was lifted  on the basis of concocted police reports. Therefore, he said,  they will go to the Constitutional Court and ask for the  nullification of the decision.    Article 85 of the Constitution requires the Constitutional  Court to reply within 15 days to the deputies' appeal for the  abrogation of the lifting of immunity.    What are the charges against the deputies, the files on whom  were speedily taken up and processed at parliament after years  of procrastination?    Here are the charges found in the files on eight deputies:    Hatip Dicel, leader of DEP: Dicle, who drew attention on  himself when he described the martyred noncommissioned officers  in the Tuzla massacre as military targets, is being charged with  treason to the country for his various speeches and for engaging  in activities aimed at undermining the unity of the state.    Orhan Dogan, Sirnak deputy: He is being charged for wanting  to place all or part of the state's territory under the  suzerainty of a foreign state, due to comments in speeches he  made before being elected deputy and during the oath-taking  ceremony at the Turkish parliament.    Sirri Sakik, deputy from Mus: He is being charged with  treason and for activities aimed at undermining the state's  unity.    Mahmut Alinak, deputy from Sirnak: He is being charged with  making speeches aimed at undermining the Turkish Republic's  unity. Alinak says that accusations leveled against him arise  simply from the fact that he used the term "the Kurdish people."    Leyla Zana, deputy from Diyarbakir: She is being charged  with advocating the establishment of an independent Kurdish  state in eastern and southeastern Anatolia. Zana is known for  her anti-Turkey statements made abroad.    Selim Sadak, deputy from Sirnak: He is being charged with  engaging in separatism resulting from a speech he made at a  rally in Izmit on 27 September 1992 and his parliamentary motion  on 18 August 1992 on the Sirnak incidents. In his speech in  Izmit, he said that the Sirnak incidents were organized by the  state and he spoke about the Kurdish People.    Ahmet Turk, deputy from Mardin: He is charged with engaging  in separatist propaganda due to two speeches and one article he  wrote. During his 1993 trip to the Unites States, Turk made  statements about a cease-fire declaration in the southeast.  During the 23 April parliament session he proposed that Kurdish  children too should have holiday celebrations in their own  language.    Hasan Mezarci, deputy from Istanbul: He is being charged for  opposing the laws on crimes against Ataturk. [passage omitted]    While you were watching this footage, we received the  following last minute report: Mehmet Agir, general director of  the Security Directorate, has said that the deputies whose  immunity has been lifted will be placed in custody successively.  Mehmet Agir replied to Channel 6 reporter Ful Ekasan's  questions on the phone. Agir said that Hatip Dicle and Orhan  Dogan, who were placed in custody as the start of this detention  process, have been taken to Ankara Security Directorate and will  be kept in custody tonight. Indicating that the other deputies  who stand to lose their immunity will be placed in custody one  after another, Mehmet Agir said that their interrogation will  begin as of tomorrow. Agir added that after interrogation, the  deputies will be referred to the state security court.</p>

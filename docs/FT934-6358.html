			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / QVC wins removal of Paramount poison pill The battle for control of Paramount Communications was thrown wide open yesterday as a Delaware court removed the main poison pill provision designed to protect a friendly Dollars 9.6bn (Pounds 6.4bn) merger with Viacom. The Delaware chancery court backed a challenge by QVC Network to a Dollars 500m arrangement aimed at thwarting its hostile bid for Paramount. But the court failed to overturn a separate Dollars 100m poison pill provision. The embattled Paramount board, which has refused to enter discussions over QVC's bid, attacked the court's decision and said it was launching an immediate appeal in the Delaware supreme court. Viacom also said it was appealing. Yesterday's ruling tilted the takeover battle back towards Mr Barry Diller's QVC. The home shopping channel had said that it would not proceed unless the poison pills were removed. However, the contest is expected to be drawn out for at least another two weeks as the case passes to the state supreme court. The arrangement overturned by yesterday's court ruling would have given Viacom the right to buy nearly 24m Paramount shares at its original bid price of around Dollars 69 a share, had it lost the battle for the film and television production company. This is around Dollars 21 a share less than the Dollars 90 a share in cash offered by QVC for 51 per cent of Paramount, with the balance to be paid for in securities. QVC failed in its second court application to overturn an agreement under which Paramount would pay Viacom Dollars 100m if it fell to a higher bidder. 'This to some extent levels the playing field between the two sides,' said Ms Margo Vignola of Salomon Brothers. 'It's being appealed, but the sentiment of the court was pretty clear' that the main takeover barrier should be removed, she said. Viacom's offer for Paramount was due to expire at midnight last night, and the company was expected to extend its bid pending the outcome of the appeals. Paramount's share price jumped by Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 80 1/8. QVC's share price slipped by more than Dollars 3, to Dollars 45 3/4, reflecting fears that a successful QVC bid would dilute the company's earnings, though it later recovered to close at Dollars 47 3/4. Viacom's A shares climbed Dollars 3 to Dollars 50 3/4.</p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1,000 BATTLE BRUSH FIRE IN NATIONAL FOREST  </P> <P> More than 1,000 firefighters from throughout California, Oregon and Washington  battled a 3,500-acre brush fire that continued to rage out of control in the  Cleveland National Forest this morning near the Orange-Riverside county border.  </P> <P> By mid-morning, a U.S. Forestry Service spokesman said that the speed of the  blaze had slowed substantially and that 30% of the fire had been contained.  </P> <P> Because conditions in the area are the driest in 30 years, however, officials  said they have brought in an extraordinary number of firefighters to attack the  blaze from the air and ground.  </P> <P> "We're ready for a battle," Tom Horner, U.S. Forestry Service spokesman, said  this morning.  </P> <P> The cause of the fire, which erupted about 4 p.m. Tuesday near the Upper San  Juan campground 15 miles east of Interstate 5, had not been determined, Horner  added.  </P> <P> Ortega Highway, the primary link between south Orange County and Lake Elsinore  in Riverside County, has been closed since the fire broke out, meaning long  detours for commuters. The California Highway Patrol said this morning that,  even if the fire is contained today, the highway will remain closed between  Caspers Regional Park and Grand Avenue in Lake Elsinore for at least two days  to repair fire damage.  </P> <P> Residents -- officials said they did not know how many -- were evacuated as the  blaze threatened up to 100 homes in the area. However, none of the 125  buildings dotting the remote canyons and hills in the area was damaged.  </P> <P> The American Red Cross opened two evacuation centers in the Lake Elsinore area  -- one at Lake Elsinore High School -- but they were virtually empty.  </P> <P> Two firefighters were injured at the edge of the blaze. One hurt his back and  was taken by helicopter to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission  Viejo. The other suffered a minor foot injury, officials said.  </P></p>

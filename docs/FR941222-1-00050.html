			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency conducted the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment on these wastestreams using both a current, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline management scenario, and a plausible management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario. Information relating to this discussion is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included at the present time due to business confidentiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Agency conducted the risk assessment on two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current management scenarios, a municipal landfill, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monofill, with the monofill representing the plausible management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The risk projections associated with this wastestream are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented in Table II&hyph;6. The data presented in this table  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent 18 samples collected from four azo dye manufacturing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. Eleven of the 18 samples were collected and analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by industry, and were submitted to EPA for evaluation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The risks associated with disposing these sludges in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monofills are projected to be very high. Five constituents found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the waste are predicted to pose individual high-end cancer- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk levels equal to or exceeding 1E&hyph;4 or HQs equal to or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding 1 for non-carcinogens, through ingestion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminated ground water or vegetables. The five constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pose carcinogenic risks ranging from 1E&hyph;4 to 5E&hyph;4 and non-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carcinogenic hazards from 2 to 45 times above the RfDs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monofill management scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are two cases of coeluting constituents for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream. As shown in Table II&hyph;6, there is one data point for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the mass spectrum indicates the presence of 2-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methoxyaniline, along with the potential presence of 2- and 4-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aminoaniline. As discussed in Section II.D, EPA based the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment for this set of coeluting compounds on 2-aminoaniline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level for 2-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aminoaniline is 5E&hyph;4 for the monofill management scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second set of coeluting compounds consists of the three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isomers 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene. The presence of the three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isomers was confirmed in four out of six wastewater samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected from azo dye manufacturing operations, and the combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of the three compounds was quantified. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level, based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicity of 2-aminotoluene, is 1E&hyph;4 for the monofill management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario (See Section II.D of this preamble, Coeluting Compounds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for more details on the Agency's approach to risk assessment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coeluting compounds).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the two sets of coeluting compounds used as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raw materials in azo dye manufacturing, three compounds, 1,3-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dinitrobenzene, 4-methylphenol, and 2,4-dinitrophenol were found  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at concentrations that are projected to pose a substantial risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to human health and the environment. The risks presented by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these compounds are calculated to have high-end HQs of 45, 3, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

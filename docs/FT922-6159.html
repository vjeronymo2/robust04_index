			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Letter: Fund's financing too low fully to realise east Europe objectives Sir, As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, visits Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland this week, he may see something of what Britain is doing, through the Know-how Fund, to help build institutions at the heart of their economies. Because the transformation of these countries entails massive disruption, the strength of these fledgling institutions will be severely tried in the years ahead. If they do not stand the strain, the consequences will not be limited to central Europe. In all three countries, the Know-how Fund has been so successful in attracting good projects and so quick in approving them that its budget is stretched to its limit and, in one case, beyond that limit. This is a tribute to a good concept, well administered. But justified pride should not mask the fact that the present level of financing is too low. When Mr Major speaks to his hosts of political co-operation between their governments and the EC, his words will ring hollow if he cannot assure them that the Know-how Fund will be increased to a level commensurate with the economic risks to their political stability and our responsibilities as a nation that did so much to inspire the reforms they have undertaken.

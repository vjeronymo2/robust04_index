			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: HDTV Europe's electronics manufacturers have failed to excite programme makers, satellite operators or consumers with high-definition television. Yet, judging by the negotiations in Brussels yesterday, they are still trying to play pork barrel politics to keep their obsolete vision of the future switched on. Both the Japanese system and HD-MAC, the European high-definition television standard, use analogue technology similar to conventional sets. Digital HDTV technology is, however, catching up. In the US the Federal Communications Commission is due to select a digital standard within the next year. Digital TV's extra capacity will leave analogue standing, yet Philips and Thomson are still trying to get public money to promote their old-style HD-MAC. Waiting for digital TV would delay HDTV by at least 5 years. The equipment would also be more expensive than that using HD-MAC. Perhaps digital television will never attract enough interest to make people switch. But it seems improbable that television companies or consumers will be prepared to commit almost as much money to HD-MAC in the knowledge that a better technology is just around the corner. The urgency comes from electronics manufacturers who need new products as existing technologies are rapidly becoming commodities. Unfortunately, they cannot afford to wait for digital TV - hence their desire to fill the gap. Margins in consumer electronics are falling worldwide. Most manufacturers are trying to cut costs, but they cannot hang on to efficiency gains in a competitive market. Companies like Philips with high labour costs and weak balance sheets are poorly placed to compete. A little EC graft will not solve the problem.</p>

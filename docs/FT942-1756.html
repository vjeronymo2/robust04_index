			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / S Africa imposes wealth tax and curbs spending South Africa's new government yesterday presented its first budget, a cautious document demonstrating a commitment to fiscal and financial discipline while attempting to meet the needs of the poor. The budget was the first real test of the economic policy of the multi-party government of national unity which took power just six weeks ago. It was widely welcomed by investors, who approved of its restraint on spending. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, who presented the budget to parliament in Cape Town, said his aim was to have 'the best of both worlds . . . social justice and aggressive growth'. It was a difficult balancing act, achieved in part by imposing what amounts to a wealth tax to cover the costs of transition - in particular, the expense of integrating guerrilla armies into the South African Defence Force and of excess spending on April's all-race elections. The one-off tax will primarily affect white taxpayers and white-owned companies and is levied at 5 per cent on annual incomes above R50,000 (Pounds 8,920). If white taxpayers received a shock, poorer blacks will be no better pleased. Excise on cigarettes was raised by 25 per cent, and that on some beer types by as much as 33 per cent. The extra revenue will make it possible to reduce last year's budget deficit of 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product to 6.6 per cent in the year to March 1995. Government spending will rise only marginally in real terms, in spite of R2.5bn spending on President Nelson Mandela's 'reconstruction and development' programme, a plan to build houses and provide health care and education denied to blacks under apartheid. That spending will be funded entirely from savings in other budgetary areas. Government spending on reconstruction is due to rise to R5bn next year, R7.5bn the following year, R10bn and R12.5bn in subsequent years. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party and a cabinet member of the government of national unity, said the budget 'could not have been better'. Johannesburg financial markets closed little changed. Mr Keys defended the wealth tax, which is likely to be the most controversial measure: 'We think that every income earner in this country can be profoundly grateful that our transition has gone so very well.'

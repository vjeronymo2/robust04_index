			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Into the EU's arms: Finland's bid to join the European Union Finland looks set to vote to join the European Union on Sunday, in a referendum that will not only mark an historic shift in its own regional allegiance, but which could prove a turning point in the enlargement of the Union. A Yes vote would represent a decisive move by Finland away from cold war neutrality and into the west European fold. After the deepest recession since the 1930s, many Finns hope it would also bring substantial economic benefits. But more important, as the first of three referendums on EU membership in the Nordic countries, the Finnish vote may influence the outcomes in neighbouring Sweden and Norway. Austria has already voted in a referendum in June to join the EU. But there have been strong doubts over whether the people of the three Nordic neighbours would agree with their leaders on the desirability of membership. The sequence of Nordic referendums was therefore deliberately staged to start with Finland, where opinion has tended to be the most pro-EU. The hope is that a Finnish Yes will encourage Sweden to opt for membership, in its November 13 vote, and even overcome the formidable anti-EU ranks massed in Norway, where voting takes place on November 28. If all four applicants accept membership, the EU will be expanded from 12 to 16 members on January 1, and the way will be clear for its next great expansion - into eastern Europe. Already last week, the European Commission was asked by EU foreign ministers to draw up a detailed report on how Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania could be integrated into the EU's single market ahead of their full membership. But this scenario would be seriously disrupted if the Nordic countries were to turn their backs on Brussels, and the Finnish campaign has not been a smooth ride for the Yes camp. The leading party in Finland's centre-right coalition government, the Centre party of prime minister Esko Aho, has been deeply divided over EU membership. It is the party of Finland's farmers, and the farmers, through their union the MTK, have bitterly opposed joining the EU, because of the reduction in agricultural prices and subsidies that membership would bring. The MTK is outraged that membership could see parts of Finland receiving less farm support than more prosperous farmland elsewhere in the EU. This has prompted open opposition to EU membership among influential Centre party members such as Mr Paavo Vayrynen, who was foreign minister when Finland began its membership negotiations with Brussels. Mr Aho has, however, managed to retain official Centre party support for membership, chiefly by pushing through a FM4bn farm support package to cushion farmers against the shock of joining. But EU supporters - led by the Centre party's main coalition partner the Conservative party and the opposition Social Democrats - have become increasingly confident of a Yes vote not because the farmers have been mollified, but because they believe voters are being persuaded by the broader economic and strategic gains of membership. A detailed study of attitudes towards EU membership by the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies last month showed that while voters were concerned about the negative impact of EU membership on social issues - with 44 per cent believing it would affect healthcare negatively, against just 3 per cent - most voters believed membership would benefit the economy. This belief is made more potent by the depth of Finland's most recent recession. Between 1991 and 1994, the economy shrank by 13 per cent - partly due to the loss of privileged trade with the Soviet Union. Unemployment has risen to almost 20 per cent of the workforce, ranking with Ireland and Spain as among the highest in Europe. Finland already complies with the bulk of EU economic and trade policies as a member of the European Free Trade Association. But full membership of the EU would mean taking on board the Union's agricultural policy as well, which could harm Finland's farming sector. EU advocates argue, however, that membership is vital to a broadly-based economic recovery. Membership would help Finland attract both the internal and inward investment needed to re-establish long-term growth and bring down unemployment, they argue. 'In a small economy such as Finland's we have learnt that what you can determine on your own is not much and is getting narrower all the time,' says Mr Pekka Ahmavaara, leader of KEY, a joint trade union campaign for a Yes vote. 'All the research shows membership is a better solution for economic growth than staying outside.' Finnish voters seem persuaded. Some 64 per cent of voters in the CFBPS study believed EU membership would enhance export and foreign trade, with just 5 per cent believing the opposite, while 39 per cent expected EU membership to improve foreign investment, compared with 11 per cent against. They also seem convinced of the strategic benefits of membership, with 49 per cent indicating that 'as a neighbour of unstable Russia', the country would be more secure within the EU, as against 27 per cent who believed the opposite. 'We need to stabilise our international position,' says Mr Paavo Lipponen, leader of the Social Democrats. 'That is the most important thing after the changes in Europe. And the economic costs of staying outside the EU have grown higher because of European integration.' Mr Risto Volanen, working for the No side, says that as an EU member, Finland would be forced to identify with western security and defence policy, which could be provocative to Moscow. 'I am worried we are putting ourselves on the chessboard in such a way that we are not in control of the moves that are made,' he says. But the government is adamant: 'The mere fact that we are members will give security without us having to make any new military arrangements,' says Mr Pertti Salolainen, minister for foreign trade. 'If you are a member of the EU you are untouchable because the Union could never accept any aggression against one of its members.' The signs are that this view sums up the feeling of a majority of Finns. They may not be filled with much Euro-enthusiasm, but a deep sense of defensive pragmatism should be enough to make voters accept the biggest change in Finland's international alignment since 1945.</p>

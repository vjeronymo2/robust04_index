			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Prospects fade for cut in rates PROSPECTS for an early cut in the base lending rate receded as sterling gave up early gains after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had made his Budget speech. A government official said: 'It would not be wise to hold out much hope of a cut in the next few days'. Analysts said that the chances of a cut were '50-50 at best'. In New York, sterling traded close to the bottom of its range within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Prices of gilt-edged stock - government bonds - also fell sharply after the chancellor forecast a public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of Pounds 28bn for 1992-93. This higher PSBR means the government will have to sell more gilts in the coming year than investors had been expecting. The stock market held on to gains which had been achieved early in the session and the FT-SE 100 Index closed 24.1 up at 2,574.8. Nevertheless, after the market closed, traders said they were increasingly anxious. A fall in the price of the March future contract on the FT-SE Index - which gives an indication of investors' sentiment - appeared to be signalling that share prices would open lower this morning. Mr Michael Marks, chief executive of Smith New Court, the leading marketmaker or wholesaler of shares, said that the one bright spot was shares in motor traders. These were boosted by the government's measures to help car sales. Meanwhile, market strategists disagreed about the political impact of the Budget which had been widely regarded as a curtain-raiser to the Conservative government's campaign for re-election. They said that sterling and share prices were only likely to strengthen significantly if the Conservatives took a lead in the forthcoming election campaign. 'This is not a Budget for voters,' said Mr Ian Harnett, analyst at the securities house Strauss Turnbull. However, Mr Roger Palmer, of Kleinwort Benson, said it would help the Conservatives to win the support of lower paid individuals in marginal seats. 'I think the markets are taking too pessimistic a view of the Budget,' he said. Mr Nick Parsons, treasury adviser at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said: 'The Budget . . . merely prolongs the uncertainty in the market.' He complained that the chancellor's commitment to taking sterling into the narrow band - or trading range - within the ERM was 'vague'.</p>

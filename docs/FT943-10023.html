			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Working Life: Software offers to end last minute search for those up-to-date skills - Training It is a familiar situation to most employers. A worker with important skills goes sick or is otherwise unavailable and no one knows who else in the organisation has the up-to-date skills to cover the job. A new software package, called Viva Training, offers employers a method of auditing exactly who possesses which skills at any particular time. Crucially, the package allows an employer to establish whether or not the skills in question have lapsed. Mrs Jeanne Walsh, of TSS Training and Safety Systems, who developed the concept of what she calls 'lapsed time', says: 'There is a widely held assumption that if training is carried out and recorded, that the person will be able to perform that function to the required level of competence, ad infinitum. 'In practice, this is simply not so, and work that I have carried out demonstrates this clearly. This area of loss, multiplied up through British industry, assumes gigantic proportions, and bleeds the economy.' She asks employers who purchase her package to work out for themselves how long they believe it would take for the skills for a particular task to be lost if the individual was not practising them. If the worker has no direct experience of that task for longer than the 'lapse time', the manager has the option of updating the skill, for example by asking the individual to perform that task for a short period. It sounds simple. Mrs Walsh, who also develops safety management systems, is marketing her concept in a roadshow touring Cardiff, Birmingham, Manchester and London this autumn. Several companies have already purchased the package, which retails at about Pounds 2,300. The companies include British Sugar, Dairy Crest, and C. P. Pharmaceuticals in Wrexham. Most purchasers are medium-sized or large employers. 'I don't believe computerised control is important for companies with less than about 130 employees', says Mrs Walsh 'but we are developing a cheaper system for smaller businesses.' Mr Graham Williams, training manager at C P Pharmaceuticals, says that the package can be adapted for bespoke use. He makes use of the system in the company's sterile production areas, where operators are licensed for 12 months to do up to 80 tasks. 'Each task has an an expiry date and after 11 months we review the skill,' he says. 'If the manager finds that the individual has been using a particular skill, he or she can be re-licensed. We need this level of management control to demonstrate to the Medicine Control Agency that we have competent people doing tasks', says Mr Williams. 'We need the level of documentation that the system offers. At anytime the supervisor can log into a system that informs him or her what tasks an individual can do. It gives them confidence.'</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NOGGIN OF NUTRITION;  </P> <P> WHOLESOME DRINKS ARE A HEALTHY WAY OF KEEPING THOSE RESOLUTIONS TO LOSE WEIGHT.  </P> <P> More than 40% of the American adult population perceive themselves to be  overweight, according to an independent national study, released Tuesday by  Weight Watchers International, Inc. Of those, some two-thirds went on a diet at  least once last year and will begin another in 1989.  </P> <P> The preoccupation with weight-loss is especially prevalent at this time of  year. Upwards of 1.2 million people across the nation have already begun their  New Year's resolutions and enrolled in the Weight Watchers program. (The  organization's average weekly attendance is 600,000, according to a company  representative.)  </P> <P> The New Year is the time when countless Americans try any means possible --  some nutritionally acceptable and some not -- to lose the excess weight  accumulated during holiday festivities. For many, the gluttony began as far  back as Thanksgiving and has added as much as 10 to 15 pounds. So they join  exercise gyms, participate in diet programs, swallow diet capsules and ingest  diet foods and protein drinks in an effort to shed the extra weight.  </P> <P> The hectic pace of today's life style is one explanation for the popularity of  radical diets that eliminate food groups or suggest unusual food combinations.  But dietitians warn against such extreme and unusual methods of losing weight  -- specifically when undertaken as a means of undoing the damage from the  holidays. Instead, people are encouraged to choose a sensible eating pattern  that fits into their individual routine.  </P> <P> A way to accomplish this, according to Linda Dahl, president of the California  Dietetic Assn., is to resume previous dietary habits that were established  before the holiday eating frenzy took place and to begin or continue a regular  exercise program. This means cutting back on high fat foods and controlling  portion sizes, she said.  </P> <P> "Usually if you return to your previous dietary habits and exercise program you  will return to your previous weight," said Dahl, "and that makes a lot more  sense than going on a diet, which is temporary and you may go off it and wind  up in the same place you were during the holidays."  </P> <P> One sensible approach is to eliminate the traditional morning meal and opt  instead for a nutrient-rich blender drink. Since it is the hour of the day when  time is at a premium, it tends to be a time when fast-food or coffee and sweets  are favored. Or, if one's schedule permits and a traditional breakfast meal is  an option, it typically features high-fat meats like bacon, sausage and eggs,  pancakes, syrup, fatty breads and spreads or cereals loaded with cream and  sugar.  </P> <P> But a nutritionally-adequate blender drink can meet the body's energy supply  needs as well as the palate's desire for good taste, and for a lot fewer  calories. These beverages can be powerhouses of nourishment when packed with  foods rich in vitamins and minerals. They offer waistline-watchers an  alternative to high-fat breakfast fare on the run.  </P> <P> By combining wholesome ingredients such as nonfat milk and yogurt, dried and  fresh fruits, vegetables and grains, it is possible to achieve the  calorie-sparing benefit of a light meal, provided that sufficient fiber and  other nutrients are included in meals the remainder of the day.  </P> <P> "People are in a hurry in the morning," Dahl said, "We've gotten away from the  traditional breakfast. I think that beverages are handy but the problem I have  with them is they are very low in fiber. We manage to get in the fruit and the  milk, but we don't get in the insoluble fiber."  </P> <P> To increase the amount of fiber in the beverage meal, Dahl explained, add a  tablespoon of bran to the mixture. It lends sufficient fiber. Then, include  whole grain breads, legumes and other carbohydrate-rich foods in the remaining  daily meals to meet the recommended daily allowance of fiber.  </P> <P> This way, Dahl said, nutrition drinks "can fit into a sensible diet program --  especially for people on the run," as long as they are not denying themselves  food and using the beverages as an entire intake for the day. That doesn't  teach people how to choose lower fat foods and control portion sizes. "We're  not talking about the modified fasts for weight reduction," she emphasized.  </P> <P> Bananas, fruit juice, dairy products and wheat germ are the most popular  ingredients in blender drinks. But, if meeting the daily requrement for fiber  isn't a problem, use the juice extractor for fresh, natural juices from all  sorts of vegetables. The automatic juice extractor will separate solids from  almost every fruit and vegetable imaginable, leaving the pure concentrated  juice for use in recipes.  </P> <P> If a juice extractor is not an option, use the blender to puree such fruits as  pears, peaches and berries. It will create nectar rather than clear juices, but  these can be strained and diluted with water or thin juice and combined with  crushed ice for a thick and frosty drink.  </P> <P> Pureed, steamed vegetables are another possibility. Mix with clear fruit juices  or homemade chicken broth (it is lower in sodium than commercial brands) and  serve with cucumber slices, radishes, celery or carrot sticks or sweet pepper  strips for swizzlers. Health food stores or the health food section of the  supermarket also have large displays of vegetable juices including some  surprising ones such as spinach, celery and cabbage.  </P> <P> To ensure nutritional adequacy of the beverage, here is a list of important  vitamins and minerals, their function in the body and their dietary sources.  Follow the recipes given, then mix and match according to the desired taste or  nutrient emphasis. Oat bran is a good alternative to wheat germ, but we learned  when developing these recipes in The Times Test Kitchen that the oat bran tends  to thicken the drink upon standing. Therefore, unless several people will be  served, those recipes should be scaled down to serve only one then doubled when  needed.  </P> <P>  -- Vitamin A: Needed for normal cell growth, healthy lining of body cavities  and glands, healthy bones and teeth, maintenance of the cornea; its precursor,  beta carotene, is linked to cancer prevention. Food sources: green leafy  vegetables such as spinach, turnip tops, chard and beet greens; green stem  vegetables such as asparagus and broccoli; yellow vegetables such as carrots,  sweet potatoes, winter squash and pumpkin; and orange fruits such as apricots,  peaches and cantaloupe.  </P> <P>  -- Vitamin C: Important for cell formation, synthesis of collagen and  absorption and use of iron. Deficiencies usually result in poor wound healing,  poor bone and tooth development and, although rare today, scurvy. Food sources:  citrus fruits, pineapple, berries, tomatoes, melons, cabbage, broccoli,  strawberries, potatoes and some green leafy vegetables like kale, cabbage,  kohlrabi and greens.  </P> <P>  -- Vitamin D: Necessary for calcium and phosphorous regulation to prevent  brittle bones and teeth. Food sources: fortified milk and very small amounts in  egg yolk and butter.  </P> <P>  -- Vitamin E: Primary function is as an antioxidant. It prevents oxygen from  combining with other substances and damaging them. Deficiency is rare since it  is widespread in plant foods. Food sources: vegetable oils are principal source  but whole grains, wheat germ and dark leafy vegetables contain appreciable  amounts.  </P> <P>  -- Vitamin K: Fat-soluble vitamin necessary for blood clotting. Food sources:  green leafy vegetables such as spinach and cabbage.  </P> <P>  -- Calcium: Responsible for bone and tooth formation, blood clotting and nerve  transmission. Many women fail to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance for  this mineral and as a result may suffer brittle bone disease (osteoporosis) at  menopause. Food sources: dairy products -- milk, cheese and yogurt -- tofu,  greens and some whole grains.  </P> <P>  -- Iron: Found as a component of blood protein (hemoglobin) and muscle protein  (myoglobin). It enables these proteins to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide  to and from body cells. Intake is usually below the RDA. Food sources: whole  grain and enriched cereal products contribute substantial amounts as do peas,  deep green leafy vegetables, dried fruits such as raisins and apricots.  </P> <P>  -- Magnesium: A factor in bone mineralization, muscular contraction,  maintenance of teeth and protein building. Food sources: whole grains, green  vegetables, chocolate and cocoa.  </P> <P>  -- Potassium: One of three minerals found in the body that preserve water  balance. The others are sodium and chloride. None are particularly regarded as  in short supply in the body since they are all widely available in food. Food  sources: bananas, potatoes, milk and plain yogurt.  </P> <P>  -- Zinc: Involved in making genetic material and the normal development of the  fetus, the transport of Vitamin A, taste perception and wound healing. Food  sources: whole grains.  </P> <P> Food Styling by Minnie Bernardino and Donna Deane  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOMATO-CUCUMBER COCKTAIL  </P> <P> 1 large tomato, seeded and chopped  </P> <P> 1 stalk celery, chopped  </P> <P> 1 green pepper, chopped  </P> <P> 1/2 bunch cilantro, minced  </P> <P> 1 cucumber, chopped  </P> <P> 1 small onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> 1 (24-ounce) can low-sodium tomato juice  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons lemon juice  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Celery stalks  </P> <P> Combine and grind tomato, celery, green pepper, cilantro, cucumber, onion and  garlic in food processor or blender container.

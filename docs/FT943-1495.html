			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Kendall Square may seek protection from creditors Kendall Square Research, a struggling US supercomputer manufacturer, has closed its computer business and said that it may be forced to seek protection from its creditors under US bankruptcy laws. It is the second US supercomputer company to face a financial crisis. Last month Thinking Machines, a pioneer of massively parallel supercomputer technology, filed for bankruptcy protection. Kendall Square said that its chief executive had resigned and the company yesterday laid off most of its workers, leaving a staff of 50. The company said that the decision to cease manufacturing and sales operations was reached 'in light of the failure to receive expected orders and the inability of the company to raise additional capital'. The supercomputer maker, once seen as a promising company in the emerging MPP supercomputer market, became embroiled in an accounting debacle last year when it disclosed that prior sales had been overstated. Kendall said that it would continue to service and support its customers and that it would continue efforts to license its core technologies to other computer and networking companies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] You are watching Vesti. Russia's foreign minister  [Andrey Kozyrev] is the next to give us his New Year's greetings.    [Begin Kozyrev recording] I would like to wish the residents  of Russia more self-assurance. If we begin to respect  ourselves, the whole world will respect us -- there are ample  opportunities for that. Therefore, more self-esteem and less  panic! Do not succumb to any provocations. Let us simply live  normally in our own country, cooperate normally with other  countries, and be the way we ought to be, the way we really are.    I think this, in fact, is my wish for 1994 -- that it should  be a year of stabilization and a year which should see the  transformation of Russia into a normal, self-respecting great  power.

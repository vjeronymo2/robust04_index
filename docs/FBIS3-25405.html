			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. Kemp and F. Piennar] </F>   [Text] Cape Town Feb 16 SAPA -- Pan-Africanist Congress  [PAC] chief negotiator Patricia de Lille on Wednesday [16  February] clarified her pronouncement that whites who wished to  emigrate should be encouraged to do so, but elicited sharp  criticism from the African National Congress [ANC] and the  National Party [NP] for her stance.    In an interview, Mrs de Lille said her comments to the  International Press Institute [IPI] conference on Tuesday had  been incorrectly interpreted in some reports and she had  received abusive and threatening telephone calls. Mrs de Lille  told about 500 editors and publishers attending the three-day  conference that the media had "blown out of proportion" the  emigration of skilled whites and had created the impression the  white brain drain would bring the country to a standstill.    "The media should rather encourage them to leave to create  space for the majority who have been suppressed for centuries,"  she said.    On Wednesday she said racist white professionals who were  called on to implement a new government's policies would  undermine and subvert those policies. "If they are unhappy to  live under a black government they could be very destructive.  Such whites should not be forced to remain, but should rather be  encouraged to leave."    Mrs de Lille said many white professionals who were now  emigrating had been educated at taxpayers' expense. "The  question must now be asked whether the people who are leaving  have repaid that money."    She said, however, the PAC's use of the term African did not  exclude whites "because we believe in only one race -- the human  race". Whites who accepted the democratic rule of a black  majority and identified with Africa were also regarded as  Africans by the PAC.    But Mrs de Lille's statement at the conference drew sharp  responses from the ANC and the NP.    Irresponsible and inflammatory, said the ANC in a statement.  "Encouraging mass exodus of whites ahead of the formation of a  government of national unity contradicts the whole purpose of  the agreement between all parties reached at the multiparty  constitutional talks...it could only serve to destabilise the  economy and thus heighten social tensions," the ANC said.    NP Informationa and Media Director Marthinus van Schalkwyk  said Mrs de Lille's statements indicated extreme racism and  highlighted the PAC's short-sighted approach to future stability  and economic growth. "The PAC's claim that they are not  anti-white and that they represent all people who are truly  bound to Africa is finally discredited by this statement.    "A person such as Prof Deon Basson who appears high on the  PAC's candidate list will surely, after this statement, no  longer feel at home in an organisation which so clearly stands  for black racism," Mr van Schalkwyk said in a statement.</p>

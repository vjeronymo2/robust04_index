			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Back to rejoin the mainstream - In spite of problems brought by the recession, investment trust professionals believe the sector is returning to its roots as a vehicle for small investors to enter the equity market INVESTMENT TRUSTS have been enjoying a revival. After years of being the poor relations of the fund management industry, they were flavour of the moment for much of the 1991-92 tax year. There were two reasons. The first was personal equity plans. Whereas unit trust Peps were limited to Pounds 3,000 in 1991-92, an investment trust new issue qualified for a full Pounds 6,000 Pep. The result was a proliferation of investment trust launches with a 'tax-free' label, notably the Pounds 246m raised by M&amp;G's Income trust. Norman Lamont may have put a stop to this trend, by allowing all unit and investment trusts with 50 per cent of assets in the EC to qualify for the Pounds 6,000 limit. It will now make more sense to put Pounds 6,000 into an existing trust - and acquire assets at a discount - than to invest in a new trust and pay a premium for assets (after issue expenses). The second boost to investment trusts has been the decision of some to pay commission, which has attracted independent financial advisers who had not previously recommended investment trusts. The change casts doubt on the notion that consumers receive 'best advice'. How can it be best advice to recommend investment trusts with a 3 per cent upfront charge, when it was not best advice to recommend trusts when they carried no charge at all? To be fair, advisers have also been attracted to trusts by the revival of split-capital structures, which have made investment trust shares highly flexible tools for private investors. Income shares, in particular, when placed in a Pep, can offer double-digit tax-free yields. Zero-coupon shares offer steady capital growth, which gives investors an efficient way of using up their capital gains tax allowance. Capital shares are a vehicle for those who want to speculate on a quick rise in the market. But there are dangers in these structures. To date, the gains have been made by the zero and income shareholders, with the capital shares tending to drift down in the absence of a bull market. One must also question whether all those who have bought income shares have known exactly what they have been buying. In some cases, income shares are deliberately designed as an 'annuity'. They will have virtually no capital value on wind-up. Investors may be delighted with the high yields on offer, but how many of them realise that a good chunk of the income is simply the return of their capital? Other structures have zero shares attached to so-called 'ordinary income' shares. The latter get all the income of the trust but will only be repaid after the claims of the zero holders have been met. If equity returns are low in the 1990s (and some believe this will be the case), the remorseless upward growth in the zeros may eat away at the redemption value of the ordinary income shares. And even the zeros are not guaranteed to be redeemed at full value. A collapse in the stock market at the wrong moment might hit a trust's ability to repay the zeros, and cause a nasty shock to those who thought they had acquired 'safe' investments. New private investor recruits to the sector may also be disillusioned if a combination of falling stock markets and widening discounts creates substantial plunges in trust share prices. Such losses could easily wipe out the tax privileges available to Pep holders. One need only look at the losses incurred by shareholders in some of those trusts which have large unquoted holdings in their portfolios, as asset values have dropped and discounts have widened in the recession. Despite these potential problems, most investment trust professionals are delighted that the sector is returning to its roots - of being a vehicle for small investors to enter the equity market. The launch of trusts by groups such as M&amp;G and Fidelity will have widened the market, according to Paul Manduca, chairman of the Association of Investment Trust Companies. Investment trusts still have an important role to play in specialist geographical markets. Institutions are still prepared to sub-contract investment management in areas such as south-east Asia and Latin America, and for private investors, a collective fund is the only practicable means of access to such markets. The challenge for the 1990s is to maintain the momentum - to prevent the cycle of over-supply of trusts, widening discounts and predatory action which shrinks the sector. There are still predators around. Despite the general narrowing of discounts, a number of trusts have been taken over or reconstructed, notably Govett Atlantic. If managers slip in performance, they will need to keep an eye on their share registers. A further battle may be needed to allow international generalist trusts, such as Foreign &amp; Colonial, to qualify for the full Pep allowance. At present, unless such trusts commit themselves to keep more than 50 per cent of their assets in the EC, their Pep allowance is just Pounds 1,500. This dissuades private investors from backing what are acknowledged to be good first-time investment vehicles. There will certainly be intense competition for private investors' cash in the 1990s. The advantages of unit trusts, which were struggling to compete in 1991-92, may be rediscovered. Now that investment trusts are paying commission, they have lost some of their cost advantage over their unitised rivals, especially if other unit trusts follow the lead of Murray Johnstone and reduce their front-end fees. The narrowing of discounts, which boosted the relative performance of investment trusts vis-a-vis unit trusts in the late 1980s, will not be repeated in the early 1990s. But at least investment trusts, after years of being in the backwaters of the financial services industry, are back in the mainstream.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Denmark has wiped off a debt of over $15 million  for Vietnam. The decision was laid during the working visit to  Vietnam by Ms. Helle Aid Degn, minister of development  cooperation of Denmark. Following is our radio comment on the  decision and relations between Vietnam and Denmark:    This decision positively contributes to the national  construction of Vietnam. Vietnam faces many difficulties and  still lacks the capital for national development, especially in  the construction of standard infrastructure.    Since 1992, when Denmark resumed its cooperative relations  with Vietnam, relations between the two countries have developed  significantly. Denmark added Vietnam to its list of regular aid  recipients. Denmark has also granted $14 million to Vietnam.  The grant will be used to renovate and develop projects which  shall be assisted by Denmark such as the Hoang Thach Cement  Factory, the La Nga Sugarcane Factory, and the Dalat Water  Supply Program. The Danish Government was pleased with  Vietnam's maintenance and effective use of these projects.    Ms. Helle Aid Degn, during her stay in Vietnam, agreed with  the Vietnamese Government that bilateral relations between the  two countries have developed. She also met with Vietnamese  senior officials to map out the long-term strategy for  cooperation between the two countries, mainly in the field of  maintenance, the process of sea products, manufacture and  distribution of cement, and in water supply programs.    Denmark will also help Vietnamese programs on eradication of  famine and alleviation of poverty, environment protection, and  mother and child care. The decision to wipe out Vietnam's debt  is also a long-term strategic cooperation between the countries  and it creates favorable conditions for long-term and stable  cooperation in economy and trade between Vietnam and Denmark.</p>

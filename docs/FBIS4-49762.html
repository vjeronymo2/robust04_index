			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Sutherland Calls for Fast Re-entry into </F> GATT"]    [Text] Top GATT official Peter Sutherland yesterday called  for China's early re-entry into the world trade body.    He made the remarks at a meeting in Beijing with Wu Yi, the  Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.    He said speeding up the admission of China and other  applicants to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  remains one of his top priorities after the conclusion of the  drawn-out Uruguay Round in Morocco last month.    And he urged both China and the trade body's members to work  closely together to solve the remaining obstacles.    "There's a general willingness among GATT members to work  constructively to bring the negotiations (over China's re-entry)  to a conclusion," he said.    He expressed the hope that a draft protocol of China's  re-entry would be hammered out by the end of June to pave the  way for later negotiations.    He also called for a balanced treatment of China's entry,  saying that it is not realistic to ask China to meet all demands  before being re-admitted.    China should make "a big effort" to achieve re-entry as soon  as possible, he said, adding that the key is to further open up  the country's trade regime.    He said that he encouraged transparency and China's maximum  participation in the current negotiations. "This will get a  positive response from GATT members," he added.    Wu Yi said China will be able to make its trade regime more  transparent.    "China not only has the political will, but also has the  ability to further its economic reforms," she said.    She stressed that the latest reforms in the country's  finance, foreign trade, investment, taxation and foreign  exchange control systems will create a basic framework for  China's market economy.</p>

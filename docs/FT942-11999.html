			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Observer: Oh golly Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging hardly trips off even a South African tongue. Hence the search for a more euphonic handle to fit the sprawling conurbation around Johannesburg, one of the nine new provinces. 'Egoli', meaning 'place of gold', and the name given to Jo-burg by black mineworkers, was an early suggestion. But then, what would non-white residents of Egoli be called? Quite. The search continues.</p>

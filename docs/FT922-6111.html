			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers plan palm oil defence INDONESIA AND Malaysia are to meet next month to discuss setting an international standard for crude palm oil. The Philippines has also been asked to attend the discussions, which are in response to concerns over the high-cholesterol content of palm-oil. An official of the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association said yesterday the meeting would set a minimum standard for crude palm oil exports and was needed 'to counter the allegation' over high cholesterol levels. Indonesia has achieved dramatic growth in palm oil production from about 700,000 tonnes in 1980 to an estimated 2.9m tonnes last year. Exports have risen rapidly from just 300,000 tonnes in 1980 to about 1.46m tonnes in 1990, itself a 50 per cent increase over the previous year. A recent report by the US embassy in Jakarta estimates that 715,000 hectares were harvested during 1990, but that a further 400,000 hectares had been planted 'ensuring steady gains in production in coming years'. Industry officials say a further 100,000 to 150,000 hectares is being planted every year. Industry officials estimate production of 3.2m tonnes this year, rising to up to 3.7m tonnes in 1993 and 4.9m tonnes by the end of the decade. Indonesia exports of palm oil and kernel totalled USDollars 329m last year, up from Dollars 216m the year before. The Netherlands accounts for about one-third of exports, while other important buyers include China, Kenya and the UK. Palm oil demand will exceed supply for the second consecutive season in 1991-92 (October-September), despite steadily increasing production, according to the Oil World newsletter, reports Reuter from Hamburg. World production is expected to rise by 740,000 tonnes to 11.94m tonnes in 1991-92 but usage will jump 1.12m tonnes to 12.33m tonnes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Vargas] </F>   [Text] The Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement  (Molirena) legislative faction has proposed the formation of an  alliance among all parties that have a democratic and civic  vocation, but without "suicidal stubbornness and  pseudo-ideological positions," in order to form a presidential  ticket "with the most capable and qualified people."    In a news conference held at the Legislative Palace  yesterday, Molirena legislators released a communique warning  that their proposal "must be implemented urgently because  Panamanian democracy is dying and disintegrating with every  passing minute."    Molirena faction spokeswoman Gisela Chung said the Molirena  legislators' call to unity is to th e Christian Democratic  Party, the new parties, and the civic forces that fought for  democracy. Chung said the civic forces reached an agreement at  the assembly level, but, unfortunately, the same has not been  done yet at the leadership level among the ruling parties.    According to Chung, the people are surprised at how little  ability the parties have for a constructive dialogue and  effective understanding to reach the unity which will prevent  the military's return through the civilians, who backed the  cruel dictatorship for many years.    "It is not possible therefore that a presidential ticket of  the democratic forces cannot be formed because of intransigent  and haughty positions, senseless self-deception, inappropriate  arrogance, and petty shortsightedness," Chung noted. She said  the country's legislators are even willing to give up personal  political aspirations and added that they are urging party  leaders to contribute.</p>

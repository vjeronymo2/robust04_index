			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: CAN ALL THE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY TRIP UP TRUMP?  </P> <P> "TRUMP IS the victim of his own peculiar naivete about the way life works.  Couldn't he see what all of his shameless self-promotion was setting him up  for? Schadenfreude -- a German word for glee over the misfortune of others --  is actually as American as casino gambling," writes Jonathan Alter in the  current Newsweek.  </P> <P> These thoughts come under Alter's heading "The Fame Game: Why Everyone's  Gloating," in the magazine's cover story, "Trump: The Fall."  </P> <P> IT IS in this issue that Donald Trump is quoted, saying: "Negative publicity  has no effect in my life."  </P> <P> If this is true, then Donald is in a class by himself. Negative publicity  almost always takes its toll, however, in psychic distress if nowhere else. But  then, matters tend to settle, so that the public makes final perceptions and  summings-up of high profile people that usually are pretty much correct.  </P> <P> The function of the press, with all its hits and errors, is to add to this  ability of people in general to draw fairly accurate conclusions. And, as  Americans are more prone to be fair than to be unfair, somehow most stories  work out on the fair side.  </P> <P> I SUPPOSE the press can't be blamed too much for falling for that elaborate and  absurd hoax about Elizabeth Taylor's 23-year-old "new love." But anybody who  has ever dealt with Taylor's formidable press rep, Chen Sam, immediately  recognized this story as a fake. Never in a million years would Chen (or anyone  working for her) dare to talk of Elizabeth's "depression" or of her intimate  affairs. They particularly wouldn't make those National Enquirer-type quotes.  </P> <P> In fact, bamboo shoots under the fingernails couldn't make Chen Sam, a woman  with a rather blind-sided view of what constitutes her job, even tell you what  color dress Elizabeth Taylor is wearing!  </P> <P> KANIN GAININ' on marryin' Marian! Garson Kanin, the famous  screenwriter-playwright-director par excellence, was wed for many happy years  to the late actress Ruth Gordon.  </P> <P> Since Ruth's death several years ago, Kanin has been keeping company with  Broadway's most enduring actress, Marian Seldes. (She has appeared in two of  the Great White Way's longest-running hits, "Equus" and "Deathtrap," and is  currently in Chester, Conn., with the out-of-town "Annie II.")  </P> <P> Now Kanin and Seldes plan to tie the knot on June 19 in New York City. It  couldn't happen to a nicer couple.  </P></p>

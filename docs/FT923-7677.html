			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / US food airlift boosts Somalia aid effort THE US defence department will begin emergency airlifts of food to Somalia 'as soon as possible', as international efforts build up to alleviate hunger in the war-ravaged country, agencies report from Washington. A big airlift of aid is already being organised by the United Nations - to include airdrops of food to Mogadishu, the capital, and other communities in the interior. The new aid move, announced by the White House, comes on the heels of an announcement on Thursday that the Bush administration is willing to transport UN troops to help protect food deliveries. The US also wants the UN to convene a donors' conference to co-ordinate Somalia relief efforts. It would bring in the main warring groups to try to win their co-operation in getting food supplies through safely to the starving population.</p>

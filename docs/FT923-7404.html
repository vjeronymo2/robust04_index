			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Pakistan proposes talks on Kashmir PAKISTAN yesterday formally proposed talks with India on the Kashmir issue under the Simla Agreement - for the first time since the agreement, laying down terms for normalisation of relations between the two countries, was signed 20 years ago. The proposal, contained in a letter from Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, to his Indian counterpart, Mr Narasimha Rao, was delivered by Mr Shahryar Khan, the Pakistani foreign sec-retary, on the first day of talks between the two countries at the foreign secretary level. Mr Khan said Pakistan hoped that India would respond positively to its proposal for bilateral discussions on Kashmir under Article 6 of the Simla Agreement, which states that final settlement of the dispute needs to be discussed between the two sides. But he stressed that the proposal should not be seen as a change in Pakistan's policy on Kashmir, or evidence that Pakistan 'had turned its back' on United Nations resolutions on the disputed territory. 'Pakistan does not regard the Simla Agreement and the UN resolutions as mutually exclusive,' he said. 'It is Pakistan's considered view that the UN Security Council resolutions calling for a plebiscite remain valid.' An Indian foreign ministry spokesman said there was 'nothing new or startling' about Mr Sharif's proposal. He said Mr Rao had told Mr Khan that India would consider the proposal and convey an appropriate response. He also said India had pointed out during the first round of talks that it was 'not possible to isolate individual articles of the Simla Agreement, which had to be viewed in its totality as a document'. The foreign secretaries' talks - earlier scheduled for July and postponed by India after an Indian diplomat was assaulted in Islamabad - are meant to prepare the ground for a meeting between the prime ministers of the two countries in Jakarta on September 3. The Delhi talks are due to culminate today in the signing of a memorandum of understanding on a code of conduct for diplomats, an agreement banning the use of chemical weapons, an exchange of instruments of ratification and the non-violation of each other's air space.</p>

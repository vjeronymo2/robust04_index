			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Counting the cost of weathering ERM storm: 'Franc fort' squeezes jobs, growth and prices THE cost to France of its franc fort policy has been, above all, a more sluggish economy. Higher short-term interest rates have slowed growth. Fewer tax receipts and higher social charges have enlarged the budget deficit, likely to be far above the FFr185bn (Pounds 22.5bn) target for this year. Bankruptcies are running at around 4,000 a month and are highest in the building and retail trades. Bank margins have been squeezed every time short-term rates have risen, though the worst was in September when keeping their own lending rates down cost the banks FFr400m, according to the French Association of Banks. Central bank support for the franc has been on a big scale at times, with FFr160bn spent to prop it up in September alone. Sporadic speculation against the franc since November had led to intervention 'at a level a little lower than in September', Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said this week. It is not clear that the French central bank has lost anything on these operations, since the currency rates have stayed unchanged; indeed it claimed to have stung speculators in September and made a profit itself. By far the steepest cost has been in unemployment, now at 10.4 per cent, with nearly 3m out of work. It is unclear whether the exchange rate is to blame for all of the record 600,000 lay-offs in industry last year. Indeed, part of the cause may be a change in management behaviour, with employers far quicker than they used to be to try to reduce their share of France's high social payroll charges and to replace labour with capital. On this score, the employers' federation, Patronat, has come under fire from both left and right. Yesterday, Mr Francois Perigot, Patronat president, hit back: 'When we have an economic situation as disastrous as that in France, there is no other alternative but to reduce staff.' But things are 'returning to normal in terms of the exchange rate, interest rates and the Banque de France's reserves', Mr Sapin claimed this week. Though the franc is again trading comfortably within its EMS range against the D-Mark, overnight money market rates are still over 12 per cent, though they have been as high as 20 per cent. By contrast, long-term French rates, the benchmark for investment rather than speculation, are at less than 8 per cent and have scarcely moved throughout the crises. A majority of French people, 72 per cent, believe in a strong franc and oppose any devaluation against the D-Mark, according to a Sofres poll for the Finance Ministry. The one clear benefit of the franc fort policy has been squeezing inflation to a 36-year annual low of 2 per cent. This has spurred French companies into cutting costs and improving quality in a way that has paid off in export markets. As a result, the strong exchange rate has coincided with France's strongest trade performance for two decades. A FFr30bn deficit in 1991 was turned into a FFr24bn surplus for the first 11 months of last year. However, this is waning. November showed only a FFr400m surplus and December is expected to show no more than a balance. But the decline seems to be more related to slackening demand for exports in key trading partner countries, such as Germany, than to an over-valued exchange rate. So far, French traders have not really felt challenged by the cheaper pound, lira and peseta.</p>

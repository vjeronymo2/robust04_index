			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Clouds in EC open skies THERE IS an air of the predictable, as well as of the melodramatic, in the dispute among EC governments and airlines about solving the financial problems of the European aviation industry. On the liberal side of the ring are the UK and the Netherlands, champions of airline free enterprise, and critics of subsidies and restrictive practices which help make scheduled EC air fares on many routes 50 per cent higher than US levels. In the opposing corner is a larger group of member states with loss-making national carriers, proposing extra regulations and government cash to alleviate the hardships of the recession. The gap in attitudes extends beyond the sector's specific difficulties. In statements which appear to advertise the UK government's reasons for not signing the EC social chapter, British Airways' continental rivals say that relatively low UK social charges diminish their ability to compete. In a European industry with a diverse structure and history, beset by the common handicap of inadequate airport infrastructure, and facing likely consolidation into a smaller number of large global carriers, the search for a common policy is fraught with difficulty. However, unless the EC avoids the dangers of fragmentation and diversion along its path to liberalisation, the ultimate beneficiaries of the process - consumers - will not reap full advantage. This month's Brussels hearings by the EC's committee of 'wise men' into airline problems have illustrated the nature of these challenges. Three agreements on EC air liberalisation during the past six years have generated a level of competition which, along with over-capacity induced by the late-1980s aircraft order boom, is forcing less efficient carriers to carry out slimming and lay-offs. Rightly rejected Yesterday's proposal by Belgium, the current EC president, to reintroduce passenger capacity quotas runs contrary to the spirit of EC airline liberalisation. The suggestion was rightly rejected last night by the EC Commission. Yet the political will on the continent to tone down what are viewed as the effects of untrammelled deregulation should not be underestimated. Belgium's initiative was given tacit support by other countries, including France. Several airlines are mounting requests for fresh state aid, including Belgium's financially troubled Sabena, as well as the Spanish and Portuguese carriers. The Irish government, a traditional liberalising force in aviation, is seeking approval to grant Aer Lingus IPounds 175m in extra funds, in a package involving extensive job cuts. Counter-attack Meanwhile Mr Bernard Attali, the Air France chairman, has stated that the British liberalisation crusade is partly based on hypocrisy, claiming that the UK's 1977 air traffic agreement with the US gives Britain unfair advantages. Mr Attali's claim deserves study. The old airline accords by Germany and France with the US allowed American airlines much greater access to Frankfurt and Charles de Gaulle airports than allowed to Heathrow by the 1977 agreement. Yet Mr Attali's counter-attack also illustrates the difficulty of looking at European airlines' predicament in anything but a global context. The drive towards international airline partnerships and mergers is so advanced that a retreat to the previous system of national protection would be unfeasible and unwise. As a centrepiece of its competition policy, the EC has no choice but to encourage loss-making airlines to carry through further restructuring. Although this will require some smaller European airlines to merge or close in coming years, the industry will be in a better shape to face the next business cycle. Difficulties caused by variations in EC airlines' economic environments can best be tackled through privatisation. This path can be trodden only after restructuring decisions of the sort taken by Lufthansa and Air France are implemented. Over the longer term, to prevent US airlines from winning undue advantage, the EC should work towards taking over responsibility for transatlantic air traffic accords. That goal, however, will require a great deal more EC harmony than is currently evident; it can be reached only at the end of a struggle which has just begun.</p>

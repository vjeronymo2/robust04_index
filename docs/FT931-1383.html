			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Norway given go-ahead byEC for membership talks THE European Commission yesterday gave Norway the green light for its application to join the European Community, and accession negotiations are expected to open formally when EC foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg on April 5. Brussels is moving fast to bring talks with Norway into line with entry negotiations that began on February 1 with Austria, Sweden and Finland, aiming at membership for all four by 1995 if their governments can gain public support. Norway rejected EC membership in a divisive referendum in 1972, and enthusiasm for joining the Community there and in Sweden and Finland is currently lukewarm at best. Mr Hans van den Broek, EC foreign affairs commissioner, who is conducting the negotiations, stressed yesterday that all the applicants had to accept both existing EC rules and laws, and the Maastricht treaty, which still awaits ratification by Norway's Nordic neighbour, Denmark, and the UK. He restated official EC policy that there is no prospect of granting the new applicants the opt-outs on monetary union, common defence policy and European citizenship devised to enable Denmark, whose voters narrowly rejected Maastricht last June, to re-present the treaty in a second referendum on May 18. In common with its co-applicants, Norway will spend the next several months working through a list of EC laws, testing for compatibility with their own laws. These, however, have largely been brought into line via the European Economic Area treaty creating a free trade zone between the EC and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) to which all the candidate countries belong. Trickier issues - such as agriculture, fisheries, competition law, state aid, regional policy and - especially for Norway - energy, will be dealt with separately in 29 'packages'. The hope is to conclude by year-end, enabling referendums in the applicant countries next year. Mr Van den Broek adopted a tough line on the negotiations, warning that it was up to the applicants to accommodate themselves to the Community and sell the policies to their voters. Referring to the 1972 referendum in Norway, Mr Van den Broek said that 'the Community is not for sale'. 'It's not our task to influence the very mature public opinion of Norway one way or the other,' he said. But he acknowledged that a Yes to Maastricht in Denmark 'is not without relevance to this whole exercise'.</p>

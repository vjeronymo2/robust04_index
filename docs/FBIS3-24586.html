			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I. Sh. Shteynberg, Yu. A. Shchepetkin; UDC </F> 681.327.68:621.373.826]    [Abstract] Some features of recording medium behavior in  multi-layer recording devices are examined. At the present time,  halogen-silver photo-emulsion is the only material exhibiting a  10[.sup]-4[/] - 10[.sup]-5[/] J/cm[.sup]2[/]  sensitivity with nanosecond exposure, and a dynamic range of  _D_n = 0.1. With a 50-100m thickness of emulsion,  information  can be recorded in 5-10 layers. However, the processing of  materials with this thickness is difficult. Photopolymer is a  convenient material for immediate reading after recording. The  significant advantage of the photopolymers is the fact that  there is no need for a ``wet'' processing, a self fixation with  recording, and a substantial light amplification. However,  because the power density in the recording region is much  greater than the optimal, the sensitivity is decreased with  recording. The other feature is the dependance of the medium  absorption coefficient on exposure. Some characteristics of  several recording media, significant for application with  multilayer recording devices, are listed in a table. One of  possible options for reaching a compromise between the layer  sensitivity and the total number of layers is the application of  a two-photon absorption. A possible recording diagram of a  two-photon recording is described. With application of a  two-photon absorption the fundamental problems of the multi-  layer recording can be solved. This includes a uniform recording  in a bulk and a non-destructive reading at the recording  wavelength. However, the two-photon absorption coefficient for  most media is small, and becomes significant only with a power  density of 10[.sup]7[/] - 10[.sup]8[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/].

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 1886(d)(3)(E) of the Act requires that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary establish the wage index for the purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusting payment rates for hospital inpatient services to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect wages in a geographic area relative to the national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average. For this reason, we are considering establishing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion that labor market areas under the SLMO must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include all hospitals within a contiguous area or must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined geographic boundaries or distance parameters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, we are concerned that such a requirement may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevent hospitals in noncontiguous areas within a State that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share similar demographic features from being grouped in one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor market area under the SLMO. We are also concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that hospitals may be able to meet the contiguity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement but design an area with an illogical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> configuration that may not represent a labor market area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, we do not believe it would be appropriate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve an application for a new labor market area that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups 2 hospitals 100 miles apart but excludes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals located in between. We are also concerned about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approving a SLMO application under which the wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be based only on hospital-specific wages. Such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application would not reflect local market conditions based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on contiguous geographic areas. Because of these concerns,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are soliciting public comments regarding appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for approving labor market areas under the SLMO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Calculation of Budget Neutrality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As noted above, we would require payments to hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the SLMO to be budget neutral in relation to payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the absence of the SLMO. We are considering alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for applying a budget neutrality adjustment. Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budget neutrality calculation for the SLMO labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas would be made after the effects of reclassification,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we expect that hospitals under a SLMO will continue to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reclassification as they do under the current system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such reclassifications would be recognized both for purposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of computing the budget neutrality adjustment and computing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wage index values applicable to reclassified hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We envision two options for applying the budget neutrality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjusting the wage index for the SLMO labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this option, there would be a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment to the wage index that would affect all hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in the SLMO in equal proportions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjusting the wage index for selected hospitals within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SLMO labor market areas.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this option, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application to create labor market areas under SLMO would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify how the budget neutrality adjustment would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied. For example, it could be applied equally to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SLMO hospitals or it could be limited to selected hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the SLMO application does not specify how to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the budget neutrality adjustment, the adjustment to the wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index would have a proportional effect on payments to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals participating in a SLMO labor market area. (As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicated above, reclassification granted to hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating in a SLMO would be recognized in computing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index values applicable to non-SLMO reclassified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals under section 1886(d)(8)(C) of the Act.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Effect on Hospitals Not Participating in the SLMO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hospitals that are not part of labor market areas under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SLMO would continue to have their wage index calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the current labor market areas_including the effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of reclassification. The wage index for these hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would continue to reflect the average hourly wage in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current labor market area relative to the national average.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a non-SLMO hospital were reclassified to an MSA that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes hospitals that are part of a SLMO labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area, the wage index for the non-SLMO hospital would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated as if the SLMO did not exist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that hospitals in SLMO States that are not part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a redesigned labor market area would not necessarily have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be part of the budget neutrality adjustment and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support for the SLMO would not be needed. However, if they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chose to be part of the budget neutrality adjustment, their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support for the SLMO would be needed even if they were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in a redesigned labor market areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Process for Submitting a SLMO Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are considering establishing the process described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below for establishing labor market areas under the SLMO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given that hospitals may apply both for geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification by the MGCRB and for a revised labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area under the SLMO in the same year, our time frames for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SLMO decisions may parallel the time frames used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification decisions by the MGCRB. However, we expect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that approval or rejection of SLMO applications would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made by HCFA's Bureau of Policy Development. The potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process would consist of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The initial SLMO application would be made to HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and would include a statement from each participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital attesting to their support for labor market areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the SLMO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) We envision providing notification to applicants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of approval of the SLMO labor market areas before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of our annual prospective payment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule (usually published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May of each year). For hospitals whose SLMO application has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been denied, we are considering providing an opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit additional information in support of a SLMO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application. This information would be used by HCFA in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsidering a denial before publication of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

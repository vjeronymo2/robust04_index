			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Dollars 1.8bn issue launched to rebuild Beirut MIDDLE EASTERN investors were yesterday invited to subscribe to one of the region's biggest public share issues - and in effect to buy a stake in Lebanon's future - with the launch of Solidere, a Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1.2bn) company designed to rebuild Beirut's city centre. Subscription will be open to Lebanese and other Arab nationals on a scale of priorities determined by the company. The offer, of 6.5m shares at Dollars 100 each, closes on January 10. 'It is probably the largest private launch in the Middle East,' Mr Nasr al-Shamaa, Solidere's general secretary, said yesterday. A successful launch would provide the biggest private investment tranche towards the ambitious rebuilding plans of Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's billionaire businessman turned prime minister. Solidere's city centre project is a pivot of Mr Hariri's 10-year, Dollars 13bn programme to revive Beirut as the cosmopolitan hub of trade, finance and recreation it was before the 17-year civil war erupted in 1975. The government already has aid pledges of more than Dollars 1bn for specific rebuilding projects from the EC, UN, the Opec Fund, Arab institutions and European countries. But the share offer will be a test of private sector commitment to Mr Hariri's ambitions and, in particular, of his conviction that wealthy expatriate Lebanese will channel wealth back into their country. Lebanese expatriates are estimated to hold Dollars 30bn to Dollars 40bn in assets outside the country. The issue represents 35 per cent of Solidere's equity, the remainder of which will comprise 11.7m class A shares distributed among 150,000 Lebanese in exchange for their title to property on which Solidere will rebuild. A government committee valued this land in central Beirut at Dollars 1.17bn - the value of shares to be issued to former property owners. Additional class B shares in Solidere - its name being the French acronym for Lebanese Company for Development and Reconstruction of Beirut Central District - will be offered to these former landowners, other Lebanese residents, government agencies, Lebanese expatriates and Arab citizens - in that order of priority. Paribas of France and Saudi American Bank, the Riyadh-based joint venture bank, will act as subscription agents for the sale outside Lebanon.</p>

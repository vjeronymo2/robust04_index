			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: South Africa chooses the liberal flight path THE decision by South Africa to liberalise its aviation policy, with the aim of bringing the country into line with international norms, has been given added urgency by the normalisation of political and economic relations with the rest of the world, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. Mr Piet Welgemoed, transport minister, said recently that 25 airlines, from Europe, the Middle and Far East, South America, Africa and Russia had applied to fly to the country. The South African government announced a series of measures on Wednesday, including tariff deregulation, and said it would allow more than one national airline to fly routes to South Africa. The policy will have a considerable impact on South African Airways (SAA), the national carrier, which has been protected from competition as all fares for flights to and from South Africa have been set at levels determined by SAA's operating costs. SAA also enjoyed protection as the only national carrier flying the main international routes. The most important changes concerning scheduled air services are the deregulation of tariff control and allowing each country to designate more than one airline to serve on a specific route between two countries. A likely beneficiary of these changes will be Virgin Atlantic which is hoping to start a five-flight per week service to South Africa in October. During a visit to South Africa in March, Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's owner, said he thought fares could be reduced by 35-40 per cent. The policy will also allow designated airlines on a certain route to expand or cut services by virtue of demand and supply, while Cape Town and Durban will also be promoted as gateways to South Africa. From a domestic point of view, existing or future airlines will now be free to compete with SAA on its established routes. Mr Jan Blake, managing director of the recently formed Flitestar airline, has already given notice that the company hopes to pioneer scheduled services to India and the United Arab Emirates and to become the second designated carrier on routes to the UK and Germany. The new policy also encourages charter flights and will involve the ratification of various conventions which should make it easier and more beneficial for South African airlines to obtain foreign financing.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Simsmetal buys private UK group Simsmetal, the Australian scrap metal company, yesterday announced that it was expanding its UK operations with the acquisition of G. F. Denton &amp; Sons, a private company based in London, but would not be proceeding with its previously-announced plans to purchase businesses in the US. No purchase price was given for the UK deal, but Simsmetal said its UK trading operations would have an annual turnover exceeding ADollars 30m (USDollars 21.3m), the majority of which would come from the newly-acquired operations. The UK deal came as Simsmetal announced a third-quarter profit of ADollars 11.8m after tax, and a pre-tax surplus of ADollars 18.1m. Sales in the three months to end-March were ADollars 173m. This brings after-tax earnings for the first nine months to ADollars 35.3m, or ADollars 54.6m at the pre-tax level.</p>

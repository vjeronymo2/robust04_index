			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TREATMENT BACKLOG LEAVES O.C. ADDICTS IN PURGATORY  </P> <P> A serious shortage of treatment centers is making it increasingly difficult to  help hundreds of Orange County's worst drug addicts, many of whom must wait up  to six months for care after qualifying for the government-funded programs.  </P> <P> Discouraged by long delays and harmed by continuing drug abuse while on waiting  lists, roughly half of those promised a bed at the county's two residential  treatment centers never show up on admission day.  </P> <P> The situation, county officials and former drug users say, denies help for  those who need it most and places many addicts in a frustrating purgatory where  drug use worsens, relatives suffer and society continues to pay the price of  drug-related crime.  </P> <P> "It's the intent of medical professionals and Congress to get people into  treatment right away," said William Edelman, division manager of the County  Health Care Agency's drug abuse programs. "For people with insurance in private  facilities, that happens, but if you're down and out, rippin' and runnin', the  space is just not available."  </P> <P> County officials estimate that there could be more than 20,000 people in Orange  County with drug problems serious enough to qualify them for the 15-month  regimens at Phoenix House in Santa Ana and Hope House in Anaheim. Hundreds  apply every year for the 105 slots at the county-funded facilities, which  provide living quarters and an intensive counseling program. Surveys of  graduates three years out of the program show that 75% to 80% of them have  stayed off addictive substances.  </P> <P> The residential centers exclude pregnant women and those single parents who  cannot find someone to care for their children while in treatment. The county  has no long-term facility for these addicts, except outpatient clinics.  </P> <P> Officials at Hope House and Phoenix House say that two- to six-month waits are  common. In extreme cases, the delay can be a year. The time from acceptance to  admission for women is generally two to three months; for men, six months or  more.  </P> <P> Marc Corradini, executive director of Hope House, said that so many people are  qualified for the programs that if the county ran regular public service  announcements on radio, the wait would soon grow to a year.  </P> <P> "If we were aggressive and really advertised, we could easily increase the  applicants . . . and have a backlog of six months to a year," Corradini said.  "But that's inhumane."  </P> <P> Those seeking admission to the county's residential drug treatment centers are  some of the most seriously addicted that the streets can offer. About 43% use  intravenous drugs. Most are between 18 and 30 years old with long histories of  drug abuse that began in adolescence or childhood.  </P> <P> Broke and unemployed, they cannot afford $100 an hour or $1,000 a day for  treatment at private centers, which are in ample supply. Making matters worse,  many have criminal records, some so serious that private facilities would  refuse to accept them even if they could pay.  </P> <P> "The county must pick up those that fall between the cracks and cannot afford  the private sector," Edelman said. "They are often the most difficult cases in  the county, and this group is continuing to grow."  </P> <P> Statewide, the situation is not much different. In Los Angeles and San  Francisco, it can take a year to get into treatment. Statistics from the  California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs show that in 1989, 2,752  people were on waiting lists at 81 long-term treatment centers funded by  counties across the state.  </P> <P> About 85% were on the lists longer than seven days. The same figures show that  4,014 people were turned away from those centers last year because the wait was  too long or they could not afford certain services.  </P> <P> "People all over the state say they would like more residential facilities,"  said Michael Caron, who administers state grants for the Department of Alcohol  and Drug Programs. "My sense is that a two-month waiting list is lovely, if you  can find it."  </P> <P> Most don't, however, and must endure longer delays for treatment, an often  frustrating experience that can discourage some people from waiting for or  accepting a slot when it finally becomes available.  </P> <P> To make matters worse, those on waiting lists must check in daily on their own  by telephone or risk losing the spot saved for them. Former drug users say that  isn't easy for an addict living on the street.  </P> <P> Al, who asked that his last name not be used, said that he was frustrated by  the process but still made the required calls to Hope House from jail and Cider  House, a Norwalk detoxification center he entered temporarily after a drinking  binge.  </P> <P> "I guess I was just tired of getting nowhere," he said. "I knew I needed help  and I kept calling no matter where I was or how hard it was. When I finally got  in, I couldn't believe it."  </P> <P> But at Phoenix House and Hope House, roughly 50% of those accepted into the  programs drop out after waiting three weeks. Many of those who stick it out on  the waiting list continue using drugs and risk jail or worse in the interim.  </P> <P> "People get arrested for crimes or simply vanish," said William H. Smith,  director of clinical services for Phoenix House. "Most continue to play Russian  roulette with their lives and continue doing what they've always been doing --  taking drugs."  </P> <P> While Sharlene Woronets, 26, was on the waiting list for Phoenix House, she  said she lost her job and began stealing purses -- "anything" -- to support an  8-year-old addiction to heroin and cocaine. After a two-month wait, a bed  opened up for her. At the time she was in the county jail for women in Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> "I called and said I needed help, but they said there's a four- to six-month  wait," Woronets recalled. "It's depressing. Your desire for help lessens the  longer you don't get in. I didn't like being on ice."  </P> <P> The day Hope House accepted Al and put him on a waiting list for treatment he  went on the binge of his life to celebrate. It was no small achievement. The  ruddy 23-year-old normally drank himself into unconsciousness or snorted enough  crystal methamphetamine to go four days without sleep.  </P> <P> Al was high for most of three months -- the time it took his name to reach the  top of a waiting list. During that time, he was in and out of jail on warrants,  had smashed the windows of his father's house and was arrested on a charge of  assault with a deadly weapon. By his estimation, he "got heavier" into drugs.  </P> <P> On admission day, Al said, he was still feeling the effects of methamphetamine.  He cleaned himself up, though, dropped a little Visine in his eyes and  presented himself at the center's front door.  </P> <P> "I really thought they forgot about me," he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, parents experience the same frustration and anxiety as their  children on the waiting lists. Woronets' father, Eli, said that he worried  every time the body of a missing young woman was discovered by police. During  the three months that Carol Olds, 31, waited to get into Phoenix House, her  mother Altha almost gave up hope.  </P> <P> "I didn't think she'd ever get into a program," she said. "I was tired of  dealing with people that were users. Items were missing from my house all the  time. I didn't even want my own daughter in the house. It's frustrating there  aren't more Phoenix Houses."  </P> <P> County and state officials blame the shortage of treatment centers on rampant  drug use, a traditional emphasis on law enforcement rather than treatment, and  the AIDS crisis, which is providing more of an incentive for drug addicts --  particularly intravenous drug users -- to get help.  </P> <P> They also point out that cocaine and methamphetamine use have increased  substantially statewide. People addicted to those drugs are often the hardest  to treat, which means that they will occupy the limited supply of beds much  longer.  </P> <P> Financially, Orange County's drug abuse programs have not had a budget increase  in five years, although drug use remains a serious problem. Combined with  inflation, Edelman said, it has meant a cut in resources for treatment and  education.  </P> <P> But officials say that the forecast for drug treatment looks better than it has  for years. The state has promised Orange County $1.3 million, which will pay  for new facilities, including 27 more beds for Phoenix House and Hope House.  More funds will become available, Caron said, as the state applies for new  federal grants provided by the Bush Administration's national drug policy.  </P> <P> Within the next few months, the county also plans to open a long-term  residential drug treatment center for pregnant women and for single parents who  cannot leave their children. Drug abuse officials are negotiating a contract  for the services.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of women in my situation," said Terry Criswell, 29, a  recovering alcoholic and cocaine addict who has two children. "It's really  tough to find a place. You end up getting discouraged and resort back to your  old behavior."  </P> <P> Criswell could not find any facility in Orange County that would accept her and  her family, and was eventually admitted to Foley House in Whittier, which  accepts pregnant women and parents with their children.  </P> <P> "The lack of a residential program for pregnant women represents a big gap in  the county's drug treatment effort," said Len Liberio, a drug program manager  for the County Health Care Agency.  </P> <P> Even when funds are approved, opening new clinics and expanding facilities is  not that simple. The county- and city-permit processes can take a year or  longer, and substantial opposition from prospective neighbors, who fear a  decline in property values, must be overcome.  </P> <P> The county has been trying to set up an outpatient clinic in a commercial area  in South Orange County, but the owner of the property has been reluctant to  grant a lease.  </P> <P> "Drug addicts are social pariahs," Liberio said. "It's the traditional 'not in  my back yard' syndrome and the attitude is pervasive in all cities. But once  the centers are in, they are good neighbors."  </P> <P> ON THE WAITING LIST: Drug addict endures delay. A16  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / The Long View: We are not bemused WHEN YOU are a bemused investor or a beleaguered prime minister it can sometimes seem difficult to see tell the wood for the trees. It can be worthwhile to step back from the forest for a bit of perspective; you never know, there just might be a pattern. Right now we are in the disturbing process of changing our view of what represents economic and political normality. A certain level of living standard and rate of economic growth, and a certain position in the international pecking order, have been taken for granted in Britain and in the west generally. But although trends may persist for 30 or 40 years there is no law that says they will persist forever. Consider the demoralisation of America, victorious in the Cold War but now fearful of losing the peace and apparently about to throw out its president. In the 1950s and 1960s great companies such as General Motors and International Business Machines dominated the industrial world. They controlled the technology and they set the standards. Now they may be in the long slow process of going bust, taking with them to oblivion the secure, high-wage jobs that fuelled American prosperity. That degree of relative prosperity was a transient postwar phenomenon, with Europe and Japan bombed into poverty and capital famine, and the rest of the world well behind in the development timetable. Now, technology can be almost instantly transferred around the globe, and cheap labour countries are becoming powerful manufacturing centres. The rise of mainland China as a force in international trading is a little-recognised threat, although highlighted this year by a booming Hong Kong stock market. Millions of industrial jobs have already been destroyed in the west, with more to come. For a while, during the 1980s, the evil day was postponed by live-now-pay-later debt-financed binges in countries that would tolerate them, like Britain and the US. Japan was pushed down the same road and is now nursing a dangerously sick banking system. Germany, which prudently avoided the debt trap, subsided instead into Eurosclerosis, until lured into a still more seductive unification spending spree. Germany will pay for its excesses soon enough, along with France and the other remaining ERM members. Britain had to be forcibly rescued by foreign exchange speculators from the errors of its political masters. However, Continental recession will bring Britain scant satisfaction because our exports will be hit. Meantime, European traumas have distracted Britain's attention from the real long-term crisis, its loss of manufacturing competitiveness and a probable inability to sustain living standards - already a serious problem in the US. It is not a comfortable position, when our government only six months ago won an election on promises of recovery and no tax increases. Against this background, protectionism is bound to start reappearing on political agendas. At this stage the French farmers who are insisting on their right to decent incomes for growing unsaleable food may still seem an anachronism but some of their manufacturing counterparts elsewhere in Europe may soon believe they have common cause. In the UK devaluation of the currency is part of the answer, and it may have to go further. But devaluation only works if real incomes are cut. If this impoverishment is resisted, all that happens is a surge in inflation. Moreover, a massive change in the structure of the economy is required. There must be shift of resources into net exports of manufactured goods, and a consequential sharp squeeze on the public sector and the services side of the private sector, where most people are employed. The danger is that these changes will bring immense financial dislocation. Here lies another risk of inflation, because history shows that British employees fiercely resist nominal pay cuts, and relative shifts in income have to be lubricated by inflation. Some say that inflation cannot happen in an economic depression. In the 1930s, it is true, prices were falling rather than rising. But then, banks were permitted to go bust, and the money supply fell, in the US at any rate. Today failed banks are bailed out by the state, their debts are assumed by the public sector and the money supply goes on rising, albeit slowly. Meanwhile the public sector deficit will be ballooning and eventually the government will not be able to finance its debts without monetising them. Already we are in the process of a cut in real interest rates. For nearly five years interest rates have been held high in Britain in an attempt to maintain the external value of sterling and suppress domestic inflation, matching the very high real interest rates in Germany caused by the epic clash there between fiscal and monetary policies. Remember that the real return on index-linked gilts touched 4 3/4 per cent just before Black Wednesday. That real interest rate has now tumbled to under 4 per cent. Logically the British government now has motives to push that rate much lower, both to reduce the cost of the private sector's investment in manufacturing capacity and to diminish the burden of servicing its own debt. Obviously this carries the risk of stimulating inflation but the dramatic changes in political climate in the past few weeks have shown that the government has little real choice in what it does. It was swept aside on Black Wednesday. It will now be tossed to and fro helplessly by developments in industry and in the financial system. So much for prime ministers. As for investors, I suggested at the beginning of September that the golden age of British saving was about to end. There was bound to be a sharp and sudden change of direction, which was finally acknowledged by John Major on Tuesday. Already the net of tax return on a High Street savings account is down to about 5 per cent, and only optimists believe that will provide full protection against underlying inflation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Barrier Between Different </F> Activities"]    [Text] Rome -- Concerning the Antitrust Commission and  Fininvest: "The three experts," Antitrust Commission Chairman  Francesco Saja explained, "should establish a barrier between  public activities and entrepreneurial activities, or rather, I  should say private activities." During the press conference  given by the highest authority on competition, questions about  Berlusconi and his group were snowballing. Saja explained:  "The aim is to establish a dividing line between political  activity and other activities. Let us hope they will be able to  do so."    It is now up to the experts -- Antonio La Pergola, Giorgio  Crisci, and Agostino Gambino -- to study the situation, and Saja  was saying that "studying is always a good thing." However, he  seemed "less than enthusiastic" about the solution adopted:  "Let us hope they will be able to do something. Political  power must be distinct from economic power. This is the  objective."    What formula should be adopted? "Transferring his assets  would be the most radical as well as the best solution." Could  foreign models whereby the management of the assets is entrusted  to a third party be effectively adopted? "They have  limitations." What about the idea put forward by Andreatta  [Italian Popular Party lower house floor leader], who invited  Berlusconi to give the banks a mandate to sell? "A mandate  would be required." What about the PDS's [Democratic Party of  the Left] plan whereby anyone who has been granted a government  concession should not be allowed to govern? "We must first be  clear about what is meant by concession. A concession may also  involve a small state-owned plot of land."    Concerning Fininvest, the PDS, and guarantees: On this point  he is also engaged in a long-distance polemic with Fininvest  chairman Fedele Confalonieri, who considered the progressive  proposal "a little over the top," and who stated: "It is  Fininvest that needs assurances, because now Berlusconi is  devoting himself to his job as prime minister and he is  relatively uninterested in us -- assurances that we can continue  to work, without major cuts or hasty sellouts." Saja's reply to  this: "Why, who owns Fininvest?"</p>

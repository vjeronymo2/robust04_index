			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lifted by Bundesbank rate cut The Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate lifted bourses around Europe, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr Joe Rooney, European equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London, said that the move was 'very positive', reflecting the Buba's emphasis on the reducing trend in German inflation, and on the distortions in the trend of money supply growth. He said that the cut should be particularly important to equities in countries suffering from an excessively tight monetary policy: 'That really is France at the moment,' he maintained, although Spain should be another winner. Conversely, he said, Germany and the Netherlands are not so interest rate sensitive, and the move should be less beneficial for them. FRANKFURT, yesterday afternoon, was not listening to the pragmatists. Sentiment took over and, after a fall of 7.89 to 2,128.72 in the Dax index before the Buba news emerged, the Ibis-indicated index closed at 2,162.29. Turnover was virtually level at DM8.5bn. Afternoon gains were broadly based and relatively even: Allianz, Deutsche Bank, Daimler and Bayer all put up rises in the 2 to 2 1/2 per cent area. BMW fell behind the afternoon pace, up DM8 to DM867, but it had already climbed DM31.50 on the official session, said Mr Nigel Longley at Commerzbank, leaving it 4.8 per cent up on the day following a US report that the carmaker expected profits to rise by 20 to 30 per cent this year. PARIS initially reacted with undisguised satisfaction at the news from Germany, sending the CAC-40 index to a session high of 2,305.62. However, the market eased back on the likelihood that the Bank of France would not move to cut domestic rates until next week, closing the day up 16.86 at 2,281.18. Ms Melissa Carrington, European strategist at Hoare Govett, said that the fact that the Bundesbank had left the repo rate unchanged limited the French authorities' room for manoeuvre, and could mean that they will not be able to follow with a full 50 basis point cut. Mr Anthony Thomas, an economist at Kleinwort Benson, noted that yesterday's announcement meant that the trigger point for a switch out of cash and into equities was coming nearer. French investors, he said, were sitting on a mountain of cash which would provide the opportunity for market performance. Saint-Gobain, up FFr15 to FFr685, benefited from the announcement that the UK glass manufacturer, Pilkington, was to lift European prices by an average of 10 per cent. AMSTERDAM saw plenty of activity in Akzo with some investors looking ahead to next week's results. The chemicals group advanced Fl 4.50 to Fl 213.70, while the AEX index improved 1.30 to 432.91. Hoogovens ended 40 cents higher at Fl 63.80. After the close it said that it would make additional cuts in its aluminium output from next month. MILAN enjoyed a positive session. BCI, for instance, broke through the L6,000 level, finding support ahead of its planned privatisation in a few weeks' time. The shares finished up L230 at L6,050. Fiat was heavily bought for the second successive session, rising L276 to L5,035, with further talks on the car group's planned restructuring package scheduled for later last night. Olivetti rose L154 to L2,490, helped by brokers' reports and expectations that it will be awarded the country's second digital telephone network. MADRID recovered from bond market pessimism and equity weakness to close with the general index 1.91 higher at 347.98, after 342.91 at midday. STOCKHOLM jumped 2 per cent in heavy trading, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 31.4 higher at 1,589.0, supported by the Buba cut and the dissolution of Volvo's cross-ownership agreement with Renault SA of France. Volvo B rose SKr15 to SKr692. ISTANBUL stretched its gains this week by another 8 per cent, leaving the composite index up 1,449.68 at 19,131.00. Turnover rose from TL899bn to TL1,540bn. TEL AVIV's worries over a wide-ranging stock price manipulation scandal sent the Mishtanim index down another 12.96, or 5.4 per cent to 227.42 yesterday, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem. With the exchange closed today, the drop on the week was 6 per cent, following one of 9 per cent last week. Two portfolio investment managers were arrested last week by the securities authority on suspicion of manipulating securities for the eight companies they managed. And earlier this week Mr Amos Weiss, a leading portfolio manager with about Shk1bn (some Dollars 335m) under management, was released on bail after being questioned on suspicion of stock manipulation.

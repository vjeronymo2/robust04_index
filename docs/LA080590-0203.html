			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RANGERS HEAD FOR WICHITA AFTER GAINING SOME RESPECT;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: CINDERELLA BAND GETS INVITATION TO NBC WORLD SERIES AFTER  NINTH-INNING RALLIES LEAD TO SECOND-PLACE FINISH IN STATE PLAYOFFS.  </P> <P> They drive beat-up cars that barely make it to blue-collar jobs. Their dreams  are in minor-league hues and of major-league debuts. But the reality for the  Valley Rangers is summer amateur baseball, because somewhere along the line  nearly every member of the squad was overlooked or rejected by a professional  team.  </P> <P> Yet nobody asked for credentials or lines of credit when the Rangers lined up  last month at the Central State National Baseball Congress tournament in Santa  Maria. And now this band of castoffs is bound for Wichita, Kan., this morning,  and the NBC World Series.  </P> <P> To become the first Valley team since the 1987 Valley Dodgers to earn an NBC  World Series berth, the Rangers won four games in the losers' bracket of the  central state event.  </P> <P> Twice they rallied with two out in the bottom of the ninth to keep their  Cinderella summer alive.  </P> <P> Their chances in the World Series, beginning Monday against the Hays (Kan.)  Larks, seem slim considering their first-year status. To compound matters, the  Rangers won't be at full strength.  </P> <P> Several players, including pitcher Lance Gibson and shortstops Donnie Erickson  and Ted Weisfuss, couldn't get time off from work to make the trip.  </P> <P> Neither could former Calabasas star Cort Wright, so he gave up his job as a  supermarket box boy, ensuring that the Rangers would have enough pitching.  </P> <P> Now Wright and most of his teammates are concerned about paying for lodging and  meals. The Rangers got a late start raising money for the tournament because of  a communications breakdown between local NBC officials and their national  counterparts.  </P> <P> The national group refuted the locals' contention that the Rangers, as central  state runners-up, were assured a berth in the World Series. Nevertheless, on  July 27, the national organizers invited the Rangers to replace a first-place  team that couldn't raise enough money for the trip.  </P> <P> Rangers Manager Frank Des Enfants found himself in the same situation after  scrambling for a week, without success, to find corporate sponsorship in the  Valley.  </P> <P> Fortunately, half of his players were able to come up with the air fare; the  others were still trying to borrow a van late in the week.  </P> <P> "While no one has to do anything, I'm a little disappointed by the lack of  community support," said Des Enfants.  </P> <P> "Maybe they'd care if we were Little League. People are ignorant about NBC  baseball. We're not a bunch of fat beer-swillers. There's nothing higher (than  the NBC) in amateur baseball (except) the Olympics every four years."  </P> <P> With that in mind, the 45-year-old skipper considered competitiveness, talent  and attitude last spring when he assembled the Rangers.  </P> <P> "Over the years you get a feel for who can play and who can't," Des Enfants  said. "Who is a crybaby and who you want up at the plate in a clutch  situation."  </P> <P> The 33-9 Rangers cornered the market on clutch in winning nine games with  ninth-inning rallies, some of which were inspired by infielder Dave Price.  </P> <P> "He does an unbelievable impersonation of Vin Scully," said Wright. "He changes  all the last names to big-league names like 'Cort' Canseco. He can do  play-by-play for nine innings."  </P> <P> Reliever Tim de Grasse, of UC Santa Barbara via Notre Dame High, offers another  source of amusement. The "Vulture," as he is known for swooping in amid  late-inning rallies and claiming wins, is a blur of zany, constant chatter.  </P> <P> "I make sure no one gets mad if they don't do well," De Grasse said. "I remind  them it's not the college season or their life or their job on the line. It's  summer ball and you gotta be loose.  </P> <P> "Now, we're going to a place where there'll be millions of fans and scouts.  That's what we want."  </P> <P> "We want to be pros," added center fielder Jason Peterson, "that's where it's  at."  </P> <P> Peterson played for Grant High in a City Section championship game at Dodger  Stadium, but Peterson didn't get a tumble in the amateur draft following his  senior year, much less a call from a college recruiter.  </P> <P> Yet, Des Enfants believes Peterson is one of several Rangers who could play at  the Class-A level.  </P> <P> Some team members already have played in the minors. Price competed in a pro  league in Australia, and part-time catcher Andy Allanson was with the Cleveland  Indians last year.  </P> <P> "This team has a lot of talent," Des Enfants said. "I'm not worried when anyone  comes up to the plate. I don't say I wish we had our No. 3 or No. 4 hitter up.  Everyone has contributed to the late-inning rallies."  </P> <P> Since many pro and college scouts are expected to be in Wichita, the World  Series represents the late innings of these players' careers, their last chance  to impress someone and earn the right to keep playing the game they love.  </P> <P> Before Wright left his job he remembered the feeling of going from work to  play.  </P> <P> "When you get on the ball field," he said, "it's like a dreamscape. Everything  becomes magical."  </P> <P> The same can be said of the Valley Rangers' season.  </P></p>

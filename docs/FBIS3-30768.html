			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Serbs Must Be Included in the </F> Constitution"]    [Text] The newly appointed leadership of the Democratic  Party of the Serbs in Macedonia (DPS) denies the report signed  by the party's ex-president Boro Ristic and by the Macedonian  Internal Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, saying the Serbian people  does not accept that signature. For the new DPS leader, Dragisa  Miletic, the way chosen by the Serbian people is much more  agreeable -- they demand an explicit constitutional recognition  of the Serbs, as a guarantee of their equal rights with all  other minorities in Macedonia. In other words, the Macedonian  Government is to include the Serbs in its official list of  minorities in the country, in 18 months. Otherwise, the next  step of DPS will be raising of the Serbian question in Macedonia  in front of international institutions, Miletic said.</p>

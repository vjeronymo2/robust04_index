			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / N-fuel scheme faces cuts The Japanese government is likely to cut back its ambitious nuclear fuel programme following an advisory panel's call yesterday for a delay in projects involving plutonium. Their report, which is a basis for the government's long-term nuclear energy policy, follows growing domestic and international concern over Japan's surplus of plutonium, a highly toxic fuel that can be used for nuclear weapons. Japan's nuclear recycling programme was adopted in the 1950s when plutonium was regarded as a 'dream fuel'. The country's first prototype fast-breeder, named Monju and based on the west coast, began a self-sustaining reaction last month, using plutonium produced at processing plants in Britain and France. Japan's first reprocessing plant, in northern Japan, is due to start operating at the end of the decade. Until recently Japan has resisted calls from domestic and international environmental groups for curbs on its programme. However, mounting accusations that Japan intended to build nuclear weapons increased government anxiety. While the report calls only for a delay in various projects linked to plutonium use, and not cancellation, it is a severe blow to the country's nuclear lobby. The report proposes: Postponement of the decision to build a second nuclear fuel reprocessing plant until the year 2010, instead of launching the plant that year; Moving back the target date for when plutonium fast breeders will be put to commercial use by 10 years to 2030; Postponement of construction of the first demonstration fast breeder reactor to early next century; Delay to plans to construct more than 20 light-water reactors by 2010 by about 20 years.</p>

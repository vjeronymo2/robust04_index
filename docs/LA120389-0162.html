			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN POLICY SHIFT, U.S. SEEKS TALKS ON GLOBAL WARMING  </P> <P> In a major shift of Administration policy, President Bush proposed Saturday at  his summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the United States host an  international conference next fall to begin writing a treaty to control global  warming.  </P> <P> If the Soviets accept the proposal during summit sessions today, it would  dramatically advance international efforts to cope with the threat of global  warming. The two superpowers are the world's two largest contributors to the  global warming problem. And, together with Japan, they are the major developed  nations that, until now, have been reluctant to begin negotiations on a global  warming treaty.  </P> <P> Even in advance of agreement by the Soviets, Bush's decision is a significant  step, marking a rapid shift in U.S. policy that, according to Administration  officials, has developed over the last month.  </P> <P> "The United States' position seems to become more progressive weekly, even  daily" on the global warming issue, said one official who has been closely  involved in Cabinet-level debates on the issue. Bush's final decision to agree  to host a conference was made only Thursday and communicated to senior  officials as the President headed for Air Force One to fly to Malta, the  official said.  </P> <P> Global warming is widely believed to be a result of the burning of coal, oil  and other fossil fuels and the destruction of tropical rain forests. Many  scientists believe the warming process could significantly disrupt world  agriculture and raise sea levels across the globe. But, because the causes of  the warming are so widespread, reversing it could require major and potentially  disruptive changes in the global economy.  </P> <P> In addition to the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan, many Third World  nations also have resisted the idea, seeing it as a potential block to their  development efforts.  </P> <P> Within the Administration, several senior presidential advisers, including  science adviser D. Alan Bromley and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu,  had argued earlier this fall that scientific evidence on global warming --  particularly on its actual impacts on human life -- was too thin to begin  writing an international treaty that could cost U.S. industry billions of  dollars.  </P> <P> Hosting an international meeting to begin writing a treaty would expose the  U.S. government to too much pressure to agree on unrealistic steps, these  officials feared.  </P> <P> Other Administration officials, including Environmental Protection Agency chief  William K. Reilly, argued that the United States was in danger of being  perceived as a laggard in responding to a major environmental threat.  </P> <P> Reached after word of Bush's decision, Bromley said the change had come about  because "we know a lot more now than we knew even a few months ago." Calling  for an international treaty-writing session "was premature" last month, but is  no longer, Bromley said.  </P> <P> In addition to the treaty-writing session, Bush also proposed a session next  spring in Washington that would bring together international experts on the  potential impacts of current warming trends. Bush urged the Soviets to attend  that session.  </P> <P> For the past two years, global warming has been handled by three international  panels studying the issue. The United States chairs the panel considering  responses to the problem, Britain chairs a panel looking at the scientific  questions surrounding the phenomenon and the Soviets chair the panel  considering potential impacts that global warming might have on the  environment. Before Bush's decision, U.S. policy was to refuse to even talk  about an international conference until after those panels had completed their  work.  </P> <P> Late in October, opposition from Sununu and Bromley forced Reilly to abandon  plans to call for a global treaty-writing session as part of his presentation  to an international conference on global warming held in the Netherlands.  </P> <P> But, an Administration official said, over the last month, intensive study of  the scientific evidence surrounding global warming as well as the international  political context had convinced Bromley and others within the Administration  that the global warming issue needed to be put on a faster track.  </P> <P> The United States "was viewed as foot-dragging" the official said.  </P> <P> Bush's offer, said another senior official, "represents a signal that the  United States feels it shouldn't be on the defensive on this issue."  </P> <P> "Rather than being perceived as trying to run from the issue, we should seek to  be perceived as leading," he added, noting that the Administration already had  taken several steps, including new automobile fuel economy standards and  proposed revisions to the Clean Air Act, that would help in combatting global  warming.  </P></p>

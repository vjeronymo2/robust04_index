			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM MAYOR SEEKS PROBE OF THEATER WHERE FAN WAS SHOT  </P> <P> Reacting to a shooting incident outside a rap concert, Anaheim Mayor Fred  Hunter said this morning that he will ask police to investigate past incidents  at the Celebrity Theater and may ask the city to revoke the theater's liquor  license.  </P> <P> "If they can't provide proper security for this place, then perhaps they need  to go elsewhere," Hunter said, referring to the managers of the Celebrity  Theater.  </P> <P> Security at the theater was criticized by Hunter and some of the rap performers  who appeared Thursday night after a concert-goer was shot and wounded while  waiting in line outside the theater.  </P> <P> "We had gone through all kinds of security, but we've never seen anything as  poorly organized as this," said James Ice, head of security for rap performer  Ice Cube, shortly after the shooting.  </P> <P> Anaheim police were continuing this morning to try to identify the gunman and  the motive behind the shooting. Investigators confirmed witness accounts that a  melee inside the theater during a performance by rapper Too Short was unrelated  to the shooting outside the theater.  </P> <P> Owners and managers of the Celebrity Theater could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva: "Bulgarian Foreign Minister To </F> Visit Turkey"]    [Text] Sofia, May 12 (BTA) -- Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov is leaving Monday [16 May] on a three-day  official visit to Turkey.    In Ankara, Mr. Daskalov and his Turkish counterpart Hikmet  Cetin the state of Bulgarian-Turkish relations, the development  of the Yugoconflict and international problems. [sentence as  received] In a Treaty of Friendship, Goodneighbourliness,  Cooperation and Security signed in May 1992, Bulgaria and Turkey  declared their readiness to adopt the non-aggression principle  as a fundamental principle of their bilateral relations and to  promote their economic, transport and trade cooperation.  Bulgaria and Turkey have also signed a protocol on the start of  arrangements for agreements on reciprocal investment promotion  and on the avoidance of double taxation. The drafting of the  two agreements, as well as of agreements on trade, economic and  industrial cooperation will continue during Mr. Daskalov's  forthcoming visit to Ankara. Some of these accords will be  signed when President Zhelyu Zhelev visits Turkey in June.    Bulgarian-Turkish relations have been making successful  progress in the last few years, after they reached an all-time  low between 1984 and 1989 over the forced name change of  Bulgarian Turks by the communist regime. When the then prime  minister Filip Dimitrov visited Turkey for talks with his  Turkish opposite number in May 1992, this was the first  top-level contact between the two countries in 14 years. "We do  not believe that there should be boundaries between us, in the  sense of barriers between the two countries; moreover, we hope  that in the relations we establish between us we can only serve  as a model for one such melting of boundaries regionwide, and  the way we can be open, the entire region can be open and  transparent," Mr. Dimitrov said during that visit. Since 1989,  Bulgarian chief diplomats have visited Ankara four times: Viktor  Vulkov in May and August 1991, and Stoyan Ganev in November 1991  and September 1992. Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin came  to Sofia twice, in March 1992 and in December 1993. During his  1992 visit, the two countries signed three documents: a  protocol on joint work on the promotion of Bulgarian-Turkish  relations, an intergovernmental agreement on relaxation of  currency controls (annexed to the 1979 agreement), and an  intergovernmental agreement to lift restrictions on the freedom  of movement of diplomatic and consular staff. According to a  Bulgarian Foreign Ministry official, the protocol on expansion  of cooperation between Bulgaria and Turkey may be signed at this  stage.</p>

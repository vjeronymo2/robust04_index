DPR&hyph;24 and DPR&hyph;27, issued to Wisconsin Electric Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant (PBNP), Units 1 and 2, located in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments would modify Point Beach Nuclear Plant Technical Specifications (TS) 15.3.4, ``Steam and Power Conversion System,'' and 15.3.7, ``Auxiliary Electrical Systems,'' to increase the allowed outage times for one motor driven auxiliary feedwater pump and for the standby emergency power for the Unit 1 Train B 4160 Volt safeguards bus (A06) from 7 to 12 days. The proposed amendments would also modify TS 15.3.3, ``Emergency Core Cooling System, Auxiliary Cooling Systems, Air Recirculation Fan Coolers, and Containment Spray,'' to provide the clarification that the service water pump (P&hyph;32E) operating with power supplied by the Alternative Shutdown System is operable from offsite power. The changes are one-time extensions of specific allowed outage times. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not; (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the license has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The staff's review is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The probability of an accident previously evaluated will not be significantly increased because no changes are being made to the facility or to its operation which can significantly affect the potential for an accident. The only change is an extension of an already acceptable allowed outage time. The consequences of an accident previously evaluated will not be significantly increased because the licensee is taking compensatory measures to offset the increased outage time. These measures include verified operability of the gas turbine generator, cessation of maintenance and test activities that could cause loss of required equipment, assurance of at least three offsite power sources, and on-call status of a senior reactor operator with detailed knowledge of the planned evolutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The amendment only extends the allowed outage time. The changes do not affect the manner in which equipment can fail such that a new or different kind of accident can occur. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because compensatory measures are being taken (discussed above) to compensate for the increase in the allowed outage time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Sinn Fein faces renewed pressure The British and Irish governments yesterday mounted a fresh show of unity to step up pressure on Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, to accept the Downing Street peace declaration. Both governments are refusing to impose deadlines for a response from Sinn Fein, but it was suggested last night that a decision would be expected one way or the other by the time Sinn Fein holds its annual conference in Dublin at the end of the month. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, and Mr Albert Reynolds, his Irish counterpart, are to meet later this month to assess developments since the December declaration. Although they accept that the visit to the US of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, handed the party a valuable propaganda coup, they remain determined to drive home the message that the prospects for peace lie in the hands of Sinn Fein and the IRA. In Londonderry, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said he believed people had become 'very impatient' and enough time had passed for a response to the declaration. He warned he might be prepared to go ahead with inter-party talks not only without Sinn Fein, but also without the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party, which remains opposed to the Downing Street declaration. Mr Reynolds, speaking in Dublin, urged Sinn Fein to respond positively and, in a departure from earlier statements which was intended to maximise the chances of Sinn Fein acceptance, stressed that the declaration was 'essentially an Irish peace initiative'. There could be no renegotiation of the document 'though it may eventually be transcended'. In a reference to London's determination to press on with internal talks, Mr Reynolds stressed that the declaration emphasised 'peace first, negotiations afterwards'. The opposite approach had been tried among the constitutional parties 'with little sign of success so far'. He was non-committal, however, over a timetable for constitutional talks.</p>

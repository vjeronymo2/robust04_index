			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992 (The Manifestos): Plan for extensive Whitehall shake-up A CONSERVATIVE general election victory would result in the largest shake-up of Whitehall responsibilities since the early 1970s with the Treasury and Department of the Environment both strengthening their responsibilities. The changes envisaged in the Conservative manifesto would transfer to the Treasury the responsibility for overseeing all financial services in what appears to be an effort to tighten the government's regulatory grip. Environment would strengthen its authority over urban regeneration. Among the losers would be the Home Office  - shorn of broadcasting and womens' issues. The Department of Employment would lose tourism and small companies, outweighing the gain from the new responsibility for women. Mr John Major announced the prospective creation of two new Whitehall power structures. A new Cabinet-level post  - based on the existing Cabinet office  - would oversee the Citizen's Charter, and take broad responsibility for reforms of the Civil Service, and monitor Whitehall efficiency and public purchasing. A second new department would merge the responsibilities  - currently split between several ministries  - for broadcasting, arts, sports, heritage, tourism and the film industry. Those changes would run in parallel with the transfer of most of the existing responsibilities of the energy department to trade and industry with the remainder  - the energy efficiency unit  - passing to environment. The Department of Employment would hand to the DTI the responsibility for small businesses, a move which ministers said could foreshadow its eventual abolition. At the same time, the DTI would be expected to increase its links with the Training and Enterprise Councils. For its part, the environment department would take from DTI its oversight over urban development corporations and would oversee the Forum for London. The plans increased speculation that Mr Major has sketched out some of the elements of a prospective Cabinet reshuffle if the Conservatives win on April 9. Ministers said that the employment department would probably be given to one of the several women bidding for a place at the Cabinet table. The new arts and heritage department might be offered to Mr John Patten, at present a middle-ranking home office minister, and Mr Michael Heseltine could stay on in his present role at environment. Mr Francis Maude, a Treasury minister, is tipped for the Citizen's Charter job.</p>

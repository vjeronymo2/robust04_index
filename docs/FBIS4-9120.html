			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with anonymous Bosnian Serb Government </F> representative by Fausto Biloslavo in Pale; date not given: "We  Are Getting Ready for the Worst"]    [Text] Pale -- "At this moment it is as if we were on the  edge of a precipice, waiting for NATO to launch a large-scale  attack," a member of the Bosnian Serb Government observes  realistically. He agrees to speak with L'INDIPENDENTE only on  the understanding that he will remain anonymous. "It is  becoming difficult to launch an attack on Gorazde because our  positions are now very close to the Muslims," the minister  reveals. "If they decide to bomb us they could miss the target  and hit their friends. NATO is ready to attack other targets  such as electric power plants, telecommunications centers,  government buildings, and obviously military detachments." An  Gulf-style escalation of the war is therefore emerging.  Meanwhile, in the streets of Pale, the capital of the  self-proclaimed republic of Srpska, the loudspeakers from the  police cars are asking people to donate blood to build up the  stocks in hospitals. "We are getting ready for the worst," the  L'INDIPENDENTE source assures. "We do not have antiaircraft  bunkers for the civilians, but there are plans to evacuate the  people quickly to the hills, far from military objectives, as  our grandparents did during World War II."    Over the past few days, fathers of a certain age and  government personnel are being drafted, even for very short  periods of duty and in the zones behind the front, but in a kind  of general mobilization. "Bosnia is not the Iraqi desert and it  will not be easy to hit us," maintains the Bosnian Serb  government representative. "The NATO pilots rely on computers,  but when they have to find the objective in these impervious  areas, they are obliged to fly at minimal height and at low  speed. At that moment they are vulnerable to our antiaircraft  weapons." According to the minister, NATO has scarce and often  outdated information: "In one raid on Gorazde they hit a  civilian house. A command had in fact been installed there, but  15 days earlier." Another possible NATO target is a series of  bridges on the river Drina dividing Serbia from Bosnia. "They  can forget about cutting off our supplies and logistics by  destroying the bridges," maintains the government source. "We  have several alternatives ready. It would be a psychological  move instead, designed to isolate us from the rest of the world,  but in any case Serbia will not remain neutral in this war."  The Russians instead are viewed with suspicion after Yeltsin's  warning to the Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. The people are  starting to think that their "Slav" friends are turning their  shoulders on them and more than one person, even in government  circles, has made it known "that there are 400 Russians in the  Serbian quarter of Sarajevo. If Moscow were to give the  Americans and the Europeans the go-ahead to bomb us, they would  not be able to escape that quickly without our giving them a  lesson first." On the Serbian side the deadly game with NATO is  being carried out by two people: president Radovan Karadzic [of  the republic of Srpska] is playing the political game using a  carrot, while General Ratko Mladic [commander of the Bosnian  Serb army] is playing the military game using a stick. "Mladic  leads the Serbian forces at Gorazde in person," the  L'INDIPENDENTE source notes. His charisma among the soldiers is  increasing by the hour and this improves the morale of the  troops."    Everybody is wondering whether NATO will also bomb Pale and  the L'INDIPENDENTE source answers: "There are no military  targets here, but there would be a symbolic value in the bombing  of Pale. I am certain that it would be the last card that the  allies could play."</p>

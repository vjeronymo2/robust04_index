			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Juri Luik has returned from his  visit to Sweden. At Tallinn airport he was asked to comment,  among other things, on Estonian-Russian talks.    [Begin Luik recording] [Passage omitted] The Swedish side,  the Swedish Government has provided strong support to Estonia  and Sweden sees this Russian date of 31 August 1994 (?as a  pledge by Russia). This is how the Western countries have  understood this date and the Russian side's proposal. There is  the intention to emphasize this strongly to the Russian side in  front of the international public. The Swedish Government  promised to (?get in touch) with other countries' governments to  rally support on this issue. [passage omitted]    As far as my comment goes, well, if the other party behaves  completely irrationally, the Estonian side has no option but to  behave rationally and calmly. The government will meet, of  course and decide what to do next. But we will continue to hold  the position that 31 August 1994 is in fact [word indistinct] on  the Russian side; a promise to this effect has indeed been made.  Naturally, the Russian side, should it want to do so, can always  withdraw the troops before this date; we have nothing against  that. The situation now is that the talks have, in essence, been  broken off. [passage omitted: The Russian side was to have put  forward a date for the next round but failed to do so] [end  recording]</p>

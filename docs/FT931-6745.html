			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: GUS active A report in the trade press that Great Universal Stores is poised to rekindle its interest in the property market provided the latest hint that liquidity may be returning to the moribund sector. GUS, which has a property investment portfolio worth more than Pounds 600m, was seen as displaying good timing in reducing property activity before the boom years of 1989-90. By apparently expanding again, the group is viewed in some quarters as another harbinger of revival in the commercial property market. The trade report prompted broker Hoare Govett to change its stance on the stock moving from a sell to undervalued. Analyst Ms Emma Burdett said: 'A gradual return to property is a positive move by GUS which will be able to use its cash in something with a good yield at a time of declining interest rates.' She added that the stock had underperformed in the last quarter and the shares were now looking better value. The 'A's closed 13 ahead at 1643p. GUS, which has cash reserves of over Pounds 1bn, played down the report, a spokesman asserting: 'We have no crash programme to invest.' The UK's two leading oil exploration and production (E&amp;P) stocks, Enterprise Oil and Lasmo, were the best performers in the oil sector. One specialist said Lasmo started the ball rolling, moving up strongly after a stock overhang had been cleared and amid vague takeover talk, dragging Enterprise up with it. There were suggestions that Enterprise had been talking to US institutions but that was seen as unlikely as Enterprise is in the 'closed period' and consequently prevented from discussing its trading progress. Enterprise is due to report preliminary figures on March 11. Lasmo closed 7 higher at 8 up at 182p and Enterprise 16 firmer at 476p. Pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments group Fisons, which is expected to show a profit fall to between Pounds 100m and Pounds 120m from 1991's Pounds 190.5m when it reports on Tuesday, slipped 3 to 241p. However, the market expects the dividend to be maintained at 8.7p a share. Glaxo gained 22 to 667p as analysts noted that the US Food and Drug Administration advisory committee was meeting to discuss the company's Serevent asthma drug. The meeting had been known about for some time but investors are expecting good news. There was also some talk that the company might make a bid for Smith &amp; Nephew. The potential link was greeted with disbelief, but there was activity in Smith which rose 5 1/2 to 156p on turnover of 3.9m. A difficult week for the high street banks closed with the sector staging a strong fight back after the bout of downside pressure triggered earlier by higher than expected bad debts at NatWest. Abbey National, reporting on Tuesday and expected to increase the annual dividend in excess of 10 per cent, jumped 10 more to a 398p. Hambros eased a penny to 313p, with one securities house said to have bought a block of 1.9m shares - around 1 per cent of those in issue - at 311 1/2 p and placed them in the market at 313p. Composite insurances showed General Accident 10 up at 569p, despite strong suggestions that a big fund raising could accompany next Tuesday's preliminary results which should see the group reveal losses much reduced at around Pounds 30m, compared with last time's Pounds 171m loss. A 5 per cent rise in the price of Pernod shares in Paris revived old speculation of a bid and rights issue from Allied Lyons. Allied's shares reflected the disinterest for the story in London and rose 2 to 587p. Kingfisher was hounded by a combination of worries over the French economy, a negative press article and profit-taking, all on the back of its recent purchase of Darty, the French electrical retailer. The shares tumbled 12 to 544p. Unilever's post-results run continued, the shares adding 17 to 1225p. There were also reports of switching from the NV into the PLC shares by investors seeking a double dividend. P &amp; O firmed 3 to 549p, with NatWest Securities having recommended the stock. The securities house believes the dividend is secure and said that when the company reports figures towards the end of the month, 'writedowns of land and properties will affect both the results and balance sheets but these will generally be seen as history, whereas the sterling devaluation will confer increasing benefits'. Pearson shares fell 16 before closing 10 down at 381p after a block of about 1.2m shares were sold at 383p overnight.</p>

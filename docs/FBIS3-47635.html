Korea joined the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export Controls (COCOM) in October after establishing a system  according to a memorandum of understanding on exports of  strategic commodities and technical data signed in September  1987.    The exports comprised 100,912,000 dollars of  telecommunications equipment, including computers, 963,000  dollars of machinery, including navigation systems, and 410,000  dollars of materials, including carbon fiber.    Exports to former or current communist countries, including  China, Poland, Russia, Vietnam and Hungary, were less than 19.8  million dollars, or 19.4 percent of the total. The remaining  exports of strategic goods were to Singapore, Germany, Malaysia,  Hong Kong, the United States and Taiwan.    Import certificates issued by the government reached 1,962  million dollars.    The certificates are promises by a company not to export  strategic items that it has purchased, and must be sent to the  seller before he can ship the goods.</p>

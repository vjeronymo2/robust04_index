			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Why the UK can be the world's best tax haven - The catch is that you need to be resident but not domiciled. Caroline Garnham examines the best ways to keep the Revenue at arm's length Some might find it hard to believe - but the UK is the best tax haven in the world if you are resident but not domiciled there. UK legislation takes into account two factors in taxing individuals: Residence, which is determined by how much time you spend in the country. Domicile, a common law concept which has nothing to do with either residence or nationality. In essence, it is the country you consider to be your 'home'. If you are resident in the UK but domiciled elsewhere, you will not have to pay tax on profits - whether income or gains - made abroad unless you bring them into the UK. Nor will you have to pay inheritance tax on any assets or investments you own abroad for the first 16-17 years. Indeed, you can reside in the UK tax-free if you own or earn nothing in the UK; keep all your investments abroad; and bring into the UK only 'pure' capital. That is, money to which neither income nor capital gains made while resident in the UK has been added. There are many ways in which profits can be separated from capital so that they are left offshore, with only the capital brought to the UK. One is for pure capital to be deposited in an offshore bank account (account 1) with all the income mandated to a separate offshore account (account 2). Money can then be brought to the UK from the first account without having to pay income tax. The usual difficulty is finding pure capital. So, the best time for you to do any tax planning is before you arrive in the UK or just after you have received an inheritance or substantial gift. There are some ways in which income can be converted into pure capital. Investment income - such as the interest in account 2 - can be converted if, immediately before the beginning of the tax year on April 6, account 1 is closed down and the money transferred to a new bank account. The interest earned on account 1, which is sitting in account 2, can then be brought into the UK in the new financial year free of income tax. Converting investment income abroad into tax-free sums has been done by many people for many years. But it works only with investment income, not earned income, and then only for those with an eye for detail. One woman, of whom I know, thought she was operating the scheme successfully until the Inland Revenue asked her for proof. It was only then that she discovered her bank offshore had been operating only one account, to which both income and gains had been added regularly. The woman, who had been bringing substantial sums from this account into the UK, had no option but to pay a significant amount of tax plus interest and penalties. If you are lucky enough to be non-UK domiciled but UK resident with substantial funds, it is, usually, easier to set up one or two trusts offshore. The trustees then can be responsible for making sure the income is removed from the trust funds and kept offshore, and that only pure and untaxable capital sums are brought into the UK. The other big advantage, if you benefit from a trust set up by someone not domiciled in the UK, is that all gains made in the trust are tax-exempt - even if they are brought into the UK later. This is true even for gains made in the UK. You might wonder why the law is not changed to catch long-term UK residents who live tax-free. The reasons are simple. The government has admitted that it does not make economic sense to change the law for non-UK domiciled British residents since, for practical purposes, the tax advantages are available only for capital-rich foreigners. And these are just the people the UK wants to attract because they are either big spenders or good profit generators. Thus, it is highly unlikely that these tax laws, unfair though they may be, are likely to be amended by this government or any future administration, irrespective of party.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alfonso Malespin Jiron] </F>   [Text] After inaugurating the seminar entitled "Reflections  on the Democratic Transition," held at the Olof Palme  Conventions Center, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has  rejected the ultimatum issued by rearmed rebels Charro and  Northiel [not further identified] and asked them to "surrender  their weapons and return to civilian life."    Accompanied by Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo, President  Chamorro insisted that the two chiefs stop killing people and  burning trucks, "because if they do not, not even they will be  able to farm anything."    Northiel threatened to burn any vehicle that dares to  operate  in Las Segovias and to murder the drivers in response to what he  called "the government's failure to keep the agreements signed."  Presidency Minister Lacayo denied this. "There is no agreement  with him," Lacayo stated categorically. "They are the ones who  often refuse to hold talks," Chamorro said, referring to the  rebels' demands. "I am always sending the people who have to be  there for talks." During the speech to open this event, which  is hosted by the National Assembly, the president noted: "We  have suffered deeply from the legacy of violence, intolerance,  and confrontation."    During an informal news conference, Chamorro reiterated that  "as long as Violeta is in power, education will continue to be  secular." "Let us respect one another," she noted, referring to  the direct demand by the Nicaraguan Bishops Conference to  include religion in public education. On another matter, the  president criticized the killing of four children in Acoyapa,  Chontales Department, at the hands of two teenagers and affirmed  her support for every antiabortion activity, provided that "a  religious march does not turn political."    According to her, the mass murders are the result of a "lack  of education," but insisted that this situation has to be  overcome. "This is a time to build and a time for children to be  educated. This is no longer the time to kill; this is the time  for reflection," Chamorro noted.</p>

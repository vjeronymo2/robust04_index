			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Elf research crosses channel ELF AQUITAINE, the French oil and chemicals group, is to set up a Geosciences Research Centre in London, writes Clive Cookson. The centre, with 18 researchers and a budget of Pounds 4m a year, will have three related research programmes: in geology, seismics and reservoir engineering. There will be a strong focus on three-dimensional computer modelling, using supercomputers. Elf says the research will be 'open'. Olivier Guillon, manager of the centre, will be looking for collaboration from other oil companies operating in the UK and from university geoscientists. The establishment of the centre is a sign of Elf's efforts to internationalise its research and development activities. At present only 20 per cent of the group's FFr4.3bn (Pounds 430m) a year R&amp;D budget is spent outside France. Contacts: Elf UK: 071 589 4588.</p>

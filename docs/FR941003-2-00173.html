			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> Supplementary Information:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Each existing Trust is organized as a Massachusetts business trust and advised by the Adviser. The Open-End Trusts are registered open-end management investment companies, and the Closed-End Trusts are registered closed-end management investment companies. The Colonial Investment Services division (the ``Distributor'') of the Adviser serves as the principal underwriter of the Open-End Trusts. Certain of the existing Trusts offer multiple series of shares. The term ``Fund'' refers to any series of a Trust, if the Trust offers shares in multiple series, or to a Trust that offers shares only in one series.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The board of trustees <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  of each Fund currently consists of nine persons, eight of whom are not ``affiliated persons'' of the Adviser or the Distributor within the meaning of section 2(a)(3) of the Act. Only the trustees who are not affiliated persons of the Adviser or the Distributor (the ``Eligible Trustees'') are entitled to receive annual fees for their services. The aggregate annual fees are, and are expected to remain, insignificant in comparison to applicants' total net assets. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``trustee,'' as used herein, also refers to directors of a Fund that is organized as a corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It is expected that the aggregate amount payable to all trustees of the Trusts who receive remuneration from the Trusts for their services in 1994 will be $791,000, which would represent .0053% of the Trusts' aggregate net assets as of December 31, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Applicants request relief to permit the Eligible Trustees to elect to defer receipt of all or part of their trustees' fees pursuant to a deferred fee agreement (the ``Agreement'') entered into between each Eligible Trustee and appropriate Fund. Under the Agreement, the Eligible Trustees could defer payment of trustees' fees to defer payment of income taxes or for other reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Under the Agreement, the deferred fees payable by a Fund to a particular Eligible Trustee will be credited to a book reserve account established by the Fund (the ``Deferred Fee Account''), as of the date such fees would have been paid to the Eligible Trustee. Trustees' fees payable for attending board meetings or board committee meetings will be credited to the Deferred Fee Account on the following business day. The value of a Deferred Fee Account shall equal the value such account would have had if the amounts credited to such account had been invested and reinvested in certain designated securities (``Underlying Securities'') as of the date credited. Each Deferred Fee Account shall be credited or charged with book adjustments reflecting all dividends, including interest income and capital gains, and all unrealized gains and losses that would have been earned had the account been investing in such Underlying Securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Underlying Securities will be shares of Funds as agreed to between the applicable board of trustees and the participating trustee. Although a Fund's own shares may serve as an Underlying Security, applicants do not anticipate that a Fund will purchase its own shares. Rather, monies equal to the amount credited to the Deferred Fee Account will be invested along with and in the same securities and proportions as the rest of the Fund's assets. Under existing deferral agreements, certain trustees have deferred receipt of their compensation under an arrangement where the trustee is entitled to receive an amount equal to the value such deferred compensation would have had if it had been invested in U.S. Treasury Bills on the date upon which such compensation otherwise would have been paid to such trustee. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The staff of the Division of Investment Management has stated that it would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action under the Act if registered investment companies establish deferred compensation plans where the rate of return on the deferred compensation is based on the return on U.S. Treasury Bills.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., The North Carolina Cash Management Trust  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> (pub. avail. Jan. 23, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. The obligations of a Fund to make payments to the Deferred Fee Accounts will be general unsecured obligations of the Fund, and payments made pursuant to the Agreement will be made from the Fund's general assets and property. As a matter of risk management, each Fund intends and, with respect to any money market Fund that values its assets by the amortized cost method, undertakes, to purchase and maintain the Underlying Securities in amounts equal to the deemed investment of the Deferred Fee Accounts of its trustees. If a Fund chooses to purchase Underlying Securities to cover its obligations under the Agreement, any and all such Underlying Securities will continue to be a part of the general assets and property of the Fund. Any purchase of Underlying Securities will be made for the benefit of shareholders generally and not for the Eligible Trustees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Under the Agreement, an Eligible Trustee may elect to defer payment of all or part of his or her trustee's fees until (a) The trustee ceases to be a trustee of the Fund, (b) the trustee dies, (c) the dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of the Fund, or the disposition of all of or substantially all of the Fund's assets (unless the Fund's obligations under the Agreement have been assumed by a financially responsible party purchasing such assets), or (d) the merger or consolidation of the Fund (unless, prior to such merger or consolidation, the board of trustees determines that the Agreement shall survive the merger or consolidation). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Payments shall be made in a lump sum or in a number of annual installments, not to exceed ten, elected by the trustee at the time of entering into the Agreement. Each annual payment will be made as of January 31. The trustee's right to receive payments will be nontransferable, except that, in the event of a trustee's death, amounts payable to him or her thereafter will be payable to his or her designated beneficiary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants acknowledge that the requested order would not permit a party acquiring a Fund's assets to assume a Fund's obligations under the Agreement if such assumption of obligations would violate the Act. Accordingly, such assumption would be permitted only if the assuming party is (1) Another Fund, (2) another registered investment company that has received exemptive relief similar to that sought by the application, or (3) not a registered investment company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANTS / MAX JACOBSON;  </P> <P> TRATTORIA PUTS OUT GOOD FARE, AND THERE'S NARY A SIDEWALK IN SIGHT  </P> <P> Hold everything. A trattoria without a sidewalk? The Italian government has  dissolved over less.  </P> <P> Garduno's is a Costa Mesa trattoria struggling to be an Italian sidewalk cafe.  The problem? It's attached to a supermarket complex,and graded asphalt  surrounds the entire building. There isn't an outdoor table or a strolling  musician in sight.  </P> <P> But don't fret. The heart of a good trattoria is behind the kitchen stove. And  Mark and Julie Garduno, an engaging young couple who opened the restaurant 13  months ago, know that. The modest, home-cooked fare they serve has plenty of  richly flavored sauces, finely minced herbs, and occasional surprises. Their  food may not exactly remind you of Mama, but it doesn't remind you of Mama  Celeste, either.  </P> <P> It's a tiny place, really, with about 10 tables covered in  red-and-white-checked cloth and squeezed around a large deli counter. A dark,  terra cotta floor makes the room look even smaller. The long, glass deli case  is filled with marinated salads, imported salami and gooey desserts. Behind it,  Mark and his assistant keep busy in the open kitchen, while Julie takes the  orders and brings the food.  </P> <P> The nice thing about a mom-and-pop restaurant like Garduno's is that the  cooking can be free-form. Instead of matching pastas with sauces like so many  restaurants do, the Garduno's just list all the possibilities of pastas and  sauces and leave the choice to you.  </P> <P> Mark will also custom-make a sauce for you with any combination of things he  has on hand, and, if it strikes his fancy, name it after you. Just think.  Dinner and immortality for one low price.  </P> <P> One thing Mark did for me was customize his garlic bread. It's listed on the  menu as bruschetta, but it's more like a baked loaf with garlic, cheese,  tarragon and a few spices. I asked him to make me one by rubbing the bread with  garlic and pouring olive oil over it. He did, and it was wonderful.  </P> <P> But I'm not implying that you should get too fancy with the guy -- most of his  pastas are already too good to pass up. Each pasta dish is made to order with  sauces such as pesto, arrabbiata and vongole, and they are worth the wait. I  adored a chewy linguine with a creamy carbonara, loaded with fresh peas, bits  of pancetta (Italian bacon) and sauteed mushrooms. Fusilli (twirly spirals of  pasta) is terrific paired in the chunky, tomato-based sauce listed as salsiccia  -- it's made with big pieces of meaty Italian sausage.  </P> <P> Al forno pastas (oven-baked) are the opposite of lite beer: more filling. And  they don't taste great. Maybe it's because some -- the cannelloni, for instance  -- are kept in a steam table. My cannelloni came stuffed with minced veal and  spinach that had seen better days by the time I tasted it. Maybe it simply had  been sitting too long. The steam-table lasagna looked better -- it must have  been a foot high, and people at the next table were talking it up with vigor.  Next time.  </P> <P> Besides pasta, a full Italian menu is served, including creations from the chef  that change daily. Appetizers such as mussels and clams in a cioppino-style  stew are excellent, as is the insalata caprese, fresh tomato and basil with  bufala mozzarella. A thick three-bean soup served with most entrees is full of  oregano, thyme and other intoxicating spices. And Julie is pretty proud of the  restaurant's scarola, a hot vegetable dish of escarole, spinach and romaine  sauteed together with garlic and served hot. It is so light and fragrant that  it is almost like a Chinese vegetable dish. It makes a good complement to veal  or other heavily sauced dishes.  </P> <P> Even better is the group of dishes Garduno calls secondo piatto (or second  dish), usually listed on the blackboard above the counter. On any given day,  there will be sun-dried tomatoes, fresh artichoke, porcini mushrooms and other  Italian delicacies incorporated into original dishes using pork, sea bass or  whatever the chef has on hand. I had a puff pastry with layers of meats and  vegetables called torta Siciliana -- in homage to the Garduno Sicilian  background. The dish is heavier than torta rustica of Northern Italy, with more  lingering tastes. I wouldn't say it works.  </P> <P> Best from the regular menu might be the vitello al limone, tender, white veal  in a slightly thick sauce made from lemon, butter and capers. Pass on the  involtini di pollo, or stuffed chicken breast. Mine was mostly stuffing (in  fact the same stuffing in the cannelloni), and it too had come from the steam  table. If you insist on chicken, order the pollo paesana, a saute with fresh  peppers, onion and peas. Think of this dish as Italian-style fajitas.  </P> <P> Because Southern Italian cooking can be substantial, one would expect the  desserts to be light. Not here. Julie's sister makes the cheesecakes, and they  are terrific. I liked the caramel pecan variation best. There is a fine, rummy  tirami su, but I found it so rich that two bites seemed an indulgence. Some  store-bought cannoli, horns of cheese dough filled with a custardy cream made  by the chef, are about the lightest sweet on hand. Better find a long sidewalk  and head down it after your cappuccino.  </P> <P> Garduno's is moderately priced. Antipastos are $1.75 to $6.95. Pastas are  priced from $6.95 to $10.95 (oven-baked pastas are all $6.95). Main dishes are  $9.95 to $13.95, and include soup or salad, and pasta.  </P> <P> GARDUNO'S RISTORANTE ITALIANO  </P> <P> 298 E. 17th.

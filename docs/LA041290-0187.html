			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> ELECTRICITY RATES RAISED  </P> <P> Despite objections from city residents to a proposed electric rate increase,  the new power prices were approved by the Board of Directors after a public  hearing Tuesday evening and a second vote Wednesday morning.  </P> <P> Under the new rates, a typical single-family home using 400 kilowatt hours of  electricity a month would pay $35.42, a $1.96 increase from the current $33.46  charge. A commercial customer using 2,000 kilowatt hours per month and now  paying $173.90 would pay $187.15.  </P> <P> The increase, which takes effect Friday, will enable the city-run electric  utility to partially fund a two-year, $39.8-million capital improvement  program.  </P> <P> Residents who objected called the rate hikes unfair, saying oil prices have  been declining and electric rates should decline correspondingly.  </P></p>

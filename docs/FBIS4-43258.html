			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mariano Guindal: "Government Says That It Will </F> Be Possible To Create 1,000 Net Jobs Per Day Over Next Two  Years"]    [Text] Madrid -- Minister of the Presidency Alfredo Perez  Rubalcaba stated following the cabinet meeting yesterday that  2,000 net jobs per day were created in May, according to the  initial figures supplied by the National Employment Institute  (INEM). According to him, Social Security has had 105,638 more  contributors in the first five months of the year than at the  end of 1993.    The government believes that this good performance by the  labor market will continue in June. This could offset the  adverse impact on employment that the entry of young people into  the labor market on completing their education traditionally  has. Last June, unemployment grew by 35,000, and the estimates  at the Labor Ministry's disposal forecast that this figure will  be offset.    Rubalcaba stated the the government anticipates that job  creation will be consolidated as economic growth improves. Over  the next few weeks, the government will study the new plan for  convergence with Europe, which forecasts economic growth of 1.3  percent for 1995 and twice as much for 1996, reaching 3.5  percent in 1996 [year as published].    This growth of GDP suggests that 1,000 net jobs per day  could  be created over the next two years. "That is why this assertion  by the labor minister is something more than an election  slogan," Rubalcaba stated.    The minister said that the cabinet received with great  satisfaction the Community's assistance for the development of  the most backward Spanish regions, totaling 4 trillion pesetas.  "If the cohesion funds are added to the structural funds, it  can be said that Spain will receive 6 trillion pesetas from  Europe between 1994 and 1999."    These resources will have a direct impact on job creation,  "and this has been included in the convergence program, whose  revision will be presented in Brussels in July."    Rubalcaba stated that the structural funds have three aims  --  to improve the production system, train human resources, and  create water and power infrastructures -- although he said that  the construction of transport infrastructures, which was the  previous program's aim, will slacken. Some 77 percent of  Spanish territory and 66 percent of the population, which falls  within the so-called first objective, will benefit from this  assistance.    The minister explained that "the aim is to promote public  investment in the most disadvantaged regions and their gradual  alignment with the Community average." These investments total  7.58 trillion pesetas, half of which will be contributed by  Europe and the remainder by the Spanish Government.    Andalusia is the autonomous community that benefits most,  with 28.8 percent of the funds; Galicia has 13.7 percent;  Castilla and Leon, 12 percent; Valencia, 11.2 percent;  Castilla-La Mancha, 8 percent; the Canary Islands, 6.8 percent;  and the remainder is shared out by Asturias, Cantabria, Murcia,  and Ceuta and Melilla.    Most of these funds -- 34.3 percent -- will be earmarked for  developing human resources and improving the quality of life  through vocational training programs and environmental projects.  Some 33 percent will be earmarked for improving the production  system, with programs to assist industry, tourism, fisheries,  and research. Some 24.8 percent will be earmarked for transport  infrastructures, while 7.9 percent will be invested in water and  energy.    With respect to Seat [automobile enterprise], the minister  stated that, although this is not scheduled, it is not ruled out  that Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl will discuss this problem during the summit that they are  to hold next Monday [6 June]. He emphasized that "Seat is not  in danger," and stressed that "Volkswagen has never proposed  winding up the make." He stated that "the Spanish Government  will help to seek a solution and to save as many jobs as  possible."</p>

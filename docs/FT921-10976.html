			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Tatar Republic in accord to build ICL computers MIDRANGE computers designed by ICL, the UK-based manufacturer owned by Fujitsu of Japan, will be built in the Tatar Republic under terms agreed last week by Mr Muhanmat Sabirov, the prime minister, and Mr Peter Bonfield, ICL chairman. The agreement commits the Tatar Republic, an autonomous republic within the Russian federation, to financing the import of ICL computer components between 1992 and 1994. The components will be assembled into ICL's advanced 'Risc' computers by ICL-KMECS, a joint venture which ICL established last year in the republic with the Kazan Manufacturing Enterprise of Computer Systems (KMECS). KMECS was the second largest supplier of computers in the former Soviet Union, manufacturing Soviet-designed 'Riad' mainframe systems. Since the fall of the union, local computer manufacture has collapsed. So far the ICL-KMECS venture has been a distributor of fully assembled systems. The computers to be built in Kazan will be sold and supported throughout the former Soviet Union, ICL said. Established there for over 25 years, ICL was in 1968 the first western information technology company to be accredited to establish a Moscow office. The machines will be of 'open systems' design based on advanced processing chips and the Unix operating system.</p>

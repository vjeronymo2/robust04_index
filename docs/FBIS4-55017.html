			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 7 KYODO -- A two-day East-West economic  and trade conference was set to close Saturday [7 May] after  adopting a statement summarizing its discussions on cooperation  to promote the transition of the former Soviet Union and its  East European allies to market economies.    Discussions in the final-day session centered on government  policies to promote economic reforms in the region and measures  to close regional economic gaps, conference sources said. The  participants also exchanged views on a declaration, adopted by  business executives at a business forum Friday, calling for 200  billion dollars of direct foreign investment in the region by  the year 2000, they said.    Present at the discussions on Saturday morning were  ministers  in charge of economic, industrial and trade affairs and business  representatives from the Group of Seven (G-7) major  industrialized nations and 10 countries of Eastern Europe and  former Soviet republics, they said. The declaration also called  for the privatization of state-run enterprises in the 10  countries and promotion of East-West trade, they said.    Eijiro Hata, Japan's minister of international trade and  industry, told a ministerial-level session in the afternoon that  Japan will cooperate to promote industrial development in the  region. In connection with this, Hata said Tokyo will hold  seminars in Moscow and Warsaw in late September to help promote  the development of smaller enterprises, foreign trade and  investment. Hata also said Japan will conduct surveys in two  former East-bloc countries, including Poland, in 1994 and 1995  to work out measures to overcome the economic recession.    The United States is likely to be selected as the site for  the next session in 1995, the sources said.</p>

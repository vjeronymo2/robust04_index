			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: State Farm confident on quake costs State Farm, the US insurer with the biggest exposure to January's Californian earthquake, is unlikely to adjust substantially its Dollars 600m estimate of losses from the disaster. The group said yesterday it did not expect to have to change the figure much. Other insurers have greatly increased their estimates of losses in recent days, putting the total costs of the earthquake to the insurance industry at as much as Dollars 4bn, roughly the same as the costs of Hurricane Hugo. Allstate, the second-largest issuer of homeowners' insurance policies in the state, raised its estimate of its losses from Dollars 350m to Dollars 600m on Monday. State Farm said it had already carried out detailed inspections on around 90 per cent of the claims it had received. These had revealed damage which was broadly in line with what it had estimated.</p>

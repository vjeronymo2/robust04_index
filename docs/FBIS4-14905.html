			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS--NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the  visit of U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to Moscow:    "The U.N. chief's three main meetings with President Boris  Yeltsin, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev were notable for an abundance of gratitude  lavished by the sides on each other. The deservedness of such  lavishness cannot conceal a certain difference in their points  of view on approach to peacemaking problems".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA quotes Russian Defence Minister Pavel  Grachev  as saying that "Articles 51-55 of the U.N. Charter, in  particular, allow peacemaking activities on a regional scale.  If the conflict in Rwanda is being settled by the United  Nations organisation, the one in Haiti by the Organisation of  American States, why not legalise the activities of a collective  peacemaking force of the countries that are parties to a  collective security treaty within the CIS framework?".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI quotes the U.N. secretary-general as  saying  that "Russia is a great power and a permanent member of the U.N.  Security Council. We hope that it will contribute to enhancing  the role of the United Nations in the international arena  subsequently as well".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports that a white paper about the  October 1993 events in Moscow is being prepared for publication.  It is a question of selecting materials about both the events  on the October days proper and the preceding developments--the  meeting of the Supreme Soviet (parliament), the last congress,  official decrees...    "Work on a documentary version of the book has been almost  completed. This version will be put out in a small print run  intended mainly for scientific workers.    "A documentary-and-publicistic version of the book is still  in the works and will have a much larger print run".    PRAVDA carries an interview with former Russian  Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy who makes an estimate of the  October 1993 events. In response to correspondents' questions,  Rutskoy made it clear once again that he does not intend to quit  the political stage.    "To quit politics now would mean to betray first of all  those  people who believe me," Rutskoy emphasised.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA runs an interview with Federal Council  Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko.    Touching upon the possibility of creating a community or a  union on confederative principles on the territory of the former  Soviet Union, Shumeyko pointed out as follows: "I consider it  possible to establish an integrated community of states, which  can be done on the basis of the existing CIS institutions, not  to recreate the Soviet Union as it was prior to perestroyka."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with director of  the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin.  Touching upon the outflow of scientific ideas, high  technologies and advanced systems of armaments and military  hardware from Russia, Stepashin said "the country in the near  future may lose its lead in the development of fundamental and  applied research, lose many scientific schools and highly  skilled personnel, and suffer considerable and, in point of  fact, irreplaceable material damage."    "Calculations done by Russian Science Ministry according to  U.N. methods indicate that if a specialist emigrates, the  country loses about 300,000 U.S. dollars. Russia may suffer a  potential damage of about 20,000 million dollars every year as a  result of emigration."    TRUD frontpages an article about the supply of substandard  and quite often tainted foodstuffs to the Russian market from  abroad.    "In the first quarter of the year alone, the state trade  inspectorate rejected almost 60 percent of examined meat  products and sausages, more than 70 percent of alcoholic drinks,  and over 40 percent of tea and coffee.    "The inspectorate checked and found unfit for consumption  all  imported dairy products that were on sale in Tula and Orenburg  regions, Maritime territory, and the republics of Mariy-El and  Tatarstan".</p>

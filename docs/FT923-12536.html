			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: European markets rally as rise is confined to discount rate EUROPEAN government bond markets rose sharply yesterday following the Bundesbank's decision to raise the discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 8.75 per cent, but fell back later in the day as dealers sold into the rally. Most markets were braced for a rise in the Lombard rate, which sets German money market interest rates and would have increased tensions within the European monetary system. Although the rise in the discount rate was more vigorous than expected, the move was seen as unlikely to lead to higher interest rates throughout the community. German government paper showed strong gains immediately after the rate rise was announced. On the London International Financial Futures Exchange, the September bund future rose from 87.74 at the opening to hit a high of 88.01 before falling back. During late afternoon the market slid as dealers sold paper into the rally. The September contract closed at 87.63, down on the day. Volume was strong at 65,000 contracts. There was hectic trading at the shorter end of the yield curve as investors re-assessed the outlook for German interest rates. Bundesbank officials said the discount rate was unlikely to fall below 8 per cent this year. Liffe saw record trading volume in its three-month D-Mark interest rate future. The Italian Treasury responded to the Bundesbank action by raising its discount rate. The Belgian authorities also tightened monetary conditions. Italian government bonds closed slightly higher on the day, with the benchmark 10-year fixed-rate bond closing on a yield of 13.47 per cent. The biggest losses were seen in the French market, which rallied in the morning session as traders speculated that the Bundesbank would leave monetary conditions unchanged. The benchmark 8.5 per cent OAT maturing 2002 closed down around  1/4 of a point, for a yield of 8.85 per cent. THE UK government bond market was one of only a few European markets to retain the best of the day's gains and long-dated gilts closed around 1/3 of a point higher. During the morning, the market was encouraged by average earnings statistics which showed wages growing at an annualised rate of 6.5 per cent during May, from 7 per cent in April. Analysts said the data suggested soft labour market conditions were slowing wage growth and suggested an improving inflation outlook. The 9 per cent gilt maturing 2008 closed up  9/32 of a point on the day at 96.31, for a yield of 8.86 per cent. However, with shorter maturities the gains were smaller. The benchmark 10-year stock, the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2002, closed up  5/32 of a point for a yield of 9.05 per cent. Short dated stocks were held back by lingering concerns that the UK government may still be forced to raise interest rates. Interbank money was last night trading over 10 per cent, the level of base lending rates, from one month to one year. However, government officials moved to support sterling in the foreign exchange markets by repeating the commitment to enter a narrow band within the European exchange rate mechanism at a central rate of DM2.95. AFTER posting losses in the morning on news of the rise in German interest rates and a sharp fall in weekly jobless claims, US Treasury prices bounced amid short covering and strong demand for longer-dated issues. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/8 at 104 15/32 , yielding 7.610 per cent. The two-year note was also higher, up  1/32 at 101 7/16 to carry a yield of 4.208 per cent. Treasury prices fell early on after the Bundesbank raised its discount rate. Although the German central bank kept the more important Lombard rate unchanged, the increase in the discount rate was larger than expected, and investors sold Treasuries in the wake of a further widening in the differential between German and US rates and fresh declines in the already weak dollar. News of a 15,000 decline in weekly jobless claims added to the gloom, but during the afternoon dealers covering short positions and buying of 30-years, which have lagged the market recently, brought prices back into positive territory. JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly higher overnight in Tokyo, supported by a stronger yen on the foreign exchange markets. The benchmark government bond issue No 129 closed the day on a yield of 5.17 per cent, from 5.195 at the opening.</p>

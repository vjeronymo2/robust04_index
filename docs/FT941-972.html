			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Protesting Kurds leave Mannheim Up to 10,000 Kurdish demonstrators began pulling out of Mannheim yesterday after German police offered to release detained Kurds if protesters dispersed, Reuter reports. Police said between 7,000 and 10,000 Kurds had ignored a ban and got past police road blocks to rally in the southwestern city at a wake for two Kurdish women who set themselves ablaze in protest at German arms sales to Turkey. They waved banners charging Bonn with complicity in 'Turkey's war of genocide in Kurdistan', shouted anti-Turkish slogans and punched the air with victory signs. Police used scores of water cannon to try to disperse the protesters.</p>

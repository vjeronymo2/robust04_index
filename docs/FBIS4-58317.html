			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Expanded Opposition Conference </F> Reviews Position on Baghdad"]    [Excerpt] London, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Unified  Iraqi National Congress held an expanded meeting to study the  position on the Iraqi scene and review the position of Iraqi  opposition organizations. Elsewhere, it has been announced in  Baghdad that senior Iraqi officials have joined a new military  and political organization called the "Saddamites Union" led by  the Iraqi president's son 'Udayy.    The National Congress (the Iraqi opposition's main  apparatus)  held an expanded meeting in its headquarters in Salah al-Din,  north Iraq, last Tuesday. A statement issued by the congress, a  copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has received, said that the  meeting was attended by Mas'ud Barzani and Major General Hasan  al-Naqib, members of the congress' presidential council, in  addition to the chairman of the executive council and a number  of its members and some members of the consultative  constitutional council and the national society. The meeting  discussed critical domestic conditions, ways of bringing about  change, international developments affecting the Iraqi scene,  and ways of toppling the dictatorial regime in Baghdad.    The congress' statement pointed out that the meeting  condemned the regime's repressive practices, which have been  stepped up recently in the center and the south. [passage  omitted]</p>

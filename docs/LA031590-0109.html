			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARTY CHIEF LINKED TO SECRET POLICE QUITS;  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY: THE KOHL-BACKED LEADER ADMITS THE CHARGES. A CROWD AT A CAMPAIGN  RALLY IS STUNNED BY THE NEWS.  </P> <P> An election rally of about 200,000 East Germans here was stunned Wednesday with  news that one of their leaders had worked for the Communist secret police.  </P> <P> The crowd, which had gathered in a buoyant mood to hear West German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl deliver a rousing speech in this, the cradle for East Germany's  revolution, was instead told by a preliminary speaker that Wolfgang Schnur,  head of one of the three parties in the Kohl-backed Alliance of Germany, had  resigned after admitting links with the security apparatus, known as the Stasi.  </P> <P> Schnur, who has been confined to a sick bed in recent days, had previously  denied a series of accusations claiming he had worked as an informant for the  hated Stasi, as well as passing information to West German intelligence.  </P> <P> "I have to tell you a very sad and serious thing," Oswald Wutzke, general  secretary of Schnur's party, Democratic Awakening, told the crowd. "Wolfgang  Schnur has resigned from his position because he has admitted that part of the  allegations against him are true.  </P> <P> "Wolfgang Schnur has unfortunately done the same thing as God knows how many  other East German citizens," Wutzke added. "It just proves how bad things  were."  </P> <P> Kohl did not refer to Schnur during his address. But he told a news conference  just before the rally that it was neither correct nor possible to withhold what  he termed "such serious information" just before a national election, which is  scheduled for Sunday.  </P> <P> He expressed solidarity with the Democratic Awakening party.  </P> <P> Schnur, a lawyer from the northern port of Rostock, defended well-known  opponents of the former neo-Stalinist East German regime and was widely viewed  as a man of personal courage.  </P> <P> Many innocent East Germans were blackmailed into informing on fellow citizens  during the Communist era.  </P> <P> How the affair will affect the moderate right-wing alliance is unclear. In  interviews after the rally, several citizens admitted they were shocked by the  announcement but said they will still vote for one of the alliance parties.  </P> <P> "This election isn't about personalities, it's about unification," stated  Werner Schramm, a locksmith.  </P> <P> The announcement took the edge off what was to have been a triumphant farewell  appearance for Kohl on the East German campaign trail. The crowd's original  upbeat mood reflected a strong surge by the Alliance for Germany in the final  days of the campaign.  </P> <P> Local residents and city officials described the crowd as both larger and more  spirited than at a Social Democratic Party rally last month at which former  West German Chancellor Willy Brandt spoke.  </P> <P> While early opinion polls had indicated a commanding lead for the Social  Democrats, more recent surveys have shown the Alliance for Germany roughly  even, with a sizable minority still undecided.  </P></p>

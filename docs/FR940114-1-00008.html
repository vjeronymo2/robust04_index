Ordinarily, FO loans will not be secured by chattels. However, loans will be secured by chattels as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A first lien will be taken on equipment or fixtures purchased or refinanced with loan funds whenever such property cannot be included in the real estate lien and the additional security is needed to secure the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Chattel security will be obtained when there is not enough real estate security for the loan and the best lien obtainable on all real estate has been taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same borrower. Therefore, junior liens on chattels may be taken when there is enough equity in the property. However, when possible, a first lien on selected chattel items should be obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Chattel security liens will be obtained and kept effective, as provided in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other security <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1) A pledge of real estate by a third party may be taken as security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the applicant is not adequate to secure the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Other property may be taken as additional security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender value of life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart B_Direct Soil and Water Loan Policies, Procedures and Authorizations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Section 1943.69 is amended by removing paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(4), and (c)(1); redesignating current paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(8) as paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(7) respectively; redesignating current paragraph (b)(5) as paragraph (b)(4); redesignating current paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) as paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) respectively; revising the introductory paragraph, paragraph (a)(1), newly redesignated paragraph (a)(2), paragraph (c) introductory text, and newly redesignated paragraph (c)(1) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1943.69  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Security.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each SW loan will be secured by real estate. Chattels and/or other security also may be taken as security. The total amount of security required will be the lesser of 150 percent of the loan amount, or all real estate owned by the applicant. A loan will be considered adequately secured when the real estate security for the loan is at least equal to the loan amount. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land. In unusual cases, the loan approval official may require a cosigner as defined in &sect;1910.3(d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter or a pledge of security from a third party. A pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) *&blank;*&blank;* (1) A mortgage will be taken on all real estate refinanced or improved with SW funds, and by any additional real estate security needed to meet the requirements of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Security will also include items which are considered part of the farm and ordinarily pass with the title to the farm, such as, but not limited to assignments of leases or leasehold interests having mortgageable value, water rights, easements, rights-of-way, revenues, and royalties from mineral rights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chattel security <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Loans will be secured by chattels when there is not adequate real estate security for the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The loan will be secured by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A first lien on all property acquired, improved, or refinanced with loan funds; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the security for the loan is not at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount, the best lien obtainable will be taken on other chattel security owned by the applicant, up to the point that security for the loan equals 150 percent of the loan amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1945_EMERGENCY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. The authority citation for part 1945 is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  5 U.S.C. 301; 7 U.S.C. 1989; 42 U.S.C. 1480; 7 CFR 2.23 and 2.70.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Emergency Loan Policies, Procedures and Authorizations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Section 1945.169 is amended by redesignating current paragraphs (b) through (n) as paragraphs (d) through (p), respectively; revising paragraph (a), and adding a new introductory paragraph and paragraphs (b) and (c) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1945.169  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Security.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each EM loan will be secured by chattels, real estate, and/or other security and nonessential assets in accordance with this section. The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same borrower. Thus, a junior lien on property serving as collateral for a guaranteed loan(s) is acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

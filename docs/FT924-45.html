			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Ready for the split Border country: the sign is already in place outside the northern Slovak town of Cadca, ready for the split of Slovakia from the Czech republic at midnight tonight. Cadca intends to celebrate by hoisting the national flag, singing the national anthem and letting off fireworks, but its population is divided on independence. Some people fear a grim awakening after the party. Report, Page 2.</p>

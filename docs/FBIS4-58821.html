			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hizballah has issued the following statement in  response to the enemy's demands calling for striking at the  Resistance forces in the south and in the occupied territories:    The conditions set by the enemy leaders and their demand to  disarm the Resistance whether in the south or in the occupied  territories reveal the extent of the enemy's concern over the  effectiveness of the Resistance and its fighters in dealing  blows to the enemy's security status and occupation presence.    Although the enemy's conditions reveal a blatant Zionist  intransigence that is politically and militarily supported by  the United States, they demonstrate the reality of the enemy's  chaos and confusion. The Zionist leaders have been diligently  trying to convince their settlers that they can play  simultaneously the games of force, negotiation, and superiority  under the slogan of security that is unshakable and invincible.    The statement adds: While these conditions demonstrate the  increasing Zionist deadlock, the enemy might yet try to end this  deadlock through the readiness of some parties to discuss these  conditions, as happened in the case of the representatives of  the Palestinian Islamic Resistance in Jordan.    The statement believes that the enemy's conditions are aimed  at making the Arab countries play the role of police in  defending its security without changing its policy of aggression.    The statement reiterates Hizballah's outright rejection of  these conditions and calls for confronting them firmly and  forcibly. The statement warns against suspicious voices that  are trying to depict the recent confrontations in the south and  the subsequent Zionist-Lahdist attacks as internal feuding and  sectarian sedition.    The statement adds that the bombardment of Sidon and the  atrocities against the inhabitants of 'Aramta represent a  Zionist criminal act. The killing of some Lahdist agents by the  Resistance men is only a link in the chain of the honorable  national responsibilities and duties. [passage omitted]</p>

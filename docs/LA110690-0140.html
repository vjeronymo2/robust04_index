			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC BENEFACTOR: ONE IN A MILLION;  </P> <P> ENDOWMENT: MERLE BENSINGER AND HIS DESIRE TO SHARE SURVIVED AN ORPHANAGE  UPBRINGING, CEREBRAL PALSY, DISCRIMINATION AND THE STRUGGLE FOR AN EDUCATION.  </P> <P> Merle Bensinger is sitting in a motorized armchair in his Sacramento home,  talking about an extraordinary subject -- his life.  </P> <P> There is his childhood spent in a Dickensian orphanage in the 20th-Century  Midwest; Tom Sawyer-esque flights; episodes of riding freight trains and  punching out bullies; marriage, divorce and a child; a 42-year career as a  psychologist; and, this fall, a rare, million-dollar endowment of a  professorship at the USC's Ethel Percy Andrus Gerontology Center.  </P> <P> Threading through the erratic drama is the fact that since birth Bensinger has  had cerebral palsy.  </P> <P> In noted autobiographical works, writers with cerebral palsy have driven home  the point that they are as cantankerous, randy, talented and complex as the  able-bodied.  </P> <P> Daniel Day-Lewis swilled and slugged through last year's Academy-Award-winning  portrayal of Irish writer Christy Brown in the film, "My Left Foot," drawn  largely from Brown's book "Down All the Days." In Britain's award-winning novel  "Under the Eye of the Clock," the severely handicapped writer, Christopher  Nolan, calls his principal character "crippled" not disabled, and candidly  describes his physical limitations.  </P> <P> So, too, Bensinger describes the vicissitudes of his 71 years without burdening  his story with morals or messages. His narration is blunt and brisk, recounted  in a voice so purposeful his words could be blown out from a bellows.  </P> <P> Occasionally, as he stops to draw a drink through a straw, an errant spasm  betrays his faulty muscle coordination. He holds out his right hand, showing  how his fingers uncontrollably clench, and rests his feet, bare from his  morning's whirlpool session, on the floor. Walking has always been a  problematic means of locomotion. A nearby snapshot shows Bensinger standing  outdoors, his arms outspread for balance like the wings of an airplane in a  sharply banking turn.  </P> <P> Keen-eyed and grizzled, he is an outdoors-lover who rides his wheelchair into  the back yard of his suburban ranch-style house, supervising the weeding of his  vegetable garden and pruning his roses.  </P> <P> "He drives us hard, the same way he drives himself," says June Knedel, who has  served as his secretary and factotum for 28 years.  </P> <P> In the beginning, however, Bensinger had no motivating force, not even a family  name he could count on.  </P> <P> "My mother had me in a foundling home," he explains. "She went across the  river. My father and she weren't married. They had three children. She had to  adopt us out."  </P> <P> Hiding the shame of her pregnancy, his mother left her Kentucky home to live in  Evansville, Ind., where she worked in a cigar-wrapping factory until her son  was born in April 1919.  </P> <P> When he was 6 months old, Bensinger was adopted "the first time," he says. But  his adoptive mother, Sara Biery, developed tuberculosis, and her husband, a  mechanic for the Franklin motor car, deserted her. Bensinger was again put up  for adoption, this time in the Knox County Orphanage in Vincennes, Ind. After  six months he was claimed, this second time by Commodore and Leona Bensinger.  Bensinger worked in a restaurant by day and by night labored in the coal mines  outside Vincennes. But in less than a year, this second home fell apart when  Leona Bensinger ran off with a traveling salesman.  </P> <P> His adoptive father was taking care of both Bensinger and a little girl the  family had also taken in.  </P> <P> "I remember he would leave me in bed and hold me until I fell asleep because I  was afraid of being alone," Bensinger recalls of these moments when he was less  than 2 years old. Later his adoptive father was obliged to board the children  out; but "he said people would mistreat us, so he put us back in the  orphanage."  </P> <P> At the time Bensinger was not yet 3 years old.  </P> <P> "He could only visit one day a month, the last Thursday. He'd bring me candy  and cowboy suits.  </P> <P> "I used to cry a lot for my father because he was the only person alive I  knew."  </P> <P> His adoptive father did not understand why spasms coursed through his son's  muscles or why he could not walk. "He didn't know I had cerebral palsy and  neither did Aunt Sara, my first adopted mother. They didn't know what cerebral  palsy was back in those days. They thought I had polio."  </P> <P> As a youngster, Bensinger was pulled to school in a wagon by his classmates.  When he was 6, he underwent experimental surgery to help him walk. Nerves  connected to his inner thigh muscles were severed, and for almost a year he lay  with his legs strapped up on each side of his bed. "I could see these little  kids up on a hill playing with their goats and their dogs and I thought, 'Oh,  when I get back to the orphanage and put my bare feet in the sand and dirt,  I'll feel so good.' "  </P> <P> Bensinger returned to the orphanage with a cowboy gait, swinging out his hips  as he moved. Still, by the seventh grade he was covering the mile to school by  himself. "I'd run and fall and run and fall," he says. One day he was arrested  by a police officer who mistakenly believed he was drunk. The orphanage was not  a place that coddled cripples, and Bensinger was a lightning rod for bullies on  the playground. Holding onto the iron fence that surrounded the schoolyard, he  would slug them back. "I'd get bloody noses and black eyes. Then the other kids  would join in. But I always had to be punished first."  </P> <P> When he was about 13 years old, Bensinger ran away with two other boys. "We  wanted to go down the Wabash River into the Ohio River and the Mississippi and  down to New Orleans like Huckleberry Finn," Bensinger says.  </P> <P> Living on raw sweet corn from the fields, wild blackberries and the fish they  caught, they slept under the stars as they made their way by hitchhiking and  riding the freights, the companions Bensinger aboard the moving cars. After  swiping a rowboat, they were heading down the Ohio River when they got caught.  </P> <P> They had asked for a handout of food from a night watchman at a flour mill in  southern Indiana. He gave them some stale bread and syrup and tried to sexually  molest them, Bensinger says. When the boys refused, he called the police.  </P> <P> Bensinger's two companions were sent to reform school, while he was returned to  the orphanage.  </P> <P> In his sophomore year at Vincennes High School, Bensinger received the DAR Good  Citizenship Award and honors as the outstanding history student. Teetering to  the rostrum to accept the awards on Commencement Day, he slipped on the  polished gymnasium floor and had to crawl the remainder of the way.  </P> <P> "I was embarrassed. They thought I was brave," he says.  </P> <P> Soon afterwards, the orphan again fled his hated confines, this time selling  newspapers and magazines on the streets of Vincennes and living in back alleys.  </P> <P> "I was lost in my soul. I had too many sets of parents. I had too many things  happening to me," Bensinger says, his voice briefly cracking.  </P> <P> This time the orphanage did not try to get the 16-year-old rebel back. After a  year on the streets, Bensinger began a long uphill ascent, leaning on the  shoulders of a series of social workers and academicians determined to see him  succeed.  </P> <P> After an IQ test confirmed his intelligence, he was persuaded to enter the  National Youth Authority training center connected with the University of  Indiana, where he completed his remaining two years of high school in a single  year and entered the university.  </P> <P> Intermittently taking time out from college, he worked on a cooperative farm  run by Goodwill Industries in Massachusetts' Berkshire Hills, doing such odd  jobs as spraying the apple orchards and mending fences. He helped juvenile  delinquents in Indiana's inner city and did a stint as a radio disc jockey on  the swing shift.  </P> <P> Transferring to Whittier College, he majored in psychology and sociology,  receiving his B.A. degree in 1946, and, with scholarships to USC, earned his  masters in psychology in 1948.  </P> <P> But in college, his hardships continued. "When I wrote I would break my pencil  because I had to bear down so hard. I developed a real good memory."  </P> <P> At USC, he met Olga Youngberg, a music student from Nebraska, whom he married  six weeks afterward. "She helped me type. I was real lonely." Fourteen months  later their son, Larry, was born, and the couple took turns looking after him.  "I could do everything but change the diapers, because I couldn't use the  safety pins."  </P> <P> Following graduation, the pair took jobs on a Navajo reservation in Arizona,  over 100 miles from the nearest town. After losing their second son in  childbirth, they resigned their posts and Bensinger was hired as a staff  psychologist at Norfolk State Mental Hospital in Nebraska. Two years later, he  decided on an easier life in California's clement climate, and, carrying a  letter of recommendation from the hospital's superintendent, he began job  hunting in high spirits.  </P> <P> Months later, he summed up 30 or so interviews to a journalist: "Some of them  have been franker than others. There was one man who called me and seemed  enthusiastic about my qualifications. I asked him if he knew of my handicap and  he said he did and we set up an appointment.  </P> <P> "When I walked into his office he stared at me and said, 'Why you're much worse  than I thought,' and, of course, that was really the end of the interview."  </P> <P> From eeking out a living doing part-time counseling therapy in positions found  through newspaper ads, Bensinger began working as a school psychologist and  marriage/family counselor, and gradually built up his own business in  Sacramento. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower awarded him a national  citation for outstanding service with physically and emotionally handicapped  people, and for decades he helped patients who suffered from conditions ranging  from schizophrenia to typical adolescent Angst.  </P> <P> In 1985, Bensinger retired after breaking his foot and being confined to a  wheelchair. He has been divorced for years and lives with a white Alaskan dog,  Jeffrey, and a cat saved from the animal pound. His son, Larry, 42, is a  housing contractor in Hartford, Conn., where he lives with his wife and two  children.  </P> <P> The road to the comfort of his suburban house has been hard. "As I look back  over it, that's the way life is," he says. "Sometimes you have to suffer. The  only thing is, you have to have enough experience and knowledge to learn from  your suffering rather than becoming embittered by it. If you get embittered  you're a lost soul."  </P> <P> Now Bensinger wants to help older people like himself lead full, creative lives  by establishing the Merle H. Bensinger Professorship in Gerontology.  </P> <P> "I think he wanted to leave a memorial to the achievements of his life," says  David Peterson, who directs USC's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology.  </P> <P> "A gift of $1 million or anything in that neighborhood is spectacular," he  adds. "It allows us to support the research and teaching activities of a  faculty member in perpetuity. An endowed chair is the pinnacle a faculty member  can achieve."  </P> <P> Bensinger says he hasn't hit the jackpot to make his million dollars. Since he  bought his house in 1954, it has increased in value from $16,500 to over  $200,000. And, he says, "I just kept investing. I worked seven days a week,  sometimes 14 hours a day. Instead of going out partying, I went out camping and  hiking."  </P> <P> Another motivation for his gift comes from Bensinger's philosophy of life. "If  you're alive and growing inside, you attract people to you. You can't do that  unless you have something to give."  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Kiev NARODNA ARMIYA in Ukrainian on 4  August 1993 on page 1 carries an article under the heading  "Conflicts Accompany Emergence of Ukraine's Navy," and subtitled  "Power Disruptions Affect Patrol Ship `Hetman Sahaydachnyy'."    Power to the patrol ship, `Hetman Sahaydachnyy' from  on-shore  power sources was cut off recently. The disruption in electric  power sources led to major expenditures of fuel and service life  for the diesel engines aboard the patrol ship. This technical  problem prompted the warship's transfer to another Sevastopol  wharf. The ship was prevented from docking and establishing  communications. "Guardsmen" cut the "Hetman Sahaydachnyy"'s  mooring lines. As a result, the commander, Captain 3rd Rank V.  Katushenko ordered the patrol ship to stand off at some distance  from the "inhospitable" shore. Ukrainian sailors had to wait a  whole day to find out whether or not the "Hetman Sahaydachnyy"  would be able to tie up along side its new wharf.    This conflict was eventually resolved, "but not without  intervention of `higher authorities' in Kiev." The report  concluded with the reminder that, "Sevastopol legally is the  primary navy base for our state."</p>

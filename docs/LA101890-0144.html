			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACID SPILL FORCES FREEWAY CLOSURE  </P> <P> Morning rush-hour traffic slowed to a crawl Wednesday on the Antelope Valley  Freeway in Newhall after a small spill of muriatic acid from a truck forced the  closure of two southbound lanes for two hours, the California Highway Patrol  reported.  </P> <P> Johnny Reese, 44, of Palmdale, the driver of the tractor-trailer truck that was  hauling pool chemicals, was treated for inhalation of fumes from the spilled  chemical, the CHP said.  </P> <P> He was not seriously hurt.  </P> <P> Officer A.J. Torres said only five gallons of the chemical spilled from the  truck at 7:30 a.m. near the freeway's San Fernando Road on-ramp. CHP officers  and a Los Angeles County Fire Department hazardous-materials unit blocked two  of the four southbound lanes, Torres said.  </P> <P> He said the spill was cleaned up by 9:30 a.m.  </P> <P> With motorists on the normally heavy southbound commute crowded into the two  open lanes, traffic slowed to a bumper-to-bumper crawl and backed up more than  a mile. The southbound on-ramp from San Fernando Road to the freeway was also  closed during the cleanup.  </P> <P> The CHP said the spill apparently occurred when a pallet of muriatic acid  containers shifted and several containers broke open.  </P></p>

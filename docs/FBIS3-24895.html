In  a policy statement on the Constituent Assembly 1994 broadcast on  Radio Uganda and Uganda television tonight by member of the  Presidential Commission, the Rev. Dr. (Kefa Sempanje), the party  asked the people of Uganda to commit themselves to long-term  objectives which transcend narrow interests and can stand the  test of time.    The UPC said the people of Uganda should commit themselves  to:    1. Protect and preserve the territorial integrity of our  beloved country and never permit it to be enslaved, dismembered,  and enfeebled by militaristic systems;    2. Guarantee fundamental human rights and basic freedoms of  the individual, particularly the enjoyment of the right of  association. It said political parties should be entrenched in  the Constitution in the promotion of democratic institutions;    3. Create an enabling environment for individuals to develop  their full potential; and,    4. Build a strong and sound economy.    On governance, the party said the new constitution must  guard  against the emergence of leadership which comes to power through  the gun or other criminal means. The Constitution, the UPC  argued, should state clearly the tenure of office, the process  of acquiring that tenure, its renewal and limitations. In other  words, it added, the issue of regular elections should be  entrenched in the Constitution with due dates and frequency  specified. It said this should not be left to the whims of the  executive.    The UPC also recommended that the role of the three arms of  government, namely the executive, the legislature, and the  judiciary should be defined. For good governance, the supremacy  of the Constitution and the rule of law, it said, must be  recognized and accepted. The will of the people as the ultimate  sovereignty must be respected through regular elections based on  universal adult suffrage. The National Assembly must be the  depositary of the people's will and sovereignty. Its authority  should not be undermined by any other body such as the National  Council of State.    The party described the (?adoptive) draft Constitution as a  tragic betrayal of the underlined principles in constitution  making and the noble aspirations of the people of Uganda. It  charged that the draft Constitution attempts to legitimize and  entrench the NRM in power. It declared that the country must be  committed to:    1. A constitution which is the supreme law of the land with  no individual or organ above it.    2. Ensuring that the people's sovereignty is upheld at all  times.    3. To establish constitutional modalities removing from  office a president who fails to perform in accordance with the  provisions of the constitution.    4. Maintaining the rule of law as opposed to arbitrary rule  and    5. Safeguarding the independence of the judiciary.    On local government, [the] UPC added its voice to those of  other parties who have already presented their views on the  draft constitution in recognition of the need for unity in  diversity and also it said that for effective provision of  services to the people there is need for devolution of powers to  local authorities, bearing in mind the need for equitable  distribution of resources. But it stressed that the central  government under the UPC will play a supportive, advisory, and  supervisory role. However, the central government under the UPC  will continue to play the exclusive role in the field of  international relations, finance, defense, and security and  management of the natural resources.</p>

Li  Peng, premier of the State Council, sent a congratulatory letter.    The congratulatory letter states: Basically speaking, we  need  to rely on scientific and technological progress to realize our  country's socialist modernization. The broad mass of scientists  and technical workers shoulder a glorious yet arduous historical  mission. It is my earnest hope that the broad mass of  scientists and technical workers will, following the close of  the conference, further implement the guidelines set forth at  the 14th CPC National Congress and at the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee; deepen reform of the  scientific and technical structure; constantly promote  scientific and technical progress in line with the scientific  and technological development trend in the world and in  integrating with the reality in our country; and make even  greater contributions to the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of our country's economy.    Li Peng also states the following in his letter: As the  Spring Festival, the traditional festival of the Chinese people,  is approaching, I would like to wish you in advance a happy new  year. Through you, I would also like to wish a happy new year in  advance to all comrades throughout the nation who work hard on  the scientific and technological front. [passage omitted]</p>

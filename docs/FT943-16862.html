			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Australian rates speculation grows Speculation that Australia's official interest rates may rise in the near term was fuelled yesterday when monthly economic data showed a large rise in building approvals for May, and an unexpected widening of the current account deficit for the same month, writes Nikki Tait. Building approvals rose 10.4 per cent, compared with market forecasts of a small fall. This indicated that any slowdown in Australia's booming housing market is some way off and stoked fears of domestic inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, the current account deficit widened to ADollars 1.71bn (USDollars 1.25bn) in seasonally-adjusted terms, compared with ADollars 1.65bn in the previous month. Analysts had expected a deficit of about ADollars 1.4bn. Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer who has insisted there was no sign of incipient inflation and that interest rates did not need to rise at this stage, said the balance of payments figures were 'broadly consistent with budget forecasts'. He claimed the growth in imports supported the government's expectation of a strong acceleration in investment spending over the coming year.</p>

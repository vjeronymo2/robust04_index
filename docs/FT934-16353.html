			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Germans ready for cuts in real pay ABOUT a third of the German workforce is ready to accept real pay cuts this year, even before the main annual negotiating rounds get under way. As union officials yesterday continued their campaign against employers' calls for a wages freeze, two opinion polls suggested that between 31 and 35 per cent of the working population is apparently resigned to lower incomes. While almost 50 per cent said they were prepared to strike in support of claims for higher wages, union leaders were markedly less belligerent. Mr Hermann Rappe, the leader of the IG Chemie chemicals industry union, said his aim was an award equal to the expected inflation rate. Members could not expect compensation for higher taxes and social welfare contributions, he said in a radio interview. Most economists suggest consumer prices next year will rise 3.5 per cent. The DIW economics institute in Berlin said inflation would be relatively high because of fuel tax and rent increases. While it predicted cuts in real earnings, it said a freeze was not the way to recoup lost competitiveness. According to Mr Rappe, a freeze would reduce purchasing power by 5 per cent, and this was the last thing the German economy needed at present. Unconfirmed reports that IG Metall, the engineering union, is considering a claim of around 6 per cent also suggest that expectations have been greatly reduced by the continuing recession. Mr Richard Klein, the leading wages negotiator for local authorities, yesterday proposed performance-related bonuses and flexible working hours for public service employees as an alternative to the traditional across-the-board award.</p>

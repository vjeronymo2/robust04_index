			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Labor Minister Reynaldo Peters accused the  Bolivian Labor Federation [COB] of intending to carry out  actions to place the governability and stability of the Bolivian  state at risk with its intransigence and refusal to discuss the  economic and social measures implemented by the government.    Peters made this statement a few hours after several  professional and labor organizations adopted radical pressure  measures against the government, rejecting the capitalization of  public enterprises, the reform of the social security and  education system, and a wage increase of only 7.5 percent.    "None of the strikes announced in the past few hours were  legally notified according to the Labor Law," Peters said. He  added that the Bolivian Medical Association, which will hold a  48-hour strike, and energy and telephone company workers, who  will hold a 24-hour strike, "have not made any economic demand  at all."    He said he ordered measures to punish those who do not go to  work, adding that strikes by service sector workers were  declared illegal.    The labor minister regretted that the Bolivian labor  organizations have adopted "a frank and offensive attitude of  incomprehension toward the government and its policy."    He said this "labor intransigence does not reflect the will  of the Bolivian people or workers; it is a political position of  the labor chiefs."    "Feeling relegated from the labor organization as a result  of  the measures announced by the government, these union leaders  are making an effort to attain a more prominent position at any  price," the minister said.    Peters said that is the position assumed by the COB  leadership, especially since the COB will hold a congress in May.    "Such is the real spirit behind the labor strikes and  mobilizations that are planned in the whole country," Peters  said. [passage omitted]</p>

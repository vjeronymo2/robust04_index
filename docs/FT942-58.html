			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Burns Philp buys Indian Yeast stake Burns Philp, the Australian company which has been concentrating on building up its food ingredients division, is buying a 49 per cent stake in the Indian Yeast Company from Shaw Wallace for an undisclosed sum. The Indian company has two plants in Calcutta and Bombay, and claims to be the market leader in the country. Burns said the purchase consideration was small, but that the business augmented its strong presence in the Asia-Pacific yeast market. Burns Philp has a 40 per cent market share in the region. Rank Commercial, the privately-owned New Zealand-based company which is bidding ADollars 500m (USDollars 384.6m) for Foodland Associated, the Western Australian grocery group, will not lodge formal offer documents until a hearing on the Trade Practices Commission's request for an injunction takes place. This is scheduled for July 6. The TPC, Australia's competition watchdog, is concerned about the involvement of Coles Myers, one of Australia's largest retailers, in the bid. Coles has an option to acquire Foodland's Australian assets for around ADollars 250m if the Rank offer is successful.</p>

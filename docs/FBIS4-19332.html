			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dino Vaiano: "Ministerial Race Underway, But Di </F> Pietro Says No Thanks -- Biondi and Mastella Candidates for  Justice Ministry"]    [Text] Rome -- The new government "will be like AC Milan  [soccer team, curently top of league division], with all the  best players" a young Forza Italia deputy said, taking an  inquisitive sidelong glance at the Palazzo Chigi [government  seat]. The street was crowded with official cars waiting for  [Prime Minister] Ciampi's "professors," gathered for the last  operative cabinet meeting. It was 1200 hours and there was a  demob atmosphere in the council.    Piazza Montecitorio [square outside lower house] was packed.  The "freshmen" were swarming in the streets around the Palazzo  Chigi waiting for the initiation ceremony to begin. Smiles,  witticisms, and euphoria. Meanwhile, inside the palace,  attention was focused on the race for the ministries. What kind  of team will [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi field?    The Marco Van Basten [soccer hero] of the team, the  outstanding technocratic minister wanted by many deputies, would  be [Clean Hands Judge] Antonio di Pietro at the Interior  Ministry. However, the judge involved in the Clean Hands trials  has made it known that he has no intention of hanging up his  judges robes. Now, people are banking on last-minute attempts  to get him to accept the Interior Ministry or Justice Ministry.  With Di Pietro ruled out, the list of candidates for the  Interior and Justice Ministries looks especially political.  Raffaele Costa (Center Union) and Francesco D'Onofrio  (Christian Democratic Center) will run off against Clemente  Mastella.    If Roberto Maroni (from the wing of the League touting for  ministries) becomes deputy prime minister charged with  institutional reforms and antitrust issues (so that he can  closely mark Berlusconi), then the choice of Irene Pivetti as  speaker in the Chamber of Deputies has lowered the odds on  [Liberal member] Alfredo Biondi taking a ministerial post. Will  he end up at in the Justice Ministry?    The grapevine of names comes on top of the plans to reduce  the number of ministries, grouping them together according to  their functions. The new government should have 14 or 15  ministries. Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino has suggested  merging the Budget and Treasury Ministries into a superministry  of the economy. He was thinking of Mario Monti, but the Bocconi  [Milan Independent Catholic University] rector has already said  "no, thank you."    The great power game is in full swing. However, in reality,  between Forza Italia, the League, and the National Alliance  there has, as yet, been no contact about the ministerial  structure. People are talking about programs. Berlusconi has  not ruled out bringing in people from outside. In recent days,  it is said that [former Prime Minister] Giuliano Amato has been  asked how he would feel about taking over at the Foreign  Ministry or the Treasury. Then an attempt would be made to place  a technocrat like [Segni Pact economist] Giulio Tremonti in the  Finance Ministry, and Lamberto Dini, currently Bank of Italy  general manager, in the Treasury. However, the League's  Giancarlo Pagliarini is also in the running for an economic  post, and he, together with his party colleague Vito Gnutti  (Labor) and Maroni, look set to make up the Lombardy delegation.  [League ideologue] Gianfranco Miglio is the dark horse in this  race. [Radical leader] Pannella is in line for a ministerial  post, as is, perhaps, [Christian Democratic Center leader]  Ombretta Fumagalli (Post and Telecommunications).    The National Alliance is also preparing for office. The  names being bandied around on the right are Domenico Fisichella  (Public Prosecutor), Publio Fiori (Health), and Giuseppe  Tatarella (Transport). Among Berlusconi's closest advisers,  Antonio Martino looks to be in pole position for the Foreign  Ministry. [Forza Italia ideologue] Giuliano Urbani, if he is  not made institutional reform minister, could be charged with  coordinating government action as under secretary to the prime  minister's office.</p>

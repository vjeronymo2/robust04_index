			<p>BFN     [Text] The Vietnam Second Catholic Solidarity General  Committee held its fourth plenary session in Hanoi this morning.    In past years, the patriotic emulation movement by Catholics  as well as activities of the Catholic solidarity committees of  provinces and cities countrywide have been focused on  implementing the resolution of the Vietnam Catholic Solidarity  General Committee's third plenary session. Catholics of all  strata have placed their confidence on and carried out pretty  well the policies of the state in all socioeconomic aspects. In  many localities, Catholics have positively contributed  suggestions and opinions on drafts to amend laws such as the Law  on Land, Tax Law, on so forth. They also responded well to  social and charity activities. Many localities have effectively  provided poor Catholics with material help or cash amounting to  many million dong.    In anticipation of the National Congress of the Vietnamese  Catholicism, which will be held in 1995, the Catholic solidarity  committees of all localities have actively continued to  consolidate their organization and reformed their activities;  have motivated Catholics to step up their production and  business activities in all fields of agriculture, industry,  forestry, and so forth; and have encouraged young Catholics to  participate in the national defense movement, in campaigns to  eliminate hunger and reduce poverty, in campaigns to reward  family with meritorious deeds, as well as in campaigns to fight  social vices.</p>

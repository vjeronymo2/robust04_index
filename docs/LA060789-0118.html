			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN TIED TO JUDGE IS HELD IN COCAINE CASE  </P> <P> A woman linked to the investigation of Municipal Judge Calvin P. Schmidt has  been arrested on suspicion of selling a kilo of cocaine to an undercover police  officer, the Costa Mesa Police Department said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Sgt. Tom Boylan said Terri Ann McMullen, 28, was arrested at her apartment on  16th Street in Newport Beach at 5:40 p.m. Monday. Boylan said narcotics  officers also arrested two men who were in her apartment at the time, Pedro  Diaz Chavez, 22, and Paul Padilla, 27, both of Anaheim.  </P> <P> All three were arrested on suspicion of selling cocaine and conspiracy to sell  cocaine, Boylan said.  </P> <P> Boylan confirmed that McMullen is the woman whose controversial release from  jail by Schmidt last year added to allegations that the judge showed a pattern  of preferential treatment for certain defendants. Schmidt came under fire for  ordering McMullen released from jail in March, 1988, and also last October  after she had been arrested on drug charges.  </P> <P> McMullen is the stepdaughter of M. Robert Guggenheim, a Newport Beach  philanthropist. Schmidt ordered her released on her own recognizance despite  being advised by officers that she was a bad risk because of a history of  failing to appear in court.  </P> <P> According to court documents, Schmidt justified his actions by saying that  McMullen was a member of the Guggenheim family and that the "defendant's  parents were wealthy."  </P> <P> Campaign-spending reports show that Guggenheim made a $500 contribution to  Schmidt in 1985.  </P> <P> The California Commission on Judicial Performance announced last Dec. 10 that  it had ordered a formal hearing on allegations of misconduct against the  Newport Beach judge. The hearing is scheduled to be held in August.  </P> <P> Boylan said McMullen and her two associates were arrested after a weeklong  undercover operation. He said an officer got a tip that McMullen was dealing in  cocaine, and the officer began negotiating with her. He added:  </P> <P> "The undercover officer was negotiating to buy from 2 to 5 kilos of cocaine, at  $15,000 a kilo. When a deal was made for 1 kilo, she was arrested at her  apartment, along with the two men who were there. We think Chavez was the  delivery boy."  </P> <P> McMullen was taken to County Jail and bail was set at $100,000. Boylan said  that Chavez and Padilla were in Costa Mesa Jail in lieu of $25,000 each. They  are scheduled to be arraigned this morning.  </P></p>

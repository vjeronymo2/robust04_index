			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- The government and the  ruling parties will draft tax reform bills by the end of June  designed to increase net tax revenues through raising the  consumption tax while making permanent income tax cuts, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii indicated Friday.    "The direction remains unchanged," Fujii said, referring to  earlier promises by the government and the ruling parties to  draft concrete full-fledged tax reform bills by the end of this  month. Fujii made the comments to reporters after the day's  regularly scheduled cabinet meeting.    He was also clarifying recent comments by Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata regarding the "conclusion" and "direction" of the  tax reform also promised in the March market-opening package to  be detailed by the end of June.    The United States is closely waiting for the decision after  pressuring Japan to continue with 5.5 trillion yen in income tax  cuts now limited to the current fiscal year as a measure to  boost domestic demand and curb the trade surplus.    Regarding concrete figures, especially on a tax rate hike,  Fujii said his ministry as "an administrative body" expects the  bills to include them. He also reiterated his unchanged policy  for enacting a tax hike and offsetting tax cuts in a single  package to avoid the "untreated" issuance of deficit-covering  bonds.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who had criticized  the  planned tax hike, recently eased his stance to accept Japan's  plan to separate tax cuts and a hike "substantially" for at  least three years.    The government and the ruling parties decided to issue  "stopgap" red-ink bonds to finance the single-year tax cuts with  a promise to decide on full-fledged tax reform after scrapping  the 7 percent "national welfare tax" plan announced in February  by then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Hosokawa's plan was  seen as stemming from strong opposition by the finance minister  over deficit-covering bonds.    With the promised tax reform, Fujii noted that he expects a  net tax revenue increase with tax cuts and a hike to fund  welfare spending because of Japan's aging society. The Tax  Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, asked the  ministry to take into account conditions for a net tax revenue  increase for the recently issued "mechanical calculations" on  revenue estimates in fiscal 2000 under the tax reform, Fujii  said.    The ministry's estimates called for a three-year time lag  between 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts and a consumption tax hike,  and cited a tax hike to above 6 percent from the current 3  percent as the only way to attain a net revenue increase. "But  I don't know what the panel will do with its report" slated to  be issued soon, Fujii added.    Meanwhile, the ruling coalition parties issued a report  Thursday, saying a consumption tax hike is inevitable with the  aging society.    Fujii said discussions in the government and ruling parties  are progressing smoothly toward drafting the bills by the end of  June. But uncertainties remain as panel and coalition sources  have said concrete figures might not be included to avoid  disputes with the Social Democratic Party (SDP) which is  sensitive to the issue of hiking the consumption tax. The SDP  departed the ruling camp in April when the Hata cabinet was  formed, thus giving the coalition shaky minority rule.</p>

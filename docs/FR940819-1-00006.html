Planning must take into consideration topography, soils, climate, adjacent land use, environmental impacts, energy efficiency, local economy, aesthetic and cultural values, public and private services, housing and social conditions and a degree of flexibility to accommodate changing demands. Although all planning and performing development work is the responsibility of the applicant or developer, close coordination must occur with local planning officials and with the respective Agency office to minimize the chances of spending money on development that does not meet the Agency's requirements. All development will be arranged and completed according to applicable local, State or Federal regulations including applicable health and safety standards, environmental concerns and requirements of this subpart. When a public authority requires inspections prior to final acceptance, written assurance by the responsible public authority, of compliance to local, city, county, State or other public codes, regulations and ordinances is required prior to final acceptance by the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agency advice and assistance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Applicants and developers shall be encouraged to seek the advice and assistance of the Agency before significant expenditures are made.

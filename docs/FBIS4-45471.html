			<p>Involved   in Cocaine Smuggling   <F P=102> AU1406135594 Vienna DIE PRESSE in German 14 Jun 94 p 10 </F> <F P=103> AU1406135594 </F> <F P=104>  Vienna DIE PRESSE </F> <F P=105>  German </F> BFN   <F P=106> ["(a.z."-initialed report: "NATO Officer as Wire-Puller in </F> Cocaine Scene")]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Dragan B. has been exposed as  a cocaine dealer. He repeatedly smuggled cocaine from Belgium  and Colombia to Austria. During his last coup he was caught in  Dusseldorf by the German police, which had been alerted by the  Austrians. He had four kg of cocaine on him with a street value  of 7.5 million schillings. One kilogram of cocaine from former  deliveries was found with the total of eight persons of the  inner circle of the gang, among which it had been distributed.    In Belgium, the Vienna police has now established the  identity of a high-ranking Belgian NATO officer who had supplied  the cocaine. The Belgian authorities, however, have so far  ignored the Austrian investigations: Not only has the arrest  warrant not been executed, and the suspect, who has been  incriminated by several witnesses, has not only not been  extradited, the Belgians have not even arrested the man. "This  man is somehow untouchable," sources from the Vienna police said.    Eight persons have been arrested, while complaints against  another 25 have been filed. [passage omitted]</p>

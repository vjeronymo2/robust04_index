			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] St. John's, Antigua, 1 Feb, CANA -- Political leader  of Antigua and Barbuda's main opposition United Progressive  Party (UPP), Baldwin Spencer, has rejected claims that his party  is seeking to create a confrontation with its opponents and  incite violence ahead of general elections.    The ruling Antigua Labour Party, campaigning for elections  constitutionally due by March, has accused a UPP candidate and  his supporters of disrupting an ALP public meeting. The party  also accused UPP supporters of blocking the path of ALP  supporters last Sunday in the St. John's rural West constituency  (represented by Spencer). But Spencer charged that the ruling  party, feeling the weight of the opposition, was "clearly  looking for sympathy."    "They realise that their power in this country is eroding  and  they are trying to create a situation where they would want to  put the UPP in bad light," he added.    The UPP leader said the ALP's allegations were "clearly not  true."    "There was no attempt on the part of a UPP candidate to  disrupt any meeting. There was no attempt... to block the  motorcade of the ALP that was going through my constituency," he  said. "What I believed frightened the ALP and their entourage  was the outpouring of support by the people of my candidacy in  that constituency and the total rejection of the ALP," Spencer  added.    The UPP leader said his party would "not allow the ALP to  use  fear and intimidation to derail us. We are fighting this  campaign openly without fear. We are taking the issues to the  population. We are campaigning aggressively. We make no bones  about that. We do not have the media, so we have to reach there  to the public by other means," Spencer said.</p>

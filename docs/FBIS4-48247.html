			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GVL: "Twagiramungu: `The RPF Is Respecting </F> Arusha' -- Rwandan Opposition Parties Want To Cooperate With the  Rebels"]    [Excerpts] Four Rwandan opposition parties (namely the MDR  [Republican Democratic Movement], the PSD [Democratic Socialist  Party], the PL [Liberal Party], and the PDC [Christian  Democratic Party]) have set up a Coordination Committee of the  Democratic Forces of Change (CCFDC) [Comite de Coordination des  Forces Democratiques de Changement] in Brussels intended as a  counterbalance to the interim government, which is now putting  itself forward as the legal representation, but which according  to the CCFDC is largely responsible for the slaughter. [passage  omitted].  <H5>  Twagiramungu </H5>   The CCFDC is headed by the MDR's Faustin Twagiramungu, who,  according to the Arusha peace agreements, should have led the  transition government (which was to include the RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front]). However, partly due to the delaying tactics  of Habyarimana, the transition government never came into being,  although today it constitutes the only legal basis in Rwanda.  Yesterday [13 May], Twagiramungu, who himself barely escaped  death and was smuggled out of Kigali by the Blue Helmets,  presented the viewpoints of the CCFDC. He left no doubt that  the interim government, and more specifically the MRND [National  Republican Movement for Democracy and Development] and the CDR  [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] are responsible for  the slaughter of the Tutsi minority and of political opponents  carried out by "the Presidential Guard, the army, the  gendarmerie, and the Interahamwe [Coalition for the Defense of  the Republic militia] ."    Among other things, the CCFDC is demanding that the  Presidential Guard be disbanded and that the group of extremist  army officers be arrested. It is calling for those officers and  noncommissioned officers who are not directly involved in the  slaughter to "come to the aid of the people and eliminate the  criminals."    According to Twagiramungu, the interim government has no  legitimacy. Not only does its composition violate the Arusha  agreement, but according to Twagiramungu, "it does not even  comply with the 1991 constitution. The current `president' has  not sworn any oath before Parliament, and the parties have never  approved their members' participation in government." It is  precisely that constitution, which dates from before Arusha,  which the interim government is referring to as its legal basis.  <H5>  Patriotic Front </H5>   Twagiramungu's rejection of the interim government  contrasted  sharply with his support for the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which  according to him "is respecting the Arusha agreements" and "was  acting in self-defense "when it resorted to arms again."

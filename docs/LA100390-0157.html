			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CANDIDATE DEFENDS HIRING OF DETECTIVE  </P> <P> City Council candidate Coween Dickerson Tuesday defended the actions of her  former campaign treasurer in hiring a private detective to trail Councilman  Miguel A. Pulido Jr. to find out whether he lives in the city.  </P> <P> But Dickerson said at a press conference that she had accepted the resignation  of the treasurer, Salvador Juarez, saying he should have informed her of his  actions.  </P> <P> Dickerson, a self-employed business analyst, said that Juarez was trying to  "act responsibly" in attempting to determine whether Pulido actually lives in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "I don't think he did anything wrong," Dickerson said of Juarez, "but he should  have asked me. I would have told him not to."  </P> <P> Dickerson said that Juarez offered to resign last Thursday and that Zeke  Hernandez, who lost to Pulido in the 1986 council race, will be her new  treasurer.  </P> <P> Hiring a detective, Dickerson said, was a "waste of money." She asserted that  it is common knowledge that Pulido lived outside Santa Ana. Dickerson, who has  made this a campaign issue, added that none of her campaign money was used for  the investigation.  </P> <P> Pulido maintains that he has lived in Santa Ana in a rented room since 1986,  when he first ran for office. He described Juarez's resignation as "too little  and too late." Dickerson and her supporters, he said, were making Juarez the  "fall guy" for the "mistake of hiring an investigator."  </P> <P> "If she can't control the activity of her own treasurer," Pulido said, "how  could she purport to be a council person who's going to have a whole city under  her responsibility?"  </P> <P> Private investigator William Holland of Fountain Valley said Juarez hired him  in August to determine whether Pulido was actually living in Fullerton at his  family's home before moving to a house on Garnsey Street in Santa Ana last  month. Holland said he has submitted his report to the district attorney's  office. He said that Juarez paid him with his own checks.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade said the office is reviewing the report.  LILY ENG  </P></p>

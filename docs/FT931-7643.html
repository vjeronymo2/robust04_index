			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Toyota Motor's Dollars 1.5bn placing off to a smooth start THE placing of Toyota Motor Corporation's Dollars 1.5bn five-year offering proceeded smoothly yesterday, reflecting the car company's high credit rating and the scarcity of highly-liquid corporate issues. Meanwhile, syndicate managers expect the European Community to award a mandate today for a Euromark offering of between DM2.5bn and DM3bn. An EC spokesman in Luxembourg had no comment. The market expected the deal to have a seven-year maturity and to be priced to yield between 7 and 10 basis points above the 7 1/4 per cent bund due January 2000, which closed at 104.33 yesterday to yield 6.43 per cent. This area of the yield curve is viewed as relatively attractive to issuers, but a syndicate manager close to the transaction said that the maturity also suited the EC's funding needs. Turning back to the Toyota offering, officials at the joint lead underwriters, Nomura and Merrill Lynch, reported good demand for the bonds, reaping the benefit of several days of pre-marketing the deal. They therefore expect the bonds to be priced to yield the lower end of the indicated range of 38 to 40 basis points above the when-issued five-year US Treasuries, which were yielding 5.32 per cent late yesterday. The bonds are expected to be priced this afternoon. A substantial part of the proceeds of the deal, which is the largest ever corporate issue in the international bond market, is expected to be swapped into yen. The indicated pricing of the bonds was viewed as attractive when compared with the recent dollar offering from the Kingdom of Denmark which was yielding 22 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. However, syndicate managers also pointed out that the indicated yield on the new bonds was about 10 basis points below that on Toyota's outstanding bonds due June 1997, which have lost some of their attraction to investors because they were now trading at a substantial premium to par. The lion's share, or 60 per cent, of the Toyota offering is expected to be placed in Europe, followed by Japan with 20 per cent. A further 10 per cent is expected to be placed elsewhere in Asia, 5 per cent in the Middle East and 5 per cent in offshore US funds. Elsewhere, the stream of Canadian dollar offerings continued, as Mobil Oil Canada raised CDollars 125m in a five-year deal priced to yield 70 basis points above the 6 1/4 per cent Canadian government bonds due 1998 which were yielding 6.92 per cent late yesterday. The bonds kept to that spread when they were freed to trade in the afternoon. An official at the lead manager, ScotiaMcLeod, said that the yield spread on the bonds was wider than that on recent issues but reported good demand for the bonds from continental Europe, especially Switzerland. General Electric Capital Corporation of the US also tapped the Canadian dollar market with a three-year CDollars 100m offering priced at 99.73 to yield 7.22 per cent. When the bonds were freed to trade in the late afternoon, they traded close to their launch level. Aga, the Swedish industrial gas group, has announced a DM500m commercial paper programme for general financing and the financing of its German activities, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The CP programme has been arranged by Dresdner Bank which will also act as a dealer alongside Deutsche Bank and Citibank. Aga already has a Dollars 500m CP programme on the Euro market, a FFr1bn programme on the French market and a Dollars 100m programme on the UK market.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Fujimori will run again Peru's President Alberto Fujimori chose a Lima shanty town late on Saturday to confirm that, as widely expected, he will run for a second five-year term of office in the general elections scheduled for April 9 1995. The deadline for registering candidacies and running mates is tomorrow. Backed by the parliamentary majority he acquired in the new Congress established in the wake of his constitutional coup in April 1992, Mr Fujimori rewrote the constitution last year to permit successive presidential terms. Claiming that remaining in office until the year 2000 was 'the way to continue the work my government has carried out over the past four years', Mr Fujimori underlined his regime's successes in curbing inflation, combating terrorism and re-establishing relations with the international financial community. 'Peru must not stop now,' he said. Early opinion polls give Mr Fujimori a commanding lead over his closest rival, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, the former UN secretary general. The only other individual candidate to show more than 5 per cent popular support so far is Mr Fujimori's estranged wife, Ms Susana Higuchi. All the established parties, meanwhile, will present presidential slates and congressional lists of their own. A plethora of new movements has also been emerging over the past two weeks. By close of registration there could be almost two dozen candidates for the presidency. This could make Mr Fujimori vulnerable in a run-off. Despite his consistently high popular standing, he will find it hard to obtain the 50 per cent required to avoid a second round, in which most of Peru's opposition parties are likely to throw their weight behind Mr Perez de Cuellar.</p>

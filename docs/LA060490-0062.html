			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 DIE IN CRASH WITH SUSPECTED DRUNK DRIVER  </P> <P> Three women -- all relatives who had immigrated from Mexico -- and a 7-month  fetus were killed in a collision involving a suspected drunk driver in  Wilmington, and a fourth woman, also related, was hospitalized in critical  condition, police said Sunday.  </P> <P> Authorities identified the dead women as Veronica Aguilar, 24, who was  pregnant; Olga Zamora, 18, and Marisela Arias, 19.  </P> <P> Arias' 24-year-old sister, Rosalia, was in critical but stable condition at  Harbor-UCLA Medical Center with a broken arm and internal injuries, friends of  the family said. The hospital would not comment on her condition.  </P> <P> Aguilar's fetus was delivered by Cesarean section three hours after the  accident, but was stillborn, relatives said.  </P> <P> Aguilar and Zamora were first cousins, and they were also first cousins of the  Arias sisters, relatives said.  </P> <P> Friends are seeking funds to cover burial expenses and Rosalia Arias' medical  bills.  </P> <P> "They had no life insurance or medical insurance," said Cynthia Estrada, a  neighbor and friend of the Arias sisters and Zamora, who lived on Hawaiian  Avenue in a public housing project in Wilmington. "We want to see if we can get  some funds or donations from the public to cover the burial and medical costs."  </P> <P> She said she will open an account at a Bank of America Branch in Wilmington  today to accept donations.  </P> <P> The accident occurred late Saturday as the women were driving Aguilar, who had  been visiting the Ariases and Zamora, back to her home in Wilmington, police  said.  </P> <P> A suspected drunk driver ran a red light at Pacific Coast Highway and Neptune  Avenue at 11:30 p.m., slamming into the women's 1984 Ford Escort, police said.  Hubaldo Calderon, 21, of Wilmington was arrested and booked for investigation  of murder and drunk driving.  </P></p>

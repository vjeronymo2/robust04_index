			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Letter: An ode to social class Sir, I have just read your excellent article, 'Victim of class action' (May 15). With all the talk about class and classlessness, I feel utterly confused, and haven't the foggiest idea what, if any, class I am. But perhaps my late father summed it up perfectly in a poem he used to recite: 'There were two moles of equal worth; but not it seems of equal birth. The one who said his blood was blue, was much the bloodiest of the two'. Mary Sweet, 10 St Thomas Park, Lymington, Hampshire SO41 9NF</p>

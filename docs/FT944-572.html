			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / TV Highlights: Gee, thanks for some dismal schedules Apart from the token gestures of Midnight Mass (11.45pm, BBC1) and Carols from Canterbury (11.20pm, ITV), the powers that be have shovelled together a mixture of routine (Casualty, Birds of a Feather), mediocre old films and mid-Atlantic tat for Christmas Eve on the cynical assumption that alcohol, decorating or stocking-filling will keep the proles otherwise occupied. Why waste quality on a combined Christmas Eve and Saturday? Channel 4 sees fit to herald Christmas with both Eurotrash (11.05pm) and The Word (2.20am). At least this is British garbage. Elsewhere the main concern seems to be to reassure us that we are still the 51st state. Fay Weldon's She Devil appears in its Hollywood guise (11.20pm, BBC2). Even Dame Edna is promised 'from head to toe in stars and stripes' in that traditional Yuletide venue, Hollywood, with such Christmassy figures as Barry Manilow. BBC1 gives us the supremely irrelevant Michael Moore's TV Nation (8.55pm) with such seasonal topics as law-breaking American firms and where to send American troops in 1995, and Tony Bennett - Unplugged (10.35pm, if anyone's interested). ITV gives us - wait for it - Peter, Paul and Mary, followed by McCloud. Channel 4 goes one better in obscurity with a stand-up comic in Chicago. Gee thanks. The dismal story continues on Christmas Day. Channel 4 does its own thing by scheduling, against the Queen (3pm), the Rev Jesse Jackson, one hopes more coherent than usual, sandwiched between two old Danny Kaye films. C4 highlights include a ghost story first shown on ITV, the artist formerly known as Prince, and Harry Connick Jr (9.50pm), not to be confused with Harry Connick Jr - a Profile which you may have caught on ITV at 5am if roused by excited stocking-openers. The hallucinatory nightmare quality of C4's programming may be alleviated, or then again intensified, by the mad moonlit pentatonic cruelty of Puccini's Turandot (3.15pm), in a San Francisco production designed by David Hockney. BBC2 remembers it is British and turns to the Royal Opera House for its cultural offering, Verdi's Aida (7pm) in Elijah Moshinsky's production. The Radio Times describes this as 'acclaimed', the use of which as a synonym for 'disastrous' is new to me. ITV goes cutesy with seasonal editions of Blind Date and the 1960s policier, Heartbeat, while American comic Robin Williams swims with 60 wild dolphins (10pm). 'You could say you've achieved maximum mellowness,' he remarks. Of all the things you could say in such circumstances that would be the last one to occur to me. Project X (9.45pm) portrays a US Air Force pilot teaching chimpanzees to operate a flight simulator. I anticipate a sequel which shows them planning Christmas television schedules. Fair's fair, though: ITV does give us Kiri Te Kanawa and Co singing carols in Coventry (11.15pm). Introduced by David Frost, but nothing's perfect. BBC1 trumps the competition with comedy: a new series of One Foot in the Grave begins at 9pm, with the rightly lauded Richard Wilson as cantankerous Victor Meldrew and the insufficiently praised Annette Crosbie (his wife). Victoria Wood: Live in Your Own Home (9.40pm) makes a double dose of bliss. And I shall sneak a look at the compilation Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In (6pm, BBC2) to see if it was as good as we thought at the time . . . But for me Christmas Day's highlight is the riveting version of Dickens' Hard Times (3.10pm, BBC2), with a sumptuous cast - Bob Peck, Alan Bates, Harriet Walter, Bill Paterson, Richard E. Grant, Alex Jennings - that reads like a roll-call of the profession's brightest and best. And it probably cost a fraction of one episode of Martin Chuzzlewit.</p>

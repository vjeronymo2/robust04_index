			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROJECTION QUALITY  </P> <P> Some thoughts prompted by Kenneth Bank's June 11 letter, in which he complained  about an out-of-focus movie and theorized that no projectionist was available  to fix the problem:  </P> <P> Four years ago, one mid-range and two large U.S. theater chains locked out  their professional projectionists. Now fully half of the first-run theaters use  tag teams of overworked managers and assistants to deliver their shows.  </P> <P> In past "negotiations," one of these companies cynically pointed to increased  popcorn sales when their customers wait out mid-show interruptions. And it  boasted that sloppy performances hadn't hurt its grosses.  </P> <P> Projection systems are at best semiautomated. They still need lots of care.  </P> <P> Do you want a professional show for the price of your ticket? Then stay away  from theaters whose greed sells the show short.  </P> <P> WILLIAM CLARK  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb Forces  continued heavy shelling of besieged Gorazde in defiance of a  NATO air strike ultimatum, a UN official said today in Sarajevo.    Dacre Holloway, UN Protection Force spokesman, was quoted as  saying that scores of artillery and tank rounds were fired  during "a heavy Bosnian Serb Army attack" hours before the  deadline of 0001 GMT on Sunday [24 April] set by NATO.    He said the heavy artillery attack on the town began at  11:00  A.M. Local time, with impacts all over the city, some very  close to U.N. military observer headquarters, and the town  hospital was also hit again.    According to reports reaching here, Holloway said the Serb  Forces were attacking from north of the Drina River which runs  through the Muslim town.    He also acknowledged that there had been some Muslim firing  but said the "indiscriminate" Serb response was out of  proportion.    NATO ministers meeting Friday in Brussels ordered Bosnian  Serb Forces to stop attacking the town immediately or face NATO  air strikes.    The Serbs, who have been attacking Gorazde since March 29,  were warned to withdraw all forces three kilometer from the  center of the city by the Sunday deadline, and 20 kilometer from  the town by Wednesday.    According to U.N. sources, about 700 people have been killed  and more than 1,900 injured during the Serb offensive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Boris Krivoshey] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Russia will continue active  mediation in settlement of the trans-Dniester conflict,  plenipotentiary representative of the Russian president  Vladillen Vasev told ITAR-TASS today upon the completion of his  Moldovan trip.    Slightly more than a month has passed since the signing of a  joint statement by Moldovan and trans-Dniester leaders, he said.  This period can be described as organizational. Working groups  have been set up to focus on financial, economic relations and  political settlement, which is the future state-legal status of  the trans- Dniester region.    "Economic issues are natural and there are people who are  tackling these problems. I think it will be easy for them to  pull their efforts and elaborate corresponding agreements. They  have already started to do it," said Vasev.    In his opinion, the issue of financial-economic relations  remains difficult. It is a certain stumbling stone in  Moldovan-trans- Dniester relations. "But I think the sides will  solve this problem," he added.    The most difficult problem is still the state-legal status  of  the trans-Dniester region. The problem is in the focus of the  sides' leaders and heads of expert groups - First Deputy  Moldovan Foreign Minister Nikolae Osmokescu and trans-Dniester  State Secretary Valeriy Litskay.    On the whole, the current stage of negotiations can be  described as preparatory. "Despite certain differences and  rather heated debates, one can say that the general stand of the  sides has become more constructive, they intend to reach  compromises and certain results have been achieved. The  preparatory period is necessary to reach agreements. The sides  have fixed no time for them, but it would be better not to drag  out this period," said Vasev.</p>

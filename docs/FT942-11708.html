			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US gains on news of Kodak restructuring Wall Street Blue-chip stocks improved as news of Kodak's restructuring and a second big healthcare acquisition provided a diversion from lingering concerns over interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 13.39 higher at 3,714.41, climbing back from an 18-point deficit during the afternoon. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 inched 0.01 ahead to 453.03, even though declining issues led advances, 1,093 to 985, in thin trading. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was 2.19 better at 442.39, but the Nasdaq composite eased 1.31 to 739.37. Stocks meandered in a narrow range on either side of their opening levels during the morning. The day's only fresh economic news - the March index of leading indicators - came in a little higher than expected, but not enough to spark any sustained buying and selling. Developments in the bond market were not encouraging, as the 30-year benchmark government issue slipped again. But trading was thin, with many accounts remaining on the sidelines ahead Friday's employment data for April, a keenly awaited barometer of economic strength and inflationary pressures. The overall mood was subdued, with the Federal Reserve's next move to lift rates expected soon. Later in the afternoon, a fresh decline by the dollar against the yen and D-mark hit bonds and in turn share prices. But both markets recovered quickly, and the blue chips pushed well into positive ground in the final hour of trading. Kodak brought some cheer to what could have been a rather dull market. The stock climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 46 1/8 after announcing that it would sell-off three non-core businesses, including its Sterling Winthrop over-the-counter drug subsidiary. It was the second consecutive session driven by news in the pharmaceuticals sector. Syntex, whose share price jumped on Monday on the announcement of Roche's Dollars 5.3bn bid, was again on top of the NYSE's most active list, ebbing Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 23 3/8 . Yesterday also brought news that United Healthcare, one of the biggest health maintenance organisations, had agreed to sell its drug-distribution business to SmithKline Beecham for Dollars 2.3bn. The announcement pushed United Dollars 2 3/8 higher to Dollars 46 1/2 . Elsewhere, Value Health jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 44 1/2 after agreeing to form a 'strategic relationship' with Pfizer. Time Warner gained Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 amid speculation that the company was ripe for takeover. On the Nasdaq, technology stocks retreated following the previous session's upturn. Wellfleet lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 75 1/4 , Microsoft shed Dollars 2 to Dollars 93 1/2 and Lotus Development dropped Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 63 7/8 . Canada Toronto prices closed mixed in relatively light trading. The TSE-300 composite index rose 1.28 points, or 0.03 per cent, to close at 4,283.61. But declining issues outnumbered advances 396 to 321. Volume was 58.66m shares, down from Monday's record 109.35m, but trading value rose to CDollars 552.4m from CDollars 548.6m. The conglomerates group had the day's biggest decline, off 1.2%. The mining, gold and industrial products groups also finished lower.</p>

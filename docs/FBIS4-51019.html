			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin said here today that Sino-Congolese cooperation had  yielded good results.    During his talks with visiting Congolese President Pascal  Lissouba this afternoon, Jiang said that the current visit of  Lissouba witnessed the 30th anniversary of the establishment of  Sino-Congolese diplomatic ties, and as prime minister, Lissouba  made efforts in this regard 30 years ago.    Jiang said that he was convinced that the visit would  further  Sino-Congolese bilateral understanding, and push their relations  to a high level.    He spoke highly of the efforts the Congolese people had made  under the leadership of the president to find the political and  economic structures conforming to the country's domestic  situation.    The Chinese Government appreciated Lissouba's view that  democracy must go along with the Congo's traditional culture,  and that the country's development needs stability, Jiang said.    He also expressed his satisfaction with the effective  cooperation between China and The Congo, adding that China  attached great importance to the bilateral ties.    "The Chinese people, along with Congolese people, would  strengthen the bilateral cooperation in different fields on the  basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," he added.    Jiang also expressed his appreciation for The Congo's "one  China" stand, and support for China's re-entry to the General  Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.    There was great potential in China-Congo two-way trade, he  said.    Lissouba said that social stability and peace were both  important to economic development.    He said that one purpose of his visit was to learn how the  Chinese people had made their economic achievement.    "The Congo, with rich resources to be developed, welcomes  Chinese enterprises to cooperate with Congolese counterparts,"  he said.    After the talks, Jiang and Lissouba were present at the  signing of an agreement under which the Chinese Government will  provide credit to The Congo. It was signed by Yang Wensheng,  Chinese assistant minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation, and Clement Mouamba, Congolese minister of planning  and economy.    Before the talks, Jiang held a greeting ceremony for  Lissouba.    Among those present at the greeting ceremony were Li  Tieying,  Chinese state councillor and minister in charge of the state  commission for restructuring the economy, Lu Jiaxi,  vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing  Committee, Lu Min, vice-chairman of the China Democratic  National Construction Association, and Huang Qitao, chairman of  the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister in  charge of the State Science and Technology Commission.    Lissouba arrived here at noon today for a seven-day state  visit to China at the invitation of Jiang Zemin. This is  Lissouba's first visit to China since he became president in  1992.</p>

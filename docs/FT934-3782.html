			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (6): A question of breeding - Case study / temperature control in Mr Lambkin's piggery Mr John Lambkin, who manages a farm for Farmers' Weekly magazine, was shocked to see how much energy he was losing from his pig breeding section where 3,000 animals are kept, writes Deborah Hargreaves. After an energy audit from experts at Adas, the government's farm advisory service, he was surprised to see the savings that could be made by introducing some straightforward improvements. 'Basically, they gave us a kick and said: you look at this every day and look at what you're missing. We hadn't appreciated how much energy was disappearing and how much that costs - when they did that sum, it made us wince,' Mr Lambkin said. Agriculture accounts for 5 per cent of the nation's annual energy consumption, but Adas believes that with a mix of education and advice, farmers can make significant savings as well as improving their environmental credentials. Two years ago, at the behest of the Department of Agriculture, the organisation launched a programme to educate farmers about energy conservation. This involved running a promotional and advertising campaign in the press as well as providing free farm visits where experts can offer advice on managing energy consumption. Mr Gareth Ellis, who runs the programme, said a team of advisers made 200 visits last year and are scheduled to see another 400 farms this year. Fuel bills can account for 20-30 per cent of total input costs on intensive livestock farms, horticultural holdings and for dairy producers and therefore these farmers are more interested in energy saving. But even a general farmer can end up paying 5-10 per cent of his total costs on power. 'We're offering a common sense approach to the farmer to point out some of the areas he needs to pay more attention to,' said Mr Ellis. 'It's not exciting, but it often helps to have another pair of eyes look at your energy use.' Adas advisers are looking for obvious failings such as lack of insulation, poor controls on heating units as well as efficiency of record keeping to see if the farmer really knows where his fuel is being used. They rank the farmers on the basis of their energy management: whether they are poor, good or above average. 'We kicked ourselves for not noticing some of these things before,' said Mr Lambkin who spends about Pounds 2,000 a month on electricity for heating his pig units. In other forms of intensive livestock production where chickens are kept indoors, farmers can be paying as much as Pounds 20,000 a year in heating costs for a unit containing 100,000 birds. Similarly a sow pig unit with 200 animals in it could cost Pounds 7,000 a year in fuel. Adas reckons farmers can save 10 to 20 per cent of their costs in these areas by cutting artificial lighting and using energy efficient lighting where possible, ensuring insulation is good and that heating units are regularly serviced and checked. An incorrect temperature setting of 1 degree C can increase energy use by 15 per cent. Mr Lambkin could save around Pounds 3,000 a year by modifying areas where young piglets are kept, Adas reported. The farmer is busy implementing all the recommendations made for insulating so-called 'forward creep' areas where young pigs may move to be comfortable away from their mothers. These are heated by infra-red lamps and Adas suggested cutting the wattage on these bulbs. However, other recommendations such as reducing the ventilation in the pig units have not been taken up as Mr Lambkin fears the risk of creating an unhealthy environment for the pigs. Another saving stressed by Adas is the use of off-peak electricity, for example, for feed processing or heating water in a dairy parlour. Crop drying and storage on arable farms is extremely energy intensive, but Adas advisers believe savings of up to 50 per cent are possible if energy efficient techniques and good management are used. Crops dry much more quickly in early autumn than later in the winter and farmers can make big savings by drying early. 'You can save a lot by good harvest management and getting your crops in early before dews are heavy and the moisture content is higher,' said Mr Roy Gabain who runs a 3,300-acre arable farm near Newmarket. He has also cut down on tractor use after recommendations from Adas showed he could save almost a third of his fuel costs. He does this mainly by using a lighter cultivator on fields for one to two years in a three-year rotation rather than a heavier plough which uses more fuel. Mr Gabain also stresses the importance of maintenance of farm machines and making sure that staff are adequately trained to use the vehicles properly. In addition, certain makes of tractor are more fuel-efficient than others. British farmers face an uncertain financial future as the effects of Common Agricultural Policy reform are felt and if subsidies are cut further as a result of a Gatt deal. This will make them even more cost-conscious and more anxious to trim fuel bills by adopting energy-efficient measures.</p>

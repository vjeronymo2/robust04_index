			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 (YONHAP) -- North Korea plans to move  the Japanese wives of Korean men in the North to near the  Yongbyon nuclear estate for use as a "human shield" against  possible attack by the United States, a leading Japanese weekly,  SHUKAN BUNSHUN, reported in its latest June 23 issue.    The weekly said the Japanese wives of those Korean men  repatriated from Japan to North Korea in the late 1950s are  officially estimated at 1,831 but their number would actually  run to thousands.    The report said it had obtained the information that some  Japanese women in North Korea flashed an "SOS" to Japanese  authorities, saying "we are about to be sent to an area near  nuclear facilities."    "If this is true, Pyongyang apparently intends to use the  Japanese wives as a human shield against possible U.S. attack on  nuclear facilities," a Japanese Defense Agency official was  quoted by the weekly as saying.    "This could also be a blackmail or retaliation against the  Japanese Government moving to join international sanctions  against North Korea over the nuclear question."</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Bonds: IFC brings CDollars 300m zero coupon deal The recent spate of Canadian dollar bond offerings continued yesterday, with deals for the International Finance Corporation and Canadian Global Funding, a special purpose vehicle. The heavy schedule of Canadian dollar eurobond redemptions, totalling CDollars 1.8bn in August, has prompted a steady flow of reinvestment into the Canadian market. European retail investors are replacing maturing bonds with new Canadian dollar bonds because they do not want to realise losses incurred on the currency. In addition, the high yields available in the Canadian market, which has sold off sharply this year, has attracted some new money to the market. With 10-year Canadian government bonds yielding nearly 200 basis points more than US Treasuries, investors are starting to look again at the market. IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, brought the first zero coupon deal in Canadian dollars for about a year, a CDollars 300m six-year deal arranged by Daiwa Europe. 'The market has sold off so much that zero coupon bonds now look quite attractive,' said a manager at the London arm of one Canadian house. 'It's a leveraged play on a positive outcome for the Canadian market,' he added. Also in the Canadian sector, Canadian Global Funding, a vehicle guaranteed by Financial Security Assurance, a specialist insurance company, added a further CDollars 100m to its CDollars 150m 10-year deal launched last week via Hambros. The combination of a 10 per cent coupon and a triple-A rating proved enticing for retail investors, who do not normally venture so far along the yield curve, and also attracted some institutions. The original deal was launched at a spread of 70 basis points over the curve, but had tightened to 68 basis points yesterday, the spread at which the new tranche was priced. British Telecommunications plans to set up a Dollars 1.5bn multi-currency Euro-commercial paper programme, arranged by NatWest Capital Markets, with a total of six dealers. The programme will be used, in conjunction with BT's existing Dollars 1bn US commercial programme, to finance the company's investment in a 20 per cent interest in MCI Communications.</p>

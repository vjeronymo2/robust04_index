			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Tariff deal hailed as breakthrough: Trade agreement puts pressure on Gatt negotiators to restart stalled Uruguay Round THE WORLD'S leading industrial nations yesterday agreed a potentially far-reaching tariff-cutting deal which could revive the long stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Before leaders of the Group of Seven countries began the 19th economic summit in Tokyo, top level trade negotiators delivered the long sought after draft agreement to expand market access for manufactured products. US president Bill Clinton hailed the agreement, reached by ministers from the 'Quad' group of countries - the US, the European Community, Japan and Canada - as 'good news for America and good news for the world'. It meant 'more jobs and higher incomes for our people'. Mr John Major, prime minister, said the agreement was 'infinitely bigger than anything we have seen before', while US officials predicted as many as 2m jobs could be created worldwide as a result of the trade deal. British officials estimated it could produce as many as 400,000 jobs in the UK over a 13-year period. Sir Leon Brittan, EC chief trade negotiator, said yesterday was 'an exciting day for world trade and good news for the world economy' and hailed the agreement as a 'breakthrough'. However, he pointed out that the market access agreement would have to be approved by the membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and that many other issues, such as agriculture, had to be resolved if the Uruguay Round negotiations were to be completed as hoped by the end of the year. Yesterday's agreement proposes: The elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers for eight categories of manufactured products. The harmonisation of tariffs on chemical products at low rates. Tariff cuts of up to 50 per cent where existing tariffs exceed 15 per cent. Negotiation of tariff cuts averaging at least one third on other products, with the possibility of cuts of more than 50 per cent on some items. There was also an agreement to progress to greater trade liberalisation in the services sector, particularly financial services and basic telecommunications. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, claimed the Quad pact was the 'biggest tariff-cutting agreement in history'. Mr Major said 80 to 90 per cent of the proposed Uruguay Round agreement was now in place. The summit of G7 countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - is expected to support yesterday's agreement, which will be presented to Gatt negotiators next Monday. Mr Major said the effect of this week's summit would be to put huge pressure on Gatt negotiators to reach a successful conclusion to the trade talks. The pact was given a generally favourable reception by the French government, which is holding up agreement on the liberalisation of farm trade. French officials said the government reacted 'prudently, but positively, to the news'. The US and Britain were quick to claim that Mr Clinton and Mr Major deserved the credit for the successful conclusion of the deal - claims that came as a surprise to at least one of the participants in the long-drawn-out talks. The US and EC agreed the breakthrough would not have been possible without a special effort by Japan, which surprised other Quad members by agreeing to eliminate tariffs on spirits. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, was enjoying the plaudits of his G7 trading partners, but he received a reminder that tariff cuts are not popular at home as the Japan Spirits and Liquor Makers' Association said it 'deeply regretted' Japan's contribution.

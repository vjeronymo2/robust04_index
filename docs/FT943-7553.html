			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Italian president defends central bank President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy yesterday defended the country's central bank against what he described as 'forms of aggression' by members of the Italian government after it raised two key interest rates nearly two weeks ago. Speaking to journalists at the forum for central European heads of government in Alpbach, Austria, Mr Scalfaro said 'everyone, beginning with the people in government, must respect (the bank's) autonomy'. Mr Scalfaro did not name the Bank of Italy's critics yesterday, but he reminded them that the central bank's independence provided 'security for everyone'. Tension between some members of the government and the Bank of Italy has increased since the bank decided to raise interest rates by half a point to defend the Italian currency against the effects of squabbling within the coalition. Instead of strengthening the lira, however, there was a further decline in its value against the D-Mark. Members of the extreme right National Alliance, one of three main coalition partners, also attacked the central bank last week for allegedly interfering in the proposed merger between Banca Nazionale delle Communicazioni - controlled by the Italian state railways - and San Paolo di Torino, one of the country's biggest banks. Other National Alliance members have threatened Mr Antonio Fazio, the central bank governor, with court action, and accused the bank of misusing funds. Mr Publio Fiori, the National Alliance transport minister, has accused the central bank, in its role as banking supervisor, of trying to push BNC into a merger with San Paolo, instead of considering alternative solutions which would preserve BNC's special relationship with the state railways. Yesterday, Mr Fiori met Mr Lamberto Dini, the treasury minister, to discuss a possible solution to the BNC affair ahead of a board meeting called for Saturday. According to a treasury statement, solutions could include 'varying the form of the deal'. One criticism levelled at the San Paolo merger is that it would involve an exchange of shares, whereas a smaller bank, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna, has made a cash offer. The Bank of Italy has refused to comment on the BNC affair, although sources have strongly denied the charge of improper use of funds. Banking sources yesterday expressed bemusement at the way in which what seemed to be a straightforward deal between BNC and San Paolo has been blown up into an important affair of state.</p>

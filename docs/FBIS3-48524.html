The Houai Sai-Chiang Khong  border gate was upgraded to the level of international in  accordance with an agreement reached between governments of Laos  and Thailand. The upgrade is aimed at creating favorable  conditions for the raising of trade relations and exchanges from  local to international levels. This border gate will also  create favorable conditions for foreign guests as well as  domestic travelers to travel to third countries.    There are now two international-level border gates at the  Lao-Thai border, namely the Tha Deua-Nong Khai and the Houai  Sai-Chiang Khong border gates.    A further report said that on 21 January, Charat Phuachuai,  deputy minister of communications of Thailand, donated 31.5  million kips in aid to the Bokeo provincial administration.  Accepting the aid on behalf of the provincial administration  was Khamsai Phomisai, deputy governor the province. Out of the  total, 30 million kips will be used to expand and asphalt a road  linking the municipal area and the provincial airport.  Meanwhile, the remaining 1.5 million kips will be used for the  rehabilitation of various temples in the municipal area. The  Thai deputy communications minister presented the aid to the  Bokeo provincial administration while leading a ceremonial  offering of yellow robes and alms to Buddhist monks at the Keo  Phonsavan temple in the municipal area of the province.</p>

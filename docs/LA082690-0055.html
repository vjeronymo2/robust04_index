			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIKING: THERE'S DEFINITE CATCH TO SAN GABRIEL TRAIL  </P> <P> For more than a century, Southern California fishermen have been hooking trout  in the San Gabriel River. The Pasadena Bait Club was the most prominent of  several early fishing camps catering to those looking for camaraderie, rustic  accommodations and good fishing.  </P> <P> Downriver, the San Gabriel (along with its sister streams the Santa Ana and the  Los Angeles) is best known for depositing the alluvium that now covers the  surface of the Los Angeles Basin.  </P> <P> Upriver, the San Gabriel has two major forks, each with a claim to fame. East  Fork is known for its gold, West Fork for its trout.  </P> <P> The 1890s were a particularly grand time to cast a line. But while most anglers  caught no more than the limit (50!), others were greedy and some even used  dynamite to "fish" for trout. California Gov. Henry H. Markham was hardly an  example of the conservation-minded sportsman; he once landed 98 fish in six  hours on the West Fork.  </P> <P> Eventually, the California Department of Fish and Game stepped in to enforce  limits and replenish the West Fork with fingerlings and trout brought in from  Lake Tahoe.  </P> <P> Today, West Fork -- its course determined by one of Southern California's most  significant faults, the San Gabriel -- is one of the best fishing rivers in  Southern California. Most of the West Fork has been set aside as a wild trout  preserve.  </P> <P> Fishing is of the "catch and release" variety. Barbless hooks must be used and  the daily limit is zero. Fishing for keeps is permitted along a portion of the  West Fork -- the first 1 1/2-mile stretch of river reached by trail from  Highway 39.  </P> <P> West Fork, as trout habitat, is still recovering from the desilting of Cogswell  Dam, which lies upriver. Some years ago, during less enlightened times,  Cogswell Dam was cleaned out and tons of silt were dumped into West Fork,  wiping out most of the fish population.  </P> <P> The river can be reached from a couple of different directions, but most  fishermen, as well as hikers and bicyclists, join the West Fork National Scenic  Trail that departs from Highway 39. The trail is actually an asphalt road built  at the same time as Cogswell Dam. Closed to vehicle traffic, the road is  popular with hikers, joggers and mountain bicyclists.  </P> <P> West Fork Trail meanders seven miles with the river to Glenn Camp. (The road  continues another 1 1/2 miles past Glenn Camp to Cogswell Reservoir, which is  closed to the public, and connects with Forest Service fire roads heading  west.) Hikers can travel the entire way to Glenn Camp or stop at a picnic or  fishing spot anywhere they choose.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: Weekend and holiday visitors to the popular San  Gabriel Canyon area must obtain a parking permit ($3 a day) for parking along  Highway 39, as far as the Crystal Lake turnoff.  </P> <P> You can get a permit from the Forest Service San Gabriel Entrance Station, open  8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday; early risers can buy their permits at  Daily Donuts or Circle Mobile Mart on Azusa Avenue in Azusa. These businesses  are open 24 hours.  </P> <P> From the Foothill Freeway (210) in Azusa, exit on Azusa Avenue (Highway 39) and  drive north. Fourteen miles later, and half a mile past the Forest Service's  San Gabriel Canyon Off Road Vehicle Area and Rincon Station, look for a parking  lot and locked gate on your left. Signed West Fork National Scenic Trail is the  asphalt road descending into the canyon.  </P> <P> The hike: Walk past the locked gate and down the road into the canyon. On the  weekends, you'll have plenty of company along the first mile of trail. Most of  these canyon visitors will be toting coolers, lawn chairs and fishing poles.  </P> <P> After a mile there is a flat area, the site of the Pasadena Bait Club. The  fishermen's headquarters burned in 1924, and the ruins washed away during the  flood of 1938.  </P> <P> The path intersects the unsigned Bear Creek Trail that leads north into the San  Gabriel Wilderness. Pioneers had many an encounter with grizzlies along this  creek, hence the name. After another half-mile, the trail again crosses the  river and enters the designated wild trout preserve.  </P> <P> Upriver, the road, which climbs very slowly but steadily, leads past many  tranquil oak- and sycamore-shaded pools.  </P> <P> Seven miles from the trailhead is Glenn Camp, set on a shady flat right by the  river. It's a peaceful place with half-a-dozen tables that invite a picnic.  </P> <P> West Fork National Scenic Trail  </P> <P> * Where: West Fork San Gabriel River, Angeles National Forest.  </P> <P> * Length: 14 miles round trip, shorter trips possible.  </P> <P> * Terrain: River canyon.  </P> <P> * Highlights: Trout fishing, picnicking.  </P> <P> * Precautions: Trail busy on weekends, popular with cyclists.

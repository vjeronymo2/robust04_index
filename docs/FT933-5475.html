			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / No red carpet to roll for Aristide: Canute James finds many Haitians unenthusiastic about a president's return HAITI'S new prime minister, Mr Robert Malval, installed his cabinet last night watched by the military high command, marking another significant step towards ending the two-year political crisis which began with the overthrow and exile of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. However, there has been obvious reluctance on the part of Haiti's legislators, military and supporters of the coup to implement the UN-brokered agreement preparing the way for the president's return on October 30. They have been prodded by international pressure in a direction in which they do not want to go, and rewarded by the lifting of an economic embargo which has crippled the already impoverished country. This obvious lack of enthusiasm, and the delicate nature of the remaining arrangements for the president's return, will make the next eight weeks a testing time for the new prime minister and the exiled president. Mr Aristide, who was clearly uncomfortable with parts of the agreement, will have to walk through a political quagmire which will test his so far unproven skills in statecraft and diplomacy. There are sufficient people in Haiti with a strong enough dislike for the president to make his stay in office uncomfortable. There are rogue elements in the military which are out of the current leadership's control, and which will hardly want to take orders from any new commander which the civilian government will appoint. They have been unhappy with the agreement reached by Mr Aristide and General Raoul Cedras, who is stepping down as the head of the army. They claim the accord has given the general a safe escape from the problem. Their dislike for President Aristide is hardly likely to be tempered by assurances that there will be no victimisation after his return. The UN agreement cannot speak for Mr Aristide's supporters, angry at the coup and the military's subsequent record of repression and murder. Several military officers appear convinced that despite all the undertakings, and the promised protection by an international force, the president will act against them. Similar fears are shared by affluent Haitians who supported the coup and denounced the president. Violence, either state-sponsored or popular, has never been far below the surface in Haiti. The Inter-American Human Rights Commission reported last week that at least 50 people had been killed since the agreement in July, and about 1,500 since the coup. The leaders of the coup may have good reason to be worried about their safety when civilian rule returns. There will also be increasing concern on the part of those military officers who have benefited from the use of Haiti for transshipping narcotics from South to North America, and who will consider their business threatened. Diplomats in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, have said repeatedly that the anti-Aristide sentiment can be marshalled effectively and viciously by Lt Col Michel Francois, the chief of the police force, which is a part of the army; he engineered the coup before handing over to Gen Cedras. The ranks of Mr Aristide's opponents have been increased by a resurgence of the Tontons macoutes, the feared and ruthless praetorian guard of the Duvalier dynasty. Mr Evans Nicolas, the self-styled leader of the revived macoutes, said he and his faction were ready for 'civil war' to thwart the return of the president. His support is significant in rural Hait,i where the military has tolerated the establishment of virtual fiefdoms by the macoutes, who are collecting taxes and responding brutally to any signs of support for Mr Aristide. There is little love lost between Mr Aristide and the Roman Catholic Church. Cardinal Nicolas Lopez Rodriguez, president of the Latin American Episcopal Council, said recently that the United Nations had 'blundered' in reinstating Mr Aristide, whom he described as being 'inexperienced in state affairs, insensitive and incompetent'. Behind the considerable and influential efforts of the US to have the coup overturned and Mr Aristide returned to the presidential palace, there is latent concern in Washington about the president's willingness, or his ability, to try to curb his more zealous supporters who might want to have a go at his detractors. The 1991 coup was preceded by charges from opposition groups - and which were apparently convincing to some US legislators - that Mr Aristide was actively inciting his supporters to violence. The difficulties which threaten an orderly return of the president were apparent to Mr Dante Caputo, the UN envoy who guided the negotiations. 'In a country which has had very short periods of democracy,' he concluded when the negotiations ended, 'it is very difficult for different political parties to believe that the words that are said in the paper are going to be respected.'</p>

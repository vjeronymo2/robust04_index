			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / EU poll issues that have guided Twelve campaigns: Belgium Voting Sunday. In a lacklustre campaign that has done little to provoke controversy, the three main political groupings in Belgium have presented a virtually united face on the need for monetary and political union and a social chapter. For Belgium's Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals, the desirability of a single currency is not in doubt. In a country where people put region before country, the Belgian franc inspires no great affection. Even the Liberals who allegedly favour Thatcherite economics believe a social chapter is important to raise the living standards of Europe's poorer workers. On integration all again are in favour although the nuances differ according to the cultural divide. Flemish voters, of whatever, have a very precise idea of how an integrated, federalist Europe should be structured. They favour one in which regions are more important than nation states, a notion less enthusiastically endorsed by the Francophone Walloons. LIKELY RESULT: Liberals expected to gain 25 per cent of vote, ahead of Christian Democrats and Socialists, with between 21 and 22 per cent, according to latest polls.</p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bananas on a growth curve - Fyffes' strategy for expansion in Europe and the US The 1994 year will be decisive for Fyffes, the Dublin-based fruit and vegetable distributor. The shadow boxing it has been engaging in for the past three years since its IPounds 60m rights issue is about to become a real test of financial muscle, business skill and stamina as its expansion plans in Europe and the US pitch it headlong into combat for market share with the established 'majors' such as Chiquita, Dole and Del Monte. Fortunately for Fyffes, the rules of engagement have been written in its favour. The new EU banana import regime, introduced last July, favours distributors that source bananas from the protected markets of African, Caribbean and Pacific producing countries - mainly from the Caribbean - as well as the cheaper 'dollar-banana' countries of Central and South America. Its rivals, which import primarily 'dollar bananas', stand to lose as much as 50 per cent of their market share under the new rules, according to analysts in Dublin, which is why the 'majors' and Latin American producer countries are fighting such a stiff rearguard action to have the new import regime challenged through GATT. Fyffes' expansion plan remains vulnerable to that challenge. Earlier this month it announced that its banana business will expand by more than 50 per cent in 1994, from 17m boxes to 28m, or some 500,000 tonnes in total. Until recently Fyffes was importing some 100,000 tonnes a year into the continental European market. By this time next year that figure is expected to have grown to more than 250,000 tonnes. Fyffes' bananas are about to become as familiar to German, Danish and French families as they are to British and Irish ones. Altogether, Fyffes will control about 14 per cent of the European market, placing it second in the European league behind Chiquita. The main source of this supply will be from a new 9,000-acre plantation in Guatemala, which is being financed by Fyffes, and which is also to feed some 2m boxes of bananas into the US this year. To secure the distribution chain, additional ships have been bought or chartered, and import licences have been purchased in the European market. Should the EU import regime now unravel, then Fyffes will be exposed to a free-for-all and oversupply in the market. Nonetheless, the company has a strong balance sheet with no debt and IPounds 92m (Pounds 88m) in cash. This puts it in a powerful position to sit out any price war, and to make substantial acquisitions on the European mainland to strengthen its control of the distribution network. According to Mr Carl McCann, finance director, 'up to IPounds 300m' could be spent on acquisitions, which would take gearing to a still-manageable 100 per cent. Entering the US market has been the other leg of Fyffes' strategic development plan. This will be 'a very cautious and phased development', according to Mr McCann. Some 2m boxes of bananas are planned to be sold there this year, but this will be increased as opportunities arise and will provide a 'safety valve' should prices weaken in Europe. Mr David McCann, managing director in charge of operations, explained that the new Guatemalan plantation puts Fyffes closer to the US market than most of its competitors, giving it an edge in transport costs. A reefer ship is now dedicated to this trade, but is still a long way from carrying full loads, so the maximum benefits of Fyffes' geographical advantage will only be realised as its share of the US market grows. Despite the lingering uncertainties, analysts in Dublin have been impressed by the group's plans and pleased that management has finally shaken off a traditional reticence about discussing group strategy with brokers and financial journalists. 'We can at least now see where they are going and make better judgments and forecasts,' said one analyst. Most brokers have upgraded their forecasts and are predicting pre-tax profits of about IPounds 35m this year, rising to almost IPounds 40m in 1995. However, cynical minds among them have questioned whether the motivation for this new-found desire for frankness and publicity might not be pointed in another direction. Last year, Dole made a friendly bid for Fyffes at 115p per share, which prior to the bid had been a six-year high. Fyffes would be a prize acquisition for one of the 'majors' under the new EU regime. Key shareholders, including the McCann family which controls 8 per cent of the company, considered the bid carefully, but then turned it down. Since then the share price has fallen back and languished at about 100p to 105p. Mr Neil McCann, executive chairman, said he had 'no regrets' for having rejected the offer. But when asked if he would consider another approach by Dole he said: 'We will look at anything that comes along, and we will look at it on its merits.'</p>

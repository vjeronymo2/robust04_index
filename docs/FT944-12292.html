			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Government failing to shape opinion Sir I was delighted to hear reports that Lord Howe is forming a group to argue the case for Europe ('Howe warns on Tory EU rebels', October 17). I find nothing more depressing today than the way in which almost all the UK's difficulties are attributed to Brussels or to Brussels bureaucracy. To me, the issue is simple. The UK is a small country which is not particularly well endowed with natural resources. So far as the future is concerned, we shall not be successful economically or influential politically unless we play a leading role in a strong Europe. Similarly, Europe will not be strong unless its members act together and cede certain of their powers to the Union, something we have already committed ourselves to do. Working with our fellow members of the European Union to create a strong and powerful Europe is clearly not a simple task. To me, however, contrary to what seems to be the accepted view in this country, it is not only very important but also a very stimulating, exciting and challenging prospect. I recognise, of course, that there are many aspects of the European Union which are unsatisfactory and in substantial need of improvement. It must, for instance, become much more democratically accountable. The UK should be striving to make changes as a committed member, not acting as if it were a country reluctantly involved in a Union of which it would really prefer not to be part. The greatest failure of the present government in the UK is, in my view, its failure to appreciate and to communicate to all of us how important Europe is. It is not a good excuse to say that public opinion is against Europe at the moment. The job of political leaders is to shape public opinion, especially on an issue of such vital importance to our future. Sir Jeffery Bowman, The Old Rectory, Boreham, Nr. Chelmsford, Essex CM3 3EP</p>

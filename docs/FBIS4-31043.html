			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Bekcic from Gorazde] </F>   [Excerpt] Instead of withdrawing from the 3-km zone, as  the UN Security Council Resolution No. 913 and the NATO  ultimatum dictate, the chetniks around Gorazde have been  changing their uniforms. First they were soldiers, then the  civilian police, and now they are armed civilians. In the next  stage one can expect that they will strip to the waist.    On 3 June at 1100 they occupied the same positions they have  occupied for the last 40 days. The issue of the right bank is  obscuring the fact that the chetniks have not withdrawn from the  3-km zone on the left bank either. Thus, there is still a  chetnik stronghold in Sjenokos which is 2.5 km from the town  center. Last night and this morning frequent infantry  provocations were exhibited from these positions. The defense  lines in the northwest of the battlefield, on the free territory  of Rogatica Commune, have been attacked by artillery since  yesterday afternoon. It is the Muslim part of the village of  (?Vrazovice) that has been targeted. Needless to say, the  projectiles have been fired from within the 20-km exclusion  zone. [passage omitted]</p>

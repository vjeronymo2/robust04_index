			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Telekom decision postponed The German government yesterday surprised the world's leading investment banks by postponing until next month the decision over which of them will be chosen to handle the international side of the DM15bn (Pounds 6bn) privatisation of Deutsche Telekom. A decision had been expected yesterday after a meeting of postal and finance ministry officials. But strong lobbying from European banks which were concerned that the position of global co-ordinator might go to a US institution, appears to have persuaded the government that more time was necessary in view of the share issue's political and financial sensitivity. Banks close to the talks said that the government was now leaning towards a more balanced solution in which both a US and a UK investment house would work with the German banks - expected to be Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank  -leading the issue. The US and UK are expected to provide most foreign institutional and private interest in the issue; banks estimate that these countries will account for some DM3bn worth of share purchases each, compared with the DM8.5bn or so likely to be sold in Germany. Government and Deutsche Telekom officials had talks in Washington with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week about a US listing by means of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Because of their strong placing power and teams of analysts, US investment banks have been prominent in the list of candidates for the lucrative global co-ordinating role. European banks have been arguing in Bonn that a UK-based bank, experienced in large privatisations such as those of British Telecom and energy companies, should also be chosen; the Deutsche Telekom issue, likely to take place early in 1996, will be one of the biggest in Europe. US banks with the strongest chances include Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. In the UK, they include SG Warburg, Kleinwort Benson and NM Rothschild. CS First Boston has put itself forward solely for the role of adviser to the government. Some 22 banks took part in 'beauty contests' to help decide which should play the main foreign roles.</p>

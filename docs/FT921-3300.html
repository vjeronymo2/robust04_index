			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / BBC review may cut 10,000 jobs THE BBC should review the potential for contracting out all its activities, which could cost up to 10,000 jobs over the next five years, according to an internal working party. The radical recommendations are contained in a confidential report by one of the 15 task forces set up to look at every aspect of the BBC's role in advance of the renegotiation of its Royal Charter, which runs out in 1996. Recommendations from all the task forces are being collated and will be considered by the BBC board of management and governors in May. The task force on BBC services argues that all BBC activities should be reviewed this year to see whether they are suitable for contracting out. Some BBC departments could even be 'privatised' by sale or management buy-out. The committee, chaired by Mr Bob Pugh, general manager of administrative services at London Television Centre, says implementation should start by early next year. The document, leaked to the Bectu broadcasting union, says: 'Rapid implementation would help show politicians, civil servants and the public that the corporation has a genuine commitment to becoming leaner and more efficient.' At the beginning of last year there were about 23,500 staff in the home services of the BBC - 25,000 including BCC Enterprises and Open University production staff. The savings mentioned in the report would come from buying in services and from Producer Choice, the BBC initiative allowing producers to buy services on the open market. Mr Michael Checkland, BBC director general, has repeatedly emphasised that the corporation would remain a significant programme producer. Mr Roger Bolton, the Bectu official responsible for BBC members, said: 'What you are looking at is the disintegration of the BBC as a programme maker.' Earlier this month Mr Robin Corbett, Labour's broadcasting spokesman, wrote to Mr Checkland warning that the nature of the corporation was being changed irreversibly in advance of a public debate getting under way.</p>

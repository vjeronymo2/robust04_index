			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIDEL CASTRO: THE LAST CAUDILLO ;  </P> <P> THE CHALLENGE IS TO BE PREPARED WHEN THE END COMES  </P> <P> These are lonely days for Fidel Castro.  </P> <P> Cuba's jefe maximo always fancied himself a special character on the world  stage -- a key actor not just in Latin America, where he was a symbol of  revolutionary change, but also in the Soviet Bloc, for which he was an outpost  near the U.S. mainland. But even Fidel's friends have been wondering lately  whether time has passed him by. The answer is yes. And events of the last few  weeks only emphasize just how much of an anachronism Castro has become.  </P> <P> Start with the rapid collapse of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe and the  accelerating reform effort inside the Soviet Union itself. Castro was never a  fan of Mikhail Gorbachev, or of perestroika. But as the Soviet leader  consolidates his position in Moscow and former Warsaw Pact nations like Poland  and Hungary go their own way, Fidel looks like the last Stalinist in the world.  </P> <P> His Latin American friends are in retreat, too. The Sandinistas have been voted  out by the Nicaraguan people and must now learn to work as a real political  party or be relegated to the dustbin of history. The guerrillas in El Salvador  would end the long civil war there if they were given a chance to negotiate.  And the toughest rebels in the Western Hemisphere, Peru's Sendero Luminoso, say  flatly that Castro's a wimp.  </P> <P> Fidel doesn't even have anybody on the Latin American right to commiserate  with: Chile's Augusto Pinochet is out, so Castro has the dubious distinction of  being the last old-style dictator in Latin America. For the man whose victory  over Fulgencio Batista in 1959 was supposed to inspire revolutions throughout  the region, being the last caudillo may be the cruelest irony of all.  </P> <P> Castro has been so much trouble for the U.S. government for so long -- eight  presidents have worried about him, with little to show for it -- that some in  Washington understandably might be tempted to gloat. But what U.S.  policy-makers should be doing instead is planning to use the opportunity  presented by Castro's growing isolation to try and draw Cuba back into the  American (in the broadest sense of that word) system.  </P> <P> The Soviet news media have begun criticizing Castro for refusing to join  communism's reform movement. That could presage a reduction of the $5 billion  per year in Soviet aid Castro gets.If that aid ends, he'll have to look for  help elsewhere; and if his neighbors are ready to respond, they can demand that  he behave himself in exchange.  </P> <P> But even if Castro refuses to face reality, he won't live forever. There is no  one to take his place, and once he's gone, Cuba will change. By preparing now,  the United States and the other democratic nations of the Americas can help  ensure that the process is peaceful, like Czechoslovakia's, rather than  violent, like Romania's.  </P></p>

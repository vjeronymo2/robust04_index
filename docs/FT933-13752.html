			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / 'Green' secrecy over oil lifted THE GOVERNMENT is to publish environmental conditions attached to oil exploration licences for the first time, Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said yesterday. The move comes amid growing public concern on the issue. The Department of Trade and Industry said it had received an 'awful lot of letters' about the award of licences in the latest offshore oil exploration round. For the first time the government has opened up some environmentally sensitive areas close to shore. Mr Eggar also imposed strict environmental conditions on some companies. They include restrictions on activity at certain times when sea birds are mating or moulting. Environmental groups have been pushing the government to tighten restrictions and even to exclude certain areas from oil industry activity. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, called the publication of the environmental conditions 'purely and simply a public relations exercise'. Environmental groups may tackle the award of some licences at European Community level because they believe they could infringe EC conventions.</p>

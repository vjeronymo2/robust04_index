			<p>BFN     [Text] Mulhouse (DPA) -- Germany and France want to make  armament cooperation even more effective. During their  discussions in Mulhouse on Tuesday [31 May] the two defense  ministers, Volker Ruehe and Francois Leotard, came out in favor  of building a new military cargo plane. The experience of the  civilian aircraft producer Airbus Industries are to be used in  this venture.    There is "a strategic demand" for the new cargo plane, which  is to have a greater range than the current planes with a view  to international missions, German delegation circles said. A  study on the plans will be drawn up in the Western European  Union by next year.</p>

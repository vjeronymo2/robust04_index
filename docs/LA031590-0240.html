			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIET LAW STILL APPLIES, RESTIVE LITHUANIA TOLD  </P> <P> The Soviet Parliament ruled today that Lithuania's declaration of independence  was invalid and said Soviet law is still in force in the Baltic republic.  </P> <P> A resolution, proposed by the parliamentary leadership, was passed by a vote of  1,463 to 94.  </P> <P> The resolution passed by the Congress of People's Deputies, the expanded  Parliament, also turned over to Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev  responsibility for "ensuring the lawful rights of every person" in Lithuania.  </P> <P> The republic's Parliament declared its independence from the Soviet Union on  Sunday. Gorbachev has said the move was invalid but no action has been taken to  enforce Soviet law on the territory of the republic.  </P> <P> "The Congress states that according to Article 74 and 75 of the U.S.S.R.  Constitution, the decision of Lithuania's Sejm (Parliament) is invalid," the  Congress' resolution said.  </P> <P> Those articles say Soviet law has the same force in all Soviet republics, that  all-union law prevails over republican law, and defines the Soviet Union as the  composite of the 15 republics.  </P> <P> "Confirming the right of every republic to secede, the Congress rules that  until the law determining the order of secession is adopted, the decisions  taken by Lithuania's Sejm on March 10-12 are invalid," the resolution said.  </P> <P> Earlier there had been fierce debate over the resolution, which was introduced  by Rafik Nishanov, the chairman of the Council of Nationalities, one of the two  chambers of the Supreme Soviet, the standing Parliament.  </P> <P> "Does this mean that we are to ignore the will of Lithuania expressed through  the highest body in the republic?" asked Yuri Boldyrev, a deputy from  Leningrad.  </P> <P> "We don't want any military confrontation against the will of the people," said  Alexander Lbolensky, a radical deputy from Kalingrad, which is located between  Lithuania and Poland.  </P> <P> Gorbachev has said a government commission, headed by Prime Minister Nikolai  Ryzhkov, will study the issue and announce public policy. The commission is  expected to meet with both Lithuanians and Estonians, who are also  contemplating a breakaway move.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JOB-HUNGRY MUSCOVITES TURN TO MCDONALD'S  </P> <P> McDonald's Corp. said Wednesday that more than 25,000 Muscovites have responded  to a single help-wanted ad in a newspaper seeking to fill 630 crew positions at  the chain's first restaurant in Moscow.  </P> <P> Applications are continuing to filter in, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> The McDonald's restaurant on Pushkin Square is scheduled to open Jan. 31. It  will be the fast-food giant's largest operation, seating 700 people indoors and  200 more outside and is expected to serve more than 15,000 customers a day.  </P> <P> Moscow-McDonald's, the joint venture between McDonald's Restaurants of Canada  Ltd., a unit of Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's Corp., and the Foodservice  Administration of the Moscow City Council, plans to eventually open 20  restaurants in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> A spokesman said that so far 550 crew members have been hired for the Moscow  operation. Staff will begin training next month and will earn $2.25 (1.5  rubles) an hour, to be increased after three months, based on productivity.  </P> <P> The company said that in recent weeks, it conducted more than 3,100 interviews,  seven days a week, 10 hours a day at McDonald's Moscow office.  </P> <P> McDonald's said the applicants have varied backgrounds, ranging from housewives  re-entering the work force or seeking their first jobs to students from Moscow  University. About 20% said they know two languages.  </P> <P> As of Sept. 30, McDonald's had 10,873 restaurants worldwide, including 2,763  outside the United States.  </P> <P> "McDonald's has spent a lot of time and money on developing an international  presence, which now represents about 30% of its business," said analyst Richard  Pyle at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood. "The Moscow venture should help them bear  some fruit from the investment."  </P> <P> Analysts said that considering an average sale at McDonald's is about $2.50 to  $3, the Moscow outlet may generate $13.7 million annually. The typical  McDonald's unit brings in about $1.6 million in yearly revenue, they said.  </P></p>

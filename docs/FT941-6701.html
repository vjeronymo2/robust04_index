			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Japan reviews defence policy The Japanese government yesterday opened the first review of defence policy for nearly 20 years. A nine-member panel of busi-nessmen, academics and civil servants, named by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, held its first meeting and is to re-port by the summer on Japan's changing defence needs. It will have to strike a balance between pressure for defence cuts and fears of weaker US commitment to Japan's security when regional stability is at risk. 'As the world has changed dramatically after the collapse of the Cold War structure, our handling of defence and security must change as well,' Mr Hosokawa told the panel yesterday. Any change in defence policy is politically sensitive. Only three months ago, Mr Keisuke Nakanishi, director-general of the defence agency (the Japanese equivalent of defence minister), resigned after suggesting Japan's pacifist constit-ution be revised to let its soldiers take a combat role under United Nations command. Japan's military, at 246,000 personnel, is already small by the standards of its regional neighbours - less than half the size of that of South Korea. Defence spending per head is smaller than Italy's. This is a consequence of Japan's post-war pacifism and reliance on 24,000 US troops, 190 aircraft, and the 60 vessels of the US Seventh Fleet stationed in and around Japan. The government has started to squeeze the defence budget, after more than a decade of above-average increases. It will rise this year by only 0.8 per cent, the smallest increase for 34 years. The Japanese military is also planning to reduce the number of army bases by 40 per cent from 1996. The right wing of the government coalition believes the personnel reduction should be accompanied by more spending on electronic defence, such as the two advanced airborne warning and control systems aircraft and the upgraded computers for Patriot missiles included in this year's budget. On the other side of the debate, the Social Democratic party, largest member of the coalition, is in theory committed to unarmed neutrality, but is content simply to see a continued squeeze on defence spending.</p>

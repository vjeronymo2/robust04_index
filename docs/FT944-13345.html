			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: BCH drops sale of Azucarera holding Banco Central Hispano, the Spanish banking group, has dropped plans to sell its controlling 47% stake in General Azucarera, Spain's second-ranked sugar company, to Saint-Louis, the French food and paper group, and to the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle, after strong objections from the Spanish agriculture ministry, which is determined to protect the domestic sector from outsiders. The bank has also refused to sell its stake in Azucarera to a consortium, backed by the ministry, which was led by Acor, a co-operative owned by sugar-farmers and the third-largest domestic producer. The stalemate is a setback for BCH, which is anxious to reduce its industrial assets to inject greater liquidity into its core financial business. Before the ministry stepped in, the bank had an agreement to sell an initial 20 per cent of its Azucarera holding to Saint-Louis and Tate &amp; Lyle, which jointly own 20 per cent of the sugar company, for Pta20bn (Dollars 160m). The counter-offer, which matched the Pta5,100 per Azucarera share agreed with the foreign groups and bid for the entire BCH stake in the sugar producer, was nevertheless unacceptable to BCH because it was supported by Banco Popular. The bank would have bought 10 per cent of Azucarera's equity and taken over its banking business. The rival bid was also resisted by Mr Jose Joaquin Ysasi-Ysamendi, Azucarera chairman, who objected to being pushed by the government into the arms of Acor, a group that has long been considered a maverick by the rest of Spain's sugar sector because it has steadfastly refused to back media campaigns and other joint initiatives organised by the domestic industry. The row over BCH has raised questions over whether a Spanish group can sell assets to whom it chooses, and whether foreign companies can buy freely into Spanish companies. The ministry argued that an Acor-led takeover of Azucarera, which accounts for 23 per cent of the domestic sugar market, would protect Spain's sugar quota in the EU. The issue is a sensitive one, for the sugar sector represents one of Spain's few triumphs over the common agricultural policy; the quota guaranteed to Spanish producers slightly exceeds domestic demand and has a support price somewhat above the EU average. The argument received short shrift from Mr Ysasi-Ysamendi who said the government was acting 'for all sorts of wrongheaded patriotic and protectionist reasons'.</p>

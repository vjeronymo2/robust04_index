			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cornwell Parker aided by low interest CORNWELL PARKER, the furniture and fabrics group, lifted annual profits by 2.6 per cent despite a decline in turnover caused by what Mr Martin Jourdan, chairman, described as 'the lowest demand for many years.' Pre-tax profits in the year to July 31 increased to Pounds 8.26m (Pounds 8.05m) helped by a sharp reduction in net interest payments to Pounds 29,000 (Pounds 543,000). Although turnover slipped by 3 per cent to Pounds 90m (Pounds 92.8m) in 'extremely difficult market conditions', Mr Jourdan said about a third of sales came from new products successfully introduced in the last two years. These products, in both the furniture and fabrics divisions, combined with 'stringent management controls' and further cost reductions, helped maintain operating margins at over 9 per cent. Overall trading profits slipped to Pounds 8.29m (Pounds 8.59m) with most of the decline coming in the furniture division which bore the Pounds 250,000 costs of a management consultancy report on the Nathan Furniture business. Trading profits in the furniture division fell by 5 per cent to Pounds 5.37m (Pounds 5.65m) on turnover down 4.1 per cent to Pounds 55.8m (Pounds 58.2m). However, the division, led by Parker Knoll which increased profits for the seventh successive year, was able to increase market share and maintain operating margins. The fabrics division posted trading profits of Pounds 2.92m (Pounds 2.94m) on turnover of Pounds 34.2m (Pounds 34.6m) and was also able to finance the launch of new ranges and brands 'invaluable in the fight for increased market share.' After the end of the financial year the group bought Fardis from Osborne &amp; Little to strengthen its position in the French fabrics market. Earnings per share rose to 13.3p (13.2p); the final dividend goes up to 4p making a total of 5.7p (5.5p). COMMENT During the recession the management has wisely focused on reducing working capital, cutting costs and improving productivity, while still funding the launch of a stream of new products. Once the upturn comes, Cornwell Parker will be among the first to benefit, but with neither the housing market nor high street spending showing any real signs of a pick-up, it is stuck in a holding pattern. The share price peaked at 239p the end of May, but the long-awaited recovery failed to materialise and it has since sunk to 188p. With pre-tax profits expected to total about Pounds 8.75m this year, and earnings per share of perhaps 14p, the shares are trading on a prospective p/e of 13.4 and look like a reasonably cheap buy for the optimist.</p>

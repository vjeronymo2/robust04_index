			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / US move to ease Bosnia arms ban angers Nato allies: France calls for emergency meeting on embargo The US sought yesterday to smooth over a rift with its allies after Britain and France voiced strong concern over President Bill Clinton's decision to stop enforcing the United Nations arms embargo against Bosnia. Mr Alain Juppe, the French foreign minister, told Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, that France was 'deeply worried by this unilateral decision that we can only regret'. Mr Juppe called for an emergency meeting of the international contact group on Bosnia, which consists of the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, also described the US move as worrying but his spokesman said UK fears were eased by a telephone conversation with Mr Christopher. The US secretary of state told Mr Hurd that although US ships and aircraft would be withdrawn from the embargo enforcement, US officers assigned to Nato - which oversees the operation - would continue their duties. Mr Willy Claes, the new secretary-general of Nato, confirmed that the alliance still intended to enforce the embargo without direct US assistance. Defence officials in Washington said US ships and aircraft would stop taking part in efforts to block ships carrying arms to Bosnia from early tomorrow. US ships will remain in the region to enforce the blockade against Montenegro, an ally of Serbia. A senior US defence official said the US measures did 'not amount to a unilateral end of the Bosnian arms embargo'. He said the US would not supply arms to Bosnia, and would still bar US citizens from doing so, in compliance with the UN resolution that established the embargo. If a US vessel intercepted a ship carrying arms bound for the Bosnian government, it would allow it to go on its way and make no report to its Nato allies. Nor would it pass on other intelligence on arms shipments bound for Bosnia. 'We are now required to identify that information as US-only and we are obligated by the legislation not to forward that information through normal channels as part of the Nato structure and the UN structure,' a senior military official said. UK officials said the US routinely shared satellite information with its Nato allies, and provided Britain with higher quality information under a bilateral arrangement. It seemed unlikely that this co-operation would be called into question. In Moscow, the Russian parliament criticised the US move and said it 'would lead to chaos and arbitrary behaviour in international relations'. It also criticised the White House for being swayed by domestic political concerns, a reference to this week's US elections. The Serb-dominated Yugoslav government accused Washington of siding with one party in a civil war and expressed 'deep regret and concern' over the decision. However, a Bosnian Serb official dismissed the move as a 'diplomatic game about something which is unimportant, because the Moslems are already armed.' Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, hailed Washington's move as a 'turning-point in the understanding of the Bosnian problem.' The situation in Bosnia worsened as the city of Mostar, already ravaged by last year's Croat-Moslem conflict, came under Serb shelling and heavy fighting raged nearby.</p>

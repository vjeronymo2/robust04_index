			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Split looms as SDP jettisons principles For nearly half a century since it was founded in 1945, Japan's socialist party fought in opposition for policies which they considered crucial in building their ideal of a better Japanese society. But a brief eight months in power has forced the Social Democratic party of Japan to write off, one by one, many of the principles for which it had so resolutely stood all those years in opposition. Yesterday's endorsement by the SDP of the government policy agreement was just the latest humiliating climbdown for the party. While the vague wording of the agreement leaves the socialists some room for manoeuvre, there is no doubt in the public mind that the SDP has reneged on many key election promises. 'It was a statement of complete surrender,' Mr Minoru Morita, a political commentator, said of the final agreement on taxation and defence that were wrenched from the party early yesterday. 'Have they lost all pride?' he asked. Having fought vigorously against the country's 3 per cent consumption tax when it was introduced five years ago, the SDP has now agreed that indirect taxes would eventually be raised. The party's policy of strictly adhering to Japan's pacifist constitution has been undermined by the agreement that in the face of North Korea's nuclear threat, Japan would 'prepare contingency plans under close co-operation with the United States, South Korea and, if necessary, other Asian countries.' The latest turnround follows the SDP's capitulation last year on the opening of Japan's rice market, a move the party had vigorously opposed. The party's record of giving in to the right wing of the coalition gives credence to the view that the SDP today is 'like the snow that clings to the bottom of the clog. No matter what happens it will not let go,' as one SDP diet member lamented. The latest sacrifice of principle to pragmatism will have divisive repercussions in the SDP which itself is a motley grouping of politicians ranging from extreme left-wing to moderate liberal. Already Ms Manae Kubota, head of the Economic Planning Agency and an SDP member, has criticised yesterday's agreement and expressed concern that it might 'have a bad effect on the economy.' She said that her party may have 'jumped the gun' by agreeing to the tax changes. If such differences continue to surface within the party it could lead to a split, with many socialists being drawn closer to the rest of the coalition and the more hardline leftist members returning to opposition.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: UK electricity Seeboard deserves two cheers for advancing shareholder interests. The first cheer is for yesterday's 21 per cent increase in its interim dividend per share. Such an increase may not have been hard to finance, given its cash pile. The temptation could have been to raise the dividend by the 17 per cent which prevailed last year. The total sum paid out has, in fact, gone up 17 per cent; but because the company also recently bought back 5 per cent of its equity, dividends per share rose more. Where Seeboard has shown the way, other electricity companies would do well to follow. The second cheer is for Seeboard's statement that it plans to distribute all its stock in the National Grid direct to its shareholders. That is despite the fact that it will experience a 'modest' cash outflow, because the special dividend to be paid to the recs from the Grid will not quite cover capital gains tax and rebates to customers. The temptation might have been to keep a few Grid shares and then sell them in the market to cover any cash shortfall. Again, all recs are so overcapitalised that they should follow Seeboard's practice. Where Seeboard was disappointing was in refusing to promise future share buy-backs or special dividends. Seeboard and other recs could easily live with gearing over 50 per cent, which would imply returning cash to shareholders much more aggressively than hitherto. One hopes the management's coyness merely reflects a desire to keep a third cheer up its sleeve for the moment.</p>

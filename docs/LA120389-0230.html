			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT TIME FOR ALL AT HOLIDAY PARADE  </P> <P> As the sounds of military music filled the downtown area Saturday morning, Pfc.  Marco Cabibbo, a reservist at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, stood  behind a tub of toys that eventually will brighten the Christmas of  underprivileged children.  </P> <P> One of the toys had been tossed into the barrel by a boy who wasn't tall enough  to look into the cardboard, 50-gallon drum.  </P> <P> "He told me, 'This is for another little boy,' " Cabibbo said. "That was really  great."  </P> <P> The air was full of Christmas spirit Saturday morning as thousands of people  flocked to the Civic Center area of Santa Ana for the Sixth Annual Times Orange  County Holiday Parade and Tournament of Champions.  </P> <P> The theme of this year's parade, dubbed "California's Other Parade," was  "Traveling to a Holiday Adventure." The procession included more than 25 floats  festooned with flowers, 150 horses, 16 marching bands and eight gigantic helium  balloons that floated several stories above the crowd.  </P> <P> In addition, the U.S. Marine Corps helped fulfill the dreams of disadvantaged  children by collecting for its Toys for Tots program during the  6,000-participant parade, which wound its way for seven blocks in 90 minutes.  </P> <P> This year's turnout was estimated to top last year's 30,000 attendance. For  many of the parade goers who lined Broadway, 17th and Main streets, the event  was a perfect way to kick off the Christmas season, despite the unseasonable  heat that caused many to doff shirts and shoes. The temperature rose to 83  degrees in downtown Santa Ana, said Bill Hibbert at WeatherData.  </P> <P> Shouts of "Merry Christmas!" and "Feliz Navidad!" to parade participants were  common along the route. The Disneyland contingent that included cartoon  chipmunks Chip and Dale passed by blaring, "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the  Year," a song made famous in the animated television special "Rudolph the  Red-Nosed Reindeer."  </P> <P> "I like it, especially the big Popeye," said 6-year-old onlooker Cheyenne  Knight, referring to the oversize cartoon character that floated down the  streets.  </P> <P> Dignitaries in the parade included former astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man  to walk on the moon; Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the County Board of  Supervisors; 11-year-old Tony Aliengena, the San Juan Capistrano boy who  piloted a small plane around the world this year; Umberto Luna, a popular radio  personality for the Spanish-language station KTNQ, and cowboy star Monte  Montana.  </P> <P> By 11:30, parade participants -- many of whom were wearing heavy costumes --  began to suffer from the worsening heat.  </P> <P> Just before the city's float was launched, Miss Huntington Beach and her court,  all in satin dresses, were beginning to wilt along with the flowers.  </P> <P> "It's really hot," complained Cheryl Martin, one of four runners-up riding  alongside queen Tracy Sawyer.  </P> <P> Police Lt. Earl Porter said the crowd was well-behaved and traffic control went  smoothly although major thoroughfares were closed throughout the day.  </P> <P> But the parade was not without some minor glitches. About half an hour before  it began, workers were frantically trying to patch up holes in the inflatable  Raggedy Andy that had unexpectedly appeared.  </P> <P> One glitch had scary overtones as a U.S. Marine Corps equestrian team member  lost control of his mount early in the parade.  </P> <P> The mounted Marine lost his hat and almost lost his grasp on the flag he was  carrying as the horse bucked and spun around. The horse, apparently spooked by  the first blaring notes of the Santa Ana Unified School District marching band,  nearly ran into a crowd of onlookers sitting on the curb.  </P> <P> The parade was held in conjunction with the 16th annual marching band  competition of the Southern California School Band and Orchestra Assn.  Twenty-four school bands, chosen from about 450 in Southern California,  competed in the tournament at Santa Ana Stadium, Corrigan said.  </P></p>

This means that the political forces  that support the government -- the PSDB and the PMDB [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] members who do not follow Orestes  Quercia -- are again considering the candidacy of Deputy Antonio  Britto (PMDB-RS [Rio Grande do Sul]), who is campaigning to run  for governor of Rio Grande do Sul State.    Following the PMDB executive board meeting that decided to  call the party political council to discuss the impasse created  by Quercia's candidacy, PMDB President Deputy Luiz Henrique  admitted he is receiving strong pressure from the presidents of  regional PMDB offices to endorse Britto's candidacy for  president of the Republic.    Jereissati confirmed a report published by O GLOBO stating  that the two parties' leaders recently have established contacts  to support Britto. Such efforts, however, were defeated by the  launching of Quercia's candidacy, Jereissati said.    "There was a tacit agreement that the PMDB would support  Fernando Henrique and that the PSDB would support Britto. There  still exists the possibility to resume contacts and that the  PSDB will support Britto," Jereissati said.    The PSDB president -- whose party stems from a split over  Quercia's leadership of the PMDB -- does not even consider  discussing Quercia's estrangement from the alliance because it  will be a natural consequence of the official launching of  Britto's candidacy.    "Britto will become a candidate only if the PMDB solves the  problem of Quercia's candidacy. That seems to be the only  obstacle. Once it is solved, we will be able to hold concrete  talks about an alliance," Jereissati said.    Just like the PSDB president, most PSDB congressmen in  Brasilia began to have doubts about Fernando Henrique's  candidacy. Such doubts were expressed during Cardoso's 48-hour  trip to the United States, during which he put in second place  the subject of the scope of an alliance that could support him.  First place, for him, was the political appropriateness of  leaving his post at such an essential moment for the economic  stabilization program.    The PMDB has internally resumed the discussion about  Britto's  candidacy independently of eventual PSDB support. Quercia  followers who consider his candidacy suicidal are considering  alternatives like Goias Governor Iris Rezende or former  President Jose Sarney.</p>

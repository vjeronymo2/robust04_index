			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's delegation to the Council of Europe does  not wish to attach much value to the statements made by Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, the chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party.  Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the  Russian Duma, who heads the delegation visiting Finland, says  that he takes Zhirinovskiy exactly as seriously as he deserves.  Lukin, who arrived in Helsinki today, pointed out that  Zhirinovskiy represented only a small section of the second  chamber of the Russian parliament, i.e., the Duma. According to  Lukin, Zhirinovskiy is behaving as if 80 percent of the  parliamentary deputies were behind him.    The Finnish and Russian Council of Europe delegations began  a  two-day seminar in Helsinki today discussing Russia's prospects  of becoming a member of the Council of Europe. Zhirinovskiy,  who arrived in Finland already yesterday, thought that the  Baltic countries still belonged to Russia. The statement is in  sharp conflict with conditions for membership in the Council of  Europe. David Atkinson, chairman of the committee that handles  the Council's relations with countries outside the organization,  sharply criticized Zhirinovskiy at the seminar that opened today.</p>

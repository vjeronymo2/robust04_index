			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Nottinghamshire exports fall COMPANIES IN Nottinghamshire have suffered a sharp decline in export orders with the worsening recession in continental Europe, the county's chamber of commerce said yesterday. The number of companies reporting increased overseas sales in the last quarter fell to the lowest level since September 1991, according to the chamber's latest economic survey. Domestic orders, however, have improved with 42 per cent of companies reporting rising UK demand, a 17 percentage point increase on the same quarter last year.</p>

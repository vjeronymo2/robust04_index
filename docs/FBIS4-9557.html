			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Petrovac, April 26 (TANJUG) -- Local Moslem media  report fierce inter-Moslem clashes in Western Bosnia over the  past 24 hours. The heaviest battles between supporters of  moderate western Bosnia leader Fikret Abdic and troops of  radical Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic are being fought  in the areas of Varoska Rijeka and Buzim. Both sides are firing  from small arms, anti- aircraft guns, machine-guns, mortars and  grenade launchers. Each side claims to have inflicted heavy  casualties on the other side and to have taken prisoners, but  the front line has remained intact.    The two sides recently exchanged prisoners in the presence  of  U.N. and Red Cross officials. Abdic's supporters released 280  prisoners in exchange for 75 prisoners held by the other side.  The prisoners released from Bihac by Izetbegovic's troops say  they were starved and maltreated, while those held in Abdic's  stronghold of Velika Kladusa did not have any complaints.</p>

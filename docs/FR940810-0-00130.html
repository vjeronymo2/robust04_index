			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many who commented during the supplemental comment period agreed that OSHA should use AHERA as a general model for drafting training requirements for building/facility workers (e.g., Ex. 162&hyph;13, 162&hyph;15, 162&hyph;16, 162&hyph;18, 162&hyph;24, 162&hyph;27, 162&hyph;30, 162&hyph;35, 162&hyph;42, 162&hyph;44, 162&hyph;45,162&hyph;46). Others, felt the existing OSHA training requirements were adequate (e.g., Ex. 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;22). Some objected to OSHA specifying a time period in its training requirements (Ex. 162&hyph;4, 162&hyph;12, 162&hyph;17, 162&hyph;25, 162&hyph;50, 162&hyph;55, 162&hyph;57). BCTD argued that AHERA training was inadequate for OSHA's purposes, and that any employee in a building containing either ACM or PACM who does not intentionally handle the material should receive at least 4 hours of awareness training and that any worker who disturbs ACM during repair, renovation, demolition or maintenance work needs the full 5-day training course (Ex. 162&hyph;42).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the training provisions of AHERA, all members of the maintenance and custodial staffs (of schools) who may work in a building containing ACBM are required to receive at least 2 hours of ``awareness'' training whether or not they are required to work with it (40 CFR 763.92). Those who conduct an activity which will result in disturbance of ACBM shall receive both the awareness training and 14 additional hours of training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA set as a minimum that the awareness training cover:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> _information of uses and forms of asbestos in buildings;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _information on health effects of exposure to asbestos;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _location of ACBM in building where employee works;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _recognition of deteriorating or damaged ACBM; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the identity of person responsible for management of ACBM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the more extensive training needed by those who might disturb ACM include in addition:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> _description of proper methods to handle ACBM;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _information on respirator protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the provisions of the AHERA rule; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _hands-on training on the use of protective equipment and work practices  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information in this rulemaking discussed above shows that workers who have performed work now designated Class III and IV have developed asbestos-related disease. Because as noted above, training is one of the most powerful instruments to protect workers, OSHA believes that its former training provisions must be improved by incorporating additional curricula such as covered in the AHERA courses for such workers. Imposing time criteria for courses will help insure that sufficient time for instruction is provided. More time can always be allotted, as needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (12) Housekeeping <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

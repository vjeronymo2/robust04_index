			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / E Europe 'should focus more on bilateral trade' THE emergent economies of central and eastern Europe (CEEC) and the European Free Trade Association countries should make less of their 'EC-mania', and focus more instead on their increasingly important bilateral relationship, a leading trade economist argues in a paper published last week.* This relationship is likely to account for a quarter of their trade growth in the decade ahead,the economist says. Mr Richard Baldwin, professor of economics at the Institut Universitaire des Hautes Etudes Internationales in Geneva, acknowledges that the sheer size and proximity of the European Community means it is likely to remain the main magnet for trade growth in the decade ahead for the Efta and eastern European countries. But he predicts that double-digit import growth in the eastern European economies could soon mean they account for 20 per cent of Efta's exports to the enlarged Europe - and vice versa. For the CEEC, the sum of exports to Efta countries and trade within the CEEC area is forecast eventually to account for about half of all their trade. He notes that the 100m people living in the CEEC area already have a combined GDP almost as large as the GDP of Efta's 32m population. As a result, he calls for an eastern enlargement of Efta as being in the interests of both Efta and CEEC exporters - and preferable to early EC entry, where he notes 'the economic and political marginalisation implicit in the bilateral trade deals signed with western Europe'. He also warns that the explosive growth of the CEEC for western Europe's exporters cannot continue indefinitely without more openings for their exports. This is endorsed by the Amex bank in its latest review, which notes that a 25 per cent jump in CEEC exports to the EC (from Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn a year) 'would have little impact on the EC, accounting for just 0.2 per cent of EC imports'. Mr Baldwin predicts that Efta exports to the CEEC have the potential to grow at more than 10 per cent a year 'for decades'. Assuming the CEEC can reach an average GDP per capita equivalent to 70 per cent of the EC average by the year 2020, he says their economies will grow at least twice as fast as those of the EC. For Efta countries, export growth to the region will be four times faster than export growth to the EC: 'While the base on which this growth is taking place is fairly small compared to exports to western Europe, the rates are so much higher that the CEEC markets are estimated to be an important source of Efta export growth.' * The Potential for trade between the countries of Efta and Central and Eastern Europe by Richard Baldwin.

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Elkem, BHP in manganese pact ELKEM, the Norwegian light metals producer, and Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest stock-listed company, have signed a preliminary agreement aimed at reducing their exposure to cyclical market fluctuations and stabilising earnings of their manganese businesses. The deal will give Elkem long-term access to manganese ore at prices below current market rates while securing BHP's customer base for long-term supplies of the raw material. Elkem is one of the world's leading manganese alloy producers and BHP one of the world's leading suppliers of manganese ore. The agreement, subject to government approval, calls for Elkem to acquire a 49 per cent stake in a newly established subsidiary of BHP's unit, GEMCO, a manganese ore supplier. In return, BHP will take a 49 per cent stake in two of Elkem's domestic manganese alloy plants. The transactions will be completed without financial compensation. , Elkem said. It added a final agreement should be signed in the autumn. The deal also calls for GEMCO to supply manganese ore to Elkem's two domestic manganese alloy plants, and a plant in the US. GEMCO owns and operates a manganese ore mine in Groote Eylandt, Australia. Mr Bjoern Segrov, an Elkem executive, said that last year the company purchased an estimated 500,000 tonnes of manganese ore. He added that although the deal with BHP will meet the bulk of Elkem's manganese ore demand, the company will still need to buy ore from South Africa. The final agreement will form an alliance in the manganese market which few can match in quality, size and competitive power, Elkem maintained. In the long-term, it will offer the potential for greater earnings for the two companies. Since 1986, manganese ore prices have tripled to more than Dollars 175 a tonne. Elkem's manganese alloy operations last year saw a turnover of NKr2.1bn (Dollars 360m), of which NKr1.1bn was achieved by its two domestic plants.</p>

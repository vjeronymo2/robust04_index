			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILL COMES FLYING WHEN BILL'S SPONSOR NEEDS HIM  </P> <P> How much is one vote worth at the state Capitol?  </P> <P> In the case of Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) on Wednesday, the answer was  more than $3,600.  </P> <P> That's how much one Democratic assemblymen paid to rent a private plane to fly  Hill to the state Capitol to vote on a controversial no-fault auto insurance  measure.  </P> <P> At the expense of Assemblyman Patrick Johnston of Stockton, Hill was flown  Wednesday morning from the El Monte airport in a twin turboprop plane to a  landing strip 30 miles east of Sacramento -- a location selected to avoid  low-lying winter fog. Hill was met by a legislative sergeant-at-arms, who drove  him to an Assembly committee meeting to vote for Johnston's no-fault bill.  </P> <P> Hill voted, quickly left the room, was driven back to the airstrip and hopped  the plane back to Southern California, where he is running to fill a vacancy in  the 31st senatorial district, which covers part of the San Gabriel Valley. Hill  delivered a noontime speech, got on a commercial airplane and flew back to  Sacramento later in the afternoon.  </P> <P> Despite Hill's extraordinary trip, Johnston's no-fault insurance bill was  defeated by one vote.  </P> <P> Johnston said he decided to fly Hill to Sacramento because a preliminary head  count showed that the vote would be close. Johnston said he wanted to make sure  that all his supporters, including Hill, were present.  </P> <P> The cost: $3,645, paid out of Johnston's campaign fund.  </P> <P> "It was painful to expend the money, I assure you. But it was in the pursuit of  a governmental purpose," Johnston said.  </P> <P> Hill conceded that his morning flight was unusual but said it was for a good  cause.  </P> <P> "It was a big bill," he said.  </P></p>

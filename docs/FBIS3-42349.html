[see Selected Video Reports section for TV footage of incidents]    Police report the explosive devices were activated by urban  commando units of communist guerrillas from the National  Liberation Army (ELN), which operates in Bucaramanga and the  nearby towns of Giron, Floridablanca, and Piedecuesta.  According to one source, three people in Giron were treated at  a hospital for minor injuries they incurred in one of the blasts.    The offices that were attacked belonged to Aquiles Tores  Breton, candidate for mayor of Bucaramanga; conservative  candidate Jorge Humberto Mantilla; a civic movement in Giron;  and Consuelo Duran de Mustafa in Piedecuesta.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gao Jianyuan (7559 1696 0337): "Procuratorial </F> Work: Guarantee for Just and Fair Law Enforcement"]    [Excerpt] The following are presently some of the major  difficulties and obstacles that are still commonly encountered  in the investigative work of procuratorial organs:    Ineffective measures of legal supervision.  Legislation on legal supervision is still not sufficiently  developed in China, and further explicit clarifications are  required as to procedure, methods, and the effects of legal  supervision. For instance, the procuratorial organs find it very  difficult to straighten out problems in cases involving human  relations, cases of favoritism, and imposition of fines instead  of criminal punishment. The procuratorial organs merely  investigate and give approval for arrest, but do not supervise  the execution of the arrest, so that the execution of the arrest  order will not be subject to effective supervision. In the  supervision of trials, procuratorial organs have no means of  supervising cases which have been referred back for further  investigation. For instance, in 1992, in the case of 85 percent  of the appeals filed by the procuratorate of Jilin Province, the  law courts did not convene any sessions to hear the cases. There  do not exist, therefore, even the preconditions for  procuratorial organs conducting legal supervision of cases of  the second instance. In cases of reduction of sentences or  release on parole, the procuratorial organs can also only  conduct supervision after the fact. A supervisory system for the  review of death sentences has not yet been established.  Obstacles are also great in the case of crimes that are to be  prosecuted only on the petition of the injured party, also in  civil litigation, and in administrative proceedings. All these  facts adversely affect the conduct of legal supervision by the  procuratorial organs.    In some places the leadership as well as the judicial  organs have confused ideas about the functions and intentions of  legal supervision by the procuratorial organs. In some  places the leadership regards the procuratorial organs merely as  departments that initiates cases or as administrative  departments of the government. The position and functions of the  procuratorial organs is not yet fully understood, with the  result that the procuratorial organs cannot fully exercise their  functions.    Serious insufficiency of funds budgeted for the  prosecution of cases. The insufficiency of funds has all  along been an old problem that has never been adequately  resolved. In recent years, the problem of insufficient funds for  the prosecution of cases has become even more acute. Many big  cases could not be investigated because of a shortage of funds.  When initiating cases, the basic level procuratorates will  generally adopt the method of recovering procedural expenses  from out of the confiscated money or materials of the case in  question, or will obtain funds from the unit that initiated the  case in the first place. Although the superior procuratorates  repeatedly tried to stop this procedure, it could not be  completely eradicated and has resulted in certain negative  consequences.    Besides these difficulties, much resistance is  encountered by the procuratorial organs in the prosecution of  cases of graft and bribery, especially when leading cadres are  involved. In some places, party and government leaderships  are not sufficiently aware of the dangerous and serious nature  of such economic crimes as graft and bribery. There is anxiety  that prosecution of such cases could jeopardize the key  undertaking of economic construction; action is therefore held  up. Some places have gone even so far as to decree that  such-and-such must not be investigated and such-and-such must  not be reported. Some leading cadres are themselves not clean  and afraid that they themselves may be found out if these cases  of graft and bribery are investigated. They will therefore use  manpower, finance, and material power to make things difficult  for the procuratorial organs, and as a consequence some cases  cannot be dealt with justly and fairly.    Then there is also local protectionism that seriously  and adversely affects prosecution of cases according to  law. In a small number of places, party and government  leaderships, out of considerations for the interests of their  local department or local district, ignore party discipline and  state law. They use their power to suppress the law, they make  their word, rather than the law, count as decisive, and they  interfere in the investigation of particular cases that are  being pursued by the procuratorial organs. In criminal cases  involving so-called "able persons [neng ren 5174 0086]," who in  some way have made contributions to the local economy, the local  party and government leaderships are afraid that bringing down  these "able persons" will cause the enterprises concerned to  collapse. They fear that this would then also adversely affect  the economic development of the local district, and for this  reason they will obstruct prosecution of such cases.    In yet another type of situation, the units will not  report criminal cases that might have occurred in their units,  but will dispose of such cases by somehow "absorbing" them  themselves. Their various anxieties are: First, they fear  that confiscated money will have to be turned over and will not  be returned to them. Some units, especially those that are badly  off economically, will rather deal with such cases themselves,  because they fear after they transfer the cases to the  procuratorial organs, the confiscated money will not be promptly  returned to them. Second, they fear that the case may adversely  affect their reputation. Third, they fear that they will be  "rejected by one negative vote [yi piao fou jue 0001 4384 0694  0414]." In some places, the system has willfully expanded the  scope of the "rejection by one negative vote" responsibility  system. Regardless of how well the unit may be doing with regard  to all other norms, if there happens only one security,  criminal, or other case, each one will result in "rejection by  one negative vote," when even welfare items accrued to cadres,  staff, and workers will be cancelled. As soon as that kind of a  problem arises in a unit, they will therefore always raise  obstructions in every way possible and settle the matter in some  other, perfunctory way.</p>

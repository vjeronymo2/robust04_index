			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JESSE JACKSON, EVER ON THE MOVE, ENDS L.A. VISIT WITH A THUMBS-UP  </P> <P> He hurries to his limo on Sunset Boulevard. Traffic slows, horns honk and  admirers yell: "Hey, Jesse!" He shoots them a thumbs-up. He is driven across  town to Burbank, hoists himself out of the car, and office workers materialize  on the sidewalk to greet him. Up goes the thumb.  </P> <P> This is the evidence in the Rev. Jesse Jackson's life that all is well.  </P> <P> And to those who claim otherwise, he is ready figuratively with his thumb at  his nose.  </P> <P> To those who call him troubled, unfocused in these months since the 1988  presidential election, Jackson replies: "No, no. My mood is up. . . . I'm in  stride."  </P> <P> To those who say he is stubbornly polarizing Democrats with his recent  confrontation with party moderates, Jackson snaps: "I've done more to heal the  party, build the party than anyone."  </P> <P> To those who call him disloyal for supporting a third-party black candidate  over the white Democratic Party nominee in Chicago's turbulent mayoral  election, Jackson says the national press "has failed by reducing this thing to  white and black."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Television Role  </P> <P> Jackson was interviewed Friday during the windup of a Los Angeles visit. For  two days he had been taping an episode of NBC's sitcom, "A Different World," in  which he plays himself urging college students to vote. And along the way, he  crammed in as many speeches, interviews and meetings as is humanly possible,  for this is a man whose daily schedule still resembles that of a presidential  contender in the autumn of an election year, not a defeated candidate in the  spring of the year after.  </P> <P> "People say: 'Jesse, you're all over the place,' " he shrugged. "But that's  coalition building."  </P> <P> In the four months since the Democratic presidential defeat, Jackson has  traveled to Africa, is planning a trip to Japan, has flown coast-to-coast any  number of times. He has walked the picket lines with Eastern Airlines workers  in their strike against company chairman Frank Lorenzo. He has continued his  crusade against drugs and gangs. He has helped mediate a potentially explosive  student protest at mostly black Howard University. He has launched a campaign  to replace the racial descriptive "black" with "African-American." Now he's  doing TV.  </P> <P> Jackson said he finances his extensive travels by finding a sponsor for each  trip -- in this case a TV network. "We go places by invitation, and while there  do other things," he said. "We travel a lot of miles."  </P> <P> The lion's share of national news attention has focused recently on the two  intertwined political events which speak to the mood and future intentions of  this man who is now America's most experienced presidential challenger: His  maverick role in the upcoming Chicago mayor's race and his contentious  appearance earlier this month at a Philadelphia convention of party moderates  called the Democratic Leadership Council.  </P> <P> In short, where is Jackson heading? Or leading?  </P> <P> In Philadelphia last week, he warned moderates not to sacrifice the traditional  Democratic base of minorities and have-nots in trying to win the support of  middle-class whites. "If we are all things to all people, we become rather  ill-defined, indecisive -- kind of like warm spit," he said at the time.  </P> <P> Riding down the Hollywood Freeway behind the smoked glass of an NBC limousine,  however, Jackson said he was willing to grant that Democrats cannot win  elections with just the have-nots, either.  </P> <P> "That kind of polarization is not sound thinking," he said.  </P> <P> Jackson suggested that he is not getting credit from the party for his efforts  to reach the middle class through their pocketbooks.  </P> <P> "We can't be for Lorenzo and be for 20,000 workers at the same time. A lot of  these pilots, these $140,000-a-year pilots, have become Republicans because  they're settled in with prosperity. When they stand up with me and put their  hats on my head, that's a sign they will vote Democratic. That's leadership. .  . .  </P> <P> "Lorenzo doesn't represent the middle class. He represents the very rich and  the very greedy. The middle class that we're looking for -- those quote white  males -- they're the pilots, they're the machinists. They are the new middle  class."  </P> <P> The 1988 Democratic presidential runner-up is likewise on the spot about his  party leadership in the racially charged April 4 Chicago mayor's election.  </P> <P> Democrats chose State's Atty. Richard M. Daley, who is white, as their nominee.  Jackson has chosen instead to support city Alderman Tim Evans, who is black.  For Jackson to desert his party in favor of Evans, some Democrats have argued,  is an example of racial loyality and party disloyalty. And this mix is  something that Jackson has railed against in his own political career.  </P> <P> Jackson said that news accounts have not been sufficiently sophisticated in  presenting the context of long racial struggle in Chicago's Democratic Party.  He noted that at least twice in the 1980s, leading white figures in the party  have bolted in favor of third-party white candidates when the Democrats chose a  black nominee for mayor. And more personally, Jackson said, he twice endorsed  Daley, the son of the former mayor, for state's attorney.  </P> <P> "He's never endorsed me. Reciprocity is a reasonable expectation. Reciprocity  is an abiding principle with me. . . . There is something pernicious about that  cabal in Chicago that is ugly."  </P> <P> Some journalists who have watched Jackson closely through two presidential  campaigns now are beginning to question his focus, although not his energy.  Words like "troubled" and "adrift" creep into opinion columns and  conversations.  </P> <P> Jackson insisted this is merely because reporters are no longer traveling with  him every day to watch him stoke the fires, whether on a network comedy stage  or at an angry picket line.  </P> <P> "I'm developing relationships that I never had access to before. . . . If one  day I get a call from machinists, flight attendants and airline pilots, people  who are former Democrats, and they say, Rev. Jackson will you support us? And I  get there and they're cheering, pilots putting their hats on my head. And  they're saying things like, where are the other Democrats now?  </P> <P> "Then that is the right place for me to be," he said.  </P> <P> Political writer Keith Love contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Lloyds bid for C&amp;G halted by High Court ruling: Society may appeal against judgment on structure of bank offer The structure of Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society was ruled illegal last night by the High Court, placing a large obstacle in the way of banks taking over building societies. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G's chief executive, said the society intended either to appeal against the judgment, or try to find a way of restructuring the offer to its members in a way that would bring it within the law. Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, ruled that Lloyds could not pay the C&amp;G investors who had been shareholders for less than two years. That would make it extremely hard for C&amp;G to meet voting requirements for approval of the takeover. Mr Philip Lawson, Lloyds' chief legal adviser, described the judgment as 'a hurdle to be overcome'. Lloyds said its bid still stood, and C&amp;G was free to restructure the way in which it divided the cash between its members. The judgment, which was announced after the stock market closed last night, means that Lloyds' strategy for expanding its share of the retail financial services market has suffered a setback. The judgment affirms the section of the 1986 Building Societies Act intended to stop 'speculative flows' of deposits between societies if a rumour spread that a society was about to receive a bid from a third party. C&amp;G is required by law to gain the approval of 75 per cent of its 825,000 shareholders for any takeover. As 27 per cent of shareholders have been with the building society for less than two years, and so cannot be paid, it faces difficulty in restructuring the deal. Mr Longhurst said the society's advisers would examine the ruling to see 'if we can modify the offer in some way to bring it within the terms of the judgment'. He said the benefits of the offer remained clear in spite of the ruling. He said that although the society could simply offer money to shareholders of more than two years' standing, 'that would mean that a lot of people who have looked forward to getting some money would be disappointed'. Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at UBS, said the ruling was 'a temporary setback'. He said the society could replace the cash offer with one of shares similar to Abbey National's flotation in 1989. Because of the significance of the issues for all banks and societies, it is widely expected that the matter might have to go to the House of Lords. That might threaten the timetable already laid out for the Lloyds' takeover. Some societies are likely to be relieved that the ruling reduces the possibility of banks' putting pressure on them toplace other offers before members. However, Mr Derek Roberts, chief executive of Yorkshire Building Society, said the ruling appeared to 'scupper one interesting option for the restructuring of the mortgage market', which he believed was inevitable in some form.

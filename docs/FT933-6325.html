			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Mail order houses should explain reasons for poor service (2) Sir, While the mail order industry is absorbing Mr Price's richly deserved criticism, perhaps it will explain why some goods are available only on the UK mainland. The postage is a notional sum, including packing, and must be similar, and we in the Channel Islands are not necessarily asking for relief from VAT. We pay extra anyway for most things, as half the traders leave VAT on and call it freight charges. We are not a foreign country, and we should have the opportunity to acquire goods that are on sale nationally but not readily available in our shops. P Cranford Smith, Copse Hill, Le Valongis, Alderney, Channel Islands</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Falling share markets ignore DM intervention: Bundesbank and Fed lead selling - Government acts to head off home loans rise CONCERTED intervention by the world's leading central banks to restrain the soaring D-Mark and pave the way for lower interest rates failed yesterday to prevent share prices in Europe suffering their largest fall for 11 months. In their biggest co-ordinated action since July last year, the central banks, led by the German Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve, bought dollars for D-Marks. Their action was both an effort to reduce strains in the European exchange rate mechanism, caused by the German currency's recent strong rise, and to halt the slide in the dollar. While the intervention led to a sharp fall in the value of the D-Mark against the dollar, it failed to convince stock market investors that pressures within the ERM would be eased, opening the way for lower European interest rates. The intervention, in three separate waves yesterday afternoon in Europe and New York, halted the rapid slide in the dollar which had been approaching its record low of DM1.443 set in February 1991. The Eurotrack index, which monitors the main European bourses, was 3 per cent down at 1,064.04, the biggest one-day fall since August 1991 on the day of the Moscow coup. Stock markets in London, New York and Tokyo all saw large declines. Yesterday's central bank intervention came against the background of widespread gloom about the global economy, triggered by last week's increase in the German discount rate. That in turn has sparked fears that the Bundesbank may lift its key Lombard interest rate, an event that would make it practically impossible for European borrowing costs to come down without a broad ERM alignment to revalue the D-Mark upwards. The sombre mood was shared by investors worldwide: In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed down 28.2 at 2,403.7, after coming back from a 65-point loss before the central bank intervention. Investors had earlier been unsettled about news of continuing fragility in the UK economy, shown up by weak money supply figures. In Italy, the stock market fell by nearly 6 per cent, partly due to political worries sparked by the weekend killing of an anti-Mafia judge. The Italian lira came under renewed pressure, falling close to its ERM floor against the D-Mark, amid continued fears about the impact of higher European interest rates. The DAX index at the Frankfurt bourse ended 52.99 lower at 1,649.67. Both Paris and Amsterdam saw declines of nearly 2 per cent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered from an early 47-point loss to end down 28.64 at 3,303.00. In Tokyo, before the start of European trading, the Nikkei stock index had suffered a 4 per cent fall to close at 15,884.48. However, in the first half-hour of trading today it had recovered by more than 150 points. Yesterday's intervention by the central banks also involved the Bank of England and the central banks of France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Denmark. In late New York trading last night, the dollar was quoted at DM1.4940, up almost five pfennigs from its low of DM1.447 in London, where it ended the day at DM1.4815. But the weaker D-Mark failed to prevent sterling remaining in the doldrums. In New York last night it was down slightly on the day at DM2.8469, after dipping at one point in early European trading to DM2.8282, its lowest level against the D-Mark since Britain joined the exchange rate mechanism in October 1990. New York traders said that the intervention worked well because markets had not expected it. Mr Joe Taylor, analyst with Technical Data in Boston, said: 'The market was caught wrong-footed. Until the Fed acted, the fall (in the dollar) had been orderly.' However, markets believed that the dollar might drop still lower, as analysts argued that the fundamental factors driving the dollar down were still in play. These include the large differential between German and US short-term interest rates, and fears about the scale of the US economic recovery.

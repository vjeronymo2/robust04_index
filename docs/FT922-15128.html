			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Observer: Lady vanishes While other organisations may be promoting women to their top positions, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce is doing the opposite. The elegant damsel enthroned on a cornucopia, who has headed its notepaper almost continuously since 1860, is being made redundant. Not only is she past it herself, it seems, but there are problems with her background - a pastel-hued montage of mill chimneys, kilns and sailing ship, which doesn't show up on faxes. So she is being ditched for what the association thinks will be a not only more fitting but more fetching image for the 1990s when it hopes to recruit 60,000 more members. Whether it will turn out to be right is another question; the replacement for the delicate picture is a charmless letter-dominated logo. And the damsel, for all her demure looks, has proved more than a match for such things before. In the 1970s the association jilted her for a hideous design of arrows, only swiftly to see the error of its ways and restore her to her throne.</p>

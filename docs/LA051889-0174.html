			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NORTHROP PLANT IN ANAHEIM MAY BE SOLD  </P> <P> Northrop Corp. plans to cut its work force by 2,500 to 3,000 people by the end  of the year and is likely to sell its Anaheim operation, which employs about  1,800 people, the chairman of the aerospace firm said Wednesday.  </P> <P> "When any of our properties is not useful, we will sell it. Certainly, Anaheim  is one of those," Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones told shareholders at the  company's annual meeting in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Northrop spokesmen tried to temper Jones' comments by  stating that no final decision had been made about the the Orange County  facility.  </P> <P> But company spokesman Tony Cantafio confirmed the existence of an internal  report detailing a plan of liquidation for the Anaheim operation, including  layoff and transfer figures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Looking at Alternatives'  </P> <P> "We have a transition plan and a consolidation plan," Cantafio said. "We're  looking at all of the alternatives." He declined to discuss contents of the  report.  </P> <P> The company would not comment on the extent of job losses that would accompany  a sale of the Anaheim property, but it confirmed that any such layoffs would be  included in the 2,500 to 3,000 planned job cuts.  </P> <P> Northrop's work force reduction reflects an effort to trim overhead expenses  throughout the company and to reduce jobs in the massive B-2 stealth bomber  program.  </P> <P> At least some of the Northrop workers will be laid off, though the company  hopes it can cut a majority of the jobs by normal attrition, Jones said. A  majority of the job cuts will occur in Southern California, where about 77% of  Northrop's 44,000 workers are based.  </P> <P> Analysts speculated that as many as several hundred people could be laid off at  the Anaheim facility. But the bulk of the layoffs are expected to come in the  company's B-2 bomber program, which is concentrated in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> John Simon, an aerospace analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities, said the layoffs  are more "bad news" for the troubled firm. "Why do you lay off people unless  you have too many people?" he asked. "Things are going mostly wrong at  Northrop."  </P> <P> The company is facing a difficult time in many of its major military programs,  ranging from technical problems that have forced delays to funding cutbacks  that have slowed down production lines. Northrop expects its 1989 sales to  remain little changed from last year's $5.8 billion.  </P> <P> Northrop has already cut back 2,300 jobs on the B-2 bomber at its Pico Rivera  and Palmdale plants in the past 2 years, resulting from completion of  development activities and a failure to obtain funding increases for  production.  </P> <P> Northrop declined to specify where the new job cuts would occur by plant  location, but Cantafio said after the meeting that "a large number" of the job  cutbacks would occur on the B-2 program.  </P> <P> Those layoffs were expected as development activities are completed, but recent  federal budget cuts have robbed the program of funding increases that would  have resulted in significant job growth. In addition, some of the B-2 layoffs  will be tied to a cost reduction effort that Jones said is aiming to trim $3  billion from the cost of the B-2 program.  </P> <P> In March, Northrop announced it was trimming its operations in Anaheim by  transferring 400 engineers and their support staff to a sister facility in  Hawthorne.  </P> <P> Employees in Anaheim design and manufacture infrared and optical sensors used  by pilots and anti-aircraft missile crews to shoot down their targets. They  also manufacture equipment to test missiles.  </P> <P> The company's Hawthorne operation, which employs 2,600 people, is best known  for producing part of the U.S. Air Force's MX missile guidance system.  </P> <P> The Anaheim and Hawthorne operations make up Northrop's electronic systems  division, which has suffered in recent years from production delays and  declining revenue as several key programs have neared completion. From 1986 to  1988, the division's revenue fell 13% to $1.1 billion, while its operating  profit plunged 61% to $39 million.  </P> <P> In particular, analysts said the missile test equipment group in Anaheim and  the MX missile project in Hawthorne have experienced significant revenue  declines. Furthermore, production in Anaheim of a sensor product called a  television camera set may stall because its primary application is the F-14  Tomcat fleet-defense fighter, which may soon be phased out of production.  </P> <P> "If you combine the declining revenues for test equipment and the (MX missile)  unit, the consolidation of the facilities in Hawthorne and Anaheim makes a lot  of sense," said Lawrence M. Harris, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill  Richards Inc. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Real estate brokers said Northrop's Anaheim facility, consisting of five  buildings on 53 acres, is an attractive property. "They could get at least $27  million for the land alone," said Bob Niles, a sales agent with Daum Commercial  Industrial Real Estate in La Mirada. He said the buildings could bring $50  million to $70 million.  </P> <P> Niles said likely buyers would include other defense contractors and large  computer companies. "There are lots of possibilities," he said.  </P> <P> A 30-year-old industrial electrician at the Anaheim facility said workers there  have heard that Northrop might sell the plant. "Everybody realizes the land is  more profitable than what the company is doing with it right now," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hawthorne Facility Bigger  </P> <P> The employee, who requested anonymity, said he expects to be transferred to  Hawthorne, but he has started to look for another job because he doesn't want  to leave Orange County.  </P> <P> Northrop's Hawthorne facility, situated on 218 acres, is considerably bigger  than its Anaheim complex. "It probably wouldn't be difficult at all for the  Hawthorne facility to absorb the staff and work done in Anaheim," Harris said.  </P> <P> The Northrop job terminations are another signal that federal defense spending  reductions and a drive to improve efficiency by contractors is inflicting a  heavy economic toll, especially in the concentrated Southern California  aerospace industry.  </P> <P> Virtually every major prime contractor is laying off workers from at least some  of their divisions in the Los Angeles area, including General Dynamics, Hughes  Aircraft, Litton Industries, Lockheed and TRW, among others.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's shareholder meeting, Jones did not specifically mention  Northrop's recent indictment on federal criminal charges, stemming from alleged  falsification of testing on guidance parts for cruise missiles. He did say, "We  intend to defend the company and our employees against unwarranted and  frequently exaggerated charges."  </P> <P> Jones delivered a 25-page speech, his final address to shareholders before he  steps down after 30 years as chief executive at the end of this year.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Kenneth T. Yamada contributed to this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ELECTRONICS SYSTEMS DIVISION AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> What: Northrop Corp., electronics systems division  </P> <P> Where: Anaheim  </P> <P> Employees: 1,800  </P> <P> Contracts: Builds optical and infrared sensors that enable pilots and  anti-aircraft missile crews to identify targets.

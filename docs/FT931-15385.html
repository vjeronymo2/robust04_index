			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / West Midlands business confidence at new low FEWER West Midlands companies expect to take on more workers over the next six months than at any time since the start of the recession, a survey of 1,200 businesses has disclosed. The survey, by Wolverhampton and Warwick business schools and accountants Price Waterhouse, published today, shows a sharp drop in business confidence and a marked change in corporate attitudes towards government policy. Concern about keeping down inflation has been replaced by estimates for increased government expenditure coupled with lower interest rates to provide new economic impetus. Expectations for jobs go together with gloomy predictions about business conditions. The latest survey shows that 56 per cent of companies expect conditions to deteriorate over the next six months. Only 13 per cent expect them to improve. A third of companies expected to take on more labour last summer: that proportion has dropped to 16 per cent. Over the past six months, 45 per cent of companies have reduced their workforce, more than three times as many as had expected to do during the summer. Manufacturing was affected worst by the recession in its early stages, while services remained buoyant. Now, the survey says: 'The service sector is starting to experience the employment shedding which has been taking place in the manufactur-ing sector for some time.' Recent analysis of official figures by the West Midlands Enterprise Board showed that people out of work for more than a year made up 40 per cent of the total jobless in Birmingham, the Black Country and Coventry.

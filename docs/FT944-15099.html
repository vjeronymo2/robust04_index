			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Vietnam wobbles on the capitalist fast-track: The party old guard signals its concern about unbridled reform as national assembly convenes When the World Cup football semi-final was taken off Vietnam's state-run television channel in July and replaced with a eulogy to the dead North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, it was a clear sign that Vietnam's communist old guard was beginning to stir. Hardline politburo member Nguyen Duc Binh apparently ordered the change from his hospital bed while reformist prime minister Vo Van Kiet was on a trip to Ho Chi Minh City in the south. While the change of programme irritated Vietnam's football lovers, more fundamental tensions between reformers and conservatives are expected to emerge over the next 10 days as Vietnam's National Assembly convenes a landmark session in the capital, Hanoi, starting today. Inflation, a swelling budget deficit and a review of the last four years of virtually unimpeded foreign investment are expected to top the agenda. Hanoi-based diplomats say the session could also yield a handful of ministerial reshuffles reflecting the fact that officials are starting to be made accountable for economic mismanagement as Vietnam undergoes adjustment of its once centrally planned economy along market lines. They say a prime candidate for demotion is finance minister Ho The, widely blamed for failing to check a swelling budget deficit and making promises of central government funding to provinces that were never fulfilled. 'He's ripe for sacking,' said one veteran economist and government adviser. 'He's made some very contradictory decisions.' Vietnam reacted nimbly to the sudden disappearance of aid in 1989 from its main benefactor, the former Soviet Union, achieving remarkable success in slashing annual inflation from four-digit figures to a respectable 9.9 per cent. The country's staple exports of crude oil, rice, coffee and rubber have helped maintain a much-needed flow of foreign exchange. Incomes, particularly in the cities, are rising fast. Foreign investment has poured in, reaching a total contracted amount of Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.3bn) last month. But this year there was an alarming rise in imports in the first six months, resulting in a trade deficit of Dollars 200m. Other disappointing economic statistics have soured the optimism of the past two years, fuelling conservative calls for a re-assessment of doi moi, the term used to refer to the economic reforms officially sanctioned in 1986. Diplomats say the news has worried government planners and fractured the previous fragile consensus among policy-makers that the pace of reform should quicken. Other signs of hardening attitudes include the banning last week of a collection of short stories on the grounds that a prize-winning story was infringing 'the policy and religious faith and national solidarity of the party and the government'. What worries the conservatives - understood to include Communist party secretary Do Muoi - is the potentially damaging social consequences of some market reforms and the possible erosion of the party's position. 'They're saying (reform is) the worst of all worlds,' said one economist. 'It's seen as representing the devaluation of 'socialist orientation', uncontrolled foreign investment and too much domestic business.' Diplomats and local economists say that the future direction of reform could hinge on the tenor of Mr Kiet's opening speech to the national assembly. 'It's probably the most difficult speech he'll have to make,' said the economist. Mr Kiet is understood to be keen to push through the rubber stamp assembly higher growth, increased reform of the banking system, further restructuring of lumbering state-owned enterprises and increased mobilisation of the private sector. The mood at the session is likely to be sombre. A press release issued last week by the standing committee of the assembly rapidly dispensed with the glowing rhetoric of previous years. Deputy prime minister Phan Van Khai, an avowed reformist, was reported in the local press as having warned the standing committee of the national assembly last week at a preparatory meeting of 'very heavy duties in the rest of the year'. Foreign investors say a sign that some sort of re-assessment was imminent has been uncertainty in the last four months over whether any more foreign banks would be licensed to operate branches in Vietnam. 'No one is sure about the pace of progress,' said one investor, who requested anonymity. Vietnam has allowed branch licences to nine banks. US banks Citibank and Bank of America are believed to be on top of a waiting list of about 20 hoping for branch status.</p>

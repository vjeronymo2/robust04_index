			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Lloyd's pledges reforms after criticism LLOYD'S of London yesterday pledged to introduce a number of reforms in the wake of the publication yesterday of two critical reports on its regulation and management. In his report, Sir David Walker, former chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, the investment watchdog, was fiercely critical of the professionalism and competence of many of the insurance market's agencies. Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank, proposed a framework to manage and regulate the troubled market, which would separate regulation from administration and daily business planning. The reports were commissioned by Lloyd's earlier this year in an effort to restore confidence in the market, which has been hit by heavy losses and mounting criticism over its operations. The Walker report focuses on the controversial spiral reinsurance system - in which syndicates and companies trading in London reinsure each other's exposures to catastrophe risks - and how market insiders have avoided some of the worst losses. A number of spiral syndicates have run up heavy losses, accounting for nearly half the Pounds 2.06bn deficit recorded by Lloyd's in 1989, a result which was announced in the course of last week. Although his report cleared Lloyd's of fraud or conspiracy to disadvantage particular groups of Names, Sir David said his criticisms of professionalism and competence at the market were intended to be 'very serious'. It said standards of professionalism, care and diligence of some agents had fallen below best practice. Several members' agents had taken a lax approach to their fiduciary responsibilities. Lloyd's own regulatory policies had also been insufficient to identify shortcomings in the market. Sir David suggested the regulatory board, which Lloyd's pledges to create, must set tougher standards and monitor compliance more vigorously, adding that standards of disclosure to Names - individuals whose assets provide the market's capital base - must be improved. Separately yesterday, Lloyd's won a landmark decision in the High Court in the Oakeley Vaughan case. Mr Justice Gatehouse ruled Lloyd's had no 'duty of care' in the case brought by 33 plaintiffs facing losses as members of syndicates formerly managed by the Oakeley Vaughan agency. The Names blame a failure of regulation by Lloyd's. Meanwhile Mr David Coleridge, the market's chairman, ran into a barrage of criticism at the annual meeting of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the organisation which represents over 9,000 Names, for suggesting that people unable to attend the market's extraordinary general meeting on July 27 were unlikely to be able to vote by postal ballot. Dissident Names have introduced a vote of no confidence in the market's council. Lloyd's reports, Page 7 Editorial comment, Page 16</p>

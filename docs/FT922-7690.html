			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Clocks, Watches &amp; Jewellery: Baubles on a budget - Patricia Morison set out with Pounds 1,000 to see what she could buy IT IS easy to spend a fortune on jewellery, but these are difficult times, so I set out round the dealers of London to find what treasures I could pick up on a budget of Pounds 1,000. Unless you have plenty of time, buying at jewellery sales is a non-starter. And even though you might strike lucky at an auction, even allowing for payment of commission and VAT, it is easy for an ignorant buyer to come unstuck in the sale-room where, after a month has elapsed, there is no come-back. Secondhand jewellery dealers need to carry a big stock; they charge a mark-up of 300 or 400 per cent on a piece they have 'bought well' at auction, but someone who buys from a reputable jewellery dealer, and finds there is a problem, should expect redress. Even if a piece simply looks wrong, a good dealer should offer to exchange it or refund. Membership of BADA and LPADA is a useful badge of respectability. But always obtain a fully descriptive receipt of your purchase. For example, if the brooch is sold as Art Deco, be sure those words appear on the receipt. Anyone setting out cold around London's antiques and collectibles shops could usefully buy themselves The Collector, a monthly magazine costing Pounds 1 which gives an area by area directory of shops. It is widely available in antique shops and hotels; or ring/fax 081-740-7020. Burlington Gardens in the West End is an elegant corner in which to start the hunt for period jewellery, although a budget of Pounds 1,000 turns out not to offer very much. The casual purchaser of jewellery is a far less common creature these days, and prices are currently depressed - 10 per cent down, according to one dealer. So do not to be deterred by the smart suit and plummy accent - make the dealer an offer. Blane Thompson at Silver, 3-5 Burlington Gardens, says period and antique jewellery becomes a better buy in a recession. The high street chains selling new jewellery have fixed profit margins, whereas dealers in old pieces can afford to drop their prices. Second-hand jewellery is a better buy because, with a modern piece, a purchaser is paying for the workmanship; making jewellery is skilled and time-consuming. What if you should fall on hard times? When purchasing a second-hand piece, Thompson says, 'most jewellers will be prepared to give you what you paid, plus the added value if it has gone up.' Silver specialises in Art Nouveau and Lalique (unaffordable with a budget of Pounds 1,000) and traditional English jewellery. The Victorian pieces which fall within budget tend to be conventional and rather heavy. The introduction of platinum, around 1900, allowed jewellers to make really fine settings. Edwardian rings, set with a large tourmaline, cost about Pounds 1,000. A pretty Tiffany gold openwork flower-brooch in gold and rubies is Pounds 750; a black enamel, seedpearl and diamond brooch costs Pounds 800. Brooches, rings, and pendants are more likely than earrings to come within the budget. Buyers with a sense of history tend to like Victorian gold posy rings and mourning rings, which range from Pounds 100 to Pounds 1,000, and Roman intaglios in Victorian settings - intaglios and cameos could well be Italian fakes, but that merely adds to the period flavour. Across the way at Harvey and Gore, Pounds 1,000 will take you back as far as the late 18th century, with a pair of keepsake bracelets of painted ivory (called 'bone' these days), enamel, hair, and gilt. Pretty Georgian brooches and chokers of imitation diamonds made of paste may cost in the region of Pounds 500; unfortunately they are extremely fragile. At Grays Antique Market at 58 Davies Street and in the mews behind, prices are lower. These days, almost the only sounds on a weekday are the cries of dealers calling dejectedly to each other, like sea birds on a deserted coastline. At Licht and Morrison, specialists in antique and period jewellery, it becomes clear that quality Art Deco pieces are over budget. Attractive Victorian pieces, such as a delectable pearl and diamond bangle and a chunky diamond brooch in 15 carat gold, cost Pounds 1,500-Pounds 1,900. For rather original pieces, try Donohoes in Davies Mews, which specialises in 'artist's jewellery' and rather wonderful Holbeinesque pieces - Victorian pastiche which makes you feel like Mary Stuart on a good day. For something solidly English and distinctly cheaper, consider Whitby jet and its look-alikes - there was simply not enough jet to satisfy the Victorian passion for the stuff. Allison Massey in Grays Market is the only dealer who specialises in jet. Massive-looking carved chokers and necklaces (jet is extraordinarily light), tiaras and chokers in reddish-hued 'French jet' (which is probably not French and certainly not jet), are also affordable. The medium - 'jet,' in fact, is glass - allows far more delicate workmanship. But it is black-as your-hat Whitby jet which has the literary cachet, thanks to the poet-lover's gift in A S Byatt's recent novel, Possession. What better - or better-value - keepsake of a romantic visit?</p>

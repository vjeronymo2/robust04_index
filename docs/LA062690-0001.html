			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE CITY MANAGER RESIGNS FOR ACCOUNTING POSITION;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: CITY HALL OFFICIALS SAID RON BRADLEY WASN'T ASKED TO LEAVE, DESPITE  SOME FRICTIONS. BRADLEY HAD UNDERTAKEN AN INVESTIGATION OF THREE CITY COUNCIL  MEMBERS.  </P> <P> Oceanside City Manager Ron Bradley, a former police officer who last year  publicly announced that he was forwarding to the district attorney's office  allegations of wrongdoing by three council members -- announced Monday that he  is quitting his $101,000-a-year job to go into private business.  </P> <P> Bradley, 50, said he is accepting a job with the nationwide accounting firm of  Ernst &amp; Young, and will handle local government affairs out of the  company's regional office in Irvine. The resignation is effective Sept. 28.  </P> <P> Mayor Larry Bagley said he hopes the city can get by with a temporary city  manager and delay recruiting a permanent successor until after the City Council  election in November.  </P> <P> Bagley said Bradley's resignation came as a surprise to him.  </P> <P> "He was doing a heck of a good job," Bagley said. "I think it's a loss to the  city. When he came in, we told him we wanted him to do certain things, and he  was doing them."  </P> <P> Bagley and other council members said the city manager was not asked to leave  the job, despite growing criticism of him in some corners of City Hall.  </P> <P> One city official, who asked to remain anonymous, suggested that Bradley had  been looking "for a back door out" of City Hall because of growing friction  between him and council members.  </P> <P> In particular, Bradley has sparred with one council member over the direction  of the city's redevelopment plans, and with another because of supposed  confusion in explaining the city budget.  </P> <P> And one council member, who asked not to be identified by name, said there was  lingering resentment over the way in which Bradley handled the investigation  into alleged wrongdoing by three council members.  </P> <P> That eight-month investigation was concluded in March when San Diego County  Dist. Atty. Edwin Miller announced that his office had found no wrongdoing by  council members Melba Bishop, Sam Williamson and Ben Ramsey.  </P> <P> Allegations had been presented to Bradley by the city's public works director,  Glenn Prentice, that the council members were involved in bribery, conflict of  interest and misuse of public funds. Bradley, with the support of his police  chief, hired a private investigator to look into the accusations. The city  manager disclosed the allegations to the City Council last August, then gave  his findings to the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> In his own response to the city, Miller mildly criticized Bradley for publicly  releasing copies of the private investigator's memorandum on the very day of  his announcement that he was seeking the district attorney's review. That  action, Miller said, was made "over our objections -- due to the need to  preserve the confidentiality and integrity of any pending investigation."  </P> <P> "I don't think that endeared him to members of the council," the council member  said of the public disclosure of the investigation. "He put us through months  of hell that none of us wanted to go through."  </P> <P> There was also growing discontent at City Hall between various department  managers and Bradley -- a division that became more obvious in recent weeks  while the city hammered out its new budget, the council member said.  </P> <P> Indeed, one council member, Melba Bishop, said she was "not sorry" to see him  go.  </P> <P> "I'm not a hypocrite," Bishop said. "We didn't have the best working  relationship. My complaint with Ron was that I didn't think he was giving me  enough information to do my job. I wasn't told things at all, or I was told too  late. And I had serious disagreements on how he handled some personnel issues."  </P> <P> Answered Bradley: "Melba and I disagree on some fundamental issues about local  government. That is her right and responsibility. I've never felt it prevented  us from working together. A good, healthy debate creates a more open and  effective government."  </P> <P> Bradley said he was under no pressure to quit. He described his relationship  with the City Council as "cordial."  </P> <P> Bradley said the information about the pending investigation was released on  the advice of the city attorney's office -- and, looking back on it now, he  said he wondered if he acted "out of ethics or naivete."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, he said, he believes he is leaving the post on good terms with the  council and looks forward to a change in career -- his third, from police work  to city management to the private sector.  </P> <P> "Ernst &amp; Young offered me a chance to use my training, experience and  education in an area where I'm vitally interested -- local government," Bradley  said.  </P> <P> During his tenure in Oceanside, Bradley, implementing the recommendations of a  management consulting firm, reorganized the Police Department "to more  traditional lines of responsibility and reporting," he said.  </P> <P> Bradley said he is also happy that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers'  experimental sand-bypass operation system has successfully gone into operation.  The sand pipeline sucks up sand captured on the city's northern beaches, next  to its harbor, and carries it south to sand-starved beaches.  </P> <P> Among the challenges for his successor, Bradley said, are the continued  redevelopment of the city's downtown and beachfront properties and the  completion of a study determining the need, design and location of a new police  headquarters.  </P> <P> "In local government," Bradley said, "there are always grass fires to put out."  </P> <P> Bradley said he will continue to live in Oceanside and commute to his office in  Orange County.  </P> <P> Bradley started his public service as a police officer in El Centro and later  in La Mesa, where he was elevated through the ranks and became city manager. He  was hired in Oceanside in 1988, at an annual salary of $90,000, replacing  Suzanne Foucault, who had resigned as city manager under pressure from the City  Council.  </P></p>

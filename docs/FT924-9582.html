			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Thai Airways falls 49% in quarter THAI Airways International, the partially-privatised national airline, has announced a fall in net profits to Bt3.02bn (Dollars 118m) in the year ended September 30, down from Bt3.50bn the previous year. In the September quarter, net profits fell 49 per cent to Bt1.2bn from Bt2.35bn a year earlier, reflecting fierce regional competition and higher costs. Civilians chosen by the previous government took control of the airline's board from the air force in early September, and the new management is attempting to improve the company's performance and shake off allegations of corruption which have sullied the airline's image in recent years. Most stock analysts are encouraged by the boardroom revolution, although they still regard the company's shares as overpriced compared with those of regional competitors Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines. Profits have again been boosted by aircraft disposals, but brokers say the latest sales make sense because they rationalise the fleet and help reduce over-capacity; in 1991 the airline sold air-craft and immediately leased them back simply to raise cash. Brokers are waiting for further details of the 1992 results and for the company's revised profit forecasts. Sales in the 1992 financial year rose 5.9 per cent to Bt48.43bn, while in the September quarter they rose 4.1 per cent to Bt12.27 over the same period last year.</p>

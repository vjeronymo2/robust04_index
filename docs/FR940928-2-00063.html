The purpose of this CAP is to solicit from qualified parties (applicants) detailed and comprehensive applications to serve as trustee for transactions during the full participation stage of the GNMA Multiclass Securities program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For over two decades, GNMA has operated a single class mortgage-backed securities (MBS) program, under which GNMA guarantees, with the full faith and credit of the United States, the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by private firms approved as GNMA issuers. GNMA has recently initiated a Multiclass Securities program, which began with an initial stage that includes a limited number of participants who assisted in developing the program and in closing transactions to date. GNMA is now moving toward implementation of the full participation stage of the Multiclass Securities program. Henry Cisneros, Security of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has approved a GNMA Multiclass Securities program, which will be operated to meet the requirements of the Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (GNMA REMIC securities) provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. In addition, GNMA is considering implementing a Grantor Trust (STRIPs) and possibly other multiclass programs. GNMA's existing single class MBS program also will continue in operation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;&blank;Sincerely yours, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan M.

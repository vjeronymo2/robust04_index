			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Speculators warm to SE Banken - Hugh Carnegy reports on the rush to buy shares in the Swedish bank IT reported a hefty quarterly loss, its loan losses remain large and brokers, analysts and even the bank's chief executive have been counselling caution all week. But still the rush to buy stock in Scandinaviska Enskilda Banken continued yesterday, pushing the price of its most-traded A shares up to SKr28, more than 3.5 times its value 10 days ago. After first-quarter results from Sweden's four principal commercial banks all showed a marked improvement over the tide of red ink last year, many investors decided the corner had been turned in the country's painful banking crisis. Few who study the sector closely are prepared to state outright that is the case. Nor is it yet clear what level of state support SE Banken, the biggest of the four, has requested from the government to help it recapitalise. A large element in the rise in SE Banken shares has been a gambler's attraction to their hitherto rock-bottom price and the lack of an alternative. Gotabank and Nordbanken are in government hands and unquoted. Shares in Svenska Handelsbanken, the least hard hit by a slew of loan losses deriving mostly from the crippled commercial property sector, have long since recovered from their lows to about SKr90. So those who wanted to be in for the anticipated recovery have jumped into SE Banken this week - forcing the bank to bring forward publication of its quarterly report by a week. How strong is the evidence of a turnround? A feature of the quarterly results has been a clear improvement in the banks' underlying earnings. Handelsbanken, which will report its full quarterly figures next week, has reported preliminary results showing an overall profit of more than SKr350m (Dollars 48m) in the first three months and a 30 per cent rise in profits before loan losses to SKr2.2bn. SE Banken's operating profit before loan losses was up no less than 60 per cent to SKr2.3bn. In spite of its large burden of non-performing loans, net interest earnings were up 14 per cent at SKr2.16bn. The improvement helped it cut its overall operating loss by 55 per cent to SKr608m. Nevertheless, Mr Bjorn Svedberg, SE Banken's chief executive, was sufficiently alarmed by the speculative boom in his bank's shares to warn investors not to read too much into the results. 'Great uncertainty' still surrounded the full-year picture, he said. Although SE Banken's SKr24.6bn portfolio of non-performing loans was down from the year-end figure of almost SKr29bn, the levels of negotiated interest deferments and non-paid interest on non-performing loans was well ahead of the same period last year. The banking sector as a whole is still expected to show a loss for the full year, albeit not as bad as in 1992. As Mr Svedberg pointed out, what the banks needed above all for a sustained recovery was an upturn in the Swedish economy, which was still locked in recession and expected to post a third consecutive year of negative gross national product. The banks are benefitting from a fall in Swedish interest rates, with the key marginal rate down to 9.25 per cent from the double figures of last year. Some analysts remain worried that rising unemployment and falling property values could yet trigger another round of losses for the banks, this time in the household sector. So, although there is clearly some improvement, the Swedish banks are still far from a full recovery - and the government cannot yet draw a line under the SKr67.5bn it has already provided them in state support.</p>

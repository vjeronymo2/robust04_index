			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREWS FIGHT TO KEEP FUEL SPILL OUT OF ALASKA REFUGE  </P> <P> Railroad crews were struggling Thursday to keep an estimated 120,000 gallons of  spilled jet and diesel fuel from seeping through one of the richest waterfowl  nesting areas in North America.  </P> <P> The fuel was spilled Monday when 19 tanker cars on a state-owned Alaska  railroad jumped the tracks and overturned along a remote stretch of line 40  miles southwest of Fairbanks.  </P> <P> The accident occurred on the edge of a vast wetlands system that is the spring  and summer home to an estimated 12 million ducks, geese and other migratory  birds.  </P> <P> Beaver ponds alongside the track kept most of the fuel from flowing into a  series of marshes, meandering creeks and lakes nearby, state environmental  authorities said. The beaver pools, formed by stick-and-mud dams, gave railroad  workers time to move cleanup equipment into place and begin pumping up the  spilled fuel.  </P> <P> "But for the grace of God, and a few beavers, we'd have a major, major  problem," said Rex Blazer, director of the Northern Alaska Environmental  Center, a private Fairbanks conservation group.  </P> <P> By Thursday, the derailed cars had been cleared from the tracks, and the line  reopened, although much of the spilled fuel in the ponds had not yet been  removed, according to Pete McGee, the regional supervisor for the Alaska  Department of Environmental Conservation.  </P> <P> Wildlife biologists and others were concerned that large amounts of fuel could  still seep into a nearby creek and spread quickly through the spongy marsh if  not cleaned up soon.  </P> <P> There were no reports of dead animals or fish, but patches of oily sheen were  spotted several miles downstream from the derailment, and officials reported a  mixture of fuel and water was leaking through one of the beaver dams at a rate  of about 200 gallons a minute.  </P> <P> "It's been going pretty slowly, and we've been encouraging the railroad to get  into higher gear," said Chuck Kleeschulte, a spokesman for the Department of  Environmental Conservation. "They've been having a number of problems. . . .  They didn't have the right hoses. Their nozzles didn't work."  </P> <P> The fuel, being shipped south to Anchorage from a refinery east of Fairbanks,  is more toxic than crude oil. But it is also lighter and will evaporate within  days if exposed to air, officials said.  </P> <P> More than 11 million gallons of crude oil leaked into Alaska's Prince William  Sound when the Exxon Valdez ran aground a year ago in America's biggest oil  spill. That spill aside, this week's train accident ranks among the largest  toxic spills ever in Alaska, officials said.  </P> <P> No one was hurt in the derailment. A spokeswoman for the railroad, which runs a  single line between Fairbanks, Anchorage and the southern coast of the state,  said no cause had been established. A faulty switch is suspected.  </P> <P> The spill occurred on the edge of the Minto Flats State Game Refuge, a  500,000-acre block of wilderness that is home to northern pike and other  freshwater fish, as well as river otters, wolves, black bears and moose. A  recent survey by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game found an average of 213  nesting ducks per square mile, one of the highest concentrations on the  continent, and the area is one of the richest habitats in the world for  trumpeter swans.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another worry was that brush fires could spread into the wetlands  and reach the spilled fuel. Crews have been battling wild fires all week about  20 miles south of the derailment.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 34 (524)] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin used his powers  under the new Constitution and sent Ivan Rybkin, Chairman of the  State Duma, a list of priority bills the cabinet wants approved  in the first quarter of this year.    The 60 bills in the list are regarded by the government to  be  essential for continuation of the reforms in 1994, Vladimir  Kvasov, the government chief of staff, told Interfax in an  exclusive interview. The list includes amendments of the  Criminal and Criminal Processing Codes and pension and value  added tax legislations. The government will ask the law makers  to start working on payment for land, land utilization,  privatization and technological policy legislation.    Even this incomplete list confirms the government resolve to  stay on the reform course and to have a legal basis for this,  Kvasov said. He described the argument advanced by numerous  political scientists and columnists that departure of Yegor  Gaidar and Boris Fyodorov reflected a change of the government  course as "not serious." He explained: "Did only these two  carry the reforms out while the other nearly 30 members of the  government were standing by? Because nearly all other ministers  have retained their jobs, it would be wrong to say that this is  a new government."    He confirmed that the government was "actively engaged" in  preparation for a meeting which would discuss the country's  economic situation and the prospects for its development in  1994. The national budget and ways to put it on a sound basis  are also under discussion.    "The Russian government did not ask scientists Abalkin,  Shatalin, Petrakov and their teams to work out any programs but  it will not reject considering any model of economic development  which might do Russia good," Kvasov said.    He described the government headquarters as a working body  one of whose functions was to concentrate the government's  attention on priority fields such as the socioeconomic policty,  fuel and energy, transportation, communication, conversion of  defense industries to peaceful uses and the investment policy.    A machinery structured function-wise rather than sector-wise  is capable, Kvasov thinks, of helping the government to stay on  this selective course, thus reducing the dangers of sectoral  lobbying. Kvasov believes that this is especially important now  that the country was short of finances and material resources.    He dismissed media reports of differences inside the  government. "A machinery where about 750 senior officials are  engaged does not duplicate the functions of ministries or  departments. Its enables the government to have things done.  This is the formulation of the Russian Council of Ministers  Act, signed by the president on December 22, 1992, or 20 days  before I became head of this echelon," Kvasov emphasized.    He said that there was no truth in the press reports to the  effect that his office was capable of tackling political matters  such as laying the groundwork for the next presidential  elections. "The headquarters was designed as a purely economic,  not political, office. Over 100 doctors and candidates of  economic sciences make the core of its personnel. We draft  about ten government ordinances daily. Nearly 4500 such  documents were processed in the headquarters and its personnel  carried out over 46,000 orders of top authorities last year.  With this amount of work the headquarters simply cannot share  in political tugs-of-war and we never wanted it," Kvasov said.    In his view, the government has "a sufficient safety margin"  and is strong enough to withstand political attacks. Certain  people are trying, however, to make life hard for the government  by provoking strikes and adding to social tensions. The  opponents of reforms are trying, he said, to play "the miners  card."</p>

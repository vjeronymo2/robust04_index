			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Former Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who is dying of liver cancer,  said farewell from his deathbed to his successor, President Alfredo Cristiani,  according to his personal physician. Dr. Jose Luis Saca also said that Duarte  had asked for other friends and colleagues to be sent to his room for brief  goodbys. "He is completely aware that he is dying," said Saca, who added that  the 63-year-old former president is now refusing medication that could prolong  his life. "He asked that I not give him more medicine, so that he may die in  peace." Duarte's cancer was diagnosed in June, 1988. His condition has  deteriorated rapidly the past two days.  </P></p>

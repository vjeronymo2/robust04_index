			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: Write-off of Soviet debt urged THE west should write off Dollars 20bn (Pounds 10.4bn) of the former Soviet Union's debt, enabling cancellation of Dollars 20bn of debt owed to the former USSR by some of the world's poorest countries, a senior UN economist has urged. Mr Shahen Abrahamian, a specialist on debt issues with the UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) in Geneva, says Dollars 10bn of the western debt write-off should be used to free the 10 small former Soviet republics, including the three Baltic states, from their debt obligations. This would leave Dollars 10bn available to cut the debt of the other five republics, including Russia, by about 12 per cent. The scheme would simplify the complex arrangement for assigning ex-Soviet debt to the former republics, and the negotiation of reschedulings. The Baltic states have already repudiated responsibility for this debt. Russia has proposed taking over the full debt, which Mr Abrahamian puts at Dollars 85bn-Dollars 90bn, in return for sole ownership of the former Soviet Union's foreign assets such as gold reserves, stocks of export commodities including diamonds, property and foreign loans. But Mr Abrahamian believes his scheme would be more acceptable to the other republics. In addition, debt relief would be concentrated on the small republics which, the Baltic states aside, are mostly poor or affected by strife. Several countries on the other side of the balance sheet are also poor and many western and Arab aid donors have forgiven these nations' debts, Mr Abrahamian points out.</p>

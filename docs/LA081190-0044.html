			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> PROSECUTION RESTS IN AGUILAR RETRIAL  </P> <P> Prosecutors in the corruption retrial of federal Judge Robert P. Aguilar  concluded their case with the testimony of Aguilar's colleague, Robert F.  Peckham, former chief judge for the Northern California federal court district,  and two FBI agents. Peckham and the agents who followed as defense witnesses  testified that in the summer of 1987, the FBI agents saw Aguilar, 59, lunching  with Abe Chapman, 84, a self-described mob hit man in the 1930s who also had  several drug convictions.  </P> <P> The agents said the FBI did not know that Chapman was a former relative of  Aguilar's by marriage. Aguilar's lawyer, Paul Meltzer, was repeatedly stopped  from asking questions about whether the FBI investigation and subsequent  government prosecution of Aguilar were retaliation for the judge's liberal  views. Meltzer contends that Aguilar, appointed by former President Jimmy  Carter, is being persecuted for his decisions "favoring women, gays, Hispanics  and working people."  </P></p>

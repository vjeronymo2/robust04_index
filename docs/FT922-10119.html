			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / How To Spend It: Pearls with added culture AS THE price of real pearls soars beyond the reach of all but Eastern (or, I suppose, Western) potentates, and as even cultured pearls are becoming increasingly expensive, Cobra &amp; Bellamy has developed a stunning range of faux glass pearls. What makes its range more interesting than most is that they are used with great generosity - no timid little rows of sedate pretend-real baubles, these are generous strings of slightly irregularly shaped Baroque beads given special panache by the clasps, all of which are copies of originals from the 1920s. Most of the cheaper strings of fakes in department stores are spoiled by their colour - too bright and too white (mainly plastic) - and by the give-away cheapness of the clasps. The Cobra &amp; Bellamy 'pearls' are glass beads with a nacrous coating which apes very realistically the iridescent sheen of real pearls. The clasps are equally false but equally bold - faux carved emerald and paste, faux ruby and paste, faux jade and paste stones are used to create distinctive designs which give zest to the whole string. Cobra &amp; Bellamy find that though many of its customers are the sort one might expect to wear only 'real' jewellery, they buy these strings because they feel so much easier walking around wearing something that cost a few hundred as opposed to thousands of pounds. The two strings and clasps photographed here cost Pounds 680 for the five row necklace with a faux carved emerald and paste clasp set in silver. If the pearls were cultured and the clasp real they would probably cost Pounds 60,000. The three-row necklace has a clasp of faux jade and paste stones set in silver and costs Pounds 380. Cobra &amp; Bellamy is at 149, Sloane Street, London SW1 and at Liberty, Regent Street, London W1.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 21 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S.  officials on Saturday [21 May] called off a third day of talks  aimed at striking an elusive deal on jump-starting stalled trade  talks on ways to increase foreign access to key Japanese  markets, informed sources said.    The two countries were earlier scheduled to resume the talks  on Saturday.    Senior U.S. and Japanese officials huddled for more than 10  hours in two days Thursday and Friday to "explore" a common  basis to break a three-month deadlock in the so-called  "framework" talks.</p>

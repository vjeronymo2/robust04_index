			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: GE beats forecasts with Dollars 1.2bn GENERAL Electric, the diversified US manufacturing and services group, yesterday unveiled slightly better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and predicted record results for the whole of 1993. Seven of the group's 12 business segments achieved double-digit growth in operating profits. Only the aircraft engines business posted lower operating profits in the quarter. The company reported net earnings of Dollars 1.21bn, or Dollars 1.41 a share, compared with Dollars 1.11bn, or Dollars 1.30, in the same period of last year. Most analysts had expected earnings per share of Dollars 1.40 in the latest quarter. Revenues advanced by 4 per cent to Dollars 14.86bn from Dollars 14.27bn. On Wall Street, shares in GE closed down Dollars 1 at Dollars 95 1/2 . Last year's earnings included Dollars 114m from GE's aerospace business, which was transferred to Martin Marietta this year. Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said earnings from GE's continuing operations increased 21 per cent from the previous year. Mr Welch added that the operating margin for the quarter was a record 11.6 per cent, compared with 10.2 per cent a year ago, excluding 1992 restructuring charges. He said the company strengthened its global presence during the quarter. The power systems division recorded more than Dollars 800m in international orders. In Europe, GE's NBC television business acquired a majority stake in Super Channel. In Thailand, GE Capital Services, the financial services group, formed a joint venture to provide consumer and commercial financing. For the first nine months of 1993, GE reported net earnings of Dollars 3.7bn, or Dollars 4.33 including a first-quarter accounting charge of Dollars 862m, or Dollars 1.01. A year earlier, it earned Dollars 3.38bn, or Dollars 3.95. Revenues advanced to Dollars 42.48bn from Dollars 40.87bn. Mr Welch said: 'The first three quarters of 1993 have once again demonstrated GE employees' ability to cope with change and win in a difficult global economy. 'We expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter and for the year, more than overcoming the absence of Dollars 345m of aerospace operating net earnings,' he added.</p>

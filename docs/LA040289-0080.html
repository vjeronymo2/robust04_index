			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY BLVD. IS A CHALLENGE FOR PLANNERS IN ALHAMBRA  </P> <P> Valley Boulevard, which had existed for decades in the shadow of Main Street,  is coming of age.  </P> <P> The boulevard has always been a busy commercial area but was never the heart of  the city. Main Street, where the major department stores were located, was the  place to be for shopping and fun.  </P> <P> Some 20 years ago, the Junior Chamber of Commerce even hosted a "Hi Neighbor"  parade on the boulevard featuring as the grand marshal Cheryl Tiegs, an  Alhambra High School graduate turned cover girl. Organizers had hoped the  parade would draw more attention and business to Valley Boulevard.  </P> <P> "It didn't help any," said Dick Nichols, executive director of the Chamber of  Commerce.  </P> <P> But in the early 1980s, business began booming on Valley as Asian immigrants  and other entrepreneurs established businesses ranging from restaurants to  supermarkets to furniture stores.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1 Million in Sales Taxes  </P> <P> The goods and services attract shoppers from as far away as Anaheim and Sun  Valley, raking in nearly $1 million in sales taxes a year for the city and  turning Valley Boulevard between New Avenue and the Long Beach Freeway into a  regional shopping area.  </P> <P> Development has been taking place so rapidly -- since 1980, more than 280,000  square feet of new development has occurred on Valley -- that the City Council  became alarmed about the effect of uncontrolled growth.  </P> <P> So city planners are preparing a plan that will examine issues such as the  environmental and traffic impacts of new developments, minimum lot sizes and  the development of commercial "nodes," described as a more concentrated  collection of businesses at major intersections on Valley, such as Atlantic  Boulevard and Fremont and Garfield avenues.  </P> <P> "We don't want these to be arbitrary rules and regulations," said Mark Persico,  an associate city planner. "We want to control development on Valley Boulevard.  We don't want to stop it."  </P> <P> In addition to concerns such as traffic congestion and building density, some  council members are receiving complaints from residents about the boulevard's  appearance.  </P> <P> "Every time you look, you see a junk store going up," said Councilwoman Barbara  Messina, who lives two blocks north of Valley. She cited as an example one tiny  store crammed with everything from toys to pots and pans. Business signs have  also become a problem, she said.  </P> <P> "It's not just the Asian signs," Messina said. Excessive and  unprofessional-looking signs have made some businesses look tacky, she said.  Improving the aesthetics of the boulevard was one reason why the council last  fall approved plans to install medians between Ethel and Garfield avenues, she  said.  </P> <P> Historically, the city has paid more attention to Main Street, said City  Manager Kevin Murphy. "That's one reason why you have a low-density hodgepodge  look (on Valley) now."  </P> <P> To get more control over future developments on Valley, the council has  directed staff members to draft a specific plan -- the first of its kind in the  city -- which it hopes will help shape development along the boulevard.  </P> <P> A specific plan details what percentage of an area should be devoted to certain  uses and what type of projects -- hotels, restaurants, apartments -- the city  wants developed.  </P> <P> City planners have been meeting with a Valley Boulevard steering committee to  work out details of the plan, which is scheduled to be presented to the public  in late October.  </P> <P> As part of the planning process, the council on Feb. 27 extended a moratorium  halting new construction on Valley. The freeze will be in effect for another 10  months, or until the specific plan is completed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restrictions on Permits  </P> <P> During the moratorium, the city will only issue construction permits for  additions to existing buildings if the addition is less than 20% of the  building, or 4,000 square feet, whichever is less.  </P> <P> The city is also denying requests for land use changes that increase the demand  for parking.  </P> <P> Exemptions may be granted to developers whose projects have been approved by  the Planning Commission, said associate planner Persico. Four to five pending  projects fall into that category, he said.  </P> <P> The effort to draft a specific plan is generally welcomed by the business  community, which has long hungered for detailed development guidelines.  </P> <P> "The reaction has been favorable," Nichols said. "Even though none of us likes  the moratorium, it (specific plan) is needed."  </P> <P> Some business owners do have reservations, though.  </P> <P> "I'm in favor of the city's plan, but not rigid control" said Fred Fong, owner  of Fong Realty on Valley. "I don't know if the city has the right to control  what type of business they (entrepreneurs) can get into."  </P> <P> Valley Boulevard's three-mile stretch through Alhambra is part of a major  thoroughfare cutting across the southern portion of the San Gabriel Valley.  Linking communities from Pomona to Alhambra, the boulevard -- which predates  both the Pomona and San Bernardino freeways -- ends just south of Lincoln  Heights in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As it winds through the city, Valley undergoes several metamorphoses, changing  from a collection of auto repair shops on the west end to Asian supermarkets  and restaurants in the middle to national chain stores and markets on the  eastern edge of town.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formerly Italian Area  </P> <P> The boulevard was where Italian-Americans 30 years ago first opened  delicatessens, novelty shops, and other businesses after moving to Alhambra  from Lincoln Heights and elsewhere in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Anthony Venti Sr., a barber-turned-Realtor who was raised in Los Angeles, said  he had never seen so many fellow Italians until he moved to Alhambra in 1953.  He remembers the boulevard as a promising place to start a business.  </P> <P> "Anything that opened on Valley Boulevard instantly became a success," said  Venti, now president of Anthony Venti Realtors. It's even more so today, he  said, adding that entrepreneurs snap up retail space and offices faster than  they can be built.  </P> <P> "We lease them out before we even finish with them," Venti said. "You can't do  that on Main Street."  </P> <P> He said the secret to Valley is its status as a major artery through the San  Gabriel Valley, even after the San Bernardino and Pomona freeways were built.  Business owners had worried that the freeways would siphon off traffic and  customers, Venti said.  </P> <P> "But it never happened," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asian Market  </P> <P> Immigration during the past eight to 10 years has pushed the city's Asian  population to almost 30% of the city's 73,126 residents.  </P> <P> Situated less than a mile from Monterey Park -- the San Gabriel Valley's  original hub of Asian immigration -- Valley Boulevard became a natural choice  for business owners interested in capturing the Asian market.  </P> <P> The new immigrants opened businesses that both revitalized and altered the look  of the boulevard. Crawford's Market at Atlantic Boulevard, for example, has  given way to the M. W. Asian supermarket, and the Garfield Theater at Garfield  Avenue now features Chinese-language films.  </P> <P> Interspersed with Bob's Big Boy, Shakey's Pizza and Pioneer Chicken are Asian  delicatessens, beauty salons and bookstores.  </P> <P> The corner of Garfield Avenue and Valley Boulevard is a stark juxtaposition of  cultures. On the northeast corner sits the Hong Kong bakery, which offers  Chinese sweets, such as almond cookies and, during the Chinese Autumn Festival,  little "mooncakes" filled with lotus or sweet red beans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Bit of Old Alhambra  </P> <P> Across the street sits a bit of old Alhambra -- an open-air sandwich and  hamburger stand called The Hat.  </P> <P> The place hasn't changed much since the day it opened in 1951, old-timers said.  It is still where residents can grab a hot pastrami sandwich -- billed as the  best in the world -- and a 15-cent cup of coffee.  </P> <P> Former Alhambra residents, many of them from out of state, stop in at the stand  when they are in town, said manager Susana Williams.  </P> <P> "They're happy to see the place standing," Williams said. When she was growing  up in Alhambra, Williams said, she used to go to the movies at the Garfield  Theater and afterward, stroll across the street to The Hat for a pastrami  sandwich.  </P> <P> Property owners and developers have approached Michael Paules, assistant city  manager, with ideas about how the boulevard should be developed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crystal Ball Time  </P> <P> "They are coming to us asking us to use our crystal ball to see what the plan  will say about their property," said Paules, who said their input will help him  draft a plan the community will accept.  </P> <P> To help collect data needed to compile the specific plan, the council has hired  three consulting firms at an estimated cost of $83,000.  </P> <P> Michael Brandman Associates of Los Angeles is the planning consulting firm;  Keyser Marston Associates is providing economic analyses, and Willdan  Associates has been hired to provide traffic analyses.  </P> <P> Parker Williams, a Chamber of Commerce representative on the Valley Boulevard  steering committee, said that because it is difficult for the city's section of  the boulevard to thrive on just retail businesses, he envisions some apartment  and condominium complexes and two-story office buildings.  </P> <P> "I think we'll have a mixture of residential, commercial and retail," Williams  said.  </P> <P> City planners said more detailed planning will make it easier for them to  evaluate development proposals from entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> "It was all done through the zoning ordinance and the General Plan, which are  good planning tools, but they are very broad," Persico said of the city's  method of assessing development proposals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Downtown Plan  </P> <P> Developers contemplating projects on Main Street, about a mile north of Valley,  say they wish a specific plan could also be produced for downtown.  </P> <P> Andrew Cherng, president of Panda Management Co., left a recent redevelopment  agency meeting feeling frustrated, not because his proposal to build a Panda  Inn restaurant/retail center on Main Street was rejected, but because he said  the agency did not offer any clues as to what type of project it wants.  </P> <P> "I didn't get any idea what you are allowed to develop there," Cherng said of  the site at 5th and Main streets. "There is no indication. That, I think, makes  it difficult to conduct business."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Storefront Renovations  </P> <P> While the city is mapping out the future of Valley, some property and business  owners are already busy renovating storefronts.  </P> <P> For example, Alhambra Valley Center, a 32-year-old commercial center carved out  of an old airfield near Almansor Street, is now undergoing a face lift and will  soon be renamed The Market Place. Instead of Zody's, a discount department  store that went out of business there about three years ago, the shopping  center now features HQ, an office supply store.  </P> <P> City officials and members of the business community are all anxious to see a  final draft of the plan.  </P> <P> Said Williams, of the Chamber of Commerce, "The business owners, they are  looking forward to the upshot of all this."  </P></p>

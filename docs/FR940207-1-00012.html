			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(2) Compounding and Crediting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(2)(i) Frequency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interpretation of this paragraph is deferred pending the Board's final action on proposed amendments to Regulation DD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(2)(ii) Effect of Closing an Account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed comment 4(b)(2)(ii)&hyph;1 explains that institutions may include in their contract specific consumer actions that will be considered by the institution to be a request to close the account, and that may result in the nonpayment of accrued but uncredited interest. (See &sect;230.7(b) of this part.) The Board solicits comment on this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(4) Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments 4(b)(4)&hyph;1 through &hyph;3 provide guidance for disclosing the amount of fees that may be assessed in connection with the account and the conditions under which they may be imposed. The Board believes that attempting to list in the commentary all fees imposed by institutions would produce a list that would become both lengthy and outdated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(5) Transaction Limitations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 4(b)(5)&hyph;1 clarifies that institutions need not disclose their right to require seven-day advance notice for withdrawals from an account. (See 12 CFR part 204.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(6) Features of Time Accounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(6)(i) Time Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 4(b)(6)(i)&hyph;1 provides that institutions offering ``callable'' time accounts must state the date or the circumstances under which the account may be redeemed, in addition to the maturity date. The Board believes the disclosure is a component of the maturity date_informing the consumer when the funds in the account may become available for reinvestment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(6)(ii) Early Withdrawal Penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 4(b)(6)(ii)&hyph;2 provides examples of early withdrawal penalties, and clarifies that early withdrawal penalties include bonuses that may be reclaimed if funds are withdrawn prior to maturity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 4(b)(6)(ii)&hyph;3 clarifies that institutions are not required to disclose as early withdrawal penalties potential income taxation consequences for consumers who withdraw funds held in IRAs or similar plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 230.5_Subsequent Disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Change in Terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (a)(1) Advance Notice Required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 5(a)(1)&hyph;3 provides guidance on an institution's responsibilities to provide change in terms notices when account disclosures reflect that a term may change upon the occurrence of an event, such as a fee waiver for employees during their employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Board believes that a change in terms notice does not extend to changes in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> type <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of account held. (See proposed commentary to &sect;230.4(a)(1) of this part, which clarifies that transferring funds held in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MMDA to open a NOW account must be treated as the opening of a new account.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) Check Printing Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation's exception to providing a change in terms notice for increases to check printing charges is based on the consumer's control over the style and quantity of checks ordered. The Board solicits comment on other products, if any, that should be similarly treated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Notice Before Maturity for Time Accounts Longer Than One Month That Renew Automatically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments 5(b)&hyph;1 through &hyph;5 address questions about notices that must be sent for automatically renewing time accounts. Comment 5(b)&hyph;1 provides guidance regarding a time account that may, in fact, have a term longer than the stated maturity date because the maturity date falls on a weekend or holiday. The Board has received questions asking whether this delay on a one-year time deposit would make the term longer than one year (thus requiring the full account disclosures under paragraph 5(b)(1) of this section prior to renewal rather than the abbreviated disclosures permitted by paragraph 5(b)(2)). The same issue arises for time accounts with a stated term of one month that may be extended beyond 31 days. The Board believes these short extensions due to the maturity date's falling on a weekend or holiday do not affect the classification of the account for purposes of the type of disclosures institutions are required to provide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 5(b)&hyph;2 clarifies that when disclosing the date when the interest rate and annual percentage yield can be determined, institutions may use general disclosures of that date if the date is easily discerned.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has received many questions about ``club accounts.'' Comment 5(b)&hyph;4 makes clear that club accounts that otherwise meet the definition of a time account (&sect;230.2(u)) must follow the requirements of this section, even if the consumer withdraws funds at maturity rather than ``rolling over'' the principal amount for another term. The proposed comment also clarifies that if the consumer has previously agreed to make payments into the account for the next club cycle (for example, by direct deposit or by transfers from another account), the club account should be treated as an automatically renewable time account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment 5(b)&hyph;5 clarifies disclosure requirements for a changed term for the subsequent renewal of a rollover time account. If the notice required by this paragraph has been provided to the consumer about the renewing time account, institutions may provide new account disclosures or a disclosure that reflects the consumer's request and the new term. The regulation states that if disclosures have previously been given and the terms remain the same, institutions need not provide the disclosures a second time. (See &sect;230.4(a) of this part.) Since consumers receive disclosures about their renewing time account, this approach provides consumers with essential information and eases compliance for institutions. The Board requests comment on this approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b)(1) Maturities of Longer Than One Year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

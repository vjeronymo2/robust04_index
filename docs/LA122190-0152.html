			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SNOW USHERS IN WINTER -- EVEN WHERE LIFE'S A BEACH  </P> <P> Winter made an authentic entrance into Southern California today, as a massive  Arctic weather system scattered light snow along the oceanfront from the Palos  Verdes Peninsula to San Clemente and temperatures dropped to near freezing  throughout the metropolitan area.  </P> <P> Snowfall in mountains farther inland was considerably heavier and forced  closure of Interstate 5 near Gorman, where drifts up to a foot deep were  reported.  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol said the storm triggered numerous accidents in  the area and dozens of vehicles were stuck in ice and snow.  </P> <P> The snow along the coastline began at about 8 a.m. and melted almost  immediately, but not before it had startled commuters accustomed to balmier  weather. In San Pedro, residents reported morning flurries that lasted up to 15  minutes.  </P> <P> The National Weather Service said there was a chance of more flurries in the  metropolitan area this afternoon, most likely in foothill communities such as  La Crescenta, La Canada-Flintridge and Altadena.  </P> <P> Forecasters said the frigid, blustery conditions were caused by a huge,  slow-moving low-pressure system that by now is blanketing the western half of  the nation.  </P> <P> "The cold air has been spilling down out of the Arctic like heavy syrup, oozing  slowly south into the United States," said Rick Dittmann, a forecaster with  WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. "It's been cold, and  it's staying cold."  </P> <P> Today is the winter solstice. Winter begins officially at 7:07 p.m.  </P></p>

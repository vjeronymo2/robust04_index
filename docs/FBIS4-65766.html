			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Mehmet Gulcegun, deputy leader of the Social  Democratic Populist Party [SDPP], has said that the Habur border  gate with Iraq will regain its old vitality in the coming period.    At a news conference in Ankara, Gulcegun said this step will  partly alleviate the load placed on the Turkish economy by the  embargo imposed on Iraq. Furthermore, he said, reopening the  Habur border gate will end the crisis in the transportation  sector, which is an important source of income in southeast  Anatolia.    Gulcegun pointed out that Murat Karayalcin, SDPP leader and  deputy prime minister, will go to Baghdad next month. During  the visit, the SDPP deputy leader said, work will be conducted  to develop cooperation possibilities.    [Begin Gulcegun recording] We are trying to solve the Habur  problem, because it is the source of other negative developments  in the region. Loyal to the unity of the country and to the  state, the industrious regional people will make use of this  opportunity in the best possible way. They will ensure their  income while contributing to the economy of our country. [end  recording]</p>

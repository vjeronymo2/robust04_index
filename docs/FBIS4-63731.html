			<p>BFN     [Text] Kharkov, 24 May -- Ukraine's railroad industry is on  the brink of bankruptcy, Oleksandr Puchkov, head of Southern  Railroads [Pivdenna Zaliznytsya] told UNIAR. "Considering the  present conditions, we should have laid off at least 30,000  Southern Railroads employees. Railroad workers have not been  paid since January. The railroad used to get its main profit  from freight which accounted for 90 percent of the entire  workload. But now freight makes up only 21 percent of the  business, with 79 percent taken up by passenger and commuter  travel and overall traffic constantly declining. The situation  is the same on Ukraine's five other railroad networks."</p>

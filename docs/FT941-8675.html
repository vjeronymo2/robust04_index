			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Back to the table South Africa's constitutional chicken is coming home to roost. Unless the country's political leaders return to the negotiating table and tackle unfinished business, April's election will unleash hostilities that could even trigger a civil war. The constitutional agreement reached last November was a remarkable achievement, but it had one fundamental flaw. It gave the central government executive, in which the African National Congress is almost certain to be the leading player, overriding powers over almost all areas of provincial government. This issue, exacerbated by a dangerous mix of ethnic differences, party rivalries and personality clashes, is at the heart of the increasingly bitter dispute between Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader whose stronghold is Natal province, and Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president. Mr Mandela has attempted to defuse the growing crisis by offering concessions on the constitution. The ANC has dropped its opposition to provincial balloting in April, thus allowing regional leaders to prove the substantial support they claim to enjoy on their home turf. But this will be of little consequence unless it is made clearer just what power regional leaders can exercise through the provincial assemblies. Mr Mandela should make more substantial concessions in an effort to meet Chief Buthelezi's concerns. Otherwise, they might have little impact on the crisis. Nevertheless, Chief Buthelezi should also make the most of Mr Mandela's overture. A door that seemed closed is now ajar. The Inkatha leader boycotted the final rounds of the constitutional talks, arguing that the alliance between the ANC and the government allowed them to steamroller their constitutional model through the conference. At this critical stage in South Africa's history he should join in, putting his case and setting out minimum terms for ending his boycott of the April poll. For his part, Mr Mandela must give more substance to the existing constitutional blueprint and dispel suspicions that the ANC pays only lip service to the principle of decentralisation. Western countries keen to foster free elections in South Africa could help by making clear that those elections can only succeed if governed by a constitution that provides a sound foundation for democracy. An unbridgeable gap may remain at the end of the day. The ANC and the National party, having gone as far as they think they can towards meeting Chief Buthelezi's legitimate concerns, may still have to proceed without him  -facing him with the choice between conceding, in the interests of a stable South Africa, and pursuing his threat to disrupt the elections, in the name of democracy. Chief Buthelezi must now grasp what may be the last opportunity to reconcile these dangerous and deep-rooted differences peacefully.</p>

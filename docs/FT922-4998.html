			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Arts: National Opera Studio Students of accountancy and law may count themselves fortunate that they do not have to do end-of-term public showings. Each year the singers of the National Opera Studio are expected to appear in an evening of scenes from various operas, which is in some ways more difficult than performing in a complete one. For this year's 'Showcase', given at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday, the Studio made sure that professional guidance was on hand. Tim Albery was the producer and David Parry with the Bournemouth Sinfonietta took charge of the musical side, but neither exactly gave the students an easy ride. The ensemble was precarious even in the scores the orchestra seemed to know, while events on stage sometimes saw ingenuity triumph over commonsense. The test of an evening like this is to see if the student performers can find the mechanism that makes their characters tick within the timescale of a single scene. To this end Albery had not been a wholly reliable guide. The amorous cavorting between Rossini's Figaro and Rosina had little to do with their operatic characters; and Don Jose was left to sing the Flower Song lying on his back while his glamorous Carmen did a striptease on the other side of the stage. Nevertheless, at least the Studio does have a Don Jose. Indeed, both the tenors made a good impression vocally. Mark Luther, who had appeared in the Carmen excerpt, also sang in a scene from Donizetti's Anna Bolena, though arguably with a better feeling for the French sound and style. Mark Le Brocq was wanting in sensuality as Massenet's Des Grieux, but returned as an outstanding Albert Herring, genuinely moving, a complete operatic portrayal in embryo. The standard of singing suggested a good year. Among the strengths were Kay Jordan's Anna Bolena and Anita Morrison's Agathe, in Weber's Der Freischutz. The honours of the evening, however, went to the partnership of Mary Plazas and Ann Taylor-Morley, who took on a scene from Donizetti's rarely-performed Maria Padilla and delivered it with a fine sense of style. These were two operatic people who came alive and one would gladly have stayed for them in the rest of the opera.</p>

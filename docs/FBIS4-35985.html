			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH  writes on Israel's premeditated intentions, aggressions, and  piracy against Lebanon. It says that the objectives of these  actions are obvious, and will only bolster Lebanon's national  unity and its rejection of any concessions regarding the  resistance or the peace process.    In a comment today, the paper writes on Israel's hostile  intentions and actions. It says: All analysts, particularly  the international analysts, agree that Israel's aggressions,  particularly against the Arab sides participating in the peace  process, which adhere to that process, clearly prove that Israel  has premeditated intentions to destroy the available opportunity  to achieve peace.    The newspaper TISHRIN writes on the massacre Israel has  perpetrated in the city of Ba'labakk. It stresses that this  massacre dealt a great blow to the peace process, and that its  timing makes it obvious that it was a stab in the back of the  United States' efforts to save the peace process from the  stalemate caused by the Israeli rejection of the pillars of a  just and comprehensive peace.    TISHRIN says: By escalating its aggressive and brutal acts,  and declaring a continuous war against Lebanon, Israel is trying  to direct its missiles, guns, and bombers to assassinate the  peace process this time, after it has failed to derail this  process from the set objectives confirmed in documents and  pledges.    TISHRIN stresses: There is no doubt that the abortion of the  peace process by escalating the situation, launching devastating  Israeli wars, kidnapping resistance men, and killing innocent  people, necessitate that the international community link its  words with deeds, pressuring Israel to stop this aggressive,  brutal policy, and to respond to the pillars of a just and  comprehensive peace.    TISHRIN notes: In light of the Israeli attempts and the  Israeli occupation forces' brutal actions to torpedo the peace  process, the United States, which stressed the need to continue  its efforts, and said that its role has not been exhausted, must  now, before anyone else, hasten to save this process from the  Israeli shelling and to prevent its destruction. This can only  be achieved by deterring the Israeli Government and curbing its  provocative practices.</p>

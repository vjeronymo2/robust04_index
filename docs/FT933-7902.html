			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Jacques II leads restoration at EBRD: The rise of a French mandarin A FISCAL disciplinarian. A stickler for detail. A dedicated civil servant. These are the kind of epithets used by former colleagues to describe Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the new head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. They suggest he will run a much tighter ship than his predecessor, Mr Jacques Attali. In Paris, government and financial officials say Mr de Larosiere, the 63-year old governor of the Bank of France, has the expertise and style to set a new course for the EBRD and to repair the damage to France's image wrought by Mr Attali's forced departure. 'The problems encountered by Mr Attali were a result of his style, but also a result of his lack of experience in banking and finance,' said one French government official. 'In both regards we expect a difference with Mr de Larosiere.' Statesmanlike and precise, Mr de Larosiere comes across as the archetypal central banker. Mr Attali, by contrast, struck many bankers as a Bohemian intellectual. Mr de Larosiere certainly has more impressive financial credentials than Mr Attali, who had never previously run a bank. Before becoming governor of the Bank of France in 1987 he served for eight years as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Before that he worked his way up the ranks of the French Treasury, a period during which he managed development assistance programmes at the French Economics Ministry and chaired the economic development committee of the OECD. In 1974 he was appointed head of the French Treasury. According to one former monetary official in Washington, Mr de Larosiere is a disciplined bureaucrat. 'He has always regarded himself as an instrument of his political masters. He will not have his own agenda.' It was during Mr de Larosiere's stint at the IMF in the early 1980s that the third world debt crisis briefly threatened the stability of the global financial system. Mr de Larosiere is remembered for being cool and resourceful during the crisis. Mr Attali himself has contributed to this impression, writing in 1985: 'The worst is over for Argentinian debt thanks to de Larosiere who knew how to manage the crisis with the private banks.' However, others query the relevance of much of Mr de Larosiere's experience for his new task. One former senior IMF official notes that Mr de Larosiere's expertise lies largely in macroeconomic and fiscal policy. He has no track record in promoting entrepreneurship or private sector development, a job that might come more naturally to a private-sector banker. 'His IMF background does not reassure me,' says Professor Hans Singer of the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, a long-term critic of IMF structural adjustment programmes. He would have preferred a 'neutral figure', perhaps from one of the Nordic countries rather than somebody associated with the IMF's 'contractionist, monetarist framework'. 'The west missed an opportunity in not appointing a well-qualified east European,' comments Mr John Williamson, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. Mr de Larosiere's most important contribution is likely to be in restoring morale and reforming the management of the EBRD which, under Mr Attali, has been heavily criticised for its slow disbursement of loans to eastern Europe and for its lack of financial controls. 'He is quiet, not bombastic, but he can be very tough,' says Mr Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, who worked alongside Mr de Larosiere during the 1980s debt crisis. Mr de Larosiere 'will run the EBRD with a firm hand', says a former colleague at the IMF. 'He likes to make sure people know who is boss. He loves the thought of putting order into finances.' At the Bank of France, Mr de Larosiere leaves more harmonious labour relations and a more efficient management structure than when he arrived. In 1987 the unions at the bank launched sporadic protests against planned changes to working practices. Mr de Larosiere reached an agreement with the unions and subsequently reformed the management structure, encouraging greater delegation of decision-making. Apart from the occasional spat, such as during the recent legislation to make the central bank independent, labour relations have been relatively smooth during his tenure. Those who have worked with him say his management style is firm but open. 'He likes to build a consensus before acting,' says a colleague at the Bank of France. At both the IMF and the Bank of France, Mr de Larosiere won a reputation as an ardent advocate of macroeconomic austerity. At the IMF he had an almost emotional attachment to fiscal retrenchment in debtor countries, according to insiders. In France the same firmness has been evident in Mr de Larosiere's conduct of monetary policy. An unswerving advocate of the strong franc policy of successive governments, he has sought to ensure a policy of financial discipline to reduce inflationary pressures and to improve the competitiveness of French industry. This policy has been successful, with French unit labour costs now lower than most of France's European competitors and with annual inflation at a meagre 2 per cent. However, the sustained assaults against the franc last month have strengthened the hands of those in Paris who are pressing for a more expansionary economic policy. The currency crisis has also cast a shadow over Mr de Larosiere's vision for western Europe. He helped prepare the Delors report on European economic and monetary union, which laid the foundation for the Maastricht treaty, but which has been shaken by the weakening of the ERM. Approaching retirement age, Mr de Larosiere must now adjust to new horizons. He is likely to find the challenge of helping to revive the private sectors of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union at least as demanding as any other he has faced in a long and distinguished career.</p>

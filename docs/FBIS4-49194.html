			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, May 3 (XINHUA) -- China said here  today that it would do its utmost to ensure the fourth world  women's congress, to be convened in Beijing in September, a  complete success.    In her meeting with the Chinese press based in New York this  morning, Chen Muhua, president of the All-China Women's  Federation, said that the preparation for the congress had been  going on very well.    She said that she would like to extend warm welcome to all  those who would participate in the Beijing congress on behalf of  the host nation.    Chen, also a chairperson of the Standing Committee of  China's  National People's Congress, attended a ceremony on Monday [2  May] to receive the Maurice Pate award conferred to her  federation by the UN Children's Fund.    According to Chen, there will be about 10,000 delegates, UN  officials and correspondents, and 20,000 representatives from  different non-governmental organizations present on the occasion.    "China pays great attention to the successful convening of  the congress," Chen said, "And its State Council has already set  up an organizational committee, which comprises senior leaders  from several dozens of government ministries."    According to sources of the United Nations, regional  meetings, whose job it is to help finalize the draft documents  for the world congress, will be convened in the next few months.    "As the host country," Chen said, "China will try to send  delegates to these regional preparatory meetings to collect  information and to gain a better understanding of the regional  concerns, so as to ensure a complete success of the Beijing  congress."</p>

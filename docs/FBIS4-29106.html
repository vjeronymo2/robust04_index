			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hope for Progress in Issues Related to Military </F> Bases"]    [Text] In postwar Okinawa, there have been two cases in  which the Okinawan people put up a united front in a "people's  struggle." Needless to say, one of these was the struggle for  the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese rule, and the other was the  "struggle for land." The first struggle came to a successful  conclusion for the most part on 15 May 1972. However, the  second struggle has yet to end, strictly speaking. Today, U.S.  military bases which occupy a large portion of the land on  Okinawa still continue to suppress and hamper the livelihood of  the Okinawan people and impede Okinawa's reconstruction and  development projects as well as its future, even though 23 years  have already passed since reversion.    Recently, however, it is heartening to see new moves toward  settling Okinawa's land problems.    One such move is the fact that the United States, which is  the most important of the parties concerned in the land issue,  has started inspecting, evaluating, and considering the issue.  Taking into consideration the changes in the international  political situation and the military scene due to the collapse  of the Cold War structure, it is only natural that the United  States has decided to review the matter.    Another move is one that has been brought about by the  collapse of the political structure in which the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP] continuously held on to power since 1955,  changes in the domestic political situation, and changes in the  government's attitude regarding the issue of military bases on  Okinawa.    Politicians from different parties are also moving toward  helping enact a bill on special measures for promoting the use  of land currently occupied by military bases, upon their return.    Finally, let us not overlook the fact that the local chapter  of the LDP has revised its policy regarding military bases.    In the past, it seemed that military base issues were a  specialty of the local reformist forces. Local conservative  parties, including the local chapter of the LDP, appeared to be  passive about military base issues, entrapped in the framework  of the Japan-U.S. security arrangement upheld by the LDP, which  dominated national politics. However, the local conservatives  bid farewell to their past at the local LDP chapter's convention  held on 10 June. They spelled out a local-interests-oriented  platform, asserting that "a new economic system and a  reconstruction of the social structure is being sought," and  that "progress has not been made despite efforts to reduce  excessive reliance on military bases by calling for their  consolidation and retrenchment."    As the history of postwar "people's struggles" show, the  only  time that the Okinawan people emerged victorious was when they  were able to put up a united front. Among the problems that  Okinawa faced were the struggle for reversion and the struggle  to uphold the four principles regarding safeguarding the  Okinawan people's land. Such problems were basically related to  domestic policies and foreign affairs. Okinawans were up  against the United States as well as their own home country.  Against such a solid wall, the greatest power that could pierce  an opening in this wall toward solving these problems is their  unity and determination. As former U.S. Secretary of State  Henry Kissinger has written in his book, the strength and  determination of the local people can change both foreign and  national policies.    Currently, Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota is visiting the  United States in a bid to resolve such issues related to  military bases as the return of the naval port in Naha, return  of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield, and suspension of live-shell  firing exercises across prefectural route 104. On 10 June, Ota  met with Hawaii Governor John Waihee and held a news conference  with U.S. reporters, during which he explained the situation of  U.S. military bases on Okinawa and tried to gain understanding  on the purpose of his U.S. visit. During the same news  conference, U.S. Representative Neil Abercrombie, who is a  member of the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee,  disclosed that a provision for a total review of U.S. military  bases on Okinawa has been included in a bill calling for a  review of national defense for fiscal year 1995. The bill was  recently approved by the House Armed Services Committee. The  representative reportedly has also said: "Firm demands by  Governor Ota are necessary so that the United States will  actually conduct a total review of its military bases on  Okinawa." It is hoped that with the Okinawan people firmly  backing him up, the governor can turn his U.S. visit and his  efforts at "direct diplomacy" into a tremendously fruitful  mission.    Although it may be a little early at this stage, groundwork  should eventually be laid down to handle matters in the event  the land occupied by military bases are turned over. In this  regard, it is urged that a law on special measures for promoting  diversion of military-occupied land be enacted during the  current Diet session by all means.</p>

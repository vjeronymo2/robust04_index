			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- Pakistan on Monday warned the Arab  nationals, who fought in the Afghan war and are now living in  NWFP [North-West Frontier Province] to immediately leave the  country or face severe action.    The government has sent a letter to all such organisations  to  make sure that all Arabs leave by April 18. Those staying here  after April 18 May be arrested and the organisations still  employing them may face punitive action. A govt official said  about 120 such Arab nationals were still in NWFP, about 80 to 70  in Peshawar. Most of them are from Egypt, Algeria, Saudi Arabia  and Tunisia.    He said those with valid papers had already been allowed to  stay, but other would have to go. "We can't allow them to use  Pakistani territory for carrying out terrorist acts against  other nations," the official said.</p>

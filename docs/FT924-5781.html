			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / People: Lewis - a 'mega-guy' for Gabicci Henry Lewis, a former joint managing director of Marks &amp; Spencer, has joined the board of USM-quoted casual clothing group Gabicci as a non-executive director; Michael Abrahams has ceased to be managing and finance director. Gabicci, which was founded in 1973 by current chairman Jack Sofier - whose wife dreamt up the name - had recently been approached by the considerably bigger clothing distributor Helene, but talks collapsed at an early stage after information was leaked to the media. Sofier, 60, who has known Lewis since they met on Sofier's honeymoon 37 years ago, describes the appointment as 'an incredible coup. We're a tin-pot little company and he is a mega guy'. Lewis, 66, was joint managing director of Marks from 1973, alongside Sir Derek (later Lord) Rayner; Lord Rayner became chairman in 1984 and Lewis retired in 1985. Since then he was deputy chairman of Berisford for three years, and is currently a director of Dixons and Porter Chadburn. He considers Gabicci 'a very well-managed company that has an impressive group of young and lively people'. But he thinks it has reached maturity and is in need of 'a little outside experience' to steer its future path. Sofier, who currently owns 14 per cent of the company, is reluctant to discuss the 'difference of opinion over strategy' that led to Abrahams' departure, but will say that 'it is my view we could operate more efficiently and better if we were part of a large group'. Abrahams had combined the two roles for the past two years, and was finance director for the previous eight. He is still on the board in a non-executive capacity: 'It is up to him to resign. I am quite comfortable he will,' says Sofier. The chairman now takes on the job of managing director as well, and is looking for a finance director. 'I'm a very young 60. I have no plans to put my feet up,' says Sofier.</p>

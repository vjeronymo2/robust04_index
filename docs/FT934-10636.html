			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / CD group faces legal action over unauthorised recordings TRING International, the budget price compact disc company being floated next month, faces legal action for allegedly selling unauthorised recordings of Olivia Newton John, Cat Stevens, Bob Marley and other artists. Tring, whose chairman is Mr Alan Wheatley, former chairman of venture capital group 3i, is also being sued for allegedly passing off one of its CDs as being by the artist Chris de Burgh. The recording was actually made by a group called the Ron David Orchestra. Mr Wheatley, who is a non-executive director of the Forte hotel group, British Steel, and financial institutions NM Rothschild and Legal &amp; General, was unavailable for comment. Mr Mark Frey, Tring's joint chief executive, said all the complaints were being investigated and the company's policy was to withdraw the music concerned from sale. He said Tring had always paid royalties to companies it believed held copyrights. He said that the actions would not have a material effect on Tring's profits, which were Pounds 3.3m pre-tax last year; nor would it affect the planned flotation, which he expects to value the company at Pounds 45m. The company, whose CDs usually sell for Pounds 2.99, had about 800 titles in its catalogue, he said. The legal actions affected only a small proportion of those. He added: 'Litigation on copyright is an ongoing thing. Every company in this business is involved in litigation.' Record groups that have served writs on Tring include PolyGram, EMI Records and MCA. MCA alleges Tring has sold unauthorised recordings from the musical Chess. Mr Frey said Tring was in dispute with MCA over who owned the copyright. Chris de Burgh is also suing the company, as is A&amp;M, part of PolyGram. Chris de Burgh says in his writ that Tring has sold CDs and tapes with covers containing his name in large letters along with the words 'The Lady in Red', one of his works. He said that at the top of the cover were the words, in extremely small print: 'The Instrumental Hits of'. Mr Frey said the recording had been withdrawn and reissued to make clear that Chris de Burgh did not appear on it. Island Records, also part of PolyGram, alleges that Tring sold unauthorised recordings of Bob Marley and Cat Stevens. Mr Frey said he was confident Tring held proper title to the Bob Marley recordings and that he was counter-suing Island. He said Tring would defend its right to the Cat Stevens recordings, but those had been withdrawn from sale. He said the company had withdrawn its Olivia Newton John recordings from sale. EMI is suing Tring over the recordings.</p>

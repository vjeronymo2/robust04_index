			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "New Confrontation"] </F>   [Text] The apparent calm in Moscow is still merely  ephemeral. The calm which had reigned in Russia since the  December elections was shattered on Wednesday 23 February on the  eve of Boris Yeltsin's address to the Federal Assembly on his  reform program. Although he can pride himself on the "success"  of his diplomacy in Bosnia, in Moscow he is being forced into a  confrontation with Parliament, whose lower house -- the Duma --  has voted for an amnesty for last October's "putschists" and for  the August 1991 "putschists."    This is a decision which benefits dozens of his enemies,  whether in prison or out of prison, and principally Aleksandr  Rutskoy, the former vice president who enjoys a popularity  capable of giving the opposition the figurehead it has lacked  since Vladimir Zhirinovskiy has been discredited by his  extremism.    The issue is therefore an important one, and the tone taken  by some people close to Boris Yeltsin in condemning this vote is  reminiscent of that used on the eve of the October clashes.  There is once again talk of a "threat of civil war" and they  are warning that the deputies "will have to take all the  consequences" of their action....    The former Communists and nationalists, of whom there are  even more in the Duma than in the former Parliament, at the  instigation of Mr. Zhirinovskiy's party, very quickly found the  flaw in the new Constitution, despite the fact that it strips  them of virtually all power to the benefit of the president or  the prime minister. Although the laws adopted by the Duma can so  easily be blocked, the Constitution does not stipulate any limit  on its right to grant an amnesty.    And yet on Thursday, the president's spokesman warned that  there is no question of Boris Yeltsin allowing Aleksandr Rutskoy  and the other putschists to leave prison "for weeks or months."  He said a new war over interpretations of laws has begun but  that the opposition's aims go further. Gennadiy Zyuganov, head  of the Communist group in Parliament, has already called for the  resignation of Boris Yeltsin and what remains of the reformers  in the government as a "compromise" measure....    Boris Yeltsin will therefore have to ignore the Constitution  with which he has provided himself and which, as he again  stressed on Thursday, is the cornerstone of the country's  stability. The West will be all the more tempted to continue to  disregard the undemocratic lapses of the "reform president" in  Russia even though it is true that these reforms are now taking  an entirely different course, overtaken by the explosion of  illegal practices, racketeering, and the exodus of capital.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] There is a fact that must not be forgotten, and  it says that Kuwait prior to 2 August 1990 is different from  today's and tomorrow's Kuwait. The lesson learned on that date  was a lesson beyond imagination for all children of the Arab  nation generally and for the children of Kuwait in particular.  Nobody had imagined that the day would come when one Arab would  attack another Arab brother, would invade his land, and would  treat him as one treats enemy prisoners.    This is a history that has left its imprints on every heart,  in the depths of every conscience, and in the crevices of the  soul of every Kuwaiti who had been living safely and securely.  This Kuwaiti citizen has responded to his Arab nation most  sincerely, courageously, and faithfully and has tried as hard as  possible to support his Arab brother in all positions and crises  to the degree of his belief in this brother's position and his  awareness of this brother's crisis. [passage omitted]    In this regard, we find that relations between Egypt and  Kuwait are distinguished relations that crystallize that vital  slogan that is applied seriously, enthusiastically, and with  mutual faith. The slogan is that Egypt and Kuwait are brothers  in time of tribulation and partners in time of prosperity. If  time confirmed this fact in the past, whether before or after  the aggression, then it behooves us to take a pause before the  reflection of the Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations in the past year.    To start, we generally say that in 1993, Egyptian-Kuwaiti  relations experienced constant growth at all levels. This growth  reflected the strong boost these relations had gained during the  aggression to which Kuwait was subjected by Saddam Husayn,  Iraq's tyrant. This ordeal contributed to strengthening the  bonds of love and fraternity between the two peoples,  considering that Egyptians and Kuwaitis united as a single man  in their rejection of the aggression and their defense of  Kuwait's freedom and independence.    This growth in the two countries' relations was not confined  to official aspects solely but was coupled with a noticeable  leap in relations between the two fraternal peoples. This leap  was embodied in the frequent visits between representatives of  the two countries' popular organizations and in increased  numbers of Kuwaiti tourists coming to Egypt, not to mention the  single spirit that united both countries' read, seen, and heard  media, which played the same tune for freedom, dignity, and  independence.    When speaking of development of the Egyptian-Kuwaiti  relations in 1993, we can say that a new spirit cast its shadows  on the various aspects of cooperation between the two countries  since the invasion ordeal that culminated with the invaders'  defeat and with the restoration of Kuwait to its legitimate  owners. This cooperation is no longer based on interest alone  and it no longer relies on the conventional mainstays that bind  all Arab and Islamic countries. Rather, other elements of  rapprochement and harmony were generated and they resulted in  the spontaneous solidarity between the two people's citizens  during the ordeal.    It is worth noting that the direction of the bilateral  Egyptian-Kuwaiti relations indicates greater closeness and  communication in the coming phase, thus reinforcing the  accomplishments made recently as a result of the wise leadership  of His Highness Prince Jabir al-Ahmad al-Sabah, amir of the  State of Kuwait, and His Excellency Muhammad Husni Mubarak,  president of the Arab Republic of Egypt.  <H5>  One Philosophy </H5>   In the information and culture area, Kuwait was keen on  organizing cultural weeks in Egypt, including art shows and  varied intellectual and literary activities. They included the  week organized by the University of Kuwait in cooperation with  Alexandria University--a week which abounded with artistic and  intellectual demonstrations that reflected the spirit of  cooperation between the two countries. Kuwait also participated  in the activities of the Cairo International Fair which was held  at the beginning of this year.    Moreover, Cairo witnessed the visit by Kuwaiti Information  Minister Shaykh Sa'ud Nasir al-Sabah who met with President  Husni Mubarak and high-ranking officials. The minister concluded  a number of agreements in the various information areas to  bolster cooperation between the two countries' radio and  television people. This cooperation was bolstered with the  agreement concluded between Amin Basyuni, head of the Radio and  Television Union; and Faysal al-Hajji, Kuwaiti Information  Ministry undersecretary, to receive the transmission of the  Kuwaiti satellite channel and to retransmit it in Egypt. Kuwait  also purchased a large number of television and radio  productions from the union.    Educational cooperation marched in step with the information  cooperation. Egypt loaned 1,053 male and female teachers to  Kuwait and increased the number of Kuwaiti male and female  students in Egyptian institutes and universities to 816  students. Egypt also contributes to the development of Kuwaiti  curricula and meets Kuwait's needs for educational materials and  requirements.    In a related development, the Kuwaiti Government and people  contributed to the construction of dozens of schools to make up  for the schools damaged by the October 1992 earthquake. Kuwait  played a prominent role in alleviating the effects and in  dealing with the consequences of that catastrophe. As of the  moment news of the catastrophe were broadcast, Kuwait rushed to  express its solidarity with Egypt. Kuwaiti Foreign Minister  Shaykh Salim al-Sabah was the first Arab official to arrive in  Cairo to convey condolences on the loss of the earthquake  victims. Kuwait did not content itself with this moral gesture  but proceeded to offer $20 million as a first installment to  assist earthquake victims; established an air corridor to  deliver medical and food supplies to Egypt; and launched active  popular efforts to collect donations, which amounted to dozens  of millions [of dollars].  <H5>  Egyptian Labor in Kuwait </H5>   As Kuwait contributed with its great generosity to the  reconstruction activities that followed the earthquake, Egypt  continued to participate in the building and reconstruction  operations that followed the liberation of Kuwait. Egyptian  construction companies continued to perform their commendable  role in restoring utilities and installations and contributed to  the development projects going on in all parts of Kuwait. In  addition to this direct participation, Egyptian labor and  brains, working side-by-side with Kuwait's citizens, have  contributed greatly to Kuwait's revival. After its liberation,  Kuwait opened its doors to Egyptian labor and gave Egyptian  workers all facilities and privileges that enable them to offer  even more. Consequently, large numbers of Egyptians poured into  Kuwait. By the beginning of 1993, their numbers amounted to  140,000 Egyptians, representing 26 percent of the foreign labor,  followed by Indian, Bengali, and Pakistani workers. A total of  63 percent of the Egyptian workers in Kuwait are employed in the  manufacturing sector and 17 percent in the trade and insurance  sector. Out of the two countries' eagerness to safeguard  Egyptian workers' rights, 1993 saw the conclusion of an  agreement by the two countries' manpower ministers that  stipulates that the salary of an Egyptian worker in Kuwait will  be no less than 70 dinars [D] monthly, plus food and housing.  Moreover, the two countries' labor unions have been working  actively to bolster their cooperation in the various areas.  <H5>  Open Lines </H5>   In view of the importance of transportation and  communication  means in strengthening concerted cooperation between the two  countries in the area of labor and other areas, officials have  devoted attention to bolstering these means by increasing the  number of telephone lines and eliminating obstacles in the area  of air transport. Moreover, the Kuwaiti National Assembly  approved the Egyptian-Kuwaiti agreement on land transportation  of goods and passengers, which calls for abolishing any fees or  other taxes levied on the two countries' citizens in these areas.    The positive steps taken by the two sides in this regard  reflected positively on their economic relations. Trade activity  and capital movement increased and Kuwaiti participation in  varied production projects grew. An indication of this fact is  that total loans and grants advanced by Kuwait to Egypt grew to  $52 million to finance 16 projects. Egyptian officials assert  that these sums have contributed effectively to Egypt's  development programs because of their soft terms and high  performance. In the context of bolstering the two countries'  economic cooperation, the Kuwaiti Development Fund allocated  $500 million as a contribution to Egypt's economic reform  process until 1995.    A prominent project to which Kuwait contributed in 1993 is a  project to reclaim 400,000 feddans of land in the Sinai at a  total cost of 4 billion Egyptian pounds, to which Kuwait has  contributed the equivalent of D71.3 million. This is in addition  to dozens of other projects to which Kuwait has contributed more  than D300 million.    On its part, Egypt is keen on elevating the level of  economic  exchange with Kuwait, and it seeks to increase its export rates.  Consequently, it has established a trade center in the middle of  the Kuwaiti capital to display Egyptian products. Sixty  companies and factories have participated in this center. This  is in addition to a center to provide information on Egyptian  goods and companies. In this respect, Kuwait participated in  1993 in the Cairo International Fair through 300 companies and  establishments that displayed a variety of distinctive Kuwaiti  products, embodied in textiles, consumer goods, perfumes,  aluminum products, and fish. This demonstration was an  opportunity for businessmen from both countries to meet and to  agree on joint production and service projects. The Kuwaiti side  also expressed its willingness to import more Egyptian goods and  products. The value of such imports amounted to more than 300  million pounds in 1993. By June 1993, total Kuwaiti investments  in Egypt amounted to 788 million pounds, which is the equivalent  of 16 percent of the total Arab investments in the country.    The two countries believe that the presence of a feeling of  security and safety at the domestic and external levels is one  of the most important elements that contribute to enhancing  economic and other forms of cooperation between the two  countries. Consequently, Egypt has received numerous Kuwaiti  Army officers to be enrolled in training courses at specialized  military units and institutes. Egypt also sends its experts to  train Kuwaiti soldiers in operation the the locally-manufactured  air defense system.    Regarding domestic security, cooperation between the two  countries witnessed noticeable growth in 1993. Kuwaiti Interior  Minister Shaykh Ahmad al-Hamud al-Jabir visited Cairo and held  with Egyptian officials contacts that culminated in the  conclusion of agreements in the areas of training and  information exchange. Egypt dispatched 43 officers, ranking from  major to brigadier general, to join the Kuwaiti State Security  Agency and to contribute with their expertise in training their  Kuwaiti colleagues on investigating war crimes, interrogating  prisoners and collaborators with foreign circles, and fighting  espionage.  <H5>  Exchange of Convicts </H5>   Security cooperation was coupled with cooperation in the  legal area by virtue of the strong link between the two areas.  This cooperation included the Kuwaiti National Assembly's  approval of the extradition treaty between the two countries and  the loaning of 41 Egyptian counselors to Kuwait to work in its  various legal departments.    A delegation also visited Egypt in 1993 from the management  of Kuwait's Citizen's Administration and Complaints Office. The  delegation met with officials of the Administrative Control  Authority, and familiarized itself with its working systems.    In addition to these areas of close cooperation between the  two countries in 1993, forms of cooperation in other areas, such  as health, also expanded. Visits between the two countries'  physicians increased and Kuwaiti import rates of Egyptian drugs  rose. In the area of electricity and energy, Kuwait participated  in the construction of a number of Egyptian power plants,  including Sidi Kurayr plant at a cost of $300 million. Kuwaiti  electricity networks also contributed $3 million, in addition to  building a heavy oil distillation unit at a cost of $5 million.    In the oil resources area, 1993 experienced constant growth  in oil- prospecting operations carried out by Kuwaiti firms in  Egypt, and these operations scored great success. Coordination  continued between the two countries' officials on oil policy.  Cooperation between trade unions in the petrochemicals area was  also active. The Kuwaiti Government renewed the contracts of the  Egyptian firms that participated in restoring and rehabilitating  Kuwaiti oil wells that had been destroyed during the Iraqi  aggression.  <H5>  Venerable al-Azhar Delegations </H5>   Out of awareness of the strong spiritual tie that binds the  two countries' peoples, their two governments devoted great  attention to this area. Delegations from the venerable al-Azhar  visited Kuwait constantly and Cairo received increasing numbers  of Kuwaiti students in its religious institutes.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Suleyman Demirel by Ibrahim </F> Nebiogly; place and date not given -- live or recorded in  Turkish]    [Text] [Nebiogly] Esteemed President, in your meeting with  correspondents yesterday you announced that Azerbaijani  President Geydar Aliyev will pay an official visit to Turkey in  February.    [Demirel] Yes, on 3 February.    [Nebiogly] Could you comment on the importance of our  esteemed president's official visit to Turkey?    [Demirel] Azerbaijan is our soul mate. There is no one in  Turkey who does not get excited when he hears the name of  Azerbaijan. The occupation of Azerbaijani land by the Armenians  deeply saddened us here. We have supported Azerbaijan in every  manner, as the international situation permits. But if we try  to do anything else we would be harming Azerbaijan's interests.  We have defended Azerbaijan on every international platform and  will continue to defend it every day.    Esteemed Geydar Aliyev is the elected president of  Azerbaijan. He will visit Turkey and be hosted as the president  of an independent state. We will discuss bilateral ties and  other regional problems with him. We will seek ways to overcome  hitches if they exist. We will discuss how to protect  Azerbaijan's rights on international platforms, at the United  Nations, and in the CSCE. It will be a very beneficial visit.  Esteemed Aliyev is my invited guest.    [Nebiogly] Esteemed President, as you know, the Turkic  summit, which was to take place in Baku from 21 to 22 January,  was postponed. But the Turkish press has been publishing rumors  for the past two days. I want to stress, as you yourself know,  that this meeting was simply postponed. What is your view on  this subject?    [Demirel] We stated very openly that the decision to hold  such a meeting at a more suitable time does not mean such a  meeting is renounced. I will meet the presidents of the other  republics in Davos. I will also meet Geydar Aliyev. We will  find a date that suits everyone. I think we are engaged in  politics, not in a fight. The important thing is to obtain  results. It will benefit all the concerned countries if this  meeting is held at a time when it can produce the best results.  That is what we are going to do.    [Nebiogly] Thank you. Esteemed President, what about reports  that the Azerbaijani Army has now been transformed into a  regular army and has been achieving success lately? What is  your view on this subject?    [Demirel] Naturally, this makes Turkey happy. Azerbaijan has  been subjected to injustice and its land was occupied through  the use of force. Land outside and inside Nagorno-Karabakh was  occupied. What right do the Armenians have to be in Kelbadzhar,  Agdam, or Fizuli? What right do they have to be in Lachin or  Shusha?    Turkey is pleased that Azerbaijan has ousted these occupiers  from the land by using its own army.</p>

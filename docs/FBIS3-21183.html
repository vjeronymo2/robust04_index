			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] In April 1993 the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC)  announced ``Antimonopoly Guidelines on Joint R&amp;D.'' When  corporations can correctly understand the import of these  guidelines for an area that was previously ambiguous, they can  be at ease as they carry out joint work. However, they may get  into unforeseen trouble if they don't pay careful attention to  issues such as the total market share of the participating  members or to deciding how the research results are used.    In July 1993 ten VTR manufacturers including Sony,  Matsushita  Electric, and Philips of the Netherlands announced their  proposal for an international unified standard for consumer  digital VTRs. It is not determined that the ten manufacturers  will aggressively develop products using this standard. However,  it appears that, insofar as leading manufacturers have lined up  behind this standard, if a manufacturer developed other  specifications it would be at a disadvantage. Creation of this  kind of de facto industry standard is a kind of joint  development, but would it fall under antimonopoly law?  <H5>  Judging on ``Rationality'' </H5>   The JFTC says ``in principle, OK'' under the current  guidelines when it deems that technological innovations  encourage competition. The background to this includes the  merging of computer and consumer electronics technology,  increasing joint R&amp;D, and and European and American  antimonopoly  policy.    Auto parts development conducted by American auto companies  in the 1960s and 1970s in response to auto emissions regulations  was a victim of antimonopoly policy. However, when the Joint  R&amp;D  Law was enforced in 1984 with the aim of improving corporate  competitiveness, not all joint R&amp;D was under suspicion.  Instead  it was judged by the ``principal of logic.'' In 1984 in the EC  also antimonopoly law application was softened with regard to  R&amp;D. The world is shifting from strict application of  antimonopoly law to emphasizing competitiveness.    Corporations must keep in mind that this is limited to that  which is actually linked to competitiveness in the market.  Selection of participants and research themes, rights granted in  development contracts, the technology that is developed, and the  products that use that technology are points to consider.  However, the most important point is the line-up of members.  <H5>  Access is Condition </H5>   If the combined share in the direct market of the members of  a joint research project is 20% or less, then there is no  problem even if the members are rivals. Even when share exceeds  20%, a decision will be reached by looking at the overall  character of the research and of the need for the research. A  project supported by the government won't necessarily be  overlooked, while there's little likelihood of problems with a  topic such as environmental policy which is clearly too  difficult for one company by itself.    In the case of de facto industry standards, ``there's no  problem if assuring compatibility will benefit consumers,''  according to Kenji Kawakoshi, attorney. However, the conditions  are that the use of other standards cannot be restricted, others  who aren't original members can participate in making the  standards if they desire, and there must be access to the  completed standards.    In the case of digital VTRs, a conference was set up to  consider specifications for HDTV. Any company could apply to the  secretariat, pay a membership fee, and then participate in  drafting the standards. If the company became a member of the  working group it could cast a vote on deciding the final  specifications. The final specifications are public information.  The secretariat says, ``we explained the conference to the  JFTC,'' so concern was shown for the transparency of procedures.    When the total market share of the members is high, then  naturally the way in which the development contract determines  price and sales territory for products based on joint  development is an issue. ``To avoid suspicion, it is better not  to decide by contract which items members will discuss nor to  exchange information on market competitiveness,'' advises  attorney Yoshikazu Takaishi.    However, development results are to be protected by  intellectual property rights for patents or know-how. Legal  experts say this point has been clarified by the guidelines. For  example, with an eye to avoiding disputes over rights, it has  been decided that there will be no problem if limitations are  placed on members doing joint development with other companies  on the same theme for a logically fixed period of time after  completion of the original joint development project.    Conditional Access Technology (Coatech) Research Institute,  which developed a method for encrypting pay broadcasts, did not  disclose technical information about the three key integrated  circuits until March 1993. Coatech was established jointly as a  specially licensed basic technology research promotion center by  NHK, Japan Satellite Broadcasting, Toshiba, Matsushita Electric,  and NEC. Manufacturers who were not members had to buy an IC  unit in order to manufacture signal decoders.  <H5>  Emphasis on Individual Judgment </H5>   To the extent that encryption is a technology that allows  only subscribers to see broadcasts, there is a reason to  maintain secrecy. However, non-participant manufacturers want to  manufacture from the IC stage to lower costs. In fact, only the  three participating manufacturers have produced decoders since  1991, even after JSB began pay broadcasts. Coatech arranged to  maintain secrecy by disclosing information on only two of the  integrated circuits. Two audio-visual manufacturers had already  received permission.    The JFTC has now set up an advance consultation system for  joint development. ``If we say it is legal, no legal action will  be taken as long as that is not withdrawn,'' says Hidekatsu  Hirabayashi, regulation section chief in the JFTC's economics  division. However, Shozo Obune, advisor to the Sanwa Research  Institute which proposed clarification of policy on joint  R&amp;D to  the JFTC's study group, emphasized that ``corporations should  exercise their own judgment since the effort has been put into  publishing the guidelines.''    To avoid problems, it is a good idea to report to the JFTC  ahead of time and to report outside on the nature of joint work.  However, joint R&amp;D is an area of great strategic importance.  There will probably always be cases of joint R&amp;D that will  not  surface. There is no need to fear antimonopoly law excessively  if a company takes advantage of the guidelines' clarification to  set up a structure so that corporation's own research and legal  departments regularly engage in frank exchange of information.  <H3>  Items and Excerpts from ``Antimonopoly Guidelines on Joint  R&amp;D'' </H3>   Implementation of Joint R&amp;D    1) Items which are recognized in principle as not coming  under unfair methods of trade (terms for innocence): imposing  requirement that necessary technical and other information be  disclosed to participants, imposing requirement that secrecy be  maintained regarding technical and other information disclosed  by other participants, limiting appropriation of technology etc.  disclosed by other participants for purposes other than the  joint R&amp;D project, limiting individual R&amp;D and R&amp;D  with third  parties on the joint research theme during the term of the joint  R&amp;D.    2) Items which may be considered as coming under unfair  methods of trade (terms for gray areas): exceeding the scope  necessary for preventing appropriation of technology etc. and  limiting the use -- for purposes outside the joint R&amp;D theme  --  of technology etc. disclosed by other participants, exceeding  the scope necessary for implementing joint R&amp;D and limiting  the  introduction of the same kind of technology from other sources.    3) Items which are extremely likely to be considered as  coming under unfair methods of trade (terms for guilt): limiting  R&amp;D on themes other than the joint R&amp;D research theme,  limiting  production or sales by participants of competing products other  than those based on joint R&amp;D results.    Products Using Technology Resulting From Joint R&amp;D    1) Terms for innocence Requiring a minimum level of quality  or maintenance of standards necessary to assure the  effectiveness of the resultant technology when a supply of  products based on the research is procured from other  participants in the R&amp;D    2) Terms for gray areas Limiting the production or sales  region of products based on the research, limiting the  production or sales quantity of products based on the R&amp;D.    3) Terms for Guilt    Limiting the price at which the products based on the  R&amp;D can  be sold to third parties.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Smog clears The smoky haze that has affected Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia had largely dissipated yesterday, thanks to rains and favourable winds. Thick smoke from forest fires raging in Sumatra and Kalimantan had shrouded large parts of south-east Asia. Singapore's authorities continue to advise people affected by haze to stay indoors. Many people have had breathing problems.</p>

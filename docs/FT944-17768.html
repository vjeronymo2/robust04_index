			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Avesta Sheffield expands in US Avesta Sheffield is planning to expand its presence in the US market through the purchase of the assets of Eastern Stainless from Armco, one of the leading US steel groups. The Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer said the deal came at a time of rising US demand and increasing prices. And it comes just three weeks after British Steel increased its stake in Avesta Sheffield to 49.9 per cent from 40 per cent. Buying Eastern will increase Avesta's US stainless plate sales to SKr900m (Dollars 120.3m) from SKr500m a year, while lifting its plate capacity there to 60,000 tonnes a year from 35,000 tonnes. The company operates a stainless plate plant in New Castle, Indiana, and has a welded tube factory in Wildwood, Florida. Eastern turns over Dollars 65m a year but has made heavy losses for several years. Avesta plans to restructure the operation to return it to profit by 1996. It pointed to potential synergies with its New Castle unit. The acquisition includes a plate plant, a mothballed melting shop, and an annealing and pickling line. Avesta said it had no immediate plans to reactivate the melting shop. The parties hope to finalise the deal by the end of the year. North America is Avesta's third biggest market, after the UK and the Nordic region, and accounts for 25 per cent of group sales. Mr Adri De Ridder, strategic planning officer, said it would be easier to increase volumes in the US than in the intensely competitive European market. 'US per-capita consumption of stainless is significantly lower than in Europe,' he said.</p>

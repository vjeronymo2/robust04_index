			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / 'Shattered' Seat chairman quits as VW seeks harsh cuts VOLKSWAGEN'S demands for harsh cuts at its Spanish subsidiary led to the resignation yesterday of Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, Seat chairman and a member of the German automotive group's board. The demands could also lead to political and industrial turmoil in Spain, a senior government official warned. Mr Diaz Alvarez will leave today, just two days after the VW group board publicly rejected as inadequate his scheme to cut 5,000 jobs at Seat. He returned to the company's Barcelona offices yesterday 'completely shattered', an aide said. 'I have become an obstacle to the future of Seat and that is the last thing I want to be,' he told his closest colleagues. It is believed that VW wants to close the Zona Franca factory in Barcelona, and cut up to 9,000 jobs. Such losses at Spain's biggest manufacturing employer, would be a catastrophe for Barcelona, the government official said. Unemployment in the area is already around 20 per cent. The official said there was no possibility of financial aid from Madrid and added that the government viewed as 'suspicious' Seat's sudden plunge into deep loss. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, who has also ruled out any further funds after this month's DM1.5bn (Pounds 615m) emergency cash injection, was allegedly caught unawares when he was told last month of a looming loss of DM1.25bn this year. Seat has been hit by falling car sales and has also been severely affected by the need to finance investment credits taken out in D-Marks and US dollars in heavily-devalued pesetas. Mr Diaz Alvarez was one of a handful of the old-guard directors still in power at VW. Most of the old group board, including the Mr Daniel Goeudevert, Mr Piech's deputy, has gone since the new chairman arrived in January. Mr Piech told the FT recently that he had been advised to clear out all the old management, but had not done so. As a result, there were still 'dead bodies in the cellar'. Speculation is mounting about other imminent board changes. The name most often mentioned is that of Mr Werner Schmidt, another long-serving director, currently finance chief.</p>

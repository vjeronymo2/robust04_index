			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Siegfried Hofmann under the rubric "Companies </F> and Markets": "BASF AG/R&amp;D Work Remains Steady at Around Two  Billion German Marks [DM] in Spite of Recession - Innovation  Processes to Become Faster and More Efficient. `Research Has to  Be Strong Where Business Is Still Weak'"]    [Text] Ludwigshafen, Saturday-Sunday, 4-5 Dec 93  (HANDELSBLATT)-- The BASF group will invest around DM2 billion  in research and development again in 1993 too and thereby is  emphasizing its intention of not neglecting innovation efforts  even in a phase of dwindling earnings and tight resources. All  the same, the changed economic and competition situation also  has not left the chemical group's R&amp;D divisions unaffected.    For instance, a number of organizational changes lie hidden  beneath the since 1990 largely steady application of funds,  BASF's head of research planning, Professor Horst Konig,  states in a conversation with HANDELSBLATT: In the years since,  BASF has turned heavily to the methods of project management  with the aim of making innovation processes faster and more  efficient. They include first of all clear agreements on goals,  individual development steps and schedules. Planning itself  takes place within the framework of a strategic performance  target of the managing board based on individual suggestions  from the fields of concentration ("bottom up"). At the same time  the company has also for a short time been encouraging  innovative behavior via an innovation prize for BASF personnel,  which was awarded to two research teams for the first time a few  weeks ago.    Konig sees the main concern of project management to be  the speeding up of research projects. "Because in the chemicals  industry time is more often than not more important than money."  For him the importance of the time factor can be seen, for  example, in the fact that today almost 10 years are required for  the development of a new plastic, 12 years for plant protectives  and on average 15 years for pharmaceuticals. As a result, a  half-year's delay could already lower a project's overall  profitability by up to 40 percent.    Konig blames a portion of these long development times on  the especially time-consuming (and thereby  innovation-inhibiting) approval terms and conditions in Germany.  Just the thorough testing of a new substance in accordance with  the law today requires around 1.5 years. However, because  substances of this kind are often used as additions or  intermediate products in a multistage process, this expenditure  of time can easily build up. Hence, the aim of project  management--which one could wish for the government approval  process too--is precisely to lessen these delays also.  <H5>  Concentration on "Core Knowledge" </H5>   More precise planning, project management and a more  critical  analysis of prospects for success have, says Konig,  contributed to the fact that the number of individual research  projects in the BASF group has been reduced since the end of the  eighties from 800 to around 600 now. An additional reason for  this was the more recent changes in the product portfolio. For  instance, the retreat from the especially research-intensive  field of concentration of structural materials.    However, Konig by no means wants to have anything to do  with applying to research the motto of "concentration on core  fields." Rather the goal here has to be concentration on "core  knowledge," he says. He points out that dealing with new fields  of concentration in the final analysis constitutes a  prerequisite for the further development of a company.    BASF too would never have entered many of its major fields  of  concentration and would not have been able to find its present  structure if it had concentrated its development activities  instead on already strong fields of concentration. So, in  principle research has to be strong precisely where one is not  so strongly developed in business, Konig stresses. "All the  branches cannot be cut off the tree, otherwise it will not grow."    How strongly the emphases and orientation change he  illustrates by the example of BASF's four large central research  facilities: For instance, the main laboratory today is regarded  as a "life science" center (with a distinct emphasis on the  field of research of pharmaceuticals and plant protectives and  biotechnology). In the plastics laboratory there is an ever  stronger move toward research on materials, while the color  laboratory has been generally dealing with the optical  properties of materials and has developed an emphasis in the  field of "effector materials." In the ammonia laboratory (which  traces its origin to fertilizer research) they are turning ever  more strongly toward research on catalysts, which play a central  role in almost all chemical production.    Konig rates the present basic structure of BASF's  research as "solid and well adapted for the future," whereby, no  doubt above all, efforts in the field of "life sciences" will be  still intensified in the future. When the company is presently  attending to developing a "vision" for all its research, so as  by no means to create a sheer slogan, but to create a genuine  leitmotif that presupposes a basic direction, without unduly  restricting the researchers' creativity.    Konig expects that an important change in overall  chemical research will above all be the fact that in the future  one will in general have to turn far more strongly to system  development. Thus, there will be increasing research in an  integrated system, whereby chemistry will also act ever more  strongly as a development partner for other industries.  <H5>  Research in an Integrated System Gaining in Importance </H5>   While in Konig's viewpoint one can blame German chemical  research for all told only a few failures (rather, he ascribes  the industry's current problems to too rapid market changes), he  recognizes a still substantial need to catch up in the area of  transindustry cooperation in research. He refers to the fact  that this kind of integrated research is already far more  strongly established in Japan, for example, where a short time  ago a 16-partner-strong consortium integrated its work under the  guiding theme "clean car."</p>

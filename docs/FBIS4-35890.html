			<p>BFN     [Text] [Jordanian] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad met  with his Iraqi counterpart Watban Ibrahim in Baghdad yesterday.    The IRAQI NEWS AGENCY quoted Ibrahim as hailing Jordan's  position on Iraq during and after the Gulf war.    AKHIR KHABAR has learned that Hammad's visit to Baghdad  follows several diplomatic and political contacts relating to  Jordanian citizens in Iraq. It also learned that Hammad is  carrying a special security file on activating security  agreements signed previously in Amman and Baghdad. The file  also deals with the recent increase in cases against Jordanian  citizens.    AKHIR KHABAR also learned that the interior minister's talks  in Baghdad deal with increasing bilateral coordination, and  reaching an agreement on a mechanism to control illegal trade  across the Jordanian-Iraqi border, especially following an  increase in smuggling operations.    Hammad's visit also aims at fostering bilateral security  coordination.    Observers noted that Hammad is the first official to visit  Iraq after the latest government changes, according to which  President Saddam Husayn assumed the post of prime minister in  order to launch the battle to lift the siege imposed on Iraq.</p>

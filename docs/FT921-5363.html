			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Probation officers vote for action MEMBERS of the National Association of Probation Officers have voted four-to-one in favour of industrial action over staffing levels in probation and bail hostels in England and Wales. The association says members are at risk of attack, particularly at night, when most hostels are staffed by only one person. It will boycott posts at, and referrals to, allegedly unsafe hostels from March 26.</p>

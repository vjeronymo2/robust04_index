			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Users' council hits out at electricity meter charges The electricity supply industry is facing strong criticism from industrial consumers amid fears that it will implement significant rises in charges associated with meter reading. The Major Energy Users' Council said yesterday that there were proposals to lift the metering charge levied on customers in the competitive market - those using more than 100kw of electricity - from Pounds 200 this year to between Pounds 360 and Pounds 630 in 1995-96. The Electricity Pool, which helps to administer the metering payments system, described the council's figures as speculative. No decisions had yet been made on the charge. Nonetheless, some electricity companies were pushing for large rises, arguing that Pounds 200 did not cover costs. The large energy users' anger results mainly from severe shortcomings in the metering system - including data collection and computerised bill settlements - since about 45,000 mainly industrial and commercial sites joined the competitive market in April this year. The users' council said: 'The electricity companies who have been quick to enjoy the benefits of the privatised environment must now accept the consequences of failure and cover the costs of the mistakes themselves.' The pool said the costs of metering for the competitive market were still being examined following the first year of competition for users of more than 100kw. Decisions still had to be made about the correct allocation of costs.</p>

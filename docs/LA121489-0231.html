			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL/ADVERTISING;  </P> <P> REGIONAL ADVERTISING, MARKETING WORK SHIFTED TO IN-HOUSE BY CARL KARCHER  </P> <P> Carl Karcher Enterprises has moved its regional advertising and marketing  business in-house, a company spokeswoman said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Patricia Parks, a spokeswoman for the Anaheim-based burger chain, said the  decision resulted from an expansion of Karcher Enterprises that included a  marketing department. Those marketing managers found themselves duplicating the  efforts of the outside advertising agency, she said.  </P> <P> The ad firm that has handled the Carl's account for 4 1/2 years -- New  York-based Della Femina, McNamee WCRS -- will continue do the company's  strategic planning, its marketing research and develop all of its TV and radio  advertising and in-store materials, said Joseph Olin, a vice president with  Della Femina in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As a result of Carl's decision to handle regional marketing, Della Femina has  laid off half of its 14 employees who worked on the $20-million account. "But  we're still handling the company's business on a systemwide, brand and regional  basis," Olin said.  </P> <P> For the first three quarters of fiscal 1990, ended Nov. 6, Karcher Enterprises'  net income has declined 13% to $14.5 million from $16.6 million for the  comparable period last year. The company has blamed the lower net income on a  decline in investment income and an increase in interest expense.  </P> <P> Bringing the regional advertising business in-house, Parks said, "was a  management decision to manage the costs of the agency more effectively."  </P> <P> Neither Karcher Enterprises nor Della Femina would comment on how much the  hamburger chain will save by taking over the regional advertising and marketing  work.

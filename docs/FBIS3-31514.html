Finance  Minister Julius Toth's decision became effective straight after  the Wednesday [16 February] meeting of the Customs Union Council  (RCU).    Today the decision was discussed with Slovak customs  authorities, the spokesman said.    The documents specified in the agreement between the Czech  and Slovak offices for normalization, metrology, and inspection  will be required at the border after March 31. Toth's decision  states that the two sides must agree on mutual recognition of  testing procedures and certificates.    Yesterday Slovakia withdrew from the sudden and unilateral  requirement it made on February 11 according to which no food  products could be imported into the country without a quality  certificate issued by Slovak organs. Officials said the measure  was inspired by concern to limit the import of poor quality food  products.</p>

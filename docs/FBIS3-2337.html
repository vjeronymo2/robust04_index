From their own experience  many units have found it necessary to take the path of  comprehensive management.    So-called comprehensive management means that under the  unified leadership of party committees at all levels, the staff,  political, logistics, and technical departments of military  units cooperate closely; military, political, logistics, and  technical officers make joint efforts to conduct management;  work in the fields of education, training, management, and  logistics guarantees is combined closely; and ideological,  administrative, legal, and material means are used  comprehensively to exercise across-the-board management over all  troops at all times. Troop management and education should also  be conducted jointly by military units, local governments, and  families of soldiers by various available means in order to  establish a systematic management network. Thus, advantages of  all quarters may complement each other and achieve comprehensive  management results.    Comprehensive management embodies the principle of  materialist dialectics and reflects the internal regularity of  troop management under the new historical conditions. For a  long time in the past, many comrades just regarded troop  management as a matter concerning the management of internal  affairs of troops, such as keeping barracks clean, performing  formation drills, and maintaining required standards for  appearance and bearing, and regarded this as the tasks of a  certain department. This caused some artificial limitations in  management work. We admit that an important aspect of troop  management is related to organization of the troops' daily lives  and duties, the coordination of internal relations, and the  maintenance of the internal order. It is the foundation for  troop management in all aspects, but it is not the whole of  management work. In fact, many problems in troop management are  not just administrative problems; instead, they were caused by  comprehensive factors and could not be properly solved if only  one department was responsible for handling them. Practice  shows that management work is related to a wide-range of  affairs, comprehensive factors, and day-to-day work in various  aspects. Comprehensive management is suited to these  characteristics of management work and may ensure that troop  management is conducted regularly and scientifically.    The key to proper conduct of comprehensive management lies  in  unifying thinking and strengthening leadership. In the final  analysis, comprehensive management needs the mobilization and  participation of forces in all aspects. All officers and men,  no matter what rank they hold, should take troop management as  their own task. Military units should warmly consult local  governments and families of soldiers and solicit their help  within the scope of their ability. In this regard, if people's  thinking is unified, then a solid ideological foundation will  exist for comprehensive management. Being a systems project,  comprehensive management requires strong leadership to exercise  organization and coordination. Party committees at all levels  must take this work as a major matter concerning the  consolidation of troops in all aspects, and should include it in  their work schedules, regularly studying it, settling problems  in good time, and coordinating the work of all departments. As  long as party committees effectively and properly coordinate  everything, a new situation will certainly appear in troop  management.    Chairman Jiang pointed out when talking with cadets of the  National Defense University that it is necessary to strictly  enforce troop discipline, strengthen troop management, and  effectively manage the troops well. Leaders and departments at  all levels and cadres of all sorts should work for the aim of  enhancing combat effectiveness, concentrate on troop  construction and troop management, take the initiative in  studying management skills, make efforts to improve management,  and take the path of comprehensive management in order to raise  the work of troop management to a new stage as quickly as  possible.</p>

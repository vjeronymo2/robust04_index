			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / 'Two-tier housing market' develops: Property market 'fragile' A 'TWO-TIER' housing market is developing in some areas of the UK, with realistically priced properties selling quickly but a much larger number of homes remaining unsold because buyers think they are overpriced. This is one of the conclusions of the latest monthly survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, published today, which confirms reports that the recovery is under way in the housing market, but is fragile and erratic. Mr Peter Miller, the institution's residential property spokesman, said the level of activity was healthier than at this time last year, when the market was hit by the immediate aftermath of the UK's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. 'But things are far from robust. There are plenty of potential buyers, but too few vendors are able or willing to sell at the market price,' he added. With would-be sellers holding back in the hope of getting a higher price later, a two-tier market was developing. 'Fresh and realistically priced' homes were being sold within weeks, while a much larger number of properties remained unsold. 'Their particulars gather dust in estate agent windows because, in the eyes of the buyer, they are overpriced,' the institution said. In Leicester, Mr David Johnson of Spencers said an adequate supply of well-priced, quality property coming on to the market remains 'a difficulty', and there is still a significant gap between vendors' expectations and purchasers' preparedness to meet them. In Saffron Waldon, Essex, Mr Geoff White of Geoff White &amp; Partners said there is still 'a good nucleus of serious buyers, but vendors appear to be still waiting - what for?' Mr Miller added the institution's weight to the construction industry's pleas for the chancellor 'to keep his hands off housing' in next month's Budget. Reacting to speculation about plans to abolish interest tax relief on new mortgages, he said a disincentive to move house would lead the market back to stagnation. The survey is based on reports from 88 estate agents. Housing Market Survey. RICS, 12 Great George Street, Parliament Square, London SW1P 3AD. Pounds 10.</p>

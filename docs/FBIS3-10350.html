			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 4 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican Commerce  Secretary Jaime Serra Puche referred to the free trade agreement  with Costa Rica, whose negotiation will conclude this week, as  "the most advanced in Latin America." Serra Puche argued that  the agreement not only includes goods but also services,  copyrights and investments, dispute settlement procedures, and  government purchases." [no beginning quotation mark as received]    Mexico and Costa Rica trade goods and services for some $80  million a year. Serra Puche believes that the treaty negotiated  with Costa Rica, which will come into force on 1 January 1995,  could become a very useful guideline for negotiations with other  Central American countries. He pointed out that talks with  Central America will continue, but they "will not be conducted  as a bloc." Therefore, there will be separate negotiations with  Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and later with Nicaragua.    Serra Puche announced that trade negotiations with the Group  of Three -- Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia -- might resume in  March.</p>

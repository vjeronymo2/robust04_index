			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- After meeting with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today, Italian Foreign  Minister Antonio Martino said that the talks were interesting  and fruitful.    Martino reiterated that his mission was to find a peaceful  solution to the Yugoslav crisis before the forthcoming G7  meeting G7 in Naples.    The Italian Foreign Minister said that he is still a  "stubborn" optimist regarding the future, adding that he agreed  with President Milosovic that peace is the most important thing  for the prosperity of the region, the surrounding states, and  the whole of Europe.    Martino stressed that the next two weeks will be crucial for  finding a solution to the crisis. Expressing his hope that,  with peace as the main goal, something constructive would happen  in the period between now and the G7 meeting in Naples on 8  July, Martino said that he does not have "a magic formula in his  pocket" but that the encouraging signs on the horizon should not  be discarded.    Asked about Serbia's future role, Martino said that Serbia,  President Milosevic and Yugoslavia have a very important role to  play in the efforts successfully to implement the peace process.    Certain obstacles to peace must be overcome as they belong  to  the past and are not a problem of the future, the minister said.  "If we have a constructive approach to the problem, things will  work out fine", he added.    Martino said he discussed the sanctions against the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia with Milosevic and that he said that all  sides could benefit from trade, which is a unifying factor in  international relations and of great importance for all  countries.    Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, who also took  part in the talks, agreed with Martino's description of the  talks as cordial and meaningful and that they showed that both  sides are interested in establishing peace promptly and in  removing all artificial obstacles to achieving this.    "We are particularly encouraged by the fact that the new  Italian government will intensify its activities in the peace  process, as well as by the abandonment of the double-standards  policy and the adoption of a principled stance to the Yugoslav  crisis, since this is the only stance that can bring peace,"  Jovanovic said.    The parts of the talks relating to world politics showed  adherence to the principles of peace and a significant degree of  readiness by both sides to contribute towards finding positive  solutions to all different aspects. We believe that we shall  continue to develop principled cooperation with Italy, as the  most important neighboring state, Jovanovic said.</p>

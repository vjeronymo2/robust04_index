			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOVING DAY IS BLUNDER HE WON'T FORGET  </P> <P> Jermund Skogstad took a break from moving into his new apartment, went out for  a bite to eat and forgot to take his new address with him.  </P> <P> That was a month ago.  </P> <P> "This is embarrassing . . . but I can't find the way back to my new home," the  50-year-old man told the Aftenposten newspaper. "I've searched and searched."  </P> <P> Skogstad went to the newspaper in hopes his landlady would read of his plight  and call him. The story and his picture ran Tuesday, but there had been no call  by today.  </P> <P> Skogstad moved to the capital from the countryside and lost his way while  walking to a cafe. His wallet, with the address, was in the apartment.  </P> <P> His search has been expensive: He paid rent for the 30 minutes he spent in his  apartment and also had to rent a hotel room.  </P></p>

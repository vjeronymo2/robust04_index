			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The words I heard at the meeting hall of the  Government Palace in Beirut on 16 September 1993 during the  final meeting of the first session of the Syrian-Lebanese  Follow-Up and Coordination Committee are still ringing in my  ears. It was said then, with full clarity, that the Economic  and Social Coordination and Cooperation Agreement between Syria  and Lebanon will make the citizens of both countries feel the  importance of what took place. They will sense, through the  cancellation of the import permit, which will enable Syrian  merchants to import Lebanese goods without a permit, that  something important has indeed been achieved this time on the  level of bilateral relations, and that all this will reflect  positively on the living conditions in both countries.    Since that date, many meetings have taken place at the  highest levels, as well as at other levels, and documents,  signatures, and ratifications have been exchanged. Recently, on  9 February 1994, the Lebanese paper AL-SHA'B reported that the  Lebanese Chamber of Deputies ratified 14 draft laws; foremost,  the agreements with Syria. The draft law under Decree No. 4373,  which permits the Government to conclude cooperation agreements  between Lebanon and Syria, was submitted to the Chamber for  discussion and ratified.  <H5>  Implementation </H5>   With this measure, everything has become ready for  implementation, especially once the signed, ratified, and  legally approved documents have been exchanged. This is a major  step forward, because the agreement provides for measures that  will lead to economic integration between Syria and Lebanon and  the establishment of a Syrian-Lebanese common market, including  joint industrial and tourist projects.    Under this agreement, eight committees were formed to carry  out production and services projects in all fields.  <H5>  What Has Been Achieved So Far </H5>   Many efforts have been exerted, several meetings have been  held, and numerous delegations have come to Syria while others  have gone to Lebanon, all pending the moment the implementation  will begin. The time is approaching, and in the course of all  these activities the two sides have defined the bases for  applying the Certificate of Origin, as follows:    - The Arab Certificate of Origin used for facilitating and  developing trade between the Arab countries will also be used to  certify the national identity of goods exchanged between the two  countries.    - In light of the discussions that took place between the  two  countries concerning the provisions of the Certificate of Origin  and the methods of certifying their veracity; and in accordance  with the decisions made by the Follow-Up and Coordination  Committee during its meeting on 15-16 September 1993 on these  subjects, the two sides decided to make the following  recommendations:  <H5>  1. Certificate of Origin: </H5>   A. Applying the Certificate of Origin (as per attached)  approved under the Agreement on Facilitating and Developing  Trade Between the Arab Countries, provided this certificate is  endorsed by the customs departments in both countries in  accordance with the current procedure between them.    B. Instructing the customs departments in both countries to  fix a date in order to put this certificate into effect after  these minutes have been ratified by the quarters concerned in  both countries and after an agreement has been reached in  principle concerning its format and dimensions. The two  departments shall conclude their work within a period of two  months from this date.    C. The customs departments in both countries shall, when  necessary, exchange information about checking the veracity of  the Lebanese or Syrian Certificates of Origin. They may take  the necessary measures in this regard through coordination --  including the exchange of visits -- with the competent  departments in both countries.  <H5>  2. Cancellation of Import Permit: </H5>   - Canceling the current import permit with regard to the  exchange of goods and commodities between the two countries and  replacing it in Syria by the Import Approval (as per attached  model) under the provisions of Paragraph B of Article 5 of the  Economic and Social Cooperation and Coordination Agreement  signed between the two countries on 16 September 1993.    - The Syrian side has explained that all products of  Lebanese  origin can be traded with Syria within the limits of the foreign  trade ordinances and the currencies used in Syria, whether or  not these products are included in the lists attached to the  1953 agreement. Exemptions from and reductions of customs  duties are incorporated in these lists.    - The Lebanese side explained that all commodities of Syrian  origin can be traded with Lebanon and also imported in  accordance with the existing laws in Lebanon, and that  exemptions from and reductions of customs duties are also  incorporated in the lists attached to the 1953 agreement.  <H5>  The Joint Economic Committee </H5>   On 10 January 94, a Lebanese economic delegation led by  Lebanese Economy Minister Hagop Demerdjian visited Damascus. A  meeting was held at the Economy Ministry in Damascus under the  chairmanship of the ministers of economy and foreign trade of  both countries. The meeting was attended by Nasri Khuri,  secretary general of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese Council, and  members of the Syrian and Lebanese delegations. As a result of  this meeting, it was decided:    1. To form the Joint Economic Committee provided for in  Clause (i) Paragraph (B) of Article (4) of the Economic and  Social Cooperation and Coordination Agreement under the  chairmanship of the two ministers of economy in both countries  and the representatives of the competent departments. The  committee shall undertake the following tasks:    2. To discuss the scientific means and formulas needed to  implement the Economic and Social Cooperation and Coordination  Agreement signed between the two countries on 16 Sepember 1993,  especially Paragraph (B) of Article (2) which deals with:    A. Coordinating the internal costs of national goods  exchanged between the two countries in order to achieve parity  in these costs, and therefore free the goods from any  restrictions..    B. Proceeding gradually toward the free exchange of national  goods and commodities between the two countries and freeing  these goods and commodities fropm any restrictions in accordance  with the lists of commodities and products whose internal costs  have been equated and endorsed by the Economic Committee  established under this agreement.    C. Coordinating all other fields of economic cooperation,  especially the transfer of capital between the two countries in  order to free trade between them and to enable them to establish  joint ventures.    D. Enabling nationals of both countries to carry out all  types of economic and professional activities to ensure equal  opportunities for them in accordance with existing laws and  regulations.    E. Encouraging the establishment of joint economic ventures,  taking into consideration the coordination and standardization  of privileges, securities, facilities, and exemptions, and  applying in this regard the provisions of existing laws,  including those concluded within the framework of the Arab  League and its affiliate organizations.    F. Coordinating economic and trade cooperation with the  other  states and regional and international organizations.    G. Revising the lists attached to the economic agreement  signed between the two countries in 1953 with the view to  expanding and developing these lists.    It was also decided that the two sides will submit their  ideas on how to achieve these tasks gradually, provided  attention is given to the following priorities:    A. Specifying the topics and questions dealing with trade  and  the proposed solutions for them.    B. Revising the commodity lists attached to the economic  agreement of 1953 with the view to developing and expanding them  in line with the economic developments in both countries.    C. Studying the minutes of the technical committee with the  view to defining the bases for applying the certificate of  origin. Each side will inform the other of its own ideas  through the general secretariat of the Higher Syrian-Lebanese  Council within a period of one month from this date prior to  discussing these ideas in the meeting which is scheduled to take  place in Beirut at a date to be fixed by the secretary general.</p>

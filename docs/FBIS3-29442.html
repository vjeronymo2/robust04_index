			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by U.S. Bureau Chief Yoichi Funabashi: "Changing </F> Stands of the United States"]    [Text] The new, "mature" era of the Japanese-U.S.  relationship began with the Clinton administration resuming  attacks on Japan, using the high yen and economic sanctions as  weapons. This is a strange situation in which even the  President is not hesitating to talk about a "trade war" between  Japan and the United States. Both countries declared, after the  framework talks broke up, that they would resume the framework  talks after a "cooling-off period." But the character of the  U.S. negotiating team, the team's attitude in the talks, the  pressure it is receiving, as well as its views on the politics  of Japan have changed greatly from the past. If Japan fails to  recognize this change adequately, another rupture in the talks  is possible. What has changed in this era of "mature"  frictions? We will examine it.  <H5>  Compromise Comes Only at Last Moment </H5>   One of the U.S. congressional staff members blamed the  rupture in the talks on the presumptuous force of the "lawyer  mafiosi" such as U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor  and Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky.  Another official said, "The only way they know how to do things  is to demand the highest possible price, and then to bargain at  the last moment." They overdid it this time, and they failed.    The USTR with his lawyer's seriousness persisted with the  "numerical targets" issue, warding off attempts to attach  loopholes to them. There is no denying that this made a  political decision difficult. In Japan, there are wishful  voices saying, "If only Kantor were not there" (to quote one of  negotiating team's members), but (according to a White House  staff member), his political standing now is "very strong, for  he is close to Mrs. Clinton."  <H5>  The NEC's Predominance </H5>   The power of the National Security Council (NSC), which used  to have the final say on Japanese-U.S. relations during the cold  war, is now falling fast with the appearance of its rival, the  National Economic Council (NEC), which is having a great impact.  Particularly with respect to economic relations with Japan, the  NEC's power is clearly predominant. In the "mature"  relationship, which may mean having economic matters handled  separately from political and security matters, this state of  the NSC being unable to fully interfere in the NEC's formulation  of policies on Japan is likely to become permanent.  <H5>  Gephardt </H5>   During the days of the Republican government, the issues of  trade with Japan were always a "political football" to be kicked  around between the government and the Democratic-led Congress.  There were signs that the Democratic Congress bashed Japan in  order to bash the Republican government.    Now both the government and Congress are headed by the  Democrats, but the "political football" is being kicked around  between President Clinton and the protectionist force of House  majority leader Gephardt, who is supported by major trade  unions. There is a strong residue of hard feelings after the  President enlisted the help of the Republican Party in pushing  for NAFTA in the face of labor's objections to this treaty. The  trade issues with Japan are thus also being used as a  "compensating" mechanism by which the President wants to restore  his relations with labor.  <H5>  Business </H5>   Japanese-U.S. trade frictions -- whether in the framework  talks or concerning sanctions -- are almost always the upshot of  persistent campaigns waged by one or two companies or the heads  of these companies.    Many times, lobbying efforts in Washington by top executives  of Cray Computers or the Motorola company have simply turned  into demands made by the U.S. Government of the Japanese  Government.    "Previously, leaders of major corporations got together and  agreed on what the government should demand of other countries,  but there is no longer such a group of leaders who share the  government's goals," said Mr. Donald Gartin of the Atlantic  Council, who used to be involved in business roundtable talks by  big business associations.    Besides, high-tech businesses have close relations with the  Defense Department (Pentagon). Since the end of the cold war,  the Pentagon has been active in promoting the development of the  high-tech industry. This is also creating a new perspective  within the Pentagon concerning Japan, with the former coming to  consider it a "rival" rather than an "ally."    Almost all the members of the U.S. negotiating team are  persons who have the experience of having earlier done business  in Japan or with Japan. What is common among these people is  the conviction that "the Japanese market is not open; Japan is  not like other countries." Mr. Robert Kief, a political  consultant, said: "The allegations that the U.S. Government has  no people who know Japan are totally groundless. It is full of  people who know Japan. But the problem is that they know Japan  wrongly." The argument of the so-called revisionists about  "Japan being unlike other countries" which emerged in the late  1980's is now losing its impact among intellectuals, but it  appears that such a way of thinking is only gaining force among  the people occupying the political and economic circles.    An official close to President Clinton said that the  president is one of these people. According to the official,  one of the reasons why the President decided to break up the  talks was out of concern that "the economic recession in Japan  is not as serious as is reported, and that Japan will pull  through this and will become even stronger." Is this an  expression of the belief that "Japan is different from other  ordinary countries?"</p>

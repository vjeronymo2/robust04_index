			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Observer: Chat-up line Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, was brimming with confidence at the launch of Mercury's One-2-One cellular phone service yesterday. He enthused about the merits of its free off-peak local calls and lamented that the system had not been available when his children were teenagers. When suggesting people could talk all night he did, however, gloss over the fact that the phone's battery only lasts 55 minutes. Fortunately, of course, replacements are available at extra cost.</p>

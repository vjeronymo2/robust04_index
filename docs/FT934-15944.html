			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Investment gains enable Orkla to move into profit ORKLA, the Norwegian industrial and investment group, rebounded to a NKr907m (Dollars 13m) pre-tax profit for the first eight months of 1993 from a NKr161m loss in the same 1992 period. The group said the result was helped by a better operating performance but the main difference was in the development of financial activities. Last year it sustained losses of NKr642m on share deals but this year had realised gains of NKr230m. Investment activities contributed NKr202m to the pre-tax result, compared with a NKr722m loss last year. Operating revenues rose to NKr11.28bn from NKr10.99bn, while operating profits increased by 12 per cent to NKr852m from NKr759m. Branded consumer goods lifted operating profits by 5 per cent to NKr659m, despite strong competition and little growth in the Norwegian groceries market.</p>

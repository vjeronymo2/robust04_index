			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 19 Apr -- "There cannot be any question of  terminating talks with one of the parties to a settlement of the  conflict in Bosnia," Mikhail Demurin, deputy head of a  directorate of the Russian Foreign Ministry's information and  press department, told a briefing today. "The talks must  continue. This is our general line and we will not retreat from  this line," he stressed.    The Russian side believes that "the only way to resolve  conflicts in former Yugoslavia and other parts of the world is  to hold political talks." This position, the diplomat said, is  the reason why Russia is calling for restraint, compromise, and  mutual understanding.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman blamed the so-called "party  of  war" for inflaming the situation around Gorazde by "recklessly  gambling on the achievement of military victory." According to  him, this gambling will first of all inflict damage on the  Serbian people themselves.    M. Demurin pointed to the inappropriateness of raising the  question of lifting sanctions in a situation "where the Serbian  troops are at Gorazde." In his opinion, the resolution of this  question is being postponed for some time, depending on which  way the situation develops." He said that during the recent  talks between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, the Russian side promised  Belgrade its "most active support" in resolving the questions of  lifting the sanctions stage-by-stage. He said: "During the same  meeting, other agreements were also reached, in particular,  unblocking the situation around Gorazde." The Serbian side gave  appropriate assurances, M. Demurin stressed. "However, the  words of those who gave these assurances are totally at odds  with their deeds," the Russian diplomat said.</p>

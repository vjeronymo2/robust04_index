			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT WEEKDAY REPORT;  </P> <P> SOUTH CAROLINA SATISFIES ITS TASTE FOR FOOTBALL, JOINS SECASSOCIATED PRESS  </P> <P> South Carolina accepted an invitation to join the Southeastern Conference  Tuesday and accomplished its goal of becoming a member of an all-sports league.  </P> <P> SEC presidents voted earlier Tuesday during a conference call to ask the school  to join the conference, which on Aug. 1 added Arkansas. Since then, the SEC had  been searching for a 12th member to give it an even number of schools.  </P> <P> South Carolina and Miami of Florida were the front-runners to become the 12th  team.  </P> <P> "Today is a great day for South Carolina," Arthur K. Smith, the school's  interim president, said at a news conference at Williams-Brice Stadium. "This  afternoon, on behalf of the 10-member universities, Commissioner Roy Kramer of  the Southeastern Conference extended an invitation of membership to the  University of South Carolina. On behalf of the University of South Carolina . .  . I enthusiastically accepted that invitation."  </P> <P> Many supporters sported stickers saying, "Proud To Be in The SEC." The  stadium's scoreboard posted "SEC" in big letters.  </P> <P> "We now join the finest all-sports collegiate conference in the country, one  with a proud history that began nearly 100 years ago when member teams began  competing with one another," Smith said.  </P> <P> South Carolina had been a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference from that  league's inception in 1953 until it withdrew June 30, 1971, becoming the only  school to leave the ACC. South Carolina then joined the Metro Conference April  14, 1983.  </P> <P> The Metro does not include football. South Carolina wanted to become a member  of a league that included football.  </P> <P> The SEC hopes to integrate all South Carolina sports except football into the  league by the 1991-92 season. Participation in football probably will be  postponed a year because of scheduling problems.  </P> <P> South Carolina was founded in 1801 and is the oldest state institution in the  United States to be continuously supported by public funds. The school has nine  campuses across the state, with 25,613 students attending the Columbia campus.  </P></p>

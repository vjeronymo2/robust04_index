			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / CBI urges small-business aid to encourage investment THE TREASURY should emphasise the needs of smaller businesses when drawing up its Budget strategy, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. The CBI wants tax allowances to encourage more small manufacturers to invest in buildings and machinery. It also wants tax relief for cash injections into unquoted companies, through a form of the business expansion scheme. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said tax increases in the Budget should be avoided, on the grounds that the recovery was still fragile. He urged Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to reduce public spending by Pounds 10bn by 1996-97 as a way of limiting public borrowing - expected to reach Pounds 50bn this financial year. Mr Davies will meet Mr Clarke next month to discuss the Budget proposals. The CBI is emphasising the need to give companies extra incentives to invest so that industry is in a better position to meet higher demand in the 1990s. It wants a continuation of the temporary rules under which 40 per cent of spending on investment qualifies for tax relief. Under existing Treasury proposals, from the end of next month the proportion which can be written off against tax is due to drop back to the normal 25 per cent. The CBI also wants all investment up to Pounds 200,000 to be eligible for relief.</p>

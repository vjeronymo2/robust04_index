			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VATICAN, POLES RE-ESTABLISH DIPLOMACY TIES  </P> <P> The Holy See and predominantly Roman Catholic Poland today re-established full  diplomatic relations, the first time the Vatican has forged such ties with a  Warsaw Pact nation.  </P> <P> The announcement by the Vatican and Poland's state-run news agency said  relations, cut by the Communists who took power in Poland in 1945, are at the  level of ambassador by Poland and apostolic nunciature by the Vatican.  </P> <P> Sources said the names of the ambassador and the papal nuncio will be announced  later.  </P> <P> The way was paved for establishment of full relations between Pope John Paul  II's native Poland and the Vatican in May after the Polish Parliament passed a  law giving the Roman Catholic Church legal status for the first time since  1944.  </P> <P> The Sejm (Parliament) also passed two other laws establishing freedom of  worship for all creeds and the church's right to build churches, teach religion  and establish and run Catholic schools.  </P> <P> Church-state relations were marked by bitter conflict after World War II and  were strained by the Pope's fervent support of the Solidarity free trade union.  </P></p>

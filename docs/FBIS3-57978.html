Juppe, presenting his New Year wishes to the press, said  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) leaders at their  summit meeting next Monday and Tuesday should "reflect on a new  initiative, either to guarantee implementation of the peace  plan, or force the parties to give up their warlike plans and  find an accord."    Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats are to meet in  two  weeks in Geneva to resume peace talks.    Juppe also stressed the need to maintain pressure on the  Bosnian parties and for the United Nations to find an "urgent  response" on the role and means of the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia.    On Monday, French General Jean Cot, commander in chief of  the  30,000-strong UNPROFOR in ex-Yugoslavia, complained of the  "humiliations" suffered by the UN troops and said the force was  ready for an "offensive intervention" in Bosnia.    "I understand the feeling of revolt and anger" of UNPROFOR  officials, Juppe said. "We cannot allow ourselves to be  discouraged."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 22 (AFP) -- Fighting between the  rival Yemeni armies and overnight shelling of this southern port  killed another dozen people and wounded around 40, most of them  civilians, hospital officials said Wednesday [22 June].    Shells slammed into the Dar al-Amir suburb, which lies north  of the city and just 10 kilometres (six miles) from the front,  killing nine people and wounding 29, officials said.    Three dead soldiers and seven wounded were taken to  hospitals  here from Abyan, where southern forces have been resisting a  northern offensive for the past two days.    Eight Katyusha rockets also hit the airport without causing  damage on Wednesday as southern jets were taking off for raids  on northern supply lines.    Two surface-to-surface missiles were fired at Aden on  Tuesday  evening, but one was intercepted by anti-aircraft fire while  another landed in the sea.    President 'Ali Abdallah Salih's northern troops, and  southern  forces loyal to his rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid, have been locked in  a civil war for almost two months.</p>

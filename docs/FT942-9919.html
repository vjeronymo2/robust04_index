			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Rail drug tests yield convictions Random drug and alcohol checks on British Rail and London Underground employees led to 60 cases where tests proved positive or where samples were not supplied in the first year of their introduction, a report said yesterday. The tests, introduced in December 1992, had led to 16 convictions up to February this year and 46 other prosecutions were in progress. The test record emerges in a study on alcohol and drug policies in the workplace undertaken by Incomes Data Services, an independent research body.</p>

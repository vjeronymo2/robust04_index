			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Fashion: Comfort dressing can be as elegant as you like - How to spend it When you are all shopped out, your stilettos are killing you and the effort of looking glamorous has begun to tell, then it is time for comfort clothes. Of course, comfort clothes have long been with us - there are those who wear nothing else. Whether it be an easy tracksuit, a floaty caftan or a beaten-up pair of jeans, comfort clothes are what a woman puts on when she wants to relax, when she is tired of holding in her stomach and when the most appealing thing she can think of doing is to flop on a sofa with a glass tinkling with ice in one hand and a book in the other. But there is another sort of comfort dressing. These are clothes that are just as easy to wear, just as forgiving, but infinitely more indulgent. Forget cotton, Lycra or easy-care mixes. These are made of brocades and velvets, cashmere, silks and satins. They are metropolitan in mood, langorous and seductive. These are the clothes to wear when champagne or a stiff Martini are on the menu and they are a million miles from the cup of cocoa and a biscuit mood. They all hark back to the days when the salon played a large part in the social lives of the sophisticated metropolis, when being 'at home' wasn't a synonym for sloppy dress but an invitation to the civilised indoor delights of good conversation, of music, of fine food and entertainment. Such clothes have more than a touch of the hedonistic about them, echoing the heyday of the aesthetic movement, mirroring the richness of a Gustav Klimt portrait or the turn-of-the-century love affair with Eastern exoticism. Clothes that tune into this new mood are everywhere. Knickerbox, one of the cheaper chains, has soft and seductive pyjamas that are luxurious enough to wear in company. Higher up the range, Georgina von Etzdorf has rich lush velvets, while Caroline Charles is the place for gold-braided brocaded jackets. What they all have in common is that, being loose and unstructured with fluid outlines, they are just as comfortable, as easy to wear, as anything made of Lycra or acrylic, but are much more glamorous. Since the fabrics are sumptuous and the workmanship intricate they usually don't come cheap, but they can as easily be worn to the grandest gathering as an evening home alone.</p>

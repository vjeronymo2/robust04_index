			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Colgate buys Ciba-Geigy Indian unit The Indian unit of Colgate-Palmolive said it had signed an agreement to buy the oral hygiene business of Hindustan Ciba-Geigy for Rs1.31bn (Dollars 42m), Reuter reports from Bombay. Hindustan Ciba-Geigy is 40 per cent owned by Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland. Colgate-Palmolive (India), a 51 per cent subsidiary of the parent company, said turnover of the acquired business was forecast at Rs650m for 1994. The acquisition involves the transfer of Cibaca toothpaste and other brands, distribution and manufacturing arrangements. Analysts said that with the acquisition of Ciba's brands of toothbrushes, Colgate's market share will jump to 70 per cent. Ciba-Geigy is the market leader in toothbrushes with a 35 per cent share, followed by Colgate with 33 per cent. Colgate said only 20 per cent of the Indian population uses any form of modern dentifrice. Hindustan Ciba-Geigy has opted out of this business to focus on ophthalmic products.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Thyssen returns to black but omits dividend again Thyssen, the steel-based conglomerate, said yesterday it was back in profit after the worst results in its 103-year history. However, it will not be paying a dividend for 1993-94. The group reported a DM90m (Dollars 57.9m) net profit for the year ended September 30, compared with net losses of DM994m the year before. Thyssen said a 'satisfactory' dividend would be paid at the end of the present financial year. The group last paid a dividend, of DM10, in 1992. Its recovery was driven mainly by a turnround in the European car industry and the growing demand for investment goods as Germany emerges from its worst post-war recession. Restructuring over the past two years, especially in the steel division, helped lift productivity. Turnover for the year rose 4 per cent to DM34.9, up from DM33.5m, while orders increased 8 per cent. Budd, the US subsidiary, saw turnover rise 17 per cent during the review period, helped especially by strong sales of pick-up trucks and minivans, which are the group's speciality. More jobs are expected to be shed in the coming year, mainly in the steel division, which represents about 30 per cent of group turnover and was the main cause of the recent losses. Steel sales rose 3 per cent to DM11bn during the period. Although the steel division has been reporting monthly profits since April, it will report a loss for the year as a whole, even though plants are working flat out and cannot meet the unexpectedly strong demand for some products. Thyssen employed 129,389 people at the end of the period, about 5 per cent less than a year earlier. The group expects to shed another 4,000 steelworkers by the end of 1995, bringing the steel division's workforce to about 22,000, down from 30,858 in September 1993. The Steel Federation said new orders at German steelmakers in the third quarter rose 16.4 per cent, to 9.5m tonnes, over the same period a year ago. However, the figures represent a drop of 0.8 per cent against the second quarter, mainly because of lower orders from China.</p>

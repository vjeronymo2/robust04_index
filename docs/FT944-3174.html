			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK fisherman seek to repel Spanish armada - Alison Maitland on a campaign that could lead to another government defeat The prospect of the Spanish fishing fleet gaining full access to waters west of the UK spurs Mr John Ashworth into grim eloquence. Mr Ashworth, spokesman for the Save Britain's Fish campaign, believes this is the thin end of the wedge. It will lead to the European Union's largest fleet winning entry to all EU waters, including the North Sea, by 2003, he says. 'At the end of the day, it means that Britain has handed over her greatest renewable resource. It will mean the end of our industry.' The campaign group wants Britain to renounce the principle enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy of equal access for all member states to a common resource. As this is the policy's cornerstone, they say the logical step is for Britain to withdraw from the CFP. Next week, EU fisheries ministers must resolve the prickly question of how to integrate Spain and Portugal into the western waters off the UK, France and north-west Spain, and in particular into the 'Irish Box'  - the waters surrounding Ireland. While having restricted access to most of the western waters, the two countries have been barred from the Irish Box  - where fish stocks are particularly fragile  - since they joined the community. This ban is to be lifted at the end of next year, but the UK and Ireland are anxious to protect their fishermen's rights and minimise the Iberian presence. The British House of Commons will tonight debate an opposition Labour party amendment to keep Iberian fishermen out of the Irish Box. It could win backing from anti-European Conservatives, leaving the government facing another defeat. Spain has threatened to block the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden in January unless a deal is worked out by the end of this year. The UK government has been at pains this week to deny rumours spreading through the fishing community that Spain has already been granted new rights to these waters under a secret deal. Mr Michael Jack, the fisheries minister, says the only agreement at last weekend's EU summit in Essen was that a fishing deal should be clear and unbureaucratic. Mr Ashworth acknowledges that Spain and Portugal are fully justified in their claims to greater access. But he cannot see how the European Commission can square this with an agreement that Iberian integration into the CFP should not entail any overall increase in fishing effort. 'I don't think they know how to do it,' he says. 'They're in a shambles.' Integration, originally due by 2003, was brought forward to 1996 as part of the deal on accession for the Efta countries. British fishermen are deeply concerned that the 17,000-strong Spanish fishing fleet will ignore quotas and other conservation measures in western waters. They also fear the Spaniards will catch immature fish, which are much appreciated on their domestic market, depriving shoals of their replacement stocks. Mr John Thomson, vice-chairman of the Scottish White Fish Producers, says fishermen are already hard-pressed. 'Fishing is the life-blood of Scottish communities. For every man at sea there may be 10 people employed on shore. We're very frightened this could be devastated.' At the very least, he wants Britain to regulate EU vessels entering its western waters, a proposal taken up by the UK government. Mr Geoff Bullus, a Cornish fishermen's leader, is bitter about what he sees as double standards. 'Stocks are overfished at the moment and the scientists are recommending reductions in all stocks in the western approaches. At the same time the Commission is telling us we must make room for the Spanish fleet. That's very difficult to stomach.'</p>

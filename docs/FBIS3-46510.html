Among the American pollees, 49 percent said they think  Japan-U.S. relations are "going very well," or "going well to a  certain degree" followed by 49 percent who regarded them as "not  going well" or "bad."

Meanwhile, in the United States,  those who believe they will go toward a "good direction" rapidly  increased from 33 percent to 51 percent. [passage omitted]    Asked about relations between the leaders of the two  countries, the percentage of those who answered that they think  relations between them have become "better" reached 20 percent  both in Japan and the United States.

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers reportedly shot and killed a 15-year-old Palestinian and  wounded 15 Arabs in clashes that broke out during a Palestinian strike to  protest Israel's Middle East peace plan. Arab reports said the strike was  observed in the Gaza Strip, where troops on Friday killed three Palestinians.  In the Khan Yunis refugee camp, soldiers shot Akram Mohammed Schade Saada in  the neck, and he later died at the nearby Nasser Hospital, Israel Radio  reported. The army immediately imposed a curfew on the camp, forcing its 35,000  residents to stay indoors, Arab reports said.  </P></p>

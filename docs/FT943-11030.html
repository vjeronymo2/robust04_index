			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Bottles of fruit drink recalled Robinsons is recalling bottles of its apple and blackcurrant drink because of fears they could burst after fermentation caused by the recent hot weather. The company said it was 'concerned that the fermentation could, under extreme circumstances, result in pressure build-up causing bottles to burst'. The company said the drinks had been withdrawn as a precaution after the discovery that there had been fermentation in a few bottles. The changes were not a danger to health but care should be taken to remove the caps. About 3m plastic bottles of the drink were being recalled. Production at the Norwich plant had been halted until a solution could be found. Other varieties of juice, including baby drinks, were unaffected.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On Thursday [3 February] Lithuanian officials took  over the files of KGB old-age pensioners residing in Lithuania.  Earlier, the files, kept in the former KGB headquarters in  Vilnius, were under the charge of a special KGB people group,  subordinate to the Russian Embassy in Vilnius. The Baltic News  Service reports that a conflict broke out while taking over the  documents, as the women in charge of the dossiers refused to  give them to Lithuanian officials. The authorized Russian  official was not present during the handover of the documents,  and the Russian Embassy in Vilnius refused to comment on the  incident. The files of the KGB pensioners will now be kept in  the Lithuanian archives and will be accessible to both  Lithuanian and Russian officials.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Harsh fare for the jobless THE UK government, poorly ad-vised by civil servants and City economists steeped in the conventional economic wisdom, miscalculated the length and depth of recession. It now risks overestimating the speed of recovery. Yesterday's Treasury statement, pointing out that most independent forecasters expect a return to growth this year, can hardly have cheered the 60,000 ex-workers who joined the unemployment register last month. The first priority of the government's new unemployment policy should be to give the economy another kick quite soon. The Treasury is right to counsel against interpreting November's 0.5 per cent fall in manufacturing output as evidence that the recession is still deepening. But the Treasury has been saying the same thing for months, while the economy remains flat on its back, with scant evidence to suggest that it is going to get up again soon. The one piece of good news is the swift fall in the rate of increase of average earnings. The government now has room to cut interest rates once more, despite the slight slip in sterling's exchange rate over the past week. It should do so, assuming, heroically perhaps, that the Treasury can raise rates once more if earnings start to pick up. Yet both history and the practices of British wage-bargaining suggest that cuts in interest rates will do little to push back the flood of lost jobs that has far exceeded the increase in registered unemployment over the past year. Unemployment has risen by 1.4m since the recession began, but total employment has fallen by a fraction short of 2m. This explains why a shrinking and unprofitable manufacturing sector is now registering rates of productivity growth in excess of 5 per cent a year. One reason for this unusually rapid fall in employment by historical standards is the increased ease with which employers can now shed labour. But this has been compounded by the willingness of the employed to push for higher wages at the expense of job cuts. The average earnings of those lucky enough to keep their jobs have now risen by a shocking 17.1 per cent since the recession began and by 6 per cent when earnings are adjusted for inflation. Excessive wage increases remain the greatest threat to the unemployed, as Mr Fred Bayliss points out in a recent pamphlet for the Employment Institute. The government has a responsibility to represent the unemployed by cajoling employers and unions to keep settlements low and by waving the interest rate stick if growth in average earnings starts to rise again. The government should also be planning how to help the newly unemployed compete when recovery begins. Recent talk of cutting unemployment benefits or of imposing some form of workfare on people out of work for less than two years is misguided. The government should, instead, concentrate its help on subsidising full-time job search, expanding jobs clubs and computerising the woefully inadequate system for storing job vacancies. The more difficult challenge for public policy is how to help the very long-term unemployed, normally young or old men with no educational qualifications, who have been unemployed since before the recession began and are likely to remain so when recovery comes. The negligible education of these men means that they are not attractive to employers except at lower wages than the unemployed will accept. These men are the targets of the new enthusiasm for workfare schemes. But the US experience spins a cautionary tale. Workfare has an understandable appeal in these days of rights, responsibilities and budget deficits. But the risk in stopping benefits or replacing them with poorly paid workfare schemes is that the young unemployed will be driven not into employment but into the criminal economies of modern cities. A better option may be to subsidise employment, so closing the gap between what the illegal economy offers young people and what the market will pay. Subsidising their employment, in either the private or public sectors, makes more sense than leaving them to decay.</p>

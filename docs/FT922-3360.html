			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Oriflame back on track with Pounds 8.89m Oriflame International, the direct sales cosmetics group, yesterday reported a return to sales and profits growth and said that the acquisition of the ACO skin care brand in Sweden, along with expansion in eastern Europe made for an encouraging outlook. The year to March 31 saw sales rise by 17 per cent to Pounds 64.7m (Pounds 55.2m) and operating profit jump 74 per cent to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 4.36m). Financial income declined to Pounds 632,000 (Pounds 3.16m), but despite this the rise at the pre-tax level was 47 per cent at Pounds 8.89m (Pounds 6.05m). The favourable comparison was due to an exceptional item of Pounds 2m carried last year. Despite recession in its main markets the company managed to raise sales by 7 per cent in Scandinavia and by 10 per cent in the UK. The final dividend is maintained at 8p for an unchanged total of 12p on earnings per share of 15.7p (10.3p). The shares rose 6p to 170p.</p>

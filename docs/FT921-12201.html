			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / BJP unity tour falls short of expectations: Leaders forced to abandon grand climax at Srinagar THE OPPOSITION Bharatiya Janata party's much publicised ekta yatra (unity tour) ended in a shoddy victory, at best. Its leaders are now pondering whether it was worth the effort. The BJP had hoped by emphasising national unity to widen its appeal among voters and to deflect attention from its emotional communal campaign to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram on a religously disputed site. The BJP had failed to live up to its promise to start building the temple. Meant to symbolise India's unity, the caravan headed by Dr Murli Manohar Joshi, the BJP president, was to finish its 45-day tour at Srinagar, capital of the state of Kashmir, where the national flag was to be unfurled before a huge gathering. The grand climax did not take place. A short discussion with Mr G N Saxena, the Kashmiri governor, the day before the planned grand drive forced Mr Joshi to change his plans. Thousands of volunteers were stranded, with only a token group ferried to Srinagar by the Indian Air Force to unfurl the national flag in a 15-minute ceremony. It was exactly this sort of tokenism that Mr Joshi had been deriding. Honours went to the militants seeking Kashmir autonomy. In spite of an official curfew, gunfire in the Kashmir valley was heard throughout the day. Even the unfurling site was the target of rocket attack. The militants were able to show that they held sway. The diverse militant groups fighting for independence apparently suspended their differences, if only for the day, although political observers believe this could well lead to more cohesion among the guerrillas. The ekta yatra seemed only to strengthen the militants' resolve, and the BJP might now be forced to abandon yatra politics.</p>

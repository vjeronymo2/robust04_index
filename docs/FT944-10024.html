			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets: Signs of recovery fail to lift Italian equities - But there is room for optimism The Italian economy is growing and inflation is relatively low; industrial companies have shown, in half-year figures, the first clear signs of recovery, with exporters leading the way; the privatisation programme appears to be back on track; and, in the last three weeks, two of Italy's biggest banks have announced their intention to mount L2,000bn bids for control of quoted competitors. Yet the Comit index of leading Italian equities still stands at about the same level as at the beginning of the year, closing yesterday at 641. Those analysts who forecast that the index would top 900 within a year of the March general election seem unlikely to be vindicated. 'The market is getting to a level where it is cheap enough to justify buying on fundamentals,' says Mr Andrea Ruggeri of Goldman Sachs in London. 'On the other hand, as far as political and fiscal developments are concerned I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel yet.' One problem is that nobody knows how long the tunnel is. In summer, with equity prices still sliding from their mid-May peak, investors pinned their hopes on a rapid coalition agreement on the vital 1995 budget. Ministers were slow in agreeing, but the final plan was stricter than most outside observers had expected. Now, however, the focus is on the government's ability to push the plan through parliament, which it must do before January 1. This is no easy matter, given the underlying level of dissent. Trade union federations are predicting that more than a million workers will join them in Rome today for a demonstration against the budget, following weeks of industrial action which has reached its worst level since the 1960s. Such considerations seem likely to keep the lid on equity prices for the foreseeable future, aided by the reluctance of Italian mutual funds, themselves short of new clients, to invest their reserves of cash in the short term. But, as the low volumes of the last few months indicate, longer term investors, notably non-Italians, are also hanging back. 'The main worry for foreigners is not Italy as such - it's the rest of world bond and equity markets,' says Ms Francesca Lolli, head of research at Finanziaria Indosuez in Milan. Real interest rates are particularly high in Italy, deterring investors from returning to equities, in spite of the underlying performance of the companies themselves. With confidence so fragile, it has proved easy for unscrupulous investors to set rumours running in bond, money and equity markets, usually based on the possibility that anti-corruption magistrates are about to put Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, under investigation. Nervous and frustrated Italian ministers have taken to accusing the City of London of conspiring to undermine the Italian currency and economy. However, Italy has still been one of the best performing markets in Europe this year, and there are at least three reasons for optimism about its performance in the next nine months, assuming the political cloud lifts a little. Bank Bids. Shares in Italy's quoted banks have performed particularly badly this year. Hit by the overhang of bad loans from the recession and the underperformance of bond portfolios, the value of banking stock has fallen by 11.5 per cent since January. The recent offers outlined by two privatised banks - Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) for a majority stake in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), and Credito Italiano for a majority of Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) - have stimulated interest in the sector, and raised the possibility that other takeovers could follow, even if the plans already announced founder. In addition, the whole banking sector could be due for a more solid recovery in the first half of next year if bond trading picks up and as the quality of loan portfolios improves. Insurers could also benefit from cutbacks to the state pension system and proposed new legislation encouraging private retirement provision. Privatisation. The new government muddied the waters on privatisation policy soon after taking office, when ministers issued a series of conflicting statements about the speed and priorities of the programme. Now, however, the timetable seems clearer. Yesterday, ministers outlined their proposals for the privatisation of Enel, the state electricity company, promising to begin the sale of shares by the middle of next year. That should inject new liquidity into the stock market, particularly as Enel is not yet quoted. The first six months of 1995 should also see the sale of the treasury's outstanding stakes in Ina, the insurer, and IMI, the banking and financial services group, and of holdings in Stet, the telecommunications holding company, and part of Eni, the energy and chemicals conglomerate. Futures. The stock exchange will finally launch a futures contract on the revamped MIB 30 index of the biggest Italian stocks in the week beginning November 28. Analysts expect this to improve the liquidity of the underlying market. However, they point out that big investors will only be satisfied fully with the innovation once the borsa develops an efficient stock lending system and introduces full cash settlement on all shares, improvements which could be put in place next year.</p>

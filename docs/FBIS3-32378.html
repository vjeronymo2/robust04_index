It is headed by Samuel Lewis Galindo, a  businessman. The party also authorized its national directorate  to negotiate an electoral alliance to face the upcoming 8 May  elections.    The Solidarity Party held its convention at the Atlapa  Convention Center. The other members of the presidential ticket  are Carlos Clement as the first vice presidential candidate and  Marisin Villalaz de Arias as the second vice presidential  candidate. In his acceptance speech, Lewis Galindo promised more  jobs, better education, and renegotiation of the foreign debt.    The Solidarity conventioneers also agreed to authorize the  party's national directorate to negotiate before 8 February --  the deadline established by the Electoral Tribunal for engaging  in alliances -- a possible political alliance with other  parties. According to Villalaz de Arias, the Solidarity Party is  talking with the National Unity Mission and the Papa Egoro  Movement about the possibility of an alliance. The presidential  ticket can be changed to adjust to the results of negotiations,  a source said.    Meanwhile, at the Doctrinal Panamenista Party [Partido  Panamenist Doctrinario -- PD] convention, Jose Salvador Munoz  was nominated as the presidential candidate. The nominee for  first vice president is Rodrigo Bernal, and the nomination for  second vice president went to Julia Suria. In his acceptance  speech, Munoz described his party as the third force and the  best option. According to him, the oligarchy that governed the  country during the past three years and the Democratic  Revolutionary Party and its allies, who represent 21 years of  "military dictatorship and repression," must be discarded.    According to reports from the Electoral Tribunal, 1.5  million  Panamanians, out of a population of 2.5 million, have been  called to participate in the general elections in May. According  to authorities, these will be the first democratic elections  ever to take place.</p>

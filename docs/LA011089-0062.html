			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR SEEKS TO UNCLOG ROADS;  </P> <P> STATE OF STATE MESSAGE ALSO CALLS FOR REFORM OF THE BUDGET PROCESS  </P> <P> Talking tough but also urging cooperation, Gov. George Deukmejian invited  legislators in his annual State of the State address on Monday to join him in  creating new proposals to unclog California's highways and to reform the  state's budget process.  </P> <P> Regarding highway tie-ups, Deukmejian said, "It is time to seriously consider  restricting commercial truck traffic on our freeways during peak hours in urban  areas."  </P> <P> On the state budget, the Republican governor questioned "the continued  usefulness" of a spending limit that voters amended into the California  Constitution 10 years ago. He suggested the limit may no longer be workable  because of subsequent voter actions, such as the approval last November of  Proposition 98 guaranteeing public schools roughly 40% of the state's general  fund.  </P> <P> Deukmejian proposed one "long overdue" change in California's political system:  He advocated the election of the governor and the lieutenant governor as a  "ticket," similar to the way the President and vice president are elected. The  governor and lieutenant governor now run separately, and in recent years the  result often has been that the victors on Election Day are from different  parties.  </P> <P> Deukmejian did not mention it in his State of the State address, but if the  lieutenant governor last year had been a Republican instead of a Democrat, the  governor would have felt free to consider vice presidential overtures from  George Bush. As it was, Deukmejian would have had to turn the governor's office  over to Democrat Leo T. McCarthy had he been elected vice president.  </P> <P> On another political matter, Deukmejian said he now is willing to join the  chorus of legislators advocating an earlier presidential primary in order to  restore California's former clout in the nominating process. He also asked the  lawmakers to join him in urging Washington to set a uniform poll closing time  for the next presidential election, so that television networks will be unable  to project the winner before Californians finish voting.  </P> <P> As governors traditionally have, Deukmejian delivered the State of the State  address -- his seventh -- from the dais of the ornate, 19th-Century-style  Assembly chamber. Jammed into the chamber for what always is one of the  Capitol's biggest events of the year were the legislators, other statewide  officeholders, top Administration officials and invited guests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Third Term  </P> <P> This was the first time Deukmejian has faced the Democratic-controlled  Legislature as a political lame duck. The governor announced last Thursday that  he will not run for a third term, pledging during his final two years in office  to "personally reach out" to legislative leaders in hopes of developing some  bipartisan solutions to pressing problems.  </P> <P> Reiterating his observation about this new "window of opportunity" for  bipartisanship, Deukmejian said somewhat humorously: "And why not? With peace  breaking out all over the world -- with President Reagan talking to (Soviet  President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev, with the U.S. talking to (PLO Chairman Yasser)  Arafat, and with Speaker Willie Brown talking to the (Democratic rebel) 'Gang  of Five' -- surely we ought to be able to work together peacefully and  productively."  </P> <P> He added, "I thought of suggesting a second honeymoon. But I can't seem to  recall the first."  </P> <P> Deukmejian's appeal for peaceful and productive cooperation drew the biggest  applause of his speech. He was interrupted six times in all.  </P> <P> Not all of his words were conciliatory. For example, the governor warned the  legislators that if they do not provide him with sufficient money in the next  state budget to fund a 3% "rainy day" reserve, he will veto enough spending  programs to acquire the money himself. Democrats already have indicated they  will oppose setting aside such a reserve at a time when the governor is  expected to be trying to cut many social programs.  </P> <P> Deukmejian, anticipating criticisms of the new budget proposal he will send to  the Legislature today, admonished the lawmakers that "rather than shout at each  other or make intemperate remarks to the media, we (should) sit down together  over the next five months to develop a budget plan that is balanced, fair and  compassionate to all Californians."  </P> <P> On transportation, an increasingly controversial issue as freeways become more  clogged and highway construction wanes for lack of funds, Deukmejian sounded a  little bit at times like his predecessor, Democrat Edmund G. Brown, Jr., an  advocate of alternative solutions.  </P> <P> "I want to unlock gridlock in our state with a two-track approach: build more  roads where needed and make better use of the transportation system we already  have," the governor said.  </P> <P> "We must not underestimate the impact that ride sharing, mass transit and  better traffic management can have on congestion. If we can increase the  average number of riders per vehicle from 1.2 to 1.4, congestion would  virtually disappear without adding a single additional mile of pavement to our  system."  </P> <P> Deukmejian said he has offered state workers "financial incentives" to  ride-share and has asked major businesses to do the same for their employees.  </P> <P> But acknowledging that "we must also finance and build more highways," the  governor disclosed that he soon will invite legislative leaders and  representatives of local governments, businesses and organized labor to meet  with him "to develop a funding plan" to be submitted to voters in 1990.  </P> <P> Deukmejian provided few details of what he has in mind, however. Nor did he on  most of the issues he touched on in his speech.  </P> <P> The governor said he will invite legislative leaders "to sit down" with him "to  thoroughly review the state budget process." He proposed placing on the table  for negotiation "all mandated entitlements, automatic cost-of-living  adjustments in spending programs, as well a complete re-examination" of the  spending limit.  </P> <P> Democrats never have really liked the spending limit, but they historically  have been protective of "entitlement" programs for welfare families, the aged,  blind and disabled and Medi-Cal recipients.  </P> <P> Deukmejian lamented that budgeting has become so restricted because of  "statutes, constitutional amendments, court orders and other legal  requirements" that the governor now has effective control over only 8% of state  spending.  </P> <P> Regarding education, Deukmejian said he will propose that $110 million of the  new Proposition 98 money be spent for teaching basic subjects and reducing  class size. He also called for adoption of a comprehensive drug education  program statewide, adding: "Saying 'no' to drugs must be part of the basic  learning curriculum of every child beginning in grade school."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Working Prisoners  </P> <P> As for people convicted of drug crimes or any other felonies, Deukmejian said,  "It is time that the criminals themselves worked and paid for their own  upkeep." He reiterated his longstanding conviction that inmates should be  allowed to manufacture goods that can be sold outside the prisons.  </P> <P> The governor noted that labor unions have opposed this concept on grounds that  it "would take jobs away from law-abiding Californians." But he dismissed this  argument, saying that even if every inmate worked, they would make up just 0.5%  of the total state work force.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said he will try to place a state constitutional amendment on the  1990 ballot "to put into place a system where all able-bodied inmates are  required to work and are charged for their room and board."  </P> <P> On other subjects, Deukmejian also:  </P> <P> * Called for a complete examination of the state's 13 separate school dropout  prevention programs, now costing $805 million a year. He said a new strategy  should be developed because last year "an estimated 33% of high school students  dropped out anyway."  </P> <P> * Said a top priority of his Administration this year will be to develop a  comprehensive plan for garbage disposal. "We're running out of places to bury  it or burn it," he said, adding that he wants to work toward the goals of waste  reduction and greater recycling.  </P> <P> * Noted that he will open a new California trade and investment office in  Mexico City next month, and announced intentions to establish new branches to  the state's Tokyo and London offices somewhere in Asia and Europe. He did not  say precisely where.  </P> <P> * Proposed increasing the prison sentence for large-scale importation of heroin  or cocaine to a minimum of 25 years without possibility of parole. He also  advocated the death penalty for first-degree murder committed during a  drug-related crime.  </P> <P> * Said he "would welcome the opportunity" to work with the Legislature in  developing new political reforms to "restore the public's confidence in the  integrity of the legislative process." The FBI currently is investigating  alleged political corruption in the Legislature.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favorable Reactions  </P> <P> The governor's speech drew generally good reviews from legislative leaders.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said "it clearly was a speech  of a statesman who's on his way out."  </P> <P> This means, Brown said, that "the governor is literally free of any need to  consider political restraints and maybe we'll see great leadership." But Brown  added that he wished that Deukmejian had advocated raising the gasoline tax to  pump more money into the transportation building fund.  </P> <P> Senate Democratic leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who frequently has  feuded with Deukmejian, said the governor "was as friendly as could be. I'm not  going to rehash past history. I'm going to accept his outreach."  </P> <P> Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra praised Deukmejian for  agreeing to an earlier presidential primary. And he called the proposal to  require prisoners to work "a terrific idea."  </P></p>

However, this is a competition that will contribute to  accelerating the necessary structural adjustments. Those who  stop this structural change harm themselves, FRG Chancellor  Helmut Kohl stressed at the opening of the 24th World Economic  Forum in Davos in Switzerland. Detachment from the reform  states or even the possible reduction of economic aid for these  countries would also have disastrous consequences for the West,  said Kohl, who particularly referred to possible immigration of  workers to West Europe.    Therefore, the further opening of Western markets for East  European products is necessary because only in this way can  these countries be enabled to earn the foreign exchange needed  for their development by exports. Despite all the support from  the West, the help for the reform countries continues to be only  help for self-help. The reform states also have to be  introduced to the market economy more slowly than before.  German experiences have shown that patience is one of the most  important factors in the transformation process. Moreover,  political signals also have to be given, Kohl said. For  example, he refused to accept the Oder-Neisse border as the  future eastern border of the European Community. The process of  enlargement is also indispensable in the combating of  unemployment because unemployment no longer can be combated in  only one country, he said. For this reason, the chancellor  called for the European countries' joint efforts to combat  unemployment and to ensure stability, while he gave preference  to stability over the observation of the timetable in the course  of European unification.    In his deliberations, Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer  also focused on stability policy. He urgently appealed to the  industrial nations to stick to anti-inflation policy. Moreover,  Tietmeyer took the view that there should be no experiments with  anti-inflation policy. Rather, the industrial nations have to  be careful not to endanger their successes in the curbing of  inflation. Particular caution is required as far as the  increase of the state expenditures is concerned. Tietmeyer  commented skeptically on the possibility to boost demand by  increasing the state expenditure. This would probably be more  harmful than useful, he said.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION MASTERS WRESTLING;  </P> <P> FOUR FROM COUNTY WIN CHAMPIONSHIPS  </P> <P> Last season, Rick Monge walked away from the Southern Section Masters wrestling  tournament down and out. After entering with high expectations, the wrestler  from Mater Dei High School lost his first two matches and the chance to compete  at the state tournament.  </P> <P> He eased that memory on Saturday by defeating Rim of the World's Jason Roberts,  5-2, to win the 145-pound Masters tournament championship at Fountain Valley  High School. Monge advances to the state meet next weekend at the University of  the Pacific.  </P> <P> "This year, I just wanted to make sure I got to state," said Monge. "I was kind  of disappointed last year."  </P> <P> Monge was one of four Orange County wrestlers to win championships Saturday.  Canyon's Zach Cooper, who pinned three opponents, won his 91st consecutive  match in the 191-pound final and teammate Jason Mitchell won the 138-pound  championship. Savanna's Tony Okada won the 132-pound division.  </P> <P> Overall, 17 county wrestlers advanced to the state meet by finishing in the top  six in their respective weight class. Canyon qualified six wrestlers for the  Masters meet at last week's divisional championships, San Clemente and Edison  each qualified two wrestlers.  </P> <P> Monge said he was especially frustrated last year because he had been ill two  or three weeks before the Masters and was at less than full strength when he  lost a pair of one-point matches. Adding to Monge's frustration was the fact  that he beat the 132-pound state champion, Arroyo's Elfrin Gonzales, during the  regular season.  </P> <P> Thus, an inspired Monge (46-1) met Roberts in the final. Monge, a senior, had  beaten Roberts, 2-1, at a tournament three weeks ago.  </P> <P> "I finished a lot stronger on my takedowns this time," Monge said. "The last  time I was kind of sloppy. This time I drove in harder with more intensity."  </P> <P> Okada, who placed fifth in the state meet last year at 126 pounds, raised his  record to 46-0, defeating Coachella Valley's Albert Morales, 13-2.  </P> <P> "I expected it to be tougher," Okada said of his victory. "I used my quickness.  I beat him on my feet."  </P> <P> Canyon, which won its third Southern Section 4-A championship in four years  last week, was the only county school with two champions. If not for what Coach  Gary Bowden called "some bad luck," Canyon may have qualified more than two  wrestlers.  </P> <P> Tom McCullogh (119 pounds) was battling the flu, Bowden said, and lost his  first two matches. Matt Padgett (154 pounds) was bothered by a knee injury he  sustained in practice Thursday and couldn't finish his second-round match in  the losers' bracket.  </P> <P> "We expected to get two in," Bowden said. "We've wrestled great all year and  haven't had many problems with injuries or sickness, so maybe it was our turn."  </P> <P> Jason Booth (112 pounds) and Josh Kitner (98 pounds) qualified for San  Clemente. Chad Stansbury (138) and Brian Burgess (132 pounds) advanced for  Edison.  </P></p>

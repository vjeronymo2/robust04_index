			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a letter sent to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin,  settlers in the Jordan Valley write that if reports are true  that Israel agreed to set up three territorial corridors --  which will dissect the Jordan Rift Valley -- this constitutes a  declaration of war on settlement in the Jordan Valley. Our  settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that the  settlers go on to tell the prime minister: Do not force  settlers who merely want to farm to turn into warriors fighting  for their homes and lives. The settlers say they will not put  up with such lethal blows and will not allow the establishment  of a Palestinian corridor anywhere in the Jordan Valley.</p>

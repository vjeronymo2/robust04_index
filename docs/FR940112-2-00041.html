			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> D. MC shall send U.S. EPA copies of preliminary determinations on PSD permit modifications and amendments at or prior to the beginning of the public comment period. U.S. EPA will provide comments to MC prior to the close of the public comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. MC shall send to EPA a copy of all applicability determinations and justifications made that would involve PSD exemptions due to offsetting or netting (40 CFR 52.21(b)(3) and 52.21(b)(21). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Revisions to Title 40 CFR 52.21 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. This delegation covers any revisions that are promulgated for 40 CFR 52.21 and 40 CFR 124. The terms ``40 CFR 52.21'' and ``40 CFR 124'' as used in the delegation request and throughout this Agreement, include such regulations as are in effect on the date this Agreement is executed and any revisions that are promulgated after that date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. In addition, the following U.S. EPA policies shall apply to PSD review: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. U.S. EPA is responsible for the issuance of PSD permits on Indian Lands, under sections 110(c) and 301 of the Clean Air Act. States (or their delegates) have no authority to establish air pollution control requirements on Indian Reservations, unless requested to by the Tribal Governing Body.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. According to U.S. EPA guidance published on September 22, 1987 and supplemental guidance published on July 28, 1988, all delegated agencies must now consider pollutants not subject to the Clean Air Act in their Best Available Control Technology (BACT) determinations. The BACT determinations must include a review of the toxic effects of unregulated pollutants and the impact of the proposed BACT on the emissions of these pollutants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. MC shall consult with the appropriate Federal, State, and local land use agencies prior to issuance of preliminary determinations on PSD permits. In particular, U.S. EPA requires that MC shall: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Notify the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and U.S. EPA when a PSD permit application has been received, in order to assist U.S. EPA in carrying out its non-delegable responsibilities under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (PL 97&hyph;304). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Notify potential applicants of the potential need for consultation between U.S. EPA and the FWS if an endangered species may be affected by the project. U.S. EPA's data sheet may be used for this process (copy enclosed). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Refrain from issuing a final PSD permit unless the FWS has determined that the proposed project will not adversely affect any endangered species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. MC shall consider a dry scrubber for sulfur dioxide control, a baghouse or electrostatic precipitator for particulate control, and efficient combustion techniques for carbon monoxide control in their BACT determinations for municipal waste combustors pursuant to U.S. EPA guidance published on June 26, 1987. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. MC shall begin any BACT determination with the most stringent control options available for that category, pursuant to additional BACT guidance issued on December 1, 1987. U.S. EPA will consider as deficient any BACT determination not complying with this ``top-down'' requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Upon notification from EPA, MC shall implement such new regulations or directives pending revision of this Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Permits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A. In any matter involving interpretation of sections 160&hyph;169 of the Clean Air Act, or 40 CFR 52.21, and of 40 CFR 124 where guidance on the implementation, review, administration, or enforcement of these sections has not been sent to MC, U.S. EPA will be contacted and requested to provide the appropriate guidance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. MC shall at no time grant any waiver to the PSD permit requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Permits issued under this delegation shall contain language certifying that the Federal PSD requirements have been satisfied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

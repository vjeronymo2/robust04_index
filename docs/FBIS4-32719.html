			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 24/06/1994 -- The Romanian  Polling Institute IRSOP conducted a June inquest to find out  what people think about political personalities and topical  issues of their daily life. The first three in the top appear  to be Adrian Nastase, executive president of the ruling Social  Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR, and speaker of the Chamber  of Deputies, Emil Constantinescu, president of the main  opposition bloc, the Democratic Convention of Romania -- CDR,  and Ion Iliescu, the president of Romania. Since March Senate  President Oliviu Gherman has added some credit to his public  image, forging a positive impression among 41 percent of the  interviewed as against only 26 percent three months before.  IRSOP manager Petre Datculescu said that although personalities  affiliated or 'close' to the ruling party hold best positions,  PDSR would lose to the convention should elections be called now.    The `negative character' of the poll seems to be the  government, whose activity causes growing dissatisfaction among  people, who are equally grumbling against parliament and justice.    The answers got under the chapter devoted to living standard  reveal a feeling of insecurity among the polled persons. The  ratio of those totally discontent with their living standard has  risen from 15 to 25 per cent over the past three months. People  are also growingly apprehensive of price increments and  unemployment.    The barometer of opinion has been conducted by IRSOP at the  request of the Soros foundation for an open society and is  focused on the major themes of social and political interest.  The polling is run every quarter in the months of March, June,  September and December alternately by two specialized  institutions: IRSOP and IMAS, which devised their questionnaire  jointly. The June survey selected a batch of 1,095 persons aged  18 and over and found representative for Romania's entire  population, and its margin of error is three per cent.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Intl Food shares dive 19p on warning SHARES of International Food Machinery dived 19p to 35p yesterday as the company warned that profits for the year to December 31 were likely to be 'substantially below' market estimates. The reasons given were: The company has adopted a more stringent accounting policy for the recognition of sales; Two major contracts are unlikely to be completed prior to December 31; There has been a recent downturn in business in the UK and Europe which has particularly affected the meat and bakery division; Various exceptional expenses incurred in the reorganisation of the group and promotional expenditure in opening up overseas markets have been written off. The company came to market in December 1992 with the shares priced at 51p. In September, when it reported a surge in pre-tax profits from Pounds 292,000 to Pounds 878,000 for the first six months of 1993, the shares rose by 9p to 80p.</p>

In a  statement, Mr Terreblanche said: "The AWB has undertaken to  provide President Mangope with any support he may need  including, if necessary, physical force to prevent the communist  rabble from turning Bophuthatswana into another African National  Congress [ANC]-type Transkei tin pot state."    He expressed the AWB's concern at what he called attempts by  the ANC/South African Communist Party/(Foreign Minister) Pik  Botha alliance to undermine and destroy the government of  Bophuthatswana.    "Mr Botha was the same man who, four years ago, actually  sped  to the assistance of President Mangope when the communist rabble  tried to overthrow the legal government of Bophuthatswana.    "It is a sad reflection on the National Party that they are  prepared to stab their former loyal friends in the back in this  despicable manner."</p>

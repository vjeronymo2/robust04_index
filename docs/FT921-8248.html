			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Chilectra raises Dollars 72m for expansion CHILECTRA Metropolitana, Chile's largest electricity distribution company, has raised Dollars 72m from US institutional investors in order to participate in the privatisation of Argentine utilities. Chilectra is the second Chilean company to issue American depositary receipts (ADRs), the instrument through which foreign companies are able to sell equity in the US. Its success, following that of the trail-blazing Compania de Telefonos de Chile, may persuade other Chilean companies to tap the US capital markets to finance their expansion plans at home and abroad. The company said the ADR offering had been heavily oversubscribed and attracted interest not only in the US but also from institutional investors in Asia and Europe. The private placement was managed by JP Morgan, the US investment bank. Chilectra forms part of Enersis, a fast-growing group of private electricity companies whose profits last year topped 49bn pesos (Dollars 130m) - a 34 per cent return on assets. The Chilean company is particularly interested in bidding for Segba, Argentina's biggest utility, when it comes up for sale this year. Chilectra is talking to potential partners in the US, Spain and France on a possible joint bid.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Welsh regeneration to be funded by private sector, says Redwood Mr John Redwood, the Welsh secretary, told business leaders yesterday that in future most of the money for Welsh economic regeneration would come from the private sector. Increasing grants from the public sector paid directly to companies was not the best way to create new jobs, he said. 'The idea that Wales's economy is a vulgarised Keynes-by-the-sea, propped up grants on the pier and subsidies on the amusement arcades, is a myth which does not bear scrutiny.' In a keynote speech on economic development in Wales at the opening of the D'Arcy Business Park near Neath in south Wales, Mr Redwood said the principality was 'spinning out of recession in an impressive way'. It was leading in the attraction of new jobs and inward investment as well as the creation of more enterprises at home. Unemployment had fallen from 10.5 per cent to 9.6 per cent between December 1992 and July 1994, to the point where it was now in line with the UK average. But this had not been achieved on the back of government subsidies. Mr Redwood said grants had their place for three of the four factors which he regarded as the motors that power the Welsh economy - well-trained people, a decent supply of land and a good transport system. The fourth - access to money to do the job - he saw coming increasingly from the private sector. He conceded that some direct subsidies to companies had their uses. 'Grants are useful in encouraging footloose business to locate in more disadvantaged areas. It is for that reason that we offer them in parts of Wales. I have no plans to make further changes in the grant system. I am not about to threaten the most disadvantaged areas of Wales with the removal of their grants,' Mr Redwood said. But he added: 'Most of the money for Welsh regeneration will come from the private sector and will be channelled through a multitude of companies drawing on support from the financial markets and banks.'</p>

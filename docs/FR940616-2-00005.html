(PPSI). Aspen Environmental Group, a third-party contractor, under the direction of the CPUC, as the lead California State agency, and the USFS/ANF, as the lead Federal agency will prepare a draft and final EIS/SEIR to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 10, 1991, PPSI filed an Application with the CPUC for authorization to issue capital stock and other indebtedness to fund development of a proposed pipeline to transport offshore Santa Barbara crude oil to Los Angeles area refineries. At the same time, PPSI submitted a Proponent's Environmental Assessment (PEA) pursuant to the provisions of CEQA. The CPUC conducted comprehensive scoping meetings and solicited public and agency comments on the scope of the EIR. The CPUC selected a third party contractor (Aspen Environmental Group) to independently prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) pursuant to their responsibility as a lead agency under CEQA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project, as proposed at that time, was a 171-mile long, 20-inch insulated pipeline with a capacity to transport 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil. This originally proposed pipeline would have extended from Gaviota Marine Terminal in Santa Barbara County to oil refinery destinations in the Los Angeles Basin. The pipeline would have traversed across Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties, and enter Los Angeles County near Santa Clarita. For much of its length, the proposed pipeline would have been buried in the Southern Pacific Transportation Company railroad right-of-way (ROW). In Los Angeles County the pipeline would have continued southeasterly, mostly parallel to Interstate 5(I&hyph;5) to near Glendale and then south to Watts. At the Watts Junction the pipeline would have split into two pipelines, each leading to a refinery destination. One pipeline would continue to the Chevron Refinery in El Segundo, and the other would continue south to both Texaco's Wilmington refinery and the GATX oil distribution facility. This originally proposed project also included five pump/pressure reduction stations along its route. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A comprehensive EIR was prepared for this originally proposed project. Five workshops and five public hearings were conducted and significant public comments were received on the Draft EIR and incorporated into the Final document. In addition to the comprehensive EIR, an Executive Summary was prepared and made available to the public in both English and Spanish language versions. The Final EIR (FEIR) was Certified by the CPUC in 1993, indicating that in their view, the EIR had adequately identified the potential impacts of the Proposed Project and contained the information required for making their final decision on the project, which would be reached after conducting evidentiary hearings and upon the receipt of staff recommendations. However, due to project changes announced by PPSI after certification, evidentiary hearings were not held, nor was a decision made on the Proposed Project by the CPUC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In December of 1993, PPSI filed an Amended Application with the CPUC. Later, in early 1994, PPSI also filed this Amended Application with the ANF. This Amendment was based on an Agreement reached by major potential users of the Proposed Pipeline (Santa Barbara offshore producers) and the All American Pipeline Company (AAPL). The producers agreed that the only means of transporting their oil out of Santa Barbara County by pipeline will be through use of the existing AAPL, which can transport all produced oil in this area to Kern County, and ultimately, to Texas, if requested by producers. However, producers have informed agencies and the public that the preferred destination for the majority of their heavy offshore production is the Los Angeles area refineries. Currently there are no existing pipelines with adequate capacity to transfer crude oil from the Southern Kern County to the Los Angeles area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, PPSI proposed to modify their project to comply with recent agreements and respond to this demand. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Amendment filed with the ANF differs from the original proposal in the following manner: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;The origination point of the pipeline would be at an existing Texaco oil facility in Emidio, Kern County, an area adjacent to the All American Pipeline, which would enable the transfer of Santa Barbara offshore crude oil from the AAPL to the Pacific Pipeline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;From this origination point a proposed 20-inch pipeline segment will continue for 62 miles to Castaic Junction, at which point, it would join the originally proposed project as applied for by PPSI. The 62-mile pipeline ROW would be generally parallel to I&hyph;5, and will traverse through the National Forest System land administered by the ANF. This newly proposed 62 miles from Emidio to Castaic Junction would replace the 104 miles of previously proposed pipeline from the Gaviota Marine Terminal to the Castaic Junction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;The replacement of the previously proposed Gaviota to Castaic Junction pipeline with the new 62-mile pipeline would result in the following changes in ancillary facilities: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _five of the pump/pressure reduction stations required previously in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angles Counties would be replaced by three new pump/pressure reduction stations in Kern and Los Angeles Counties <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the proposed Control Center for the pipeline would be located in Taylor Yard (Los Angeles) instead of Ventura County, as originally proposed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> 0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;The Amendment also requires consideration of three additional refinery/terminal destinations in Los Angeles County (retaining the previous three destinations). These three destinations are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Unocal Refinery in Carson <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Chemoil Terminal in Carson <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Ultramar Refinery in Wilmington. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> These newly proposed destinations would require installations of an additional 3.3 miles of 16-inch pipeline that was not considered in the FEIR. Considering these additional connecting lines, the total length of the proposed pipeline would be approximately 132 miles (versus 171 miles for the originally Proposed Project). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Amended Application also refers to a future scenario in which Mobil would obtain a permit and would produce up to 40,000 bpd of oil at their Santa Barbara Clearview Project. The Applicant suggests that the previously proposed pipeline between Ellwood to Castaic Junction might be reconsidered for this potential scenario. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

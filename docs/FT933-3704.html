			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Bus drivers find route to fortune A SELECT group of bus drivers will make a profit of more than Pounds 100,000 each through the forthcoming flotation of Badgerline Group, the Avon-based company that has grown into one of the UK's biggest providers of local bus services. The company, which operates 2,300 buses and coaches in Midlands, south Wales and the south of England, will be floated on the stock market in November with an estimated value of Pounds 100m. The original 80 employees who took shares seven years ago when the company was created by a management led buy-out, have seen the value of their stake increase nearly a hundredfold. They will gain even more when the terms of the flotation are finalised, while some modestly paid middle managers will have shares worth more than Pounds 200,000. The company set out on its route to fortune in 1986 when a group of managers and employees succeeded with a Pounds 3m buy-out of Badgerline, the third of the National Bus Company's subsidiaries to be sold in the government's privatisation programme. A report by the National Audit Office said that one in four of the state-owned bus companies was sold for less than the value of its vehicles and properties. The price paid in the Badgerline buy-out, completed before deregulation of bus services, reflected the 'reasonable commercial risk' involved, said Mr Trevor Smallwood, its chairman.

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Insurers to challenge US verdict Insurers, including syndicates at Lloyd's of London, are to appeal against a Dollars 386.4m (Pounds 259.3m) punitive damages award made earlier this week by a Los Angeles jury in a product liability case. A Los Angeles state court awarded the damages to two subsidiaries of Amoco Corporation, the Chicago-based energy company, in what is one of the largest jury awards seen in the US this year. The award provides a reminder of the scale of the London insurance market's potential exposure to liability claims in the US. Lloyd's syndicates have already set aside hundreds of millions of dollars in reserves to pay claims resulting from asbestosis damage and pollution. These 'long-tail' claims - frequently affecting those policies originally underwritten up to 50 years ago - have contributed significantly to Lloyd's losses, which have amounted to Pounds 6.5bn over the past five years. In the Los Angeles case Amoco claimed that the insurers had wrongfully refused to pay for the defence and settlement of product liability lawsuits arising from the manufacture of irrigation and sewer pipes by an Amoco subsidiary in the 1970s. The punitive damages award follows a Dollars 39m compensatory damages award to Amoco on December 3. About 90 insurers, including insolvent subsidiaries of London United Investments as well as an estimated 50 Lloyd's syndicates, are affected by the award. Insurers described the court's verdict, which followed a five-week trial and more than four weeks of deliberations, as 'astonishing'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 9 June, Amnesty International asked the Albanian  attorney general for explanations of the arrests and  interrogations of six members of the Greek minority organization  Omonoia. The arrested people have been detained in Tirana  prisons for the past two months.    The international human rights organization is demanding to  know whether the six detainees had lawyers during the entire  period of their interrogation, particularly during the  questioning by interrogators.    According to Amnesty International, during the month of May  only one of the six detainees was visited by a lawyer, and no  lawyer was present during questioning. Finally, Amnesty  International expressed concern over reports it received that  when the six people were arrested the police searched the  Omonoia offices and houses of members of the Greek minority in  Gjirokaster, Delvine, and Sarande without search warrants.  There have also been reports that members of the Greek minority  were threatened by the police during interrogation about  possible contacts with these six arrested people.</p>

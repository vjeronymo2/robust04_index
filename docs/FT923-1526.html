			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Serb refugees suffer the full absurdities of civil war: Judy Dempsey reports from the Baranja in Croatia, where Serbs treat their fellow Serbs as pawns in a policy of ethnic cleansing MRS Stoya Ivcic is a 73-year-old Serb. She lives in Miokevicevo, a small, western Slavonian village in central Croatia. Before fighting started here a year ago between Serb irregulars, backed by the Yugoslav army, and Croatian forces, more than 35 per cent of the village was Serb. Today, few Serbs remain. Some were forced out by the Croats. Others were ordered out of the village by Serb nationalists and the army who sent them to neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina. But these innocent peasants, whose forebears had lived for centuries in this part of Croatia, found no peace in Bosnia when war started there earlier this year. They had little in common with the Bosnian Serbs and even if they wanted to return to Croatia, which is no longer at war, they would face intimidation and treatment as second class citizens. Their homes are likely to have been destroyed by the Croat authorities as a means of stopping Serbs from returning to Croatia. These peasants have thus become pawns in the Serb policy of colonising Serb-controlled regions of Croatia aimed at driving out non-Serbs. Over the past six weeks, Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia, have been transferred by the Serb authorities to the Baranja, a rich, agricultural region of north-eastern Croatia which Serb forces seized last year and made part of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Krajina. But even in the Baranja, which today is one of the three United Nations Protected Areas in Croatia, these poor peasant refugees have still to find a place to call their own. This is because the Serb administration there is determined to prevent Croatia from regaining this part of its northern territory: and it is just as determined to prevent Croatian and Bosnian ethnic Serb refugees from leaving the region. The means used to implement this two-pronged strategy is a law passed by the republic of Krajina in September 1991. This law stipulates that any Croats from the Baranja who fought on the Croatian side during the war no longer have the right to return. Moreover, Croats still living in Baranja whose relatives fought in the Croatian army no longer have the right to property, or work, in the Baranja. Local Serbs are also affected by the law: those who refused to join the Serbian forces have no right to return to the region. As a result, many of the 10,000 Serb refugees have been given jobs taken from the local Croat population, which now totals only 6,000; or jobs formerly held by Croats who either fled, or fought in the war and did not return. The latter's houses have been allocated to the refugees. The influx of refugees and the exodus of non-Serbs has radically changed the ethnic composition of the Baranja - to the advantage of Serbian extremists. Before the war, Serbs made up 25 per cent of the 54,000 strong population, and Croats 40 per cent. During the war, 25,000 Croats and Hungarians fled. Today, Serbs make up 70 per cent of the population, and are close to achieving their aim of an ethnically homogenous region. Serb refugees, who are afraid to speak out openly against the local Serb Baranja administration, want to return home, eventually. But they are prevented from leaving the Baranja. It is sealed by the Drava river on the west, the Danube on the east (which runs along the Serb-controlled province of Vojvodina), and a bridge which spans the Drava to the south. One end of the bridge is manned by UN troops and local Serb policemen; the other end, only by the Serbs. Every one needs a pass to enter and leave the region. In short, the refugees have become virtual prisoners in the Baranja. This policy of colonisation has created tensions between the Serb refugees, local Serbs, the local non-Serb population, and the Croatian government. The Serb refugees want to leave. Work is scarce, and besides, they have no roots. The local Serbs want the United Nations to leave so that they can expel the remaining non-Serbs. The non-Serb population, already denied their rights, want the UN to protect them, get their jobs and homes back, and live in peace. Meanwhile, the Croatian government want all Croat refugees allowed back into the Baranja as a means of regaining control over the region. But the likelihood of any group achieving their goals peacefully are as remote as the guns falling silent in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina, or Mrs Ivcic ever seeing her Serb neighbours again.

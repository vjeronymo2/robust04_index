			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Burns-Anderson offshoot in buy-out plan The management of Burns-Anderson Independent Network, a 75.1 per cent owned subsidiary of Burns-Anderson Group, the recruitment and financial services operation that went into administration receivership two weeks ago, is staging a buy-out. Agreement in principle has been reached with Touche Ross, the administrators. Burns-Anderson Independent Network, the third largest network of financial advisers in the country, is financially ring-fenced from its parent. It owns 24.9 per cent of the capital and is putting together a deal to buy out the rest. Mr Alan Taylor, managing director of the network, which has 375 individually registered members with Fimbra, the self-regulatory organisation, said he was hopeful the price would be satisfactory to all parties. The network made pre-tax profits of Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000 in 1991 on turnover of Pounds 13m to Pounds 14m. Investors Planning Associates, another company in the Burns-Anderson stable, said it, too, was putting together a management buy-out. 'We're fed up with people owning us who did nothing for us,' the company said. IPA, which has 57 Fimbra-registered individuals, said pre-tax profits amounted to less than Pounds 100,000 in 1991 on turnover of Pounds 2.4m.</p>

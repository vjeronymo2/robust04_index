			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (3): Armed forces hold the key - Suharto tightens his grip but time is against him PRESIDENT Suharto's election to a sixth five-year term of office last March came as no surprise. Not only was he the sole candidate for the post, backed by both opposition parties and the ruling Golkar party, he also had a direct say in appointing more than half the 1,000-member electoral college. Instead, Mr Suharto saved the surprises for the cabinet reshuffle. Out went 20 of his 35 ministers including the three leading economic ministers, the home affairs minister and the minister of defence. It is too early to pass judgment on the new cabinet but Mr Suharto appears to have further tightened his already strong grip on the country's political affairs. Looking to the past, the depth of his personal power has ensured political stability and provided the environment for economic growth. Facing up to the future, with Mr Suharto turning 72 next month and no clear successor in sight, doubts are increasing over whether a smooth transition to the post-Suharto era can be achieved. Much will depend on the armed forces (known by their Indonesian acronym Abri), which enjoy a fifth of the seats in the national assembly and have a political role enshrined in the constitution. Abri is seen by the business community as a source of stability. 'The smooth transition from the old generation military leaders to the new generation is complete,' says the head of one Indonesian conglomerate. But Abri does not always act as a homogeneous force; and certain groupings within Abri may not see eye-to-eye with Mr Suharto over who should be the next president. The depth of Mr Suharto's personal power ensures the political scene remains a mostly closed affair and the tensions within government rarely break through a veil of obfuscation. A decision, however, by Abri to nominate General Try Sutrisno, armed forces commander until early this year, for vice-president several weeks before the March election caused a stir. Many Indonesians interpreted the move as a way of manoeuvering Mr Suharto into a corner and avoiding a recurrence of the 1988 election when Mr Suharto nominated State Minister Sudharmono, a trusted legal adviser, against the wishes of several Abri officers. Whilst Gen Sutrisno is a former personal aide to Mr Suharto, the latter may not wish him to be the next president. As one western diplomat explained, Gen Sutrisno is 'surrounded by Abri and dominated by them. He's not a particularly strong man.' Political opponents say Mr Suharto has already exacted retribution on Abri by removing General Benny Murdani - previously seen as an important counter-balance to the president - as defence minister and reducing the number of military officers in the cabinet. General Edi Sudrajat, recently appointed Abri commander, and General Ida Bagus Sudjana, the new oil minister, are 'regarded by Abri as their only real representatives in the cabinet,' notes a diplomat. Abri is now pushing to retain its influence by having an officer head the ruling Golkar party. Mr Suharto, himself a former general, has been promoting within Abri officers more to his liking - a military background and Islam as a religion are almost certain pre-requisites for the next president. At the top of the list is General Wismoyo Arismunandar, the army chief who has the added benefit of being Mr Suharto's brother-in-law. But Gen Arismunandar is thought to have a weak power-base within Abri, perhaps because of his first-family connection, and is regarded by many officers as a soldier-politician. The concern of some Abri officers is that Mr Suharto's choice of successor will be made on the narrow grounds of who will best protect his family after he has gone. Should he harbour any desire to step down, Mr Suharto's influence over his possible replacement remains strong. For instance, if Mr Suharto were to stand for a seventh term of office in 1998, push through his nomination as vice-president and retire shortly after, his favoured candidate would automatically assume the presidency. The likelihood is that Mr Suharto and senior officers will negotiate a compromise and a smooth transition will follow, although, as the regime's opponents point out, this assumes popular support for such a deal. While there is very little open political dissent - the United Development and Indonesian Democratic opposition parties usually support the government to maintain political consensus - the few dissidents who do speak out hold strong views. 'If Sukarno breached the constitution in one act (by being elected president for life), Suharto has done it in installments,' says a dissident from his musty Jakarta office. Mr Suharto's critics fear that he may override his better judgment in his determination to leave an indelible legacy by moving towards a more nationalistic - and risky - economic policy. Mr Suharto's March reshuffle of the cabinet - removing three economic ministers - strengthened the hand of Mr BJ Habibie, the energetic minister for research and technology, who backs a policy of nurturing industries such as aircraft manufacturing, shipbuilding and weaponry. Supporting these industries treads a fine line between costing Indonesia dear and accelerating industrial development. Donors say funding to state-owned high-technology industries is running at about Dollars 1.5bn a year, a figure unlikely to decrease if plans such as the construction of 12 nuclear power stations are pushed through. Mr Suharto's supporters say the president will back Mr Habibie but not to the detriment of the economy. They say controlling inflation, keeping a balanced budget and limiting offshore borrowing are guiding factors for Mr Suharto in setting his political agenda. Such is the business of maintaining the status quo in Indonesia. Extending the status quo, however, to beyond his own reign will be Mr Suharto's toughest task. Accommodating the interests of the Indonesian populace, satisfying the demands of Abri officers and providing for the future wellbeing of his family could stretch the president's political skills to the full.</p>

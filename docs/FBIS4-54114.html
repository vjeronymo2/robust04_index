			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kim Tong-song, Professor of Economics at the </F> School of Political Economics, Chungang University: "New  Horizon for ROK Diplomacy--ROK-China-Japan Three-Way  Diplomacy"]    [Excerpts] Currently a strong whirlwind of "challenge and  opportunity" is rising over Northeast Asia. This whirlwind,  coinciding with the process of building new post-cold war world  order, is being generated by the discord and friction between  opposing cultures as China, Japan, and the ROK try to weld  themselves into a Northeast Asian sphere of influence so that  it may become the center of international order in the 21st  century, replacing the United States and Europe.    On the other hand, the ROK, China, and Japan are each  looking  to secure a position of regional hegemony by taking advantage  of the changes in the outside world, and trying to find ways to  adapt themselves to these changes. Their ambitions are giving  rise to recurring whirlwinds in this region. At the moment,  their ambitions are hidden behind these whirlwinds. There is  no telling how soon, or in what form the effects will be felt.    It is precisely because of these changes that the civilian  government in South Korea has begun to talk about improving the  nation's competitive strength, begun to attach more weight to  internationalization, and started to advocate a "new  diplomacy." In the short term we need to continue to further  our pragmatic national security and economic interests as much  as possible in the interest of existing cooperative relations  with the United States, China, and Japan. In the mid to long  term, we need to lay, by our own effort, the national foundation  that will enable us to increase our influence in the new  international order and seek future prosperity. This makes it  all the more imperative for us to clearly perceive the given  "opportunity and challenge" and work out an independent  strategy for the future.    President Kim Yong-sam's scheduled visit to Japan and China  for summit meetings with their leaders is coming at a  historical moment when the prevailing international political  situation gives hope and opportunity despite its uncertainties  and uneasiness. The coming trip could stop at making us feel  keenly about the difficult "challenge" posed by the outside  environment, or serve as an "opportunity" to take advantage of  the uncertain international environment. Needless to say, what  all of us want is successful fulfillment of this opportunity.  This fulfillment requires an overall change in thinking on the  perceptual as well strategic planes with regard to the idea of  "the ROK-China-Japan triangular alignment."    From the ROK point of view, the triangular relationship of  the ROK, China, and Japan has roughly two aspects. One aspect  is the existing status quo-oriented pattern of cooperating with  China and Japan to promote ROK-Japan economic cooperation and  ROK-China exchanges from the standpoint of seeking our national  interests while maintaining the ROK- U.S. alliance and  friendship as the immutable axle. Under this pattern, our goal  in the ROK-Japan relationship will be the correction of the  trade imbalance, the acceleration of technology transfers, the  promotion of friendship on the government and private levels,  and the respect of Japan for the status of the ROK and its  people.    In ROK-China relations, our main goal will be the expansion  of trade, the strengthening of government-level cooperation for  the expansion of industrial cooperation, the promotion of  private-level investments, and the acceleration of cooperation  in the diverse areas of technology and management. Short-term  reality makes the promotion of such cooperation essential, and  this cooperation is realizable. However, this course separates  the economy from security, and it does not mean that we  ourselves will engineer the structural change in the future  international order.    Another aspect of the triple relationship is that this  relationship means a new forward-looking alignment with an eye  into the 21st century. It relates to the questions of what  independent method the ROK would use to bring China and Japan  together and what strategic position the ROK would take in the  event, for instance; the security environment on the Korean  Peninsula should change, accompanied by the revamping of the  international order in Northeast Asia. The international order  is a result of the rivalry and discord between the United  Stats, China, and Japan.    To be more specific, let us assume that the United States  and  North Korea will have better foreign relations and cooperative  ties with each other, Japan and North Korea will establish  diplomatic relations, Japan will pursue an independent line  divorcing itself from the U.S.-Japan security arrangement and  alliance, China will begin to assert its role as a mediator in  military security in North East Asia, and Russia will propose  to form a military alliance with any one country. This is a  scenario that was hardly imaginable in the past. However, the  problem is that the scenario is gradually approaching the realm  of reality and it may become reality in the near future. The  ROK-China-Japan triple alignment, that may emerge in the course  of structural revamping of the international order in Northeast  Asia, is bound to be radically different from the existing  status quo-oriented bilateral form of cooperative relations  currently perceived and being applied by these countries.    The difficulty in finding the direction for the development  of the ROK- China-Japan triangular relationship lies in the  necessity of considering not only short-term pragmatic  objectives but also longterm goals. In view of the unsettled  issue of North Korea's nuclear facilities, as well as the  current North Korean economic condition and the attendant  uncertainty in the security environment on the Korean  Peninsula, it is very clear that the arrangement of the ROK-  U.S. alliance will continue to prove effective. Considering the  worldwide economic recession and the current economic situation  in our country, we cannot neglect in the least our efforts to  accelerate normal ROK-China economic exchanges and ROK-Japan  economic cooperation in order to secure our country's  competitiveness necessary for the continued buildup of national  strength and future national development.    However, dealings between states are one thing and  transactions between private firms are another. In dealings  between states there are many aspects that cannot be measured  in terms of monetary value. For instance, problems such as  those involving national sovereignty, nationalism and national  sentiments, the legitimacy and efficiency of the government,  and the quality of the leadership are delicate problems in  dealings between states. They have direct bearing on the future  of bilateral or multilateral relations. From our point of view,  the ROK-China-Japan triangular relationship is a matter that we  need to handle by looking ten, twenty, or one-hundred years  ahead.    If we are to chase two hares at the same time, namely, the  pursuit of short-term national interests and the search for a  forward-looking scheme of cooperation, it is imperative to  change our way of thinking in establishing our foreign  policies. The first requirement is to free ourselves from the  conventional strategic view with which we have continued our  "subservient diplomacy." In the period of the Sixth Republic  our government advocated partnership relations with, and  independent diplomacy toward, the United States as its goal.  However, the "pragmatic view"--the view that security  cooperation from the supposedly honest-minded hegemonic power  is essential--still persists true to the age-old convention of  subservient diplomacy, coupled with the alarm against the  danger of invasion from North Korea.    Admittedly, our policies "in the style of subservient  diplomacy" have greatly contributed to our national security in  some aspects. However, a policy of dependence on foreign powers  or a policy of inviting in foreign powers will be no longer  helpful in turning our international environment to our  advantage in the future; rather it will only serve as a  structural impediment to the pace of our development.    Arguments about the rise and fall of U.S influence in  Northeast Asian countries are intensifying as we move into the  mid-1990's. To state my conclusion on the basis of many of these  arguments, neither the United States, China, or Japan will be  able to secure a hegemonic position in Northeast Asia. The  reason is this: Ironically, all three have the ambition and  potential to maintain hegemonism, and as a consequence, they  will keep an eye on one another and try to hold one another in  check. Accordingly, the international order in Northeast Asia  is bound to continue for the time being in the form of  maintaining the conventional balance of power by tacit  multilateral agreement.    This situation offers the ROK the best opportunity to play  an  active role as a balancer in maintaining the balance of power.  Under the circumstances in which the balance of power is  actively at work, the economic and cultural competition among  states will be a dominant factor in international politics, and  countries with an eye toward the future will make every effort  to consolidate their national foundations under the balance of  power. At the same time, diverse forms of multilateral  arrangements and dialogues will be developed actively through  various channels. That is why we must make preparations now for  that future.    What position will the United States, China, and Japan take  under this new international order? Needless to say, the  international order in Northeast Asia will for the time being,  be characterized by the influence and role of the United  States, the military superpower. However, the current condition  of the United States, its foreign policy, and its recent moves  suggest that "the time being" will not be too long.    Although the U.S. economy is on the way to recovery, the  United States incurs a trade imbalance each year of nearly $100  trillion and a fiscal deficit of $300 to $400 trillion.  Accordingly, the curtailment of defense expenditure would not  be completed in a short period of time (the defense cost may be  reduced from 5 percent to 3 percent of the GNP for the next 10  years); and the reduction of U.S. forces in this region will  become inevitable as the scale of reduction in the defense cost  is to be expanded to the Pacific region from Europe. Already 2  years ago Holbrook, then U.S. assistant secretary for  Asia-Pacific affairs, predicted that "U.S. troops will withdraw  from Asia within 10 years."    President Clinton advocated a "new Pacific community" during  his visit to Korea and Japan last year. Presiding over the APEC  summit that took place subsequently, he admitted that the way  out for the U.S. economy depends on the Asia-Pacific region in  general and Northeast Asia in particular. More recently, he  began to apply trade pressures by invoking Super 301. He has  began to use the human rights issue as a diplomatic trump card  against China. In the future the United States will enter  willy-nilly into relations of competition and rivalry in  Northeast Asia rather than keep on offering concessions and  cooperation to China, Japan, and the ROK.    Under these circumstances, what outlook will Japan hold for  the future? Up till now since its defeat in World War II, Japan  has been able to concentrate on economic reconstruction thanks  to the U.S.-Japan alliance. For the time being Japan will seek  to promote stability and national interests while supporting  the U.S. leadership in the international community. However,  Japan's economic power has already reached the point where it  is threatening to the U.S. leadership. The current deteriorated  economic situation in Japan is prompting some critics to  predict a very negative outlook for Japan. But the argument  that Japan will surpass the United States in the 2000's is  gaining ground. If Japan continues to allocate 1 percent of its  GNP for its defense expenditure, Japan will have an edge over  the United States in the Asia-Pacific region in terms of  military expenditure in the early part of the 21st century.  [passage omitted]    The problem involves the changes that will take place in the  future in conjunction with the economic dispute between the  United States and Japan, the territorial dispute between Russia  and Japan, and the multilateral territorial dispute over the  South sea Islands. Amid these changes, voices will mount in  Japan demanding for an independent position in security, foreign  relations, and economy and calling for the status of a  political-military superpower, and this will be a major  uncertainty factor in Japanese domestic politics.    Therefore, from the ROK's point of view, it should be able  to  lead the way in devising some ways to eliminate Japan's  uncertainty. As a matter of fact, the ROK is not in a position  to maintain a military strength superior to that of Japan nor  to surpass Japan in national strength. This is why the ROK will  have no choice but to exert efforts to work out a diplomatic  strategy designed to take advantage of the peculiarities of  international relationships in Northeast Asia instead of trying  to deal with developments in this region in an emotional way.    In the economic field, Japan has already laid the groundwork  for exercising its influence in the Southeast Asian region by  providing economic development funds for and making direct  investments in that region. Japan is also shifting the focus of  its industrial and trade policy from Europe and the United  States to East Asia. The ROK should be able to deal with and  take advantage of this strategy.    China was a sleeping lion for the past 100 years or more  under the domination of Western material culture. But awake  from its long sleep, China is now building its body and  sharpening its nails, determined to restore its grand posture  as "the center of the universe." Since China adopted a reform  and opening policy in the late 1970's in conformity with the  Deng Xiaoping line, it has recorded marvelous economic growth.  It achieved an annual GNP growth rate of 9.4 percent in the  1980's, and entering the 1990's it has recorded an annual growth  rate of over 10 percent despite the worldwide economic  recession. The volume of its commodity exports is also  increasing at an annual rate of 12.4 percent. [passage omitted]    Under an economic strategy seeking trade with the Western  world and inducing investments from the outside world, China  has pursued an economic policy "centering on the coastal  region." The greatest problem China is facing now is the  appalling gap between its coastal areas and the interior  resulting from this policy. In the Chinese economic structure,  foreign trade now accounts for more than 30 percent of the GNP.  That is why China cannot but be susceptible to changes in the  external environment.    From a mid-long term point of view, China is faced with the  serious limitations inherent in "the socialist market economy."  It is maintaining an iron-clad rule dominated by the communist  party while pursuing a capitalist economic development  strategy. The ideal of "equality" in income and distribution is  gradually becoming passe. There is no telling when another  democracy or liberalization movement will break out.    Nevertheless China's continuing rapid economic growth is  having a tremendous influence on the process of establishing a  new order in Northeast Asia. China began reducing its military  strength in the 1980's, but entering the 1990's it began to add  spurs to defense modernization by continually increasing its  defense outlays.    China is particularly trying to develop, deploy, and sell  high-tech weapons by using its military-industrial complex.  Recently China has been found to be receiving various types of  high-tech weapons and military technologies from Russia. As a  result of the effort to rebuild its backward navy, many foreign  observers maintain that the Chinese program for building an  "oceangoing navy" is now getting into gear.    China contends that its defense modernization is for  defensive purposes and it is no match for the United States or  Japan. Yet China seems to believe that national strength not  backed by military strength is hollow. One should see that  behind its naval buildup is its intention to cope with the  territorial dispute in the South China Sea on the one hand, and  on the other hand to fill the power vacuum created by the U.S.  withdrawal from Subic Bay and the weakened strength of the  former Soviet Union's Far East Fleet. However, the ultimate  goal of China's military buildup policy will be to counter the  U.S.- Japan policy of maintaining a military balance in Asia.    Speaking of China's waxing economic influence in Asia, China  is seeking to form an economic union called "the Zhonghua  economic zone" by bringing together overseas Chinese in Hong  Kong, Taiwan, and ASEAN countries. This raises the possibility  that China will face diverse competition with Japan, which  seeks to expand its economic influence in the Southeast Asian  region.    Needless to say, considering the distinct gap between China  and Japan in the levels of economic development, capital, and  manpower, there will be a complex mixture of competition and  cooperation as far as Asia is concerned. Accordingly, China  will have no choice but to give weight to its economic  cooperation with the ROK for the sake of countering Japan's  leading position and for the sake of its own economic  development.    China is ahead of the ROK in the fields of basic science and  technology, but it is trailing the ROK in the commercialization  of technologies. That is why China needs the ROK industrial  system which has low capital-intensive features. China will  also continually desire ROK participation in the economic  development of the Chinese northeastern region. Therefore, the  ROK should be able to take advantage of these diverse needs of  China.    There are roughly two points that can be ascertained by the  reality in the United States, China, and Japan and through a  prognostication of their outlook for the future. One is that  China and Japan will be recognized before long as world  superpowers in all aspects--diplomatic, economic, and military,  if the current pace of development should continue. However,  viewed from the pragmatic point of view of forming a new order  in Northeast Asia, if Japan and China should seek to gain a  superior position against each other or seek regional  hegemonism, it would invite direct check intervention by  neighboring countries, aggravating the international discord.    The other point is that the ROK will be able to play the  role  of a balancer to maintain the balance of power in Northeast  Asia, and by taking advantage of this position, to maximize its  practical benefits as an intermediary. Needless to say, this  optimistic view is based on the assumption that the  relationship between North and South Korea will improve to the  extent that the ROK may no longer be fettered by its North  Korea policy. This assumption may well become a reality because  the current political and economic condition in North Korea and  the international environment will compel North Korea to behave  reasonably.    If the above analysis is acceptable, our foreign policy  option should be directed at bringing the Sino-Japanese  relationship into our forward-looking strategy. To work out a  new "ROK-China-Japan alignment," a shift to a "policy of active  involvement" is needed. This is to say that we should do away  with the past foreign policy of inviting in foreign powers.    The ROK can no longer be content with playing its role as a  trumpeter of the U.S.-Asia policy. It should stand in the van  of anti-hegemonism as the balancer of power in Northeast Asia.  It should play an active role as arbiter of "positive peace"  for peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia. To play this new  role, it is imperative for the ROK to formulate its own foreign  policy principles and for our people to have self-pride and  stand ready to share as widely as possible whatever short term  losses they may incur from abiding by these principles.    In international politics in Northeast Asia, the ROK should  seek to form the framework of the "ROK-China-Japan triangular  alignment" in such a way as to play its role as an arbitrator  of international disputes, as a contact point for international  interests, and as a mediator of international competition. To  this end, our country should forge relationships of unswerving  trust with other countries at the leadership and organizational  levels. It is essential to pursue many-sided diplomacy by  expanding the channels of private-level diplomacy.    With Kim Yong-sam's forthcoming visit to China and Japan as  momentum, ROK-China and ROK-Japan economic cooperation is  expected to accelerate. In the interest of this acceleration,  our country is expected to exert efforts to make legal and  structural improvements on the administrative level and expand  methods of cooperation. On the basis of the successes that  will be made in these efforts, the ROK should search for a more  farsighted creative framework of economic exchange and mutual  cooperation with China and Japan. What we need to do is map out  a strategy for making investments in areas where we can  exercise definite influence on some sectors of the Chinese and  Japanese economies and forge the kind of mutual economic  relationship by which we can get a grip on the weak links in  the Japanese and Chinese economies, and on the other, to boldly  invest our resources for the implementation of this strategy.

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Council Elections: Liberal Democrats prove capacity to surprise THE LIBERAL Democrats proved once again last night their capacity to surprise by out-performing the party's national opinion poll rating and confounding gloomy predictions about its local election campaign. As results came in last night, Liberal Democrat strategists sipped champagne and rapidly revised projections of net losses for the party on seats it won in 1987. Party officials congratulated themselves on making substantial net gains after a campaign dominated by clashes on national issues between Labour and the Conservatives. Projections based on early results suggested the Liberal Democrats were winning, perhaps, more than 20 per cent of the vote - compared with recent opinion polls putting the party on about 14 or 15 per cent. Early this morning the party was exceeding Labour in terms of net gains of seats. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, was able to claim vindication for his strategy of concentrating efforts and resources in target areas - notably Gosport, Hampshire, and Eastbourne, East Sussex, where the party notched early victories. He was also able to claim, with some justification, that in large areas of southern England, the Liberal Democrats, were the only challengers to the Tories. By taking control of - among others - Lewes in East Sussex, North Wiltshire, North Devon, and Torbay in Devon the party more than fulfilled its promise to increase its 'power and influence' where it already had a strong base. 'The Liberal Democrats are the clear winners tonight,' Mr Ashdown said. 'Where the Tories have to be beaten the Liberal Democrats are the clear and powerful challengers.' The party's campaign was deliberately different to Labour and the Tories, concentrating on local issues and the party's strength at 'grassroots' politics. The results further cemented the bonds between the old Liberal party and the Social Democrat party which formed the Liberal Democrats after the last general election. Last year's local election results, where the party won about 16 per cent of the vote, encouraged hopes that the damaging rifts at the time the merger had been overcome. The Eastbourne by-election, followed soon after by success in Ribble Valley, brought further cheer. Last night's results suggest that period can be relegated to the history books. They will also encourage Mr Ashdown in his strategy of looking for a gradual strengthening in his party's standing - rather than hoping for a frothy dash for growth. Officials said the party had also made impressive gains in areas of the country where it had not focused efforts. What the Liberal Democrat party still has to prove is that it can displace Labour as the main challenger to the Tories in more than a handful of seats in the midlands and north England.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> TROUBLED STUDENTS HAVE SPECIAL CLASSES  </P> <P> Ten La Habra students in grades three through eight are attending special  classes through an experimental program to help troubled young people stay in  school.  </P> <P> The La Habra City School District started the program in September for students  whose behavioral problems were so severe that changing classes, and sometimes  even changing school districts, did not help.  </P> <P> "These kids aren't different from other kids except that they've made some bad  choices," said Barry Beckman, teacher of the district's "Opportunity Classes."  </P> <P> "They're still kids with a lot of the same concerns that every other young  teen-ager has."  </P> <P> Three of the 10 students have had problems with the law and are on probation,  he said.  </P> <P> "Those students tend to be a little easier to work with because they have to go  to school as a condition of probation, and if they violate they go back into  detention, and they don't want that," Beckman said.  </P> <P> District officials, citing privacy laws, declined to allow students in the  program to be interviewed.  </P> <P> Students are required to remain in the program for a minimum of six weeks. They  attend either a morning or afternoon class, and must stay home for the balance  of each school day. Beckman makes spot telephone calls and home visits to make  sure the students stay at home when they are assigned to be there.  </P> <P> The program can handle only 12 students because they tend to misbehave around  large groups, Beckman said.  </P> <P> "Because of group dynamics, they can't handle peer pressure," he said. "They  can't handle peers in general."  </P> <P> The goal of the program is to prepare the children for a return to the regular  classroom. Of the original 10 students, nine are still in the special classes  and one has returned to a regular classroom.  </P> <P> School board President Antonio Valle Jr. is a supporter of the classes.  </P> <P> "It's an important program, and we're hopeful that it will be successful and  provide help to a group of students who really need help," Valle said.

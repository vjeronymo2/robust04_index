			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Anger at use of retired signallers The RMT transport union last night accused Railtrack of employing a 'Dad's Army' of retired signalling staff in its efforts to break the 11-week-old rail strike. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said Railtrack planned to employ a retired inspector at Birmingham New Street next Tuesday and had approached other retired staff in a move which posed a threat to the safety of the railway network. He said: 'This issue raises serious safety questions. I assume any retired staff will be medically examined as well as re-examined in rules and regulations. How large this Dad's Army of former signalmen is remains to be seen but I shall be writing to the chief inspecting officer of railways.' Railtrack confirmed that it had signed up one recently retired signalling manager who had taken early retirement in his mid-50s. It was looking to re-employ retired staff in their fifties and not people past the retirement age of 65. Railtrack said: 'These are very senior people with very valuable experience who would be very offended to be described as a Dad's Army. It is nonsense to suggest we are employing 65-year olds.' As well as retired staff Railtrack is expected to start using seconded British Rail staff in its signal boxes during the planned 48-hour strike on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. BR said earlier that it was inviting staff with signalling experience to help out, although the numbers involved would be only about 100 at the most. BR said it was unable to give numbers of those who had responded to its call but some would start next week. Mr Knapp yesterday urged Railtrack to return to negotiations about its claim for a payment in recognition of past productivity improvements. He said if Railtrack was worried about the reaction of the government to any settlement he would be ready to help explain the deal to the transport secretary.</p>

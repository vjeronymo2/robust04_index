			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Occupation Is the Cause"] </F>   [Text] Israel quaked again for the second time in less than  a week as a result of the Hadera operation carried out in the  heart of the Zionist entity near Tel Aviv. This proves that  through measures of repression, terrorism, and siege, the  Israeli occupation forces cannot guarantee security and  stability in the 1967 occupied territories or in the 1948  territories. This shows Israel's propaganda that its plans and  proposals can guarantee the achievement of peace is mere  illusion and imagination. Israel is reaping the results and  effects of its policy of continued occupation. It is reaping  what it has planted in lies, delusions, and claims. All these  confirm that partial agreements and separate deals cannot make  peace or lead to security and peace, but to further disturbances  and confusion, and to the escalation of violence and bloodshed.  Developments and facts in the occupied territories prove Israel  has fallen into the impasse of fragile and destructive  settlements. It caused the situation to explode due to its  adherence to occupation and disregard of the just and  comprehensive solution, and as a result of its maneuverings and  delusions to circumvent the resolutions of international  legitimacy.    Certainly, the situation can expect to see additional grave  dangers and damaging repercussions if Israel continues its  repressive and terroristic policy, and its rejection of the  pillars of a just and comprehensive peace. This is because  occupation, or any part of it, is the problem. In fact, it is  the major obstacle to achieving security and stability in the  region. Undoubtedly, the full removal of the occupation of the  Arab territories in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jerusalem,  southern Lebanon, and Golan, is the true ground for an  honorable, lasting, and successful peace. As long as Israel  continues to avoid this, it will be responsible for the cycle of  violence, and for the anger, indignation, and explosions in the  occupied Arab territories. These are impossible to bridle or  stop by continuing the occupation.    Had Israel been really concerned about security and  stability, it would have immediately managed to learn from and  to comprehend what is taking place by announcing it is ready to  withdraw from the occupied Arab territories, to respond  positively to the requirements of a just and comprehensive  peace, and to abide by the resolutions of international  legitimacy, the Madrid formula and principles, particularly the  land-for-peace principle. However, instead of doing so, it  maneuvered, cheated, and did its best to drag the Palestinian  side into making further concessions leading to partial  agreements and separate secret deals. The result of this was  that the Oslo agreement's repercussions, and threats to and  relinquishment of the Palestinian people's rights have reflected  negatively not only on the Palestinians who signed the  agreement, but also on Israel itself. This is because the  Palestinian people discovered in this agreement full  relinquishment of their national, legitimate, and political  rights, flagrant violation of their just demands, and full  liquidation of their cause, for the sake of which they have been  waging a struggle so it will continue to live as a cause of a  people striving for liberation and salvation from the yoke of  occupation, and for living in peace, security, and stability.    Therefore, under no circumstances should one ask the victim  to ignore its killer. After all these sacrifices and  confrontations, the Palestinian people should not submit or  yield to capitulatory deals, or accept the continuation of  occupation. The fact is that all parties have participated in  the peace process knowing it is comprehensive. Otherwise, the  Madrid conference would not have been convened. So, we should  go back to the bases of the Madrid formula, to facts that have  become axioms, and to established facts stressing the need for a  just and comprehensive peace, especially since this is the only  means to prevent disturbances, end setbacks, catastrophes and  tragedies, uproot the manifestations of violence and  counteractions, and the causes of terrorism, repression, siege,  and Israeli occupation.</p>

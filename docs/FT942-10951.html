			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A will that isn't specific I would like to make a will along the following lines: My estate to be disposed of by X (or by X and Y, if two are required) with the request (not binding) that such disposal be made in accord with my known wishes and any letters which I may leave. I would want it drawn in such a way that any disposals to charity would be IHT-exempt, just as they would be if made as direct bequests under the will. Is it possible to do this? I have just been told by my local solicitor that it isn't and that I must be specific regarding disposal of my estate. I tend to agree with the local solicitor. It is always possible to leave your estate in a discretionary trust with powers for the trustee and executors to distribute it in accordance with a separate letter of wishes. But I cannot see why, if you know already how you wish to leave your estate, you should not write this into your will. This provides a lot more certainty  -and you can always write a new will if you change your mind. (Barry Stillerman).

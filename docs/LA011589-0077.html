			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAM HALL KAPLAN: DESIGN AWARDS HAVE SOME VALUE  </P> <P> Few weeks go by in the design community without some sort of an award program  or other. Last week, it was the chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts  traveling to Pasadena to hand out the Presidential Awards for Design Excellence  to regional winners, having already announced the awards a few months ago at  ceremonies in Washington.  </P> <P> This week Progressive Architecture (PA) magazine is scheduled to disclose the  winners of its coveted annual awards program in the categories of architectural  design, urban design and planning, and applied research, with California  practitioners as usual expected to garner more than their share.  </P> <P> Bestowing honors in December was the Society of American Registered Architects,  the Southern California chapter of the American Society of Landscape  Architects, and Architectural Record magazine, the latter in a new, highly  touted awards program entitled "In the Public Interest."  </P> <P> And scheduled over the next few months are the awards ceremonies of the San  Fernando Valley and California chapters, among others, of the American  Institute of Architects, culminating with the institute's national awards in  May. Also on tap is the bi-annual Rudy Brunner Award for Urban Excellence and  the tri-annual Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The list goes on and on.  </P> <P> I have generally viewed many of the awards programs with a certain reticence.  Too often, juries have appeared predisposed and doctrinaire, influenced by peer  pressure, passing fads, flashy photography, and heavily promoted personalities  easily identified by signature styles. (Except sometimes to the embarrassment  of the juries, it is hard to tell the masters from the mimics.) Such self  congratulatory exercises can become a bore.  </P> <P> Still, I have found most awards programs to be of value, presenting as they do  glimpses of the shifting styles and prejudices of the design profession in  select geographic areas and project categories. When sitting at the design  table it is instructive to know what deck the players are dealing from, and if  jokers are wild.  </P> <P> And occasionally gems are uncovered. This usually happens when juries in fits  of independent intelligence judge submissions based on a critical matrix of  substantive architectural issues, such as social, contextual and structure,  instead of trying to pigeonhole them according to the shifting superficial  styles sanctified by a Charles Jencks, a Robert A.M. Stern, or a similar  pedant.  </P> <P> Award programs also have the potential when properly focused, conducted and  publicized to heighten public and professional awareness of the potential of  good design. In addition, by honoring such efforts others involved in a  particular design process might be encouraged to emulate them.  </P> <P> Given this potential, and the general low level of publicly funded design, I  feel the Presidential Awards program deserves special mention. Presented every  four years, the program honors designs in a variety of federally sponsored  projects, including architecture, landscape design, planning and historic  preservation.  </P> <P> Topping the Design Excellence list was the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the  Washington Mall, including both the expressive, intersecting black granite  walls designed by Maya Ying Lin, and the accompanying realistic sculpture of  three soldiers by Frederick Hart.  </P> <P> Other winners included the urban design of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington,  the planning of a transit project in Boston, and the engineering of a bridge in  Florida. (Of the 10 top awards, only one -- in Arkansas -- was west of the  Mississippi, indicating once again what I feel is a distinct East Coast  prejudice of Washington-based programs. But that is another topic for another  time.)  </P> <P> Locally, one of the 68 national Achievement Awards went to the adaptive reuse  of the former hotel overlooking the Arroyo Seco south of Colorado Boulevard as  a federal court and office building. Architects for the imaginative effort that  preserved the landmark was the Pasadena firm of Neptune &amp; Thomas  Associates.  </P> <P> Also winning an Achievement Award was the renovation of a dated, deteriorated  bungalow at 2303 Fifth St. in the Ocean Park area of Santa Monica into a  desirable apartment complex. It was accomplished by the determined non-profit  Community Corp. of Santa Monica and the resourceful architecture of the local  firm of Fondi-Bonardi &amp; Associates.  </P> <P> In bestowing a bevy of awards, the jury for the Southern California chapter of  the American Society of Landscape Architects made the provocative point that  the profession's focus was in flux. It declared that "while the variety of  projects receiving awards reflected the landscape architect's broad ability to  successfully design for any location, the real challenge is to create more  'livable' urban spaces designed with people in mind."  </P> <P> To illustrate its point, the jury gave an Award of Excellence to the Santa  Monica firm of Campbell &amp; Campbell for its design of the pier area of  Imperial Beach. It was noted that the design featuring the conversion of a  derelict parking lot into a landscaped plaza was developed with the intense  participation of local residents, in design jargon, the potential user.  </P> <P> Other landscape architecture winners included Dike/Runa of Newport Beach for  the Hidden Oaks Ranch in Valley Center, and the SWA Group of Laguna Beach for  the Baywood Apartment complex in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> This recognition of the "user" is heartening. And while few actual "users," the  person or persons a project is specifically designed for, are ever invited onto  the juries of the various associations conducting awards program, they are, of  course, the ultimate jurors, passing judgment daily on the projects experienced  in their communities.  </P> <P> In this respect, we are all jurors, and design critics.  </P></p>

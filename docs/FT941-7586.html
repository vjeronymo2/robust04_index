			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Labour policy on EU will hit jobs, says Fowler The Conservative party formally launched its European election campaign yesterday with a broadside against Labour's 'damaging' employment policies. Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, claimed that Labour was committed to a European socialist group manifesto that would destroy millions of British jobs. But the attack was widely seen as an attempt to deflect attention from tomorrow's scheduled launch of the federalist manifesto of the European People's Party, the European parliament group which embraces the Tories. Sir Norman said the Conservatives were not committed to the EPP manifesto, which is likely to prompt an angry response from Euro-sceptic Tory rightwingers. He said the Conservatives would fight the June election on a separate manifesto being drawn up by a group headed by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. However, the manifesto will not be published until close to the election in an attempt to minimise the danger of worsening the party's deep divisions on Europe. Sir Norman said the socialist group's proposals for a statutory minimum wage and a 35-hour week would destroy more than 2m jobs and cost British business Pounds 20bn. 'A socialist Europe would mean a high-cost Europe, with new and heavier burdens placed on business. Labour and their socialist friends would totally undermine Britain's competitiveness in world markets,' he said. Labour has repeatedly denied Conservative claims that it is committed to a 35-hour week. The idea is presented in the socialist group manifesto as one of several options for job creation. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, dismissed the Tory attack as 'just another rehash of old lies and propaganda from a party bankrupt of ideas'. Mr Prescott said Labour was committed only to a review of 'voluntary work-sharing', which would increase employment at the expense of overtime working. Sir Norman said the Conservatives would be 'fighting to win' the elections, in spite of widespread expectations that the party will suffer a heavy defeat.</p>

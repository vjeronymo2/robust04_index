			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japan New Party [JNP], at its standing  committee meeting on 11 May, discussed the issue of whether  Morihiro Hosokawa (former prime minister), whose term as party  head will expire soon, should stay in "the leader's post." Most  of those at the meeting favored his reappointment although some  opposed it. Thus, the leadership now plans to request Hosokawa  to stay as party leader, and then make an official decision at a  national meeting of party representatives in early June.    There still remain differences of view on the issue within  the party, however. While there is a group saying, "We will act  with Mr. Hosokawa to the end," there is also a group that is  critical of Hosokawa for his role in forming the floor group  "Kaishin." Thus, it is possible that the question of Hosokawa  needing to quit may come up again in the future.    The meeting on the morning of 11 May of the 23-member  standing committee was called to discuss the issue of who should  be named to head the party. Most of the committee members  shared the opinion: "If he resigns, the JNP will not be able to  go on its own."    However, when another meeting was held with all party Diet  members attending later in the afternoon, voices of strong  discontent erupted with some members saying: "Our mission is to  achieve political reform, and Mr. Hosokawa betrayed it."</p>

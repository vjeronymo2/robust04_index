			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Anti-India Wisner"] </F>   [Text] The views expressed by the designated U.S. envoy to  India, Frank Wisner, before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  U.S. Senate about India were not answers to satisfy the  requirements for his appointment, but are the anti-India views  of Wisner. The India visit by U.S. Assistant Secretary for  State, Strobe Talbott, and U.S. visit by Prime Minister Narsimha  Rao had begun the process of normalizing relations. The job of  any envoy is to further the interests of his nation, but it is  also his job to try his utmost to strengthen bilateral  relations. Wisner has not yet arrived in India, but he has  already started showing his fangs. India is a sovereign nation  and prudent enough to know what is good for it and what is bad.  Wisner is trying to threaten India in a roundabout way  regarding the Prithvi short-range missiles deployed by the Army.  He is saying that deployment of these missiles would worsen the  arms race. In a way, Wisner is representing the U.S. point of  view about missiles, but it is also clear that he has highly  prejudiced views about India. Only a few days ago, he expressed  negative views about India becoming a permanent member of the  Security Council. If he wanted, he could have supported India's  nomination to the Security Council, arguing that India was the  largest democratic country in the world. After all, India had  supported China's permanent membership in the Seurity Council.  It is not that U.S. diplomacy is always practiced on  principles. Obviously, Wisner has orchestrated this anti-India  refrain intentionally.    There is tremendous contradiction in Wisner's views. He  admits that there is danger to India from China. If that danger  is from China's atom bomb, then the same danger would threaten  from its carrier missiles. Prithvi is also a short-range  missile. India also should develop and deploy the Agni missile.  It is unfortunate that launching the Prithvi, which was  postponed in view of the U.S. tour by Rao, has been postponed  again. India have no fear of the Wisners. Wisner is  overlooking the fact that Pakistan not only has Chinese-made  M-11 missiles, but F-16 U.S. fighter planes. Wisher favors  supplying F-16's to Pakistan. Atom bombs could be dropped by  these planes. Hence, is there no danger to India from Pakistan?  On what logic is he recommending supply of F-16 fighter planes  to Pakistan? It is obvious that Wisner is anti-India. The  Indian Government shoudl object to his appontment. What would  such an envoy with a poisoned tongue do in India? His arrogant  statements would put daily dents in the relations which have  normalized with great difficulty.</p>

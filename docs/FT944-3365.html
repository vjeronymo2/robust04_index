			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Orange County's loss on investment portfolio now Dollars 2.02bn Orange County's loss on its investment portfolio now stands at Dollars 2.02bn, Mr Tom Hayes, the newly appointed chairman of the restructuring team said yesterday, Tony Jackson reports from New York. The figure was struck at close of business on Monday. Though higher than the originally published loss of Dollars 1.5bn, it is below some outside estimates. The County's board of supervisors authorised Salomon Brothers, which was last week retained as financial adviser, to dispose of the fund's remaining investments. Mr Hayes said he aimed to increase the liquidity of the fund, reduce its holdings of derivatives and shorten the average maturity of the securities held. The board also authorised an interim distribution of cash to investors in the fund, having met with the 11 largest earlier in the day.</p>

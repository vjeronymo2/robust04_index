			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Daily Telegraph listing proposed MR CONRAD Black, the Can-adian proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, yesterday announced he was considering a stock exchange listing for the UK newspaper group in June 'barring a market over-reaction' to the outcome of the UK election. He also announced the sale of his 8.8 per cent stake in United Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Express. The proposed flotation would require the Hollinger Group, the international media group which is Mr Black's main holding company, to reduce its holding from 83 per cent to 70 per cent. A minority of the shares is held by directors and former owners of the Telegraph newspapers. The Telegraph newspapers have just announced pre-tax profits for 1991 of Pounds 40.5m on turnover of Pounds 219m, compared with profits of Pounds 38.5m the year before, on turnover of Pounds 222m. Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of the Daily Telegraph, said the proposed flotation and the sale of the United Newspapers stake did not indicate Hollinger was short of money: 'It is more in the way of building up a war chest.' Hollinger Group sold the 17.25m United Newspapers shares to brokers Smith New Court and Cazenove, who placed them with several dozen institutions at 350p a share, raising Pounds 60.4m. United Newspapers shares yesterday slipped by 13p to 360p. The average price paid by Hollinger in building the stake in July and August 1989 is believed to be about 458p, implying a loss on the shares of Pounds 18.6m. This does not include the cost of financing the investment or dividends received. Mr Jack Boultbee, vice-president for finance at Hollinger's head office in Toronto, said yesterday there was 'no particular need' for the company to raise money, but that 'there's a lot of sense in paying down debt right now whether or not we take on anything else', writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. He said Hollinger gave a 'soft commitment' to spin off some of its interest in the Telegraph at the time of its original investment. He added that the company expects to raise 'at least' CDollars 120m (Pounds 58.4m) by reducing its stake from 83 per cent to 70 per cent, double what it paid for its original 58 per cent stake in the company.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: THE SNAKE TREE BY UWE TIMM TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN BY  PETER TEGEL (NEW DIRECTIONS: $19.95, CLOTH; $10.95, PAPER; 281 PP.)  </P> <P> A West German engineer named Wagner arrives in a South American country that  resembles Argentina or Brazil under military rule. His job is to oversee the  construction of a paper mill in the rain forest. On his first visit to the site  -- where the project is sinking literally into the mud, and metaphorically into  a swamp of incompetence and corruption -- he runs over a green snake in the  road. The snake is sacred; the Indian workers consider him marked for death.  </P> <P> Wagner, a rationalist, pooh-poohs the idea of a curse. It's to Uwe Timm's  credit that the engineer doesn't get his comeuppance in any of the obvious  ways. The story of Europeans degenerating in the tropics is, after all, an old  one; Joseph Conrad told it first and best in "Heart of Darkness," which Wagner  happens to have read. Unlike Conrad's renegade idealist, Kurtz, Wagner doesn't  go murderously insane; unlike the stereotypical modern technocrat, he is  neither narrow-minded nor insensitive. His impulses toward love and spiritual  rebirth get him into as much trouble as his demands for efficiency.  </P> <P> A colleague warns him, as someone should have warned Kurtz: "One can't force an  alien logic on things, and on people even less." Wagner's good intentions can't  cancel the fact that the colonialism Conrad described in the Third World of his  day has been replaced by an alliance between foreign economic interests and the  native elite, with results almost as bad: "The (common) people pay for  everything. We give them the loans, build them the (mill), deliver the  machinery, cut down the forest. . . . What we leave behind is a useless paper  factory, a red desert and debts."  </P> <P> "The Snake Tree," Timm's fifth novel, is romantic in two senses of the word. It  trades heavily in suspense and exotic detail: huge cockroaches popping through  a bathroom drain, a six-lane freeway bridge spanning a jungle gorge but  connected only to donkey trails. And it uses South American "magical realism"  in the service of a European idea that flourished a generation or two before  Conrad: the power of the wilderness to heal as well as destroy, the religious  and political necessity of shedding "civilization" like a snake's skin.  </P> <P> Peter Tegel's translation is littered with awkward syntax, comma faults and  misspellings. It won a prize and may represent an attempt by Timm to show the  decay of "alien logic" through the decay of language, but American readers will  find it annoying.  </P></p>

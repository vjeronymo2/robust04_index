			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Pressure on Fed to lift rates The US Federal Reserve faces pressure to raise interest rates next week following the dollar's continuing weakness against the yen and publication of data indicating US growth remains well above the rate consistent with low inflation in the longer term. On Wednesday, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, treasury secretary, said the recent rise in bond yields was not threatening US economic growth - a remark that some analysts interpreted as a green light to the Fed to raise short-term rates again. President Bill Clinton may also believe that a US rate increase before the Naples economic summit would put him in a stronger negotiating position when seeking concerted action to support the dollar and promote global growth. Figures yesterday showed robust growth of US personal incomes and factory orders in May and a sharp rise in an index of prices compiled by Chicago purchasing managers. The strong data and evidence of upward pressure on prices prompted sharp falls in bond and share prices. 'The underlying economic trend still looks very strong,' said Mr Jim O'Sullivan, economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank. He said growth probably exceeded 5 per cent at an annual rate in the second quarter despite a sharp slowdown in consumer spending because of large positive contributions from capital spending and construction. J P Morgan expects US short-term rates to rise 1 percentage point to 5.25 per cent over the next three months and to reach 5.75 per cent by year end, creating a large positive differential with Japanese and German rates. Personal incomes rose 0.6 per cent in both April and May, reflecting rapid growth of employment. As they outstripped consumer spending, the savings rate rebounded in May to 4.7 per cent against an average of 3.5 per cent in the first quarter. The recovery of savings indicates the economy is poised to grow robustly in the second half when exports should benefit from improving demand in Europe and Japan. Orders rose 0.6 per cent in May, the ninth increase in the past 10 months. The Conference Board's 'help-wanted' index also rose sharply in May, a sign of tightening labour markets. Many analysts believe the Fed will raise rates next week, either at the policy meeting of governors and regional presidents on July 5 and 6 or a few days later after the publication of crucial data for June employment, car sales and department store sales. Preliminary indications from the weekly 'Johnson Redbook' survey indicate a rebound in consumer spending in June. Some economists believe the Fed will raise the federal funds rate - the rate at which banks lend to each other - by a quarter point to 4.5 per cent next week. Other believe it will send a stronger signal by raising both the federal funds rate and discount rate half a point. The discount rate - the notional rate at which the Fed lends to banks - currently stands at 3.5 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Paz Tejerina] </F>   [Text] The creation of a Finance Ministry is practically a  fact. The candidate? Public Income Secretary Carlos Tacchi  appears to be the perfect man for the job.    No one can forget the president's plaudits regarding Tacchi,  nor his very good relations with Minister Domingo Cavallo.    The Economy Ministry's prognosis for the upcoming elections  is very optimistic. It is therefore to be believed that in the  near future the number of ministries will be increased.    The division of the Economy Ministry is becoming more and  more of a fact with the reform of the Constitution.    The economic team has always held the hypothesis that public  resources must be managed by one organization during a new stage.    In the corridors of the Economy Ministry, Tacchi appeared to  be the most solid person to give life to an alternate  organization to that of Cavallo.    And at Government House, the full endorsement that Carlos  Menem has given the "collector" seems to place him at the top of  the list of those whose names were mentioned by the presidential  clique.    The president is always repeating in addition that Tacchi  knows more about tax legislation than Cavallo himself.    In second place, the names of Vice Economy Minister Carlos  Sanchez, followed by that of Finance Secretary Ricardo  Gutierrez, were mentioned.    Cavallo was, however, more cautious in mentioning  candidates.  He preferred not to make any forecasts, and only repeated that  anyone on his team is prepared for the post.    The campaign closes today. There is no doubt that the  Economy Ministry foresees a favorable outcome. Some analysts  are asking themselves whether a future ministry managed by  Tacchi might not cast a cloud over Domingo Cavallo.</p>

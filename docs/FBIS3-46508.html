			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The United States' Cray Research Company, the  world's largest supercomputer company, plans to call on the  Japanese Government to revise its procurement procedures  involving supercomputers. The company will recommend that the  governments of both Japan and the U.S. tighten their methods of  technical review and set minimum acceptable price ceilings for  procured items. So far, Cray has bid successfully on only one  of eight contracts that the Japanese Government has awarded  under the first supplementary budget of 1993, and is unhappy  about this situation. Meanwhile, the Japanese Government and  manufacturers are unhappy about the way the U.S. Government  conducts its procurement. As such, it is likely that there will  be a reaction to Cray's position.    Before biddings on a total of 11 computers to be procured  under the supplementary budget began, John Carlson, Cray's  chairman, had said that his "goal is to land contracts on four  or five of them." So far, it has procured a contract on only one  computer. While there are three more contracts for which to  bid, it is likely that the company will win only one of them.  Cray believes that its poor performance is due to the method of  technical review, which prevents its products' technical  advantages to stand out in view of the low- price bids of  Japanese manufacturers.    The company's officer concerned said his company "will not  file a complaint on the biddings this time," but the company  plans to request that in biddings henceforth, evaluations of  product performance be conducted by a third party, and that  lower-limit price ceilings be instituted in addition to the  upper-limit ceilings currently required.    But among Japanese manufacturers there are voices saying:  "It  is absurd to set lower-limit ceilings on bid prices. Price  competition contributes to lowering government expenditures."  Some also note that in the biddings made under the  supplementary budget, three out of eight successful bidders are  to provide U.S.-made products, which, they say, means that  progress is being made in market liberalization.</p>

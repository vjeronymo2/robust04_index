			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Mining company chairman accused: Australian federal authorities launch prosecutions against two of the country's leading businessmen Normandy Poseidon, the large Adelaide-based mining and exploration group, last night took the highly unusual step of disclosing that its executive chairman, Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny, was about to be charged by the federal director of public prosecutions. The company's solicitors added that they had been advised that Mr Thomas Meiklejohn, a former employee of Normandy, would also be charged. Normandy, which made the announcement after the stock market closed, said full details of the charges had not been disclosed but continued: 'It is understood that they relate to the takeover by Brunswick NL in 1989 of Bendigo Gold and that the charges allege that Mr de Crespigny and Mr Meiklejohn allegedly failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Part A statement delivered to Bendigo Gold shareholders did not contain misleading information. 'It is understood that Mr Meiklejohn is also to be charged for allegedly having knowingly published false information in relation to the financial position of Brunswick.' Brunswick started corporate life as Brunswick Oil, but sold its oil interests and moved into the gold exploration business in Western Australia. Control was then acquired by interests related to Mr de Crespigny who, in 1989, was chairman of the company. Mr Meiklejohn, at that time, was Brunswick's managing director. The merger with Bendigo Gold was agreed in 1990. A 'Part A' document is one of the offer documents formally required under Australian takeover practice  -and the one which tells shareholders in the target company about any information relevant to them in deciding whether to sell their shares. Mr de Crespigny, one of the most influential figures in Australia's mining industry, denied any wrongdoing. 'The laying of these is entirely unexpected and very disappointing,' he said in a statement. 'The DPP has never spoken to me nor made any serious attempt to canvass its concerns with me.' He said he was completely innocent of the charges and would defend them vigorously. He was confident of an acquittal, 'although clearly the laying of these charges is bound to cause me enormous personal damage'. Last night, Mr Andrew Corletto, Normandy's company secretary, said that he did not believe that the charges had actually been laid to date, although he conceded that it was possible this would happen before the holiday weekend. Normandy's early disclosure of the impending prosecution appears to have been prompted by a wave of rumours.</p>

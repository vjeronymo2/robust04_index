			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ESTONIA VOWS FULL INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> The Baltic republic of Estonia today declared 50 years of Soviet rule invalid  and pledged to achieve full independence, the Tass news agency said.  </P> <P> Deputies of the Supreme Soviet parliament did not set a date for full  independence from Moscow.  </P> <P> They opted to debate that on a later date, Tass said.  </P> <P> The move put Estonia on the path toward a possible confrontation with Moscow,  like that of its Baltic neighbor, Lithuania. Lithuania declared independence  March 11.  </P> <P> "The Estonian parliament denied the legitimacy of the state power of the Soviet  Union in Estonia from the moment the Soviet system of government was  established here," Tass said.  </P> <P> "It also proclaimed the beginning of restoration of the Estonian republic,  announcing a transition period which will be completed with the formation of  the Estonian Republic's constitutional agencies of state power," Tass said.  </P> <P> Estonia, like Lithuania and Latvia, gained independence from the ruins of the  Russian Empire at the end of World War I. But the three republics were annexed  by Josef Stalin in 1940.  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Most unions reject ballots despite criticism: The race to lead Labour MOST UNION leaderships are to reject the idea of balloting their members on who to support in the Labour leadership election, in spite of criticism that other methods give too much influence to union leaders. Leaders of the AEU engineering decided yesterday on 'widespread consultation' among members rather than a secret ballot. The executive of the Usdaw shop workers said its union conference would make the decision. Leaders of both unions have indicated support for Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor. Usdaw said it was advising its conference to back him. Among the 10 largest unions only the GMB general workers, the GPMU print workers and the NCU communication workers seem certain to hold ballots. The TGWU general union is likely to consult members through branches and the MSF general technical union's decision is likely to be made by its annual conference. If Nupe follows the practice it adopted during the last leadership election, the matter will be decided by shows of hands at branch meetings. Mr Smith, declaring his candidacy yesterday, called for ballots wherever possible. Unions cite lack of time and money as reasons for rejecting ballots. One difficulty is separating members who contribute to union political funds from others who could not expect a vote in a ballot. In the party's electoral college 40 per cent of the votes will be cast by unions. Mr Bill Jordan, AEU president, said a ballot could not be arranged quickly and the union's political fund was empty following the general election. Balloting the AEU's 630,000 members would cost Pounds 110,000. That cost would increase after the AEU merges with the 360,000 EETPU electricians' union next month. The executive of the EETPU is also against a ballot. Although the AEU decision was made before the Labour national executive chose July 18, rather than June, for a special conference, the executive is still likely to be against a ballot because of the cost. Ironically, the AEU believes that the Labour leadership should be decided by one person, one vote among party members. Along with the EETPU, the AEU championed wide use of ballots in internal leadership contests. The AEU executive decision could, however, be challenged when the union's policy-making national committee meets next month. Mr Jimmy Airlie, an AEU executive councillor, argued yesterday that the union should abstain in the leadership election if it could not hold a ballot. Mr Garfield Davies, Usdaw general secretary, said his membership would be fully consulted through the branch structure and the executive would vote to tell the 800 conference delegates whether to accept the executive's recommendation to support Mr Smith. Mr Davies said a ballot would be expensive and turnout would be low. Usdaw's method would provide the best gauge of membership opinion.</p>

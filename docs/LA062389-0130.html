			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS ARE OPTIMISTIC COUNTY CAN AVOID $24-MILLION DEFICIT  </P> <P> The County Administrative Office released its $2.9-billion proposed budget for  fiscal 1989-90 on Thursday, showing a deficit of about $24 million -- enough to  be threatening except that officials are "optimistic" that it will soon be  erased.  </P> <P> The Legislature is considering giving a grant to county governments that would  add about $19.7 million to Orange County's coffers, bringing the deficit into  what officials consider a manageable range. The grant could be decided as early  as next week.  </P> <P> "It is my opinion that it is still too early to prognosticate doom," County  Administrative Officer Larry Parrish said in a letter to the supervisors  Thursday. "I prefer to concentrate our energy on . . . what we can do to  present a balanced budget to your board."  </P> <P> John Sibley, associate county administrative officer for the budget, said:  "We're very optimistic that we're going to be able to manage this budget. If  the $19 million doesn't come through, obviously we've got a significant  problem."  </P> <P> The 1989-90 year begins on July 1 and the supervisors are scheduled to adopt  the proposed budget on Wednesday. The county will hold hearings on the budget  during the last week of July. Then the supervisors must give final approval by  Aug. 30.  </P> <P> The awkward budget schedule -- with the hearings coming after the fiscal year  begins -- is inherently difficult because much of the county's budget depends  on decisions at the state level that are not made by June.  </P> <P> Last year, the $2.3-billion budget adopted by the supervisors had a deficit of  $23 million that was not resolved until January when the Legislature passed the  Trial Court Funding Act, a program in which the state assumed much of the cost  to operate the county's court system.  </P> <P> Before the county's budget was balanced, however, officials feared that the  $23-million deficit could force the layoff of several hundred county employees.  </P> <P> Sibley said today's deficit could have the same ramifications, but "we haven't  even started to look at that kind of thing."  </P> <P> Parrish also said, "We have exercised restraint in communicating negative  budget messages to agencies and departments in an effort to minimize the  typical budget hysteria."  </P> <P> But another potentially significant problem for the 1989-90 budget is the  salary increases being negotiated with labor unions. The contracts for almost  all of the county's 12,000 union employees will expire this year. Four of them  end with the fiscal year next Friday.  </P> <P> Parrish told the supervisors that there is no money in the budget for any  salary increases and, if any are granted, the county's department heads might  be forced to absorb the extra costs from their existing budgets. In that case,  there could still be significant cuts in county staff or programs, he said.  </P> <P> Sibley said a 1% salary increase for all county employees would cost the county  about $5 million.  </P> <P> Russell Patton, the county's personnel director, said four county unions are  negotiating their contracts now. One, the 600-member Service Employees  International Union, was scheduled to vote on a contract Thursday night.  </P> <P> The contract for the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs is scheduled to  expire in November.  </P> <P> Parrish began his letter to the supervisors on an upbeat tone, calling  attention to the county's accomplishments in the past year even with its  precarious budget.  </P> <P> "We have maintained county programs in an era of fiscal restraint and at the  same time, accomplished several significant tasks," Parrish wrote.  </P> <P> He noted the county's progress in expanding John Wayne Airport as well as  beginning construction at a new juvenile courthouse and an expanded branch jail  in Orange.  </P> <P> "We have accomplished these tasks within the fiscal year 88-89 in spite of the  paradox of decreasing revenues and increasing demands," he wrote.  </P> <P> Parrish then listed 11 areas for funding still needed in the county, including  more jail beds, a new courthouse, office space for several county departments  and more money for indigent medical services.  </P> <P> "I am sure you will agree that the needs far outdistance our financing  abilities," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> UNSAFE NITRATE LEVELS FOUND IN SCHOOL WELL  </P> <P> Bottled-water dispensers were installed at Rio Del Valle Junior High School in  Oxnard Wednesday after unsafe nitrate levels were found in drinking water drawn  from a campus well.  </P> <P> Officials of the Rio Elementary School District plan to meet today with the  United Water Conservation District of Santa Paula to discuss temporary water  supplies.  </P> <P> A line operated by the water district runs along Rose Avenue in front of the  school. Connecting the school to it will take about two weeks, Assistant Supt.  Fernando Cuevas said.  </P> <P> The school district's board of trustees will discuss emergency authorization to  spend $20,000 for the connection at its meeting next week, Cuevas said. The  connection will remain in place through the end of the school year. Officials  will discuss possible long-term solutions next summer, he said.  </P> <P> Letters were sent Wednesday to parents of the school's 470 seventh- and  eighth-grade students, informing them that bottled water is being provided for  drinking, said Supt. John McGarry. Well water will continue to be used in  restrooms, he said.  </P> <P> District officials said nitrate levels in the drinking water were 112  milligrams per liter, more than twice the maximum of 45 milligrams per liter  set as the safety standard by state law.  </P> <P> A high nitrate level can cause "blue-baby syndrome" in infants under 6 months,  affecting the blood's ability to carry oxygen, but does not pose a similar  hazard to older children or adults, said Robert Gallagher, resources section  manager of the county's environmental health department.  </P> <P> State law requires well water quality to be checked every three years.  </P> <P> The school is surrounded by strawberry fields, and sparse rainfall may have  lowered the water table and caused nitrates -- which are often contained in  farm fertilizer -- to seep from ground water into wells, McGarry said.  </P> <P> Principal Gary Martino said although no one reported becoming ill from the  water, students and staff have complained that it was "not very palatable."

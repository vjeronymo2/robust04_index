			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GUN DRAWN ON 3 ROCK FANS  </P> <P> Three fans of a British rock band performing on the late night television show  "Into the Night" rushed the stage during Wednesday's taping, prompting a  security guard to draw his gun, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> Michael Levine, spokesman for host Rick Dees, said the entire episode was  captured by video cameras and shown on the show which was broadcast Wednesday  night on ABC.  </P> <P> Members of The Mission/U.K., described as a "gothic rock" band with a youthful  following, were performing during the 5:30 p.m. taping, when three young women  rushed from the audience and toward the band's lead singer, Wayne Hussey,  Levine said.  </P> <P> "The security guard pulled his gun, then a stagehand saw the guard pull his gun  and he tackled him, saying, 'Don't shoot,' " Levine said. No shots were fired  and no one was injured, Levine said. The excited fans were escorted from the  stage at ABC Prospect Studios.  </P> <P> "They stopped tape for a while and regained calm," he said. Levine said that  although Dees was able to make light of the incident, it was apparent that he  was shaken by it.  </P> <P> "Security is going to be beefed up considerably for future shows," Levine said.  </P></p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Leading Article: Reforming the Finanzplatz GERMANY'S ECONOMY may be a powerful industrial engine, but its domestic financial markets have always had an incongruously low-octane rating. The twin proposals last week to reform German bourse regulations and to introduce fully computerised share trading are much more than merely an attempt to put a tiger in the tank of the country's sometimes provincially-run stock exchanges. As Chancellor Helmut Kohl emphasised in Frankfurt this week, Germany is now committed to securing a place on international financial markets on a par with its status as the world's third largest economy. More liquid, open and efficient financial markets will be of considerable benefit in the task of rebuilding east Germany, buttressing the time-honoured method of funding corporate investment via the banks. Additionally, after a run of insider trading affairs, Germany needs to improve the image of its financial sector in its political drive to bring the planned European central bank to Frankfurt  - a goal to which Mr Kohl ascribes highest importance. One significant factor behind the reform plan is the fear of further migration of share trades to London, which accounted for a sizeable chunk of dealing in German blue chips last year. Both for this reason, and to stoke domestic interest in Germany's equity markets, the big German banks have given full-hearted support to the Finance Ministry's package. Advancing integration The aim of promoting harmonised conditions for business and investment across Europe would be ill-served if London, Paris and Frankfurt were simply to indulge in beggar-my-neighbour competition to boost their own market volumes. However, the changes planned in Germany seem on the whole a positive contribution to advancing economic integration. The absence of a centralised securities regulatory body in Germany, and the lack of legal redress against insider trading, have always looked like drawbacks; with the advent of the single European market, when cross-border supervisory co-operation will be even more necessary than it is now, such shortcomings would appear downright antediluvian. Central agency Before the reform package can become law, Bonn must persuade the German Lander to transfer their present responsibility for securities supervision to a centralised agency. Some Lander show an almost medieval desire to cling to regional powers, as is shown by their resistance to slimming down the number of Land central banks which make up the Bundesbank. The ambitious Frankfurt stock exchange plan to introduce computerised trading by the mid-1990s may well be of benefit here in reducing obduracy. Frankfurt already handles more than 50 per cent of business conducted by Germany's eight stock exchanges. Setting up an efficient electronic system, capable of being operated from computer terminals all round Germany, could do far more to stimulate regional stock market interest than maintaining locally-supervised trading floors around the city squares of Land capitals. As a country which has long upheld freedom of capital movements, Germany should ensure that the structure of the proposed computerised system is as harmonised as possible with those elsewhere in Europe. Technology, however, is not enough; there is also a need for further improvement in overall trading rules. In time, both German and foreign investors must hope that some of the less open parts of the German system of corporate governance will be brought more into line with standards elsewhere. Two particular problems are the lack of clear-cut division between banks' own-account investment activities and their dealing for clients, and insufficient rights for smaller shareholders in company takeovers. If the writ of Germany's mooted new securities agency were to extend into probing more fundamental issues like these, it would be a welcome surprise; and Corporate Germany AG might end up benefiting.</p>

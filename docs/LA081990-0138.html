			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: FOR 2 NEW TEACHERS, IT'S LIKE COMING HOME AGAIN AS THEY TAKE INNER CITY  POSTS  </P> <P> Recent college graduates Ray Owens and Ileetha Brooks will start their teaching  careers in familiar surroundings when school opens next month and they welcome  youngsters to elementary school classes in the inner city.  </P> <P> Owens and Brooks are among 500 participants in the Teach for America project,  aimed at alleviating teacher shortages in cities and rural areas. The project,  begun by a 1989 Princeton graduate, Wendy Kopp, is modeled after the Peace  Corps.  </P> <P> For Owens and Brooks, it will be like going home again. "I was born in Compton  but moved to Austin as an 8-year-old," said Owens, 29. "I used to swim in  Lynwood."  </P> <P> Brooks grew up in the Watts-Compton area. "I am simply going to the community I  grew up in to teach the people there," Brooks said. "My mother is there. She  will always be there."  </P> <P> Brooks, a graduate of UC Berkeley, is one of about 35 recruits expected to join  the Compton Unified School District. Owens, a University of Texas graduate, is  one of 39 recruits scheduled to teach in the Lynwood Unified School District.  About 225 of the 500 participants will work in the Los Angeles, Compton,  Lynwood, Inglewood and Pasadena school districts.  </P> <P> Owens and Brooks completed eight weeks of intensive teacher training at USC and  taught this summer in the Los Angeles district. They and other recruits are  committed to teach at least two years.  </P> <P> Brooks, who has a bachelor's degree in psychology, said she plans to get a  doctorate in educational psychology, with an emphasis on the black family. Her  goal is to become a professor and do research in educational psychology.  </P> <P> Owens majored in economics and government and originally envisioned a business  career. He left college to work as an enforcement officer in the state  controller's office in Texas, but returned to school to get a bachelor's degree  in English after deciding that he did not like the job.  </P> <P> "I realized I always wanted to be a teacher," he said.  </P> <P> He said he might someday be interested in switching from teaching to writing  curricula.  </P> <P> Owens gave the commencement speech during graduation ceremonies for recruits  Wednesday at USC. He urged his colleagues to be sensitive to the needs of  students and to help them succeed.  </P> <P> "I challenge you to care," he said. "There is a little girl in Baton Rouge who  needs to know you care. There is a little boy in Compton that needs to know  that you believe in him."  </P> <P> Debra Harrison was addicted to drugs and alcohol when she decided to mend her  life several years ago.  </P> <P> After undergoing treatment for her addiction, the mother of two teen-age  children went to night school to get her high school diploma. She graduated  from Dominguez High School along with her daughter, Meeka. They enrolled  together at Compton College. Meeka Harrison took time off to care for her  infant son; Debra Harrison graduated in June.  </P> <P> Harrison, 38, will continue to take early-childhood courses at the college and  plans to open a day-care center in the future.  </P> <P> Around the campus, Harrison is well known for her boosterism. She has organized  pep rallies, raised funds for student events and been on the student council.  Harrison, who rarely misses an athletic event, is commissioner of athletics on  the student council.  </P> <P> "She's everyone's mom," said Mark Haynes, student body president. "She loves to  have someone to take care of."  </P> <P> Haynes created a special award -- Associated Student Body President's Award --  for Harrison.  </P> <P> Maria Flores has been appointed as the new program director of the Flossie  Lewis Center, a Long Beach recovery home for women troubled by alcoholism and  drug dependence.  </P> <P> Flores, a recovering alcoholic, has helped start a couple of homes for  recovering women, including establishing a sober-living housing project in San  Pedro. The Flossie Lewis Center also includes a program for homeless women  recovering from drug dependence.  </P> <P> * Several ABC Unified School District campuses will have new principals in  September because of retirements and resignations. Decla Johnson will be  principal at Stowers Elementary School. Cerritos Elementary School Assistant  Principal Carol Trujillo will take over the top job at that school. Veteran  teacher Wade Austin will be principal at Wittmann Elementary. Nancy Maynez will  be principal at Hawaiian Elementary. Maynez was an assistant principal in the  Riverside district. Yvonne Contreras is the new principal at Killingsworth  Junior High School. Contreras was an assistant principal at Gahr High School in  the district.  </P> <P> * Compton High School students Lincoln Johnson and Tamika McClelland won gold  medals at the Afro-Academic Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics.  Johnson won for film video and McClelland for drama. The national contest was  sponsored by the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People.  </P> <P> * Norman L. Cook has been given the Distinguished Toastmaster Award by  Toastmasters International, the educational organization devoted to speech  communication and leadership development. Cook is a member of the Downey Space  Toastmasters and the Downey Happy Hour Toastmasters.  </P> <P> * Los Angeles County Fire Department Assistant Chief Jimmie L. Ryland has been  named assistant fire chief in Commerce.  </P> <P> * Ronald J. Piazza is the new president of the Lakewood Chamber of Commerce.  Piazza, 38, owns all five McDonald's franchises in the city. And at one, the  Woodruff Avenue McDonald's, he established the Lakewood Youth Sports Hall of  Fame to pay tribute to the community's young athletes.

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (1): A change of priorities - The present energy glut contrasts with the 1970s oil shortages which turned conservation into a burning issue. Today the efficient use of energy is regarded as good for business and vital for the earth's environment WHO needs energy efficiency? Why bother about conserving energy if fuel resources will be abundant well into the next century? Why invest in more efficient machinery if the price of oil is at its lowest in real terms for 20 years? Why alter your lifestyle if it is not endangered? Alas, for the energy efficiency industry, there are no compelling answers to any of these questions, which probably explains why many of its members are gripped by a sense of frustration these days. The old arguments about looming scarcity, insecure supplies and threats to ways of life have lost their sting. The world has survived the nightmare scenario of a major war in the Gulf with its energy lifelines intact. It may be, of course, that the prevailing attitudes are profoundly misplaced and are fostering a dangerous level of complacency. Yet the abundance of world energy resources was reconfirmed only two months ago at the World Energy Congress in Madrid. The WEC's experts said: ' ..there is no global shortage of primary energy now, and none is anticipated to 2020.' The WEC also concluded that the price of oil, which effectively dictates all energy prices in the long run, will rise little in real terms before the second quarter of the next century. 'Nobody will feel pressures in the next five to 10 years by using energy at the same level of efficiency as they do today,' says Dr Lee Schipper, an energy efficiency expert at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory of the University of California. He recounts that while recently staying at a hotel in Stockholm, the shirt he sent for cleaning was handled by a laundry 30kms out of town. 'That shirt travelled 60 kms just to be washed,' he notes. So what do the conservationists have going for them today? They can still rely on the puritanical streak in advanced industrialised countries which accepts that energy conservation is a good thing in itself. They can also count on the steady underlying gains in efficiency which happen anyway, spurred by competition and the spread of technology, amounting to about one per cent a year. Large strides continue to be made in energy efficient techniques, notably in the power generation industry where new turbines can at last produce more power than waste heat. This decade should also bring substantial efficiency gains in East Europe and the former Soviet republics where wasteful habits are rapidly being driven out by the transition to market economics. But the achievement of major advances in industrial countries will need an important new stimulus. The most likely one to emerge is concern about the environment. Worries on this score have grown steadily as the danger of global warming has touched the public imagination. Since the greenhouse gases which have been blamed for the phenomenon are largely caused by consumption of fossil fuels, a remedy clearly lies in energy conservation. This year's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro provided a focus for action. But the debate there showed up deep divisions within the industrial nations about the seriousness of the threat. The member countries of the European Community adopted a target of reducing their carbon dioxide emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2000. But the US remained unconvinced of the need for such defined goals. As a result, Rio failed to produce a concerted plan of action. The international treaty on climate change which was adopted there contained no deadlines or targets on carbon emissions and was widely denounced as a flop. Since Rio, the persistence of the world recession has further dampened enthusiasm for measures at either global or national level. In the UK, the crisis over the run down of the coal industry could even lead to postponement of the carbon emission targets because the government may be forced into promoting coal use to save miners' jobs. The weakness of the environment as a spur to greater energy efficiency is that - unlike the threat of fuel shortages - it does not drive up prices and unleash corrective market forces. If it is to have any effect it will have to be through government action, either regulation or taxation. The last 12 months have seen much debate about a possible carbon tax to promote greater energy efficiency. The EC Commission has been designing a plan for a such a tax, starting at the equivalent of Dollars 3 per barrel of oil, rising by annual Dollars 1 increments to Dollars 10. There are, however, considerable doubts whether this would have much effect. The greatest emission reductions need to be achieved in transport - the sector which has historically made least progress - but petrol is already so heavily taxed that even Dollars 10 a barrel would not be prohibitive. Politically, too, the tax has made little headway because of the reluctance of individual countries to adopt a measure which would handicap their export industries. Although EC environment ministers agreed to explore the idea, the likelihood of it being adopted in the foreseeable future is remote. Both the US and Japan are unenthusiastic. Thus energy efficiency remains in the domain of national initiatives. Some are substantial. Italy is proposing to spend Lire 2,611bn over three years on a conservation grant programme which it hopes will save the equivalent of 4m tonnes of oil a year (about 2.5 per cent). But many are also very small, commensurate with the low level of the perceived threat. Much of the problem is that individuals and businesses are reluctant to invest in energy efficiency. Dr Colin Myerscough, director of industry and general policy at the UK's Energy Efficiency Office, identifies three main barriers: lack of information, low capital priority, and hidden costs such as extra wiring needed to install energy efficient appliances. There are further barriers in a tax system which favours domestic fuel consumption over conservation equipment, and a regulatory regime which rewards the electricity industry for selling as much electricity as it can. This means that governments will have to take the lead. 'Energy efficiency can only become real if tens of thousands of people invest money in it. And that means governments spending money,' says an official at the Paris-based International Energy Agency. The potential for efficiency improvements is, by common consent, very high. In a study for the Stockholm Environment Institute, Dr Schipper forecast that energy intensity would fall by 24 per cent by the year 2010 if existing trends continue. But if an 'efficiency push' was launched through a 25-50 per cent increase in energy prices, energy intensity would fall by 41 per cent. Some of the biggest gains would come through more efficient home heating, and a rise in the miles per gallon achieved by the average automobile from 26 to 35. But with a 'vigorous effort' based on energy prices 50-100 per cent higher, energy intensity could fall 60 per cent. Here, cars would do 60 mpg, aircraft would consume half as much fuel as they did in 1985, and home appliances 75 per cent less electricity than they do today. The spur to change on this scale, Dr Schipper says, would be 'a massive commitment to reducing carbon dioxide'. As things currently stand, however, changes of this order are little more than pie in the sky. The World Energy Congress concluded that the annual global increase in energy efficiency should be raised from its present level of 1.8 per cent to 2 per cent - a small enough rise in appearance but one which, in practice, could prove painfully hard to deliver. 'The message of the WEC is that western industrial countries can do something about energy efficiency, and ought to - to help conserve energy resources and protect the environment,' says Mr Richard Tinson, director of the National Energy Foundation, a UK charity which promotes energy efficiency in the home. But the sluggish response to calls for greater efficiency does not necessarily mean that the case for energy efficiency lacks force: the existence of a large energy efficiency industry, ranging from research through manufacturing to proliferating consultancies is evidence that large sums are spent in this area. However the case cannot have been made sufficiently convincingly if potential and reality remain so far apart. Time will tell whether the gap is due to imprudence or a hard-nosed reading of the facts.</p>

The press  service of the Russian Navy qualified the incident as "a  contact" of two U-boats.    Nobody was injured, the armaments and equipment of the  submarines are in due order and the radioactive situation is  normal, the press service said on Thursday, adding that the subs  returned to their base independently.    It was earlier reported that the "contact" resulted in  "inconsiderable damage" which poses no danger to either the  personnel or the environment. A source in the Northern Fleet  headquarters told TASS that both subs were submerged when one of  them, on her way to the surface, "touched" the other sub. The  source described the damage as "minor", adding that both vessels  were returning to the base without surfacing.</p>

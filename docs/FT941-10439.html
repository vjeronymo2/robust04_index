			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Stora returns to profit for year Stora, Europe's biggest forestry group, yesterday reported profits of SKr530m (Dollars 67m) for 1993, a sharp swing from the SKr1.42bn loss a year earlier. The company benefited from cost-cutting, the weaker Swedish krona, and a strong performance from its financial arm. It was able to increase production and deliveries, even though market conditions remained weak and local currency pulp and paper prices were below 1992 levels. The dividend was maintained at SKr6.50 per share. The weaker krona helped lift sales to SKr49.8bn, up 4.4 per cent. Cost reductions of more than SKr2bn and a hefty one-off gain from the sale of convertibles helped lift operating income to SKr1.38bn from SKr401m. The improvement would have been greater but for Stora's production base in hard currency European countries, particularly Germany. The improved overall result owed much to a sharp drop in financial expenses to SKr850m from SKr1.82bn. Stora Financial Services lifted profits to SKr802m from SKr279m. In the fourth quarter, Stora achieved a SKr236m profit, turning round a SKr926m deficit in the same 1992 period. The result benefited from some higher prices, indicating the market had bottomed. Stora said it had finalised terms to sell Tarkett, an international flooring company, to CWB Capital Partners, a London-based acquisition fund, for SKr3.46bn. The group will book a SKr800m pre-tax capital gain on the deal, to be included in its 1994 figures. Stora's shares climbed SKr7 to SKr462 on its better-than-expected performance.</p>

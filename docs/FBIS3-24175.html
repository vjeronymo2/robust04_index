			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Daiva Rinkeviciute: "The Independent Radio and </F> TV Stations Against National Monopoly of the Ether"]    [Text] Instead of their accustomed programs or music, the  listeners of the radio stations M1, RADIOCENTRAS (Radio Center),  VILNIAUS VARPAS (The Bell of Vilnius), ZNAD WILII, and the  viewers of TELE-3 and BALTIJOS TELEVIZIJA (Baltic Television)  heard the following text yesterday at 8 pm: "During this hour  we, the independent radio and television stations, are not  broadcasting our customary programs, because we want to warn  you, listeners and viewers, about the tragic consequences of the  monopoly and totalitarian control of Lithuania's ether for the  constitutional rights and freedoms of all the inhabitants of  Lithuania."    The text, which was interrupted by the main announcements of  those stations, was read for five minutes. Starting today, the  above-mentioned radio stations will be broadcasting  announcements five times a day, urging the people to clip and to  mail in questionnaires, published in the press, investigating  listeners' and viewers' opinions about the independent  television and radio stations.    Journalists were informed about this action, its causes and  purposes yesterday, at the Lithuanian Journalists Union.  Chairman of the governmental commission on the development of  radio and television, R. Jasinavicius, and the chairmen and  representatives of television channel TALE-3, television studio  BALTIJOS TELEVIZIJA, radio stations M1, RADIOCENTRAS, ZNAD  WILII, TITANIKA, as well as the leaders and representatives of  the radio station VILNIAUS VARPAS took part at the press  conference. They acquainted the journalists not only with their  action, but also with the statement which they had addressed to  the President of the Lithuanian Republic, the chairman of the  Parliament, and the Prime Minister. It states that in the area  of mass information media the government is not only  maintaining, but is also strengthening the monopoly, giving  priority to Lithuania's radio and television and monopolizing  the communications media.    According to the authors of the statement, an  anticonstitutional situation from the legal point of view has  been created in this area. The situation must be changed if the  freedom of expression is to be nurtured in Lithuania. The  authors demand that the planned raises for the rental of the  state radio and television means of communication be revoked and  that the Lithuanian Republic TV be decommercialized. Otherwise,  the independent television and radio stations will be destroyed  economically. They survive only from advertising, while the  state radio and television draws its income both from the  taxpayers pockets and from advertising.    The main purpose of the action is making equal the  conditions  under which both the state and the independent structures exist.    At the press conference it was mentioned that the  representatives of the independent radio and television stations  are not calling for a strike or some big action that would harm  the people of Lithuania and the organizers of such actions. They  will seek a convocation of an expanded Government session, with  the participation of the representatives of the mass information  media and of the interested departments, for the solution of the  strategic problems of Lithuania's electronic mass information  media.</p>

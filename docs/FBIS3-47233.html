This was emphasized by Sar Kheng,  deputy prime minister and co-interior minister, at a meeting on  Sunday, 9 January, with a U.S. congressional delegation led by  Mr. Wilson of the Foreign Relations Commission.    Mr. Sar Kheng briefed his guests about the recent  appointment  of provincial governors, the new administrative structures  organized in line with the principle of national reconciliation  and unity, and the mutual understanding between major political  parties elected to the National Assembly under the  clear-sightedness of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk.    For his part, Mr. Wilson commended the close cooperation  between the Cambodian People's Party and the FUNCINPEC [National  United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and  Cooperative Cambodia] Party. The United States, he added, is  delighted to see respect for human rights and for the Kingdom of  Cambodia's Constitution.    The U.S. senator expressed his confidence that the RGC would  be able to defend security and bring about peace for the  Cambodian people.    Mr. Charles Twining, U.S. ambassador to Cambodia was also  present at the audience.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Kuala Lumpur strong as Nikkei falls back Profit-taking by traders and domestic institutions left the Nikkei 225 average lower, in spite of arbitrage linked buying in the morning session, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 66.31 at 19,340.67 after a day's high of 19,454.79 and low of 19,277.26. Arbitrage buying countered early morning profit-taking, but large-lot sales by domestic institutions finally prompted a decline in the index. Volume was 282m shares, against 293m. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 2.89 to 1,522.01 and the Nikkei 300 eased 0.90 to 280.86. Losers led gainers by 534 to 465, with 195 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index shed 2.52 to 1,265.25. Traders said corporate profit-taking, to realise profits ahead of the March year-end, would continue. While public postal insurance and state pension funds supported shares against the prospect of a sharp fall during October and November, analysts expect such purchases to wane during the second half to March. 'The funds probably have not much over Y500bn left available for investment within this fiscal year,' commented Mr Jason James at James Capel. Some dealers expected that, in order to generate funds, public fund managers would take profits when the index rose. 'It could mean more selling pressure ahead of the March year-end,' said a Japanese brokerage official. Individual investors traded in the second section and over-the-counter market. The second section index, however declined 7.20 to 2,066.01. High-technology issues, bought recently on the 'multimedia' theme, retreated on profit-taking. Hitachi fell Y9 to Y960 and Sony Y20 to Y5,530. Japan Tobacco rose Y12,000 to Y936,000 on buying by overseas investors and banks. Traders said many investors felt that profit-taking in the stock had run its course. Drugs companies, which had been bought by investors attracted by low valuations, receded on profit-taking. Tanabe Seiyaku shed Y31 to Y789 and Taisho Pharmaceutical Y40 to Y1,810. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 50.18 to 21,096.03 in volume of 136.8m shares. Turnover ballooned due to cross-trading, or selling and buying back of shares by the same investor. Roundup A number of factors influenced the region's trading yesterday. KUALA LUMPUR extended the week's strong climb, the composite index adding 15.98 or 1.7 per cent at 982.17, helped by gains in key blue chip stocks. The index has risen 3.7 per cent since Monday morning. Dealers said some of the buying was linked to renewed talk that the government might call a general election early next year instead of waiting until October. SEOUL saw a technical rally after recent losses, with broad gains seen among smaller-capitalised shares. The composite index firmed 2.86 to 1,026.85. Samsung Electronics gained Won2,500 at Won109,500 on the belief that the share price had now bottomed, while the company's plan to buy back its own shares also bolstered investor sentiment. HONG KONG encountered some late selective buying which overcame early profit-taking, although trade was relatively slow as many major investors had already closed their books for the holidays. The Hang Seng index was finally ahead 64.23 at 8,331.56, after a day's low of 8,230.32, in turnover of HKDollars 2.8bn. TAIPEI moved higher on bargain hunting in strong industrials. The weighted index rose 85.32 or 1.2 per cent to 7,010.60 and turnover was heavy at TDollars 102bn. Brokers remarked that the release of November export orders helped to strengthen investor optimism. Textiles were the main gainers, Hualon rising by the daily 7 per cent limit to TDollars 38.30 and Chung Shing TDollars 1.40 to TDollars 22.80. MANILA surged following the US Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady. The composite index advanced 50.55 to 2,790.59. All sectors posted rises, with commercial-industrial stocks leading the way and adding 60.12 at 4,097.29. SYDNEY closed higher in subdued pre-Christmas trading, boosted by a stronger golds sector. The All Ordinaries index rose 6.9 to 1,905.5, while the golds group moved ahead 27.8 or 1.5 per cent to 1,867.0. Volume was 158m shares worth ADollars 525m. BOMBAY held firm in low volume on late buying by local funds, combined with purchases by jobbers covering their year-end short positions. The BSE-30 index edged 15.05 higher to 3,912.63. SINGAPORE was relieved that the Federal Reserve had not acted to increase US interest rates and the Straits Times Industrial index jumped 34.02 to 2,217.48 in improved volume of 136m shares.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Management: Men with a mission - More companies are putting corporate values into words On every desk at Dun &amp; Bradstreet is inscribed a corporate prayer. 'As the men and women who are The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corporation, we are a team - One Company united through shared values' it begins, inciting the 56,000 employees to 'strive relentlessly' and to 'work to be the best'. In the 2,000 heel bars of the Minit Corporation around the world is a framed statement declaring that the company's mind is 'positive, optimistic and determined'. In the pockets of every Motorola worker is a laminated card bearing that company's mantra. Corporate values have come out of the closet. In the last few years most big US organisations have felt the need to make a public statement about what they believe in, what they are about and where they are going. The trend has now crossed the Atlantic. According to a report by Digital Corporation, some 80 per cent of British companies have put their values into words. There is no standard form to these pronouncements. Some are just a line or two, others run to a small volume. Some take the shape of 'mission' or 'vision' statements, setting strategic goals for the business as a whole, while others lay down standards of behaviour of the people inside the organisation. But all are trying to capture the essence of the company: to find something that will tie a diverse group of people and interests to a single goal or set of values. It is no surprise that these statements have recently caught on. As the old hierarchies within companies have toppled, employees have had to take more decisions for themselves. 'If you flatten an organisation, people have nothing else to turn to when they make judgments,' says John Humble, the management consultant who prepared the report for Digital. At the same time shareholders have increasingly demanded clear statements from companies justifying their existence. The most common form of mission statement involves a description - usually spelt out in the annual report - of the company's aims. This can range from the banal to the baroque, and may include a statement of its values. At one extreme is 'Ikea's Business Idea', which simply states as its guiding principle: 'We shall offer a wide range of home furnishing, items of good design and function, at prices so low, that the majority of people can afford to buy them.' At the other extreme is the Body Shop which proclaims in giant type on the back of its annual report: 'Make compassion, care, harmony and trust the foundation stones of business. Fall in love with new ideas.' Other companies state goals that reach beyond their actual business: J Sainsbury rather grandly talks not just of selling groceries but of 'contributing to the public good and to the quality of life in the community'. When it comes to listing their values, the same ones appear again and again: most companies cite the need to care for people, customers, quality, competitiveness, innovation, the community and the environment. Yet not all statements are so fashion conscious, nor so bland. The Yorkshire conglomerate BBA unashamedly announces: 'The Victorian work ethic is not an antique,' and 'grit and gumption are preferable to inertia and intellect.' But how worthwhile are these statements? Some seem so obvious as to be barely worth saying, while others are hard to say while keeping a straight face. Academic evidence from the US suggests that companies with a strong mission tend to have outperformed their competitors, but then those companies seem to be better managed generally. The mere existence of a statement of corporate values or of a mission appears to have little, if any, effect on a company's performance. The Digital survey shows that more than 60 per cent of value statements are not strictly adhered to by managers, let alone by the rest of the workforce. This is an alarming finding, as a statement which is not being followed properly can be a liability. 'If you bang on about a mission that is not believed, you are devaluing management,' says Mike Jeans of consultants KPMG. So how can companies make their statements work better? Philip Mellor from Dun &amp; Bradstreet says the company's value statement is part of a broad programme of cultural change. To make the values stick, everyone is trained for five days every year and employees are rewarded on how well they live up to the values. The Minit Corporation claims that its statement has been a success partly because it consulted 300 managers in 27 countries before the final draft was drawn up. However, not everyone agrees that companies should have value statements at all. According to Andrew Campbell of Ashridge Strategic Management Centre, statements are really only helpful in companies that already live by them. They are an aide memoire, but not of much use in motivating people or in helping them change their behaviour. A case in point is Marks and Spencer, which has grown a strong sense of corporate value without any formal statement. 'We do not hand out principles like the 10 Commandments and say thou shalt abide by them,' says a company spokesman. Campbell argues that companies should initially limit themselves to the flattest statements of what they do, and perhaps what it wants to be. 'But the 'I believe' stuff is very dangerous. If you write it, you'd better believe it,' he warns. No doubt BBA really does believe its philosophy of hard grind; whether all those companies that declare a belief in their people or in the environment live up to their words is another matter.</p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Doubt cast on minimum-wage link to job losses RESEARCH on the effect of wages councils on employment in the UK has cast doubt on the assumption that the introduction of a national minimum wage, as proposed by Labour, would lead to a significant increase in unemployment. Mr Stephen Machin and Mr Alan Manning argue in a paper for the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics that the minimum wages set by wages councils for about 2.5m workers have not reduced employment. 'If anything,' they say, 'there is weak evidence that they have increased it.' They say that researchers who have concluded that a minimum wage would increase unemployment have not looked at the economics of particular sections of the labour market. They also point to the fact that employment of women continued to rise after the 1970 Equal Pay Act. The paper notes that the toughness of the control imposed by wages councils declined in the 1980s as a result of government intervention, but there was no corresponding increase in employment. Indeed, when wages councils were tougher there was a positive effect on employment. 'Employment has declined as a result of the decreasing effectiveness of the wages councils, an effect that seems particularly strong in the catering sector,' they conclude. 'Our findings cannot tell us anything about the employment effects of a minimum wage at Pounds 3.40 an hour. However, they do question proposals aimed at abolishing the wages council system on the grounds that it inhibits job creation.' Letters, Page 19</p>

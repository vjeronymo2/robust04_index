			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Spain eases withholding tax refunds to foreigners THE SPANISH Treasury is preparing new rules to facilitate the quick repayment of a 25 per cent withholding tax on government bonds bought by foreign investors. Mr Manuel Conthe, the chief of the Treasury, said yesterday the new regulations would mean non-resident bond holders would be paid back their withholding tax within one or two days. The tax was effectively abolished at the beginning of this year but repayments are cumbersome. 'The idea is that the foreign investor will not even notice that the tax has been withheld,' he said. At present, foreign bond holders have to go through a cumbersome procedure to claim the tax back after cashing in their coupons. Proof of non-residence has to be obtained from the tax authority in their country of residence and posted to Madrid. Return of the tax can take months. Mr Conthe said the new procedure, currently being worked out with the Bank of Spain, would enable the Bank automatically to refund withheld amounts to non-residents as soon as it received its list of debt holders. This could take one to two days. Since April 1987 the Bank of Spain has run a book entry system to provide information, clearing and custody services for Treasury instruments. He said it was impossible to abolish the tax as domestic investors would still have to pay it. The Treasury, he said, wanted to make the new system as watertight as possible to prevent local investors from buying bonds through foreign institutions to escape the tax as well. He said the move had been prompted by a sudden surge of foreign interest this year in Spain's three and five-year bonds. In the expectation of further interest rate falls in Spain, the value of bonds held by foreigners has tripled this year to Dollars 12bn. Mr Conthe said the measure would probably be introduced in June, when the Treasury also plans to launch a new instrument - mainly for domestic investors - to replace its low yield Pagares del Tesoro (promissory notes) which have been used to draw untaxed income into the system. Interest in the pagares has fallen off sharply in the last two years and Mr Conthe said they would be replaced by Special Public Debt. This would yield 2 per cent (the pagares yield about 5 per cent) and mature over 6 years. Their advantage is that holders would be guaranteed protection from the tax authority. Madrid has been loathe to declare a tax amnesty on black market money in circulation in Spain, which some estimates put as high as Dollars 40bn. Although the Special Public Debt instrument is not expected to attract much interest, it is the closest the government has come to compromising with opposition calls for a general amnesty.</p>

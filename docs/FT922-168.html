			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Dividend reality INEXORABLY, dividend cuts are moving closer to the centre of the British corporate establishment. Companies like Lonrho and Pilkington have led the way: yesterday, British Steel also wielded the axe, and it seems inevitable that the uncovered payout at British Petroleum will soon be pruned heavily following last week's boardroom coup. On a trailing one-year basis, aggregate dividends in the UK are still showing a nominal gain of about 1 per cent, but that implies a fall in real terms, the first since the last recession ten years ago. During the 1980s, British companies became very keen to satisfy the hunger of their institutional shareholders for higher dividends. Although profits have been falling for two years now, the dividend response has been slow. Cover in aggregate is down to the historically very low level of about 1.7 times, and excluding the still well-heeled utilities it may be only about 1.5 times. Under pressure from their shareholders, British companies appear to have accepted that dividend payments should be smoothed over an economic cycle, generously interpreted. The extreme case of this may be the composite insurance sector, where many payments have been maintained or even increased, in the face of serious losses. But this attitude has emphasised the dangers of a downturn which might prove protracted. Britain's present recession, as it seeks to adjust to the rigours of the European exchange rate mechanism, is much more than a simple 1960s-style four-year cycle. The inflexible attitude to dividends has posed the risk that some companies might seriously deplete their capital resources, and that there would have to be a confrontation with reality as a hoped-for early profits recovery failed to materialise. We are now at that critical stage. It is important now that a more flexible approach should be restored. Companies should not allow themselves to be put under pressure to weaken their balance sheets or to abandon capital spending required to secure their longer-term competitive position. Unfortunately, the BP example appears to show that fundamental dividend misalignments are often tackled through violent boardroom upheavals rather than through orderly responses. And the severe share price reaction at BP implies that the stock market is still not disposed to view such adjustments constructively. But the dividend-paying abilities of British companies are bound to be curtailed over the next several years, a reality to which the market has begun to adjust over the past few weeks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] South Korea yesterday proposed a "multilateral  framework" for security in Northeast Asia as senior officials  convened for the first multilateral discussion on security in  Southeast Asia.    "We have in mind the establishment of a Northeast Asia  security dialogue which will go in tandem with the ASEAN  Regional Forum," South Korea's Assistant Minister for Foreign  Affairs Yi Chang-chun told reporters. "Our idea, however, is in  the formative stage. We have yet to develop it," he added.    Mr Yi made the remarks before South Korea's paper on  security  cooperation was to be discussed yesterday afternoon by officials  convened at the special preparatory meeting for the ASEAN  Regional Forum being held in July. Citing historical realities,  difference in political systems and economic development, the  paper advocated a "gradual approach" to multilateral security  cooperation in Northeast Asia. The paper stressed the need for  respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-aggression  and restraint. It also emphasized the need to remove mutual  distrust and build mutual confidence. The paper argued for  regional cooperation to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    "While making continued efforts to resolve North Korea's  nuclear issue within the existing framework and on the basis of  international consensus, cooperation among the countries in the  region is needed to strengthen the global regimes for the  non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction," the paper  said. "Regional cooperation is also needed in other fields of  arms control, including the regulation of missile technology,"  the paper added. But preventive diplomacy, particularly  conflict prevention, is crucial to security cooperation in  Northeast Asia, it went on.    For the benefit of "enhancing transparency," the South  Korean  paper called for exchange and discussion of defense white  papers, provision of data to the United Nations Register of  Conventional Arms, regular meetings of defense officials, and  exchange visits of military personnel and of naval vessels. The  paper also suggested cooperation in non-combat activities, joint  training programs and participation in UN peacekeeping  operations.</p>

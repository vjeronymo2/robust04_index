			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Ex-Drexel executives settle charges TWO former senior executives of the defunct US investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charges that they had failed to supervise properly Mr Michael Milken, former head of Drexel's high-yield bond department. This year, he completed a jail term for securities fraud. Mr Fred Joseph, Drexel's former chief executive, and Mr Edwin Kantor, former senior executive vice-president, were barred by the SEC from any supervisory role in a broking or dealing firm for three years. Both men neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.</p>

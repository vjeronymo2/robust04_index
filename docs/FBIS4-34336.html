			<p>BFN     [Text] One hundred seventy state and self-employed workers  as well as pensioners from Guisa Municipality have applied for  land grants to begin producing coffee in the mountains of Granma  Province. The need to increase coffee production, a source of  hard currency for Cuba, as well as a way of repopulating the  mountain region of Guisa, which has a shortage of workers, was  stressed in a meeting with 18 of these applicants.    Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales and Alfredo  Enriquez Pina announced that these workers and their relatives  add up to 472 people; they can tend an area of 387 caballerias  for coffee production. Jordan added that this situation is  under study to set up contracts and to grant the land to them,  since in the mountain regions of the country, there are  approximately 2,000 caballerias that the state cannot make  productive because of labor force shortages.    Alfredo Enriquez Pina stated that everyone moving to the  mountains, people with demonstrated revolutionary aptitudes,  people able to make the land produce, people able to repopulate  the mountains, and zealous guardians of the Revolution must be  given incentives.</p>

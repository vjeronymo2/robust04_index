			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 16 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Nicaraguan  Government and an IMF mission today signed a letter of intent  and concluded the negotiation process of the second phase of the  structural adjustment program.    Central Bank President Jose Evenor Taboada, who, together  with Finance Minister Emilio Pereira, was one of the signers of  the document, confirmed the signing of the document to NOTIMEX.  According to Taboada, the next step is the internal approval  procedure at the IMF Directorate in Washington.    With the signing of the letter of intent, which includes the  terms of the economic program and a request for credit from the  financial organization, the government concluded its difficult  negotiations on the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility  (ESAF) program, which is scheduled to be signed in June, Taboada  confirmed. The IMF technical delegation, which had been in  Nicaragua for one week, returned to Washington on Saturday, he  added.    The Central Bank president predicted that the accord's  ratification will not encounter problems within the IMF  Directorate because it is backed by a prior agreement with the  administration of the international organization. Taboada told  NOTIMEX: Having reached an agreement with the administration --  of the IMF -- we do not believe there will be a problem in  approving the adjustment program which guarantees $140 million  in credits to Nicaragua over the next three years. The signing  of the ESAF is linked to foreign aid, which will total $600  million in 1994. This aid will come from the international  banking community and donor countries on the condition that the  adjustment measures continue to be implemented.    Criticism from political and labor sectors opposed to the  conditions imposed by the ESAF was called manipulative by  Taboada, who explained that the cost will be greater if the  measures are not implemented. The official said he was  confident that the implementation of the economic program would  not prompt violence, strikes, or social protests that have led  to economic losses in previous years. He said: I trust people  "will not be swayed by the agitation of some sectors which,  because of a lack of information or special interests," oppose  this agreement.    The program includes a reduction of 13,000 government jobs  over the next three years. It also calls for the privatization  of the telephone company and water works, the liberalization of  fuel distribution, and the reorganization of education and  health budgets.    The government has announced the creation of 84,000 jobs,  including both primary and secondary jobs, and it promised to  give greater support to agriculture production in order to  attain the official GDP growth target of 4 percent by the end of  1994.</p>

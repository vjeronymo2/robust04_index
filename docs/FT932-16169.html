			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Arts: Overwhelming sentimentality It is good to see a lovely theatre full and humming, even if you do not much like the play. So it was at Richmond on Monday for Ivan Menchell's gloomy-sounding, but in fact remarkably cheerful The Cemetery Club. Menchell is the only student of the Yale School of Drama so far to have written a play which moved to Broadway while he was still studying. That was in 1990. The Cemetery Club has since been turned into a movie not yet released outside the US. Meanwhile the stage version is touring Britain and if the Richmond reception is anything to go by, is going down a treat. The style is heavily sentimental Jewish American and the influence of Neil Simon, whose Lost in Yonkers is still playing in London, is pervasive. It would not normally be to my taste. Yet there is at least one scene in this production by David Taylor that redeems it all. Taylor also directs Lost in Yonkers. Whether it is his particular understanding of this kind of Jewish humour that makes the show, or the outstanding performances by three actresses, is hard to say. But I doubt if you can see Millicent Martin, Anne Charleston and Judy Cornwell, all of whom must be slightly over 29, dressed as bridesmaids in little girl blue after having been to a girl friend's umpteenth wedding, and having drunk too much wine, without feeling a pang of pure pleasure. They command the stage and it would be invidious to say which one comes out on top: they support each other. For the rest, the sentimentality is a little overwhelming. The Cemetery Club is actually a group of widows who go to visit their husband's graves, clear up the leaves, polish the tombstones and talk to their husbands as if they were still alive every month. Meanwhile they think from time to time of finding a new man. The women remain very close even while they bitch. There is not much more to it but perhaps it is close to the truth. A hardened theatre-goer told me at the interval that not long ago his 80-year-old mother-in-law had met her second husband in very similar circumstances - visiting the burial place of the first. Richmond Theatre. (081) 940 0220 till Saturday, then Peterborough, Woking, Canterbury, Swindon and Wolverhampton.</p>

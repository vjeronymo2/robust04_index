			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / CBI finds evidence of growing price pressure Manufacturers are enjoying a surge in exports but plan to increase prices in the face of rising costs, according to the Confederation of British Industry's latest quarterly survey of industrial trends. The survey showed that more manufacturers were planning to increase domestic prices in the next four months than at any time since January 1991. The CBI survey also found that: Business optimism increased over the quarter. Investment intentions improved, with the number of companies planning to invest in new plant and equipment reaching its highest level since April 1989. Fewer jobs are being lost than at any time since October 1989. While the signs of an export-led recovery and higher manufacturing investment may be welcome to the government, the news of potential inflationary pressures raised fears that further interest rate increases might be announced this year. The CBI's findings on price expectations were one of the factors cited by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, when they increased base rates last month. CBI surveys deduct the proportion of those expecting a factor to decline from those expecting it to increase, and express the result as a percentage balance. The balance of companies expecting to raise prices in the next four months was 20 per cent, up from 12 per cent in the last quarterly survey and 15 per cent in the CBI's monthly trends report in September. The survey showed that a balance of 9 per cent of companies increased domestic prices in the past four months - the highest since early 1991. The CBI said that the pattern of price rises was mixed, with some industries still reporting declines. It added that manufacturers' expectations of higher prices did not always translate into reality. Mr Jonathan Loynes, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, calculated on a seasonally adjusted basis that the balance of companies expecting higher prices was unchanged in October, from the 22 per cent recorded in September. The CBI said that manufacturers' costs had been rising more strongly than expected. The balance of those reporting higher costs increased from 3 per cent in July to 19 per cent in October. Signs of potential inflationary pressure were evident in the fall in the proportion of companies working below capacity. At 51 per cent, down from 54 per cent in July, this is at its lowest since July 1990, and is below its long-term average. Companies may be responding to impending capacity constraints by increasing their investment plans. The balance of companies planning to increase investment in plant and machinery was 16 per cent, up from 6 per cent in July. Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said: 'The improvement in investment intentions is encouraging, but it will need to be sustained for a long time if we are to narrow the investment gap with our major competitors.' Export orders increased at their fastest rate since April 1988, with a balance of 17 per cent of companies reporting an increase. This trend is expected to continue in the next four months, with the balance of companies expecting higher export deliveries - 25 per cent - at its highest since this question was first asked in 1977. The survey was conducted between September 23 and October 12 and covered 1,064 companies in 50 industries.</p>

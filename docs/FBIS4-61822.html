			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sevindzh Abdullayeva, Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku, 9 May--At a news conference today, Russian  Federation special envoy Vladimir Kazimirov set out Russia's  conceptual approaches to settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict and eliminating its consequences. The diplomat  explained the need for the news conference by a desire to  clarify the main points of a Russian draft plan for settling the  armed conflict in order to dispel conjectures surrounding it.    In connection with this, Kazimirov stressed with regret that  some commentators on the draft had been trying to accuse Russia  of "a striving to implement its imperial ambitions" and "an  obvious preference for a particular side." According to him,  this is being done in order to discredit Russian policy in the  region. On the other hand, he noted, certain forces understand  that if the conflict is settled with Russia's active  involvement, this will strengthen Russia's influence in the  Transcaucasus, something they obviously dislike.    According to the diplomat, his country is pursuing the only  goal of establishing good and efficient relations with  Azerbaijan and Armenia. He specifically stressed that "a bias  toward either side would be Russia's historical miscalculation,  something it cannot afford."    Touching upon the much talked about issue of Russia's  striving to station its troops in Azerbaijan under the guise of  peacekeeping forces, the special envoy noted that "even earlier  his country offered to bring disengagement forces into the  region, believing this form to be the most efficient one for  resolving the conflict." However, Kazimirov said, the  institution of international observers cannot be efficient in  this case, in the absence of a stable cease-fire and an end of  hostilities.    According to the Russian ambassador, consensus between the  sides has been attained to date, perhaps in the view that the  conflict cannot be settled in one step and should be resolved  stage-by-stage. The Russian draft plan, which consists of three  principal stages, Kazimirov said, is based on precisely this  premise. The first stage includes a reliably secured cease-fire  and an end to hostilities and should take six days to achieve,  including the disengagement of forces. The second stage  envisages withdrawal from all the occupied territories (except  Shusha and Lachin), a quick exchange of prisoners and hostages,  the restoration of communications, and the return of refugees to  their native land. The draft assigns 34 days to complete all  this.    The issue of freeing Shusha and Lachin will be examined  separately two weeks after cease-fire is established. The third  stage is for negotiations to study the issue of Nagornyy  Karabakh's [Nagorno-Karabakh's] status.    At the same time, Kazimirov did not rule out a possibility  of  the second and third stages taking considerably more time than  envisaged, for "this is a very complicated process."</p>

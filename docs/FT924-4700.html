			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Thames gets boost from SelecTV SELECTV, the independent production company responsible for hits such as Birds of a Feather is moving its production base from Elstree Studios to the Thames Television complex at Teddington. The decision is a significant boost to Thames as it trys to build up its non-broadcasting business in advance of this month's loss of its ITV licence. The SelecTV contract, worth at least Pounds 1m a year in production facilities is the largest won by Thames so far. SelecTV decided to give up on Elstree after trying unsuccessfully for two years to buy the studios from its present owners Brent Walker. Mr Michael Pilsworth, director of UK operations for Select said the facilities at Elstree had been progressively reduced to cut costs. 'The difference between a warehouse and a television studio is show business. They took all the show business out,' Mr Pilsworth said yesterday. If Thames succeeds in raising the money to go ahead with the new Channel 5 - the deadline is this Friday - it could become a broadcaster again and might lose its status as an independent producer. A joint venture with Select could then be a useful way of keeping part of the benefit of being classed an independent producer. ITV has to buy at least 25 per cent of its programmes from the independent sector.</p>

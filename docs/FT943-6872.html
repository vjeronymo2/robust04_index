			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Observer: Munk &amp; Co When Brian Mulroney, the ex-Canadian prime minister, joined the board of Peter Munk's American Barrick, the feisty North American gold producer, it looked like the Hungarian-born entrepreneur was just adding another trophy name to his letterhead. However, word is Mulroney has been earning his keep. He has been jetting around the world on American Barrick business introducing executives to the president of Bolivia and opening doors in China. Indeed, an awe-struck Barrick official recounts how Mulroney called him from Russia this week to find out how the bid for Lac Minerals was going. Mulroney was asked whether he was speaking from a secure line. It could hardly be more secure, was the response: 'Boris Yeltsin is in the room next door.' However, one member of Barrick team who doesn't seem to have been earning his keep is Munk's highly-paid new spin-doctor, David Wynne-Morgan, the former head of Hill &amp; Knowlton's European operations, hired two months ago. Since then Munk has done two of his most ambitious deals - Horsham's bid for a chunk of Trizec and now Lac Minerals - and Wynne-Morgan has missed most of the action. The excuse seems to be that his contract doesn't start till September 1 and anyway he has been in touch with Munk from Italy and from the QEII where he has been lecturing passengers. Better check the fine print in those share options, Morgan.</p>

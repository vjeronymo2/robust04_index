			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the al-Ibrahimi Mosque Martyrs Group of </F> the PFLP-GC; place and date not given -- read by announcer]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. Salute of the armed struggle, the only way to  liberate Palestine; salute of the blessed intifadah, which  forged the most splendid feats of struggle; salute from the  honorable ones to other honorable ones: We in the group of the  holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque Martyrs [majmu'at shuhada' al-haram  al-ibrahimi]-the Janin area claim responsibility for the  following armed intifadah operations against enemy patrols:    --Throwing a hand grenade at the entrance of Qabatiyah on 3  April 1994.    --Throwing a hand grenade at the martyrs' triangle  [muthallath al-shuhada'] on 8 April 1994. Enemy troops opened  fire in a hysterical way. They also fired flares, closed the  roads, and began a large-scale search for those who carried out  the two operations, who returned safely to base.    We pledge to our heroic people to be the faithful ones in  our  struggle to liberate all Palestine and also to proceed on the  path of martyrs. It is a continuous intifadah until the land  and man are liberated.    [Signed] Your brothers in the group of the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque  Martyrs, PFLP-GC</p>

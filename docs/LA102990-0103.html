			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN RACE TO ADJOURN, CRANSTON FINISHES OUT OF THE MONEY  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) came up a penny, nickel, dime, quarter and  half-dollar short early Sunday in his bid to push a coin-redesign bill through  Congress.  </P> <P> After failing to attach the measure to a landmark housing bill that he  co-authored, Cranston tried in the waning hours before adjournment to tack it  on to a pair of smaller bills.  </P> <P> But the effort went for naught.  </P> <P> New York socialite Diane Wolf, 36, a frequent companion of the 76-year-old  senator and the daughter of a wealthy Texas oilman and a member of the federal  Commission on Fine Arts, has lobbied actively for the bill, which calls for  redesigning the reverse side of the penny, nickel, dime, quarter and  half-dollar. The reverse side is opposite the profiles of U.S. Presidents.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), co-author of the housing bill, said that he  had moved to prevent Cranston's coin measure from being added to his  legislation. "I believe in following the regular order," Gonzalez said,  referring to rules that are intended to exclude provisions not germane to a  bill.  </P> <P> Cranston also sought to insert the coin bill in the $490-billion  deficit-reduction package passed by Congress on Saturday, but that move was  thwarted by Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley), the House Budget Committee  chairman.  </P> <P> The bill would have required the Treasury secretary, in selecting new designs,  to choose from several "constitutional concepts": freedom of speech and  assembly, freedom of the press, the right to due process of law, the right to a  trial by jury, the right to equal protection under the law, the right to vote  and "the constitutional principle of separation of powers, including the  independence of the judiciary."  </P> <P> The legislation died with the adjournment of the 101st Congress, although it  could be reintroduced when the new Congress convenes in January.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hanoi VNA May 13 -- The European Union (EU) hoped  that the relations of lasting and all-sided cooperation between  EU and Vietnam would be strengthened in the fields of economy,  industry, investment, insurance, services, science and research,  mutual commerce, culture, agriculture, and so on, said the EU  ambassador in Vietnam.    Mr. J. Gwyn Morgan, EU ambassador to Vietnam-head of the  delegation of the Commission of the European Communities, was  speaking at a press conference held in Hanoi in May 11 afternoon  on the occasion of seminar entitled Single European Market  organized in the city from May 11-12.    The seminar provided information about the single European  market, the role and functioning of the EU, including  EU-Vietnamese bilateral relations, legal matters, technical  standards, marketing and distribution of which main branches are  textiles, garments, processed food and food processing, seafood,  tropical fruit and vegetables, footwear, leather and leather  products.    The seminar was held by EC with assistance from the Societe  General de Development S.A., OAV (the German East Asia  Association), Ernst and Young, and the Vietnam Chamber of  Commerce and Industry, and the Ministry of Trade.    In the years 1986-1990, the two-way trade value between EC  and Vietnam increased 100 million ECU every year. In 1993 alone  it exceeded one billion U.S. dollars, Mr Morgan noted. He said  he hoped before autumn a framework agreement of cooperation  between the EU and Vietnam would be signed. First of all, he  said, a coordination office of EU will be opened in Hanoi in  June this year.    On EC programme relating to Vietnamese non-refugees from  camps in Southeast Asia, he said the programme would conclude at  the end of Nov. 1994. That does not mean the EU will not  continue to be concerned in the international and bilateral  efforts to the Vietnamese Government to help the refugees  return, he stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Liberation Front [FLN] party is one  which believes in dialogue and national reconciliation. In  response to an invitation from Mr. Youcef el-Khatib, adviser at  the presidency, to attend a meeting on the appointment of  provisional council members on 20 April, the FLN said that it  would not attend this meeting because it was not concerned with  the council's formation. The FLN did not attend the national  consensus conference and therefore was under no obligation to  implement the conference's resolutions.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Buxton seeks to reassure Barclays shareholders MR ANDREW Buxton, Barclays' new chief executive officer and chairman-designate, yesterday contacted institutional shareholders to reassure them about plans for him to hold both offices. Following Barclays' annual meeting yesterday, Mr Buxton acknowledged that some shareholders were concerned about the concentration of authority in a single individual and said he contacted shareholders to allay their concerns. 'What they want is proper checks and balances,' he said, adding that steps have been taken to insure that. Much operational authority will be devolved to four divisional chiefs within Barclays as well as to Mr Peter Wood, finance director. Sir Peter Middleton, deputy chairman, will have input into corporate decision making, and 'he's no shrinking violet', Mr Buxton said. The decision by Barclays' board to continue combining the roles of chairman and chief executive flies in the face of pressure from institutional shareholders for UK companies to improve corporate governance. Since Mr Buxton's dual role was announced earlier this week, following the retirement of Sir John Quinton, institutional investors have expressed disquiet. 'At the point where other companies are splitting the roles, I do not understand why Barclays is consolidating them,' said the investment director at one UK life insurance company. Barclays is the only UK bank to combine the roles of chairman and chief executive. Separately, Mr Buxton said Barclays would face stiff competition from a merger of its two smaller competitors, Lloyds Bank and Midland Bank. 'Eventually it will be a more formidable competitor but it will take their eye off the ball for a while,' Mr Buxton said. Full integration of the two could take three to four years, he added. In the meantime, Barclays will seek to cut costs, largely in its retail operations, and there will be further branch closures, he said. At the company's AGM yesterday, Sir John was the target of a bucket of white paint spilt on him by 'an elderly gentleman'. Knives in the boardroom, Page 11</p>

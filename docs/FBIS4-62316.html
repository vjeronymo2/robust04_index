			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer Yevgeniy Kiselev] Another step taken  by Russian diplomacy was the meeting in Geneva two days ago  between foreign ministers of Russia and a number of Western  countries, who discussed the situation in Bosnia. Moscow still  insists that the Bosnian conflict can only be settled through  negotiations. [passage omitted]    [Begin Kozyrev recording] There were breaks during the  meeting, at times some of those attending left the conference  room to talk one-to-one. Fortunately, it did not spill out into  any violence, but there were quite a few dramatic moments. [end  recording] [passage omitted]    [Begin Kozyrev recording] Until now, until yesterday, the  U.S. side had not once associated itself with those figures, 49  and 51 percent. Why? Because Washington had always believed  that the Muslim, or the Muslim-Croat, side has to be heard  first, and that their proposals should form the basis for  further work. In their latest proposals signed in Vienna, the  Muslim-Croat side claimed as much as 58 percent of the  territory. I can easily imagine, from my endless contacts with  the sides, that both the Muslims can as yet claim up to 90  percent, and the Serbs, who also have some hotheads among them,  can also claim up to 90 percent, leaving their neighbors with  just a tiny stretch of land.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Beaches (Pages 186&hyph;187)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The outdoor developed areas subcommittee also examined beach facilities and recommended that an accessible route be provided to a point 36 inches beyond the water's edge at high tide. The subcommittee stated that a stable, firm and slip resistant surface may be accomplished by using permanent materials (e.g., concrete, wood, or plastic decking); temporary, removable materials (e.g., mats or mesh) during daylight hours; or a combination of both. Water level changes due to tides, shifting shorelines, and erosion may impact on potential solutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 14: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Should an accessible route be required to the water? If so, where should it be located? Should a temporary accessible route be allowed where a permanent one is not practicable or feasible?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Snow Facilities (Pages 190&hyph;201)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The outdoor developed areas subcommittee also examined skiing and a variety of other snow activities. The subcommittee recommended that accessible parking spaces be located a maximum of 300 feet from base area facilities or other snow area activities, unless an accessible transportation option is provided. The subcommittee also proposed the concept of a snow access route. The subcommittee noted that the ANSI B77.1 committee is conducting research on accessibility requirements for lifts and has recommended that guidelines for lifts be reserved pending the research, except for loading and unloading areas and lift corrals and waiting areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 15: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  What are the critical access issues for individuals with disabilities in snow facilities? The Access Board is interested in receiving additional information on ski lift access.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Facility Types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 16: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Are there other types of recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas that are not addressed in the committee's report? If so, the Access Board is interested in receiving information on providing access to those facilities and areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Recreation Access Advisory Committee has performed an invaluable public service by gathering information on diverse types of recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas; involving other interested persons in its work; and attempting to build consensus on possible solutions for providing access to these facilities and areas. The Access Board wants to encourage greater public participation as it develops a notice of proposed rulemaking establishing accessibility guidelines for newly constructed and altered recreation facilities and outdoor developed areas and invites comments on the committee's report. The comments will be considered along with the committee's report as the Access Board develops the notice of proposed rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authorized by vote of the Access Board on July 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Judith E.

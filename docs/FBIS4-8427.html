			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by O. Korinek, TA SR correspondent in Washington: </F> "Partnership for Peace a Priority; Prior to Strobe Talbott's  Visit to Bratislava"]    [Text] Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of state, is  the thus-far highest U.S. representative to visit independent  Slovakia. What is even more important, however, is that he is  the author of the Partnership for Peace project, which sets the  tone of current activities and considerations concerning points  of departure and solutions to European security.    His visit is taking place at a time when U.S. relations with  Central Europe assume, so it seems, a new dynamism. This is  because the domestic political scene in Russia, on which the  United States almost exclusively and, perhaps, idealistically  concentrated at the beginning of the Clinton administration, has  undergone substantial changes in the course of the past year.  The almost conflict-free partner Russia--let us only recall the  Vancouver summit--has begun to act as a power with its own  foreign political interests that it wants to assert. That these  need not always tally with U.S. interests is borne out by Strobe  Talbott's words in the U.S. Congress that "we will cooperate  with the Russians where we will be able to, and, in areas where  we will not be able to cooperate, we will have to find ways of  minimizing the deterioration of the problem involved and of  [U.S.-Russian] relations in general."    During the Cold War, the United States spent considerable  efforts and resources to defeat communism. It is therefore in  its interest not to squander the political capital it gained  with the fall of communism. And, as the hopes pinned on Russia  are becoming increasingly problematic, Central Europe, where the  thrust toward Western-type democracy is much less problematic  and which could also form a geographic dam against opposite  tendencies, is moving into the foreground.    It is therein that one must seek the roots of the  intensifying dynamism of U.S. relations toward Central Europe.  Partnership for Peace is not only a security issue, but also a  supremely political issue. The fact that Strobe Talbott said  shortly before his trip that it must be transformed from  something abstract into something real and be "given practical  significance, especially in the countries of Central and Eastern  Europe" and that, according to his own words, precisely this  will be the central issue of his talks in Bratislava and Warsaw,  clearly underscored the growing importance of the Central  European region in U.S. eyes.    In an interview for THE WASHINGTON POST on the eve of NATO's  Brussels summit, President Michal Kovac proposed a certain form  of political membership in NATO for the countries of the  Visegrad Four Group, an idea that he also reiterated in a recent  article for the NATO REVIEW. Of course, it is scarcely possible  to expect any changes to the form of Partnership [for Peace] as  approved by the supreme NATO body. The United States itself  says, however, that Partnership for Peace is, by its very  nature, an evolutionary process. Hence, if no specific criteria  [for NATO membership] are set today, and if no form of associate  membership is conceded, either, it does not mean that no  conditions can be established for this in the course of the  Pan-European and, in particular, East European political and  security development, including by the activity of partners.    The United States's view of Central Europe is the view of a  great power. It is no coincidence that its representatives  repeatedly place emphasis on regional cooperation among members  of the Visegrad Four Group. Translated into plain language,  this is an evident hint that the states of the Visegrad Four  Group should resolve their internal and mutual problems to such  an extent that their basic stability and orientation become  irreversible. When considering European security, it is easier  to think in the dimensions of a 65-million bloc --one, moreover,  located in a region that has always been a bone of contention in  Europe--than in terms of smaller entities. The incorporation of  this bloc [into Western structures] will resolve problems more  fundamentally, and a bloc is also better suited to influence, by  its weight, the overall climate.</p>

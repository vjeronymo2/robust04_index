			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Column by Ertugrul Ozkok: "Foreign Minister Cetin's </F> Reaction to NATO" -- punctuation as published]    [Text] The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs was on full  alert yesterday. Working Under Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, a  crisis group established a command center to monitor the three  fronts around Turkey round the clock. Gorazde was not the only  case on the Ministry's agenda. The crisis group also focused on  the incidents in Azerbaijan and northern Iraq.    Cetin arrived at the Ministry and set up his working group  early in the morning. They worked until midnight. Undoubtedly,  the priority issued on the crisis group's agenda was that of the  incidents in Gorazde, which is about to fall. Cetin kept  calling President Suleyman Demirel and the officials in Bosnia.  The group studied events in Gorazde minute by minute. The  Serbian forces had advanced almost up to Gorazde's central  areas. The city was about to fall. But NATO remained inactive.  It failed to launch the necessary operations.  <H5>  When, If Not Today? </H5>   The most important piece of information Cetin received was  as  follows: Commander Rose of the UN forces in Bosnia had called  for urgent air support. But UN representative Akashi was  undecided on the issue. And it couldn't be said that he was in  favor of the idea. That was why the expected NATO operation was  not launched. Cetin's views on NATO gradually began to change in  the afternoon. When would NATO use the authority transferred to  it if it didn't use it today? The view that gained weight in  Cetin's consultations with his close colleagues was: "NATO will  suffer seriously if it fails to achieve a result. No one has  the right to place NATO in such a situation. NATO has remained  helpless."  <H5>  Remove the Helplessness </H5>   That viewpoint spread by late afternoon. The developments  that took place would most likely place NATO in a helpless  situation. One of the two British aircraft that took off to bomb  the Serbian positions around Gorazde was shot down. That made  NATO look like a ridiculous organization. And that along with  its helplessness.    Conflicting reports came in from Italy. One of them said  that several NATO aircraft took off for Gorazde. But neither  the NATO general headquarters nor the UN organization in New  York confirmed it. Tension emerged at that time. Did NATO  aircraft take off? If so, would they attack the Serbian forces?  That NATO would not launch an operation against them became  apparent by 2100. This seriously disappointed the crisis group.    Cetin began to talk in a loud voice. No one had the right to  place NATO in such a ridiculous situation. NATO was not a  helpless organization. Why did it agree to shoulder such an  important responsibility if it was reluctant to fulfill its  requirements? What was even worse was that NATO would be unable  to achieve effective results in its humanitarian mission.    Considering that, Cetin prepared to make a harsh statement  against NATO the next day. He decided that the following day he  would outline the feelings and views he couldn't express that  night.    Developments in Gorazde have raised serious questions in  Turkey regarding its confidence in NATO. Obviously, Turkey will  be deeply worried by NATO's situation if Cetin's views forms the  basis of Turkey's general policy.  <H5>  Turkey's Approach to the CSCE </H5>   Undoubtedly, the anxiety NATO has caused in Turkey may have  a  bearing on Ankara's approach to the CSCE, because very important  humanitarian problems were uncovered in the world after the CSCE  was established. The situation in Azerbaijan is an example.  The tragic developments in Azerbaijan and Bosnia were important  humanitarian issues, which are within the framework of CSCE's  basic principles.    The CSCE has no mechanism to obstruct a war. NATO and the UN  establishments are the only mechanisms it can use. But neither  the UN peacekeeping forces nor NATO has been able to influence a  country like Serbia, the economy of which is almost on the verge  of collapse.    NATO has been reluctant to take any action to protect the  70,000 people who are faced with the threat of massacre,  regardless of the authority it received from its general  headquarters and the UN organization, the Kaaba of the world.    How can NATO be effective on other issues if it fails to act  as an effective organization on Bosnia?  <H5>  Hair-Raising Views </H5>   Undoubtedly, many questions can be asked if we look into the  past. Turkey is one of NATO's flank countries. It served that  organization against the former Soviet Union for many decades.  It fulfilled all its obligations as a NATO country in a  dangerous geographic location. In fact, it even allowed the U-2  reconnaissance aircraft to take off from its territory. In  other words, compared with the other NATO members, the threat  Turkey was confronted with was the most serious at the time.    The question that should be asked is this: How would NATO  have acted as a deterrent organization if a clash had taken  place between its members and the former Soviet Union? The  views and convictions on the developments that took place in the  past become more and more hair-raising when NATO's approach to  Bosnia is considered. Would NATO have moved to support Turkey  in a clash with the former Soviet Union in the past? Or, would  it have contented itself with sending two aircraft to help  Turkey, one of which would have most likely been downed in the  northern Black Sea region and the other would have escaped with  great difficulty?  <H5>  Political Geography Can Change </H5>   NATO's helplessness regarding Bosnia may upset many of the  scenarios and projects on serious international projects. It  may encourage many governments that have problems with their  ethnic communities. NATO and the United Nations have failed to  protect the Bosnian people against genocide. Will they be able  to protect the minority communities from the threat of a  massacre in remote countries in the future?    Yes, NATO's helplessness on Bosnia may change the scenarios  in the political geography in the world. Dictators may become  more daring. The humanitarian principles that have been  established by the CSCE may be undermined. The people who  struggle for their cultural rights and ethnic traditions in many  parts of the world, including those who believe that they have  almost achieved their objectives, may be seriously disappointed.  <H5>  Bosnia Would Have Saved the World </H5>   A NATO operation in Bosnia would not have been only for the  Bosnian people. It would also have been a lesson to the forces  in other countries that are inclined to create a situation  similar to Bosnia. Unfortunately, the helpless situation in  Bosnia has created an atmosphere suitable for a new kind of  political psychology in various parts of the world.    Yesterday, HURRIYET described NATO in its headlines as a  "helpless organization." As far as the world is concerned, the  cost of that state of helplessness may be very high.</p>

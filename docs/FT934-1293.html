			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pensions, reform only answer to problems (2) Sir, The only real surprise in the current controversy about transfers from company pension schemes to personal pensions is the extent to which everyone seems to be so surprised by all this. The problem mainly falls in two distinct areas: 1. Enticing members of company pensions schemes to opt-out of their company scheme into a personal pension; and 2. Transferring benefits left behind in a previous company scheme to a personal pension. You do not need to be a genius - or even an actuary - to realise that an occupational pension scheme into which an employer is paying substantial contributions is normally going to produce much better benefits than a personal pension into which no employer contributions are made. Evaluating the option of giving up a deferred pension and taking a transfer value from a company pension scheme to a personal pension is extremely complex. Very few advisers have the necessary expertise in both company pension schemes and individual pension arrangements to carry out such an analysis properly. Those that can do this normally charge for the time spent on the exercise and in our experience very few individuals, or financial advisers, are prepared to pay for this advice.

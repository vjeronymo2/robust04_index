			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the Armed Forces have again been advised  to resist attempts by disgruntled elements to cause disaffection  and discontent in the society. Addressing a combined parade of  Army, Air Force, and the police in Kaduna, the head of state,  General Sani Abacha, said some misguided citizens have been  going round barracks and military formations trying to create  confusion. He pointed out that such people were using religious  and tribal sentiments in an attempt to discomfort members of the  Armed Forces.    The head of state, therefore, reminded members of the Armed  Forces of their responsibility to ensure peace and stability of  the country. Gen. Abacha then warned the soldiers to shun any  mischievous characters manifesting themselves as politicians and  self-proclaimed democrats. He drew their attention to the fact  that in the event of any crisis, the soldiers would be the first  victims. The commander in chief assured them that government was  fully aware of the sacrifices they were making to keep the  country together. He however warned that the present  administration would not submit to blackmail from certain  quarters in subverting the cause of the democratic process being  implemented by government.    On the economy, Gen. Abacha acknowledged that the country  was  passing through a difficult period but assured that the  government would fully implement the measures announced in this  year's budget to bring relief.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Management: Toothpaste giants apply the squeeze - Nicholas Denton looks at a state-owned Hungarian group In the fierce competition for eastern Europe's turbulent consumer markets, it is the innocents who suffer. One of them is Tihamer Gedeon, beleaguered managing director of Caola, the Hungarian state-owned cosmetics and household chemicals manufacturer. Competition from western multinationals since imports were liberalised at the start of 1991 has broken Caola's near monopoly, reducing the company's market share to 40 per cent. Turnover has fallen in step, the 1992 forecast of Ft4.3bn (Pounds 28.6m) representing a halving in real terms since 1990. In toothpaste, for instance, three multinationals are battling for market share - and incidentally squeezing out Caola. Procter &amp; Gamble has taken the lead with 30 per cent, with Colgate-Palmolive following strongly on 15 per cent and rising. Now Unilever too has entered the market with the successful launch of its Signal brand. Caught in the middle, Caola has found its share of sales falling from 70 per cent to just over 30 per cent in two years. The company now claims to have stabilised its position and ironically, it is economic depression that has given the company its temporary reprieve. When cash-strapped Hungarian consumers compare the western price tags with cheap local products on the shelves, enough of them economise to keep Caola in business - just. But Caola faces a new threat as recovery approaches. 'We have to prepare for the time when people don't just want cheap products but have the money to buy better,' says Gedeon. In this refusal to give up lies a minor miracle. The surprise is not that Caola has been battered by western competition but rather that the company has survived and is even fighting back. Gedeon insists he relishes the competition. Caola languished in 'stagnant water' while it remained a monopoly, he explains. The company has pared down its product line from 800 to its 200 strongest items. It is now going on the offensive with the launch of Heviz, a range of pharmaceutical face and body creams named after one of the springs for which Hungary is famed. But Gedeon admits that, for all his efforts, Caola needs a western investor to survive. 'We could last two or three years alone but we don't want to wait.' And time may be running out even faster than that: as Caola weakens, its attraction to western multinationals is fading. Caola may indeed already have missed its best chance. Colgate-Palmolive bid for the company last year but pulled out at the last minute, saying that the company's worth was vanishing along with its market share. Since then, failure has continued to breed failure. Beiersdorf, the German manufacturer, has taken back distribution of Nivea and other products which had been licensed by Caola. Most ominously of all, Caola's most dynamic executives are voting with their feet. Tamas Suto, Caola's go-ahead marketing head, now works for the competition - Colgate-Palmolive. 'All the knowledge I had was wasted there,' he says.</p>

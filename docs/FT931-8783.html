			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Salvation Army claims Pounds 6m fraud THE SALVATION Army said yesterday it had become the victim of an Dollars 8.8m (Pounds 6.19m) fraud. A writ issued in the High Court alleges that Tilen Securities Inc, Mr Stuart Christopher Ford of Birmingham, its owner, and Mr Gamil Naguib conspired to defraud the Salvation Army of the money. The Salvation Army refused to give details of its relationship with the three defendants. It said that in spite of repeated requests for money owed to it, only Dollars 500,000 had been repaid. Mr John Larsson, the head of the charity in the UK, said it had no alternative but to take legal action to seek recovery of the restof the money. The High Court action follows proceedings initiated by the charity in Luxembourg last month, when bank accounts containing about Dollars 520,000 were frozen. The legal action has the support of the Charity Commission. The Salvation Army has asked Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, to investigate. The charity, which is the largest provider of social services after the government, last year had an income of almost Pounds 80m, of which Pounds 12m came from public donations. Mr Larsson said: 'I firmly believe that the public will see that we are acting decisively and will continue to give us the magnificent support for which we have always been so grateful.' None of those named on the writ could be contacted for comment last night.</p>

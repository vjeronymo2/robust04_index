			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 5 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese  financial official said here today that China will strive to  make its currency -- the renminbi [rmb] yuan -- convertible on  current account within six years.    China unified its previous dual exchange rates on January 1  this year. "We will also relax foreign exchange control over  foreign trade, beginning this year," said Zhu Xiaohua,  vice-governor of the People's Bank of China, the Central Bank,  in an interview with XINHUA.    Zhu, who was made director of the State Administration of  Foreign Exchange Control early this year, said the moves will  put the Chinese yuan considerably closer to being a freely  convertible currency.    He expressed satisfaction with the reaction both from the  public and the market to the rmb exchange rate unification.    The country's foreign exchange reserve went up markedly  during the past two months, he said.    Since China stopped issuing foreign exchange certificates  (FEC) upon unification of the yuan's exchange rate, the Bank of  China has withdrawn one third of the FEC special bank notes in  circulation, Zhu noted.    The first quarter of 1994 is supposed to be a transitional  period for China's foreign exchange control system to convert  from the old to the new.    During this period, the Central Bank publishes the market  exchange rates every morning, which are formed on the basis of  the average prices on the foreign exchange swap markets across  the country.    The banks, however, can only buy or sell hard currency  according to the central bank's buying and selling prices. They  are not allowed to float the price for the time being.    However, the rmb exchange rate will begin to float as of  April 1 this year. The swap centers will then have given way to  a fledgling inter-bank foreign exchange market.    Zhu said that the range of floatation will not be very big  in  the initial state of the new system's operation, to ensure that  it does not have a too large effect on the national economy.    "The floatation has to be somewhat controlled, considering  China's reality, especially when our fiscal and monetary  policies cannot fully regulate the economy," said Zhu.    But he said that the central bank's intervention will be  conducted mainly by buying or selling hard currency, instead of  by setting price limits.    "We will also see the frequency of such interventions  gradually reduced," Zhu said.    According to the vice-governor, the unified inter-bank  foreign exchange market will have as members the 13 major  domestic banks, 88 branches of foreign banks and Sino-foreign  banks.    Many foreign banks have applied to join the system, said  Zhu,  adding that the central bank is considering taking in as brokers  of the market some international trust and investment companies  "to ensure the exchange rate really reflects the supply and  demand."    As to whether China will have an adequate supply of foreign  exchange according to the current foreign exchange rate, Zhu  said that this is decided mainly by the monetary policy of the  central bank.    He said that the outline of monetary policy to curb the  scale  of investment in fixed assets has taken shape and the current  exchange rate is quite advantageous for exports.    As long as the current policy of attracting foreign  investments remains unchanged and the investment environment is  improved, more foreign investment will keep flowing into China,  thus making up the foreign trade deficit.    As one of the principal operators of reform of China's  foreign exchange system, Zhu expressed optimism about the goal  of realizing a balance between supply and demand of hard  currency while seeing an increase in China's foreign currency  reserves.</p>

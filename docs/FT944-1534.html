			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Access to railway network curbed Competition on the privatised railway network is to be restricted for at least seven years to prevent a free-for-all which would damage the interests of travellers and rail companies. Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator, yesterday announ-ced plans for tight controls on new entrants to the railway business until March 1999 and continuing 'substantial restrictions' for at least a further three years. He said unbridled competition on the railways from companies which bid to run individual lines or services could damage the interests of the franchisees that acquired the right to run entire regional networks. British Rail's passenger services are to be franchised to 25 private operators. The government originally intended to allow 'open access' operators to bid for particular routes or services to increase competition with franchisees. But protests from prospective franchisees prompted a rethink. Mr Swift said: 'The railway industry is still at an early stage . . . of fundamental restructuring. I do not believe it would be wise to expose train operators or passengers to the risks of experimenting with uncontrolled competition.' He said there would be enough competition between franchised operators which ran trains on the same routes and between the franchisees and services still run by BR. The rail regulator will restrict the right of Railtrack, the owner of the track, stations and signals, to sell 'paths' on its lines if the rival service would affect the core business of the existing train operator. From 1999 to 2002 the level of new competition allowed will depend on the degree of competition already being mounted by neighbouring franchisees. Competition for Railway Passenger Services.

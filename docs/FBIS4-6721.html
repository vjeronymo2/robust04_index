			<p>CSO   <F P=106>   [Article by Lieutenant General Trinh Tran, commander, Border </F> Defense Forces: "On the Border Defense Troops' Traditions Day  -- Let's Develop the All-People Strength, Maintain Sovereignty  and Security on the Fatherland's Borders"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] With the background of profound  international changes, on the one hand, there are opportunities  for us to win peace, to expand our international relations, and  to develop our country; on the other hand, we must do our best  to remain vigilant because the adversary forces are frantically  pushing their "peaceful event" plots and tricks combined with  armed rioting so as to overthrow the socialist system in our  country. The issues involving land borders, national  sovereignty, and the struggle against violations and seizure of  our border and sea-island sovereignty, resources, and national  interests are becoming urgent and complicated ones. The  activities of various kinds of political, criminal, and economic  violators who take advantage of the "open door" situation are  increasing and becoming more and more daring and well-organized,  with the use of arms and the connections between the country and  the outside creating many hot issues regarding the security and  order on our borders and the sea. This is the reason why the  work of organizing our border defense is playing an extremely  important role and there must be a thorough understanding of the  task and view mentioned in Resolution 3 of the CPV Central  Committee, namely, to strengthen the management and maintaining  of our sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to maintain  security and order on the borders, coast, and islands of our  fatherland.    The need for managing and maintaining sovereignty and  security on our national borders in the new situation must be  total, with maintaining our sovereignty, territorial integrity,  resources, environment, and national interests being closely  combined with maintaining political security and social order  and security, and defeating the criminals' peaceful-event plots,  violations of territorial sovereignty, and sabotaging of  security and order; at the same time, we must thoroughly  understand the foreign policy of our state in the renovation  period, build the peace-and-friendship borders with our  neighbors, and open the doors and expand international relations  in the fields of foreign investment and economic cooperation. In  order to fulfill the above-mentioned task and need and to act on  our own initiative under any circumstances, on the basis of our  recent experience we must build a strong all-people border  defense, maintain national solidarity, and closely combine  socioeconomic development with strengthening and consolidating  our national defense and security. Now and in the coming years,  we must continue to properly implement the government's Decision  16/HDBT aimed at raising the quality and effectiveness of the  Border Defense Day; make people know very well the new situation  and task; heighten their revolutionary vigilance; strengthen and  consolidate the political bases and the movement to maintain the  fatherland's security; build the people's security front along  with the all-people national defense front; and develop  solidarity with and attachment to the people, joint combat and  mutual assistance relations between the border defense forces  and the people and forces stationed on the borders, and hence  mobilization of the country's total strength to serve the task  of building and defending our borders, particularly in the  situation of unexpected events suddenly taking place.    We need to build a more profound and stronger all-people  border defense on the basis of developing the all-people  strength, the strength of the country and the political system  as a whole, from inland areas to the borders, both in the rear  and at the front, so as to resolve on a first-priority basis the  urgent socioeconomic issues and to build strong border and  coastal areas and islands, particularly the highlands and remote  areas, which will serve as the base for building the front line  based on the people's wishes, the front line based on the  people's security, and for firmly defending our national borders.    We need to strengthen leadership provided by the ministries  and central sectors and by local echelons and sectors, and to  mobilize the people all over the country and particularly the  ethnic groups in border and sea-island areas for properly  implementing Directive 525/CT-TTg on a number of programs and  measures aimed at developing socioeconomic conditions in the  highlands and among ethnic groups, and Directive 399 CT/TTg on  the task of developing the sea-based economy. The border  defense troops, along with central and local committees and  sectors, are to continue to effectively carry out programs  calling for joint action with the Ministries of Education and  Training, Culture and Information, and Public Health; the  Vietnam Women's Union; and the Youth Union Central Committee and  to obtain better and better results from them. At the same  time, they must join with the localities in basic investigations  of the socioeconomic conditions in border villages so as to  introduce there programs of action having important and key  provisions.    As for the border defense troops, after 35 years of  building, doing regular work, fighting, and growing up, they  need to develop their proud traditions; to heighten their  political capabilities and fighting power in all fields; to do  their best to overcome any remaining shortcomings and  weaknesses; to continue consolidating solidarity, democracy, and  internal discipline; and to eliminate such negative aspects as  authoritarianism and harassment of the people so as to  strengthen the blood-and-flesh attachment to the people, to  correctly implement the national and religious policies, and to  turn themselves into strong, well-trained, regular troops  capable of properly fulfilling their task while continuing to  combine border defense work with socioeconomic development as a  means to improve the standard of living and with strengthening  of the masses' work as an important political task of the forces.    The task of maintaining sovereignty and security in border  areas requires that we set renovation at the same level as that  of the new need and task. By fully learning from the "consider  the people as the roots" lesson, knowing how to develop the  strength of the masses while creating favorable conditions for  stabilizing their living conditions, effectively promoting  socioeconomic development, and achieving national wealth and  strength, as well as a fair and civilized society, we will  certainly succeed in building a front line based on the people's  wishes that becomes stronger and stronger everyday, maintaining  national sovereignty and territorial integrity, contributing to  maintaining the country's political stability, and bringing  victory to the renovation undertaken by our party and people as  a whole.</p>

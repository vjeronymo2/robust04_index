			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Larval and Juvenile Transport <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _To ensure that delta smelt larvae are transported from the area where they are hatched to shallow, productive rearing or nursery habitat, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributary channels must be protected from physical disturbance (e.g., sand and gravel mining, diking, dredging, and levee or bank protection and maintenance) and flow disruption (e.g., water diversions that result in entrainment and in-channel barriers or tidal gates). Adequate river flow is necessary to transport larvae from upstream spawning areas to rearing habitat in Suisun Bay. Additionally, river flow must be adequate to prevent interception of larval transport by the State and Federal water projects and smaller agricultural diversions in the Delta. To ensure that suitable rearing habitat is available in Suisun Bay, the 2 ppt isohaline must be located westward of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence during the period when larvae or juveniles are being transported, according to the historical salinity conditions which vary according to water-year type. Reverse flows that maintain larvae upstream in deep-channel regions of low productivity and expose them to entrainment interfere with these transport requirements. Suitable water quality must be provided so that maturation is not impaired by pollutant concentrations. The specific geographic area important for larval transport is confined to waters contained within the legal boundary of the Delta, Suisun Bay, and Montezuma Slough and its tributaries. The specific season when habitat conditions identified above are important for successful larval transport varies from year to year, depending on when peak spawning occurs and on the water-year type. The Service identified situations in the biological opinion for the delta smelt (1994) where additional flows might be required in the July&hyph;August period to protect delta smelt that were present in the south and central Delta from being entrained in the State and Federal project pumps, and to avoid jeopardy to the species. The long-term biological opinion on CVP&hyph;SWP operations will identify situations where additional flows may be required after the February through June period identified by EPA for its water quality standards to protect delta smelt in the south and central Delta. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rearing Habitat <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Maintenance of the 2 ppt isohaline according to the historical salinity conditions described above and suitable water quality (low concentrations of pollutants) within the Estuary is necessary to provide delta smelt larvae and juveniles a shallow, protective, food-rich environment in which to mature to adulthood. This placement of the 2 ppt isohaline also serves to protect larval, juvenile, and adult delta smelt from entrainment in the State and Federal water projects. An area extending eastward from Carquinez Strait, including Suisun Bay, Grizzly Bay, Honker Bay, Montezuma Slough and its tributary sloughs, up the Sacramento River to its confluence with Three Mile Slough, and south along the San Joaquin River including Big Break, defines the specific geographic area critical to the maintenance of suitable rearing habitat. Three Mile Slough represents the approximate location of the most upstream extent of tidal excursion when the historical salinity conditions described above are implemented. Protection of rearing habitat conditions may be required from the beginning of February through the summer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adult Migration <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Adult delta smelt must be provided unrestricted access to suitable spawning habitat in a period that may extend from December to July. Adequate flow and suitable water quality may need to be maintained to attract migrating adults in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River channels and their associated tributaries, including Cache and Montezuma sloughs and their tributaries. These areas also should be protected from physical disturbance and flow disruption during migratory periods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To conserve the delta smelt, this final rule designates critical habitat in an area encompassing the specific habitat conditions required by each life stage identified above. Accordingly, critical habitat is designated in the following geographic area_areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta. Thus, critical habitat for the delta smelt is contained within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Solano, and Yolo Counties, California. The ``Regulation Promulgation'' section provides a precise metes and bounds description of critical habitat designated for the delta smelt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

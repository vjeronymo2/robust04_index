			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Property: Better to sit than to squat - John Brennan looks at two special aspects of 'the housing problem' A WELL-WORN but still potent homeowners' nightmare is a return from holiday to find that squatters have got there first. Even rumours of such cases provoke generous publicity. There is no news as gripping as a story about families locked out of their own homes, their sympathetic but legally impotent local police looking on. The other side of this story - an estimated 50,000 homeless people squatting within the law in otherwise disused and part-derelict properties - has no such headline appeal. In practice, when you try to put the two sides of this story together, the distance between the popular myth and the truth about squatting is far enough to show that they have precious little in common. One side of the story is revealed as a classic middle class terror backed by few real real problems. The other remains a tragic but straightforward consequence of the housing crisis - and its image is not helped by the myth-making. As far as the myth of widespread home-squatting dramas is concerned, examples of hi-jacking temporarily vacant private homes are rare. The practice was formally made illegal under section seven of the Criminal Law Act 1977: a provision which has hardly ever had to be applied. So the police are not legally impotent in such situations, and squatters rarely form queues for houses vacated by families on holiday. What helps to give the idea its powerful horror is that it is regularly refuelled by commercial organisations with an interest in making homeowners aware of every extra risk, no matter how remote. Naturally, even the best-promoted worries need occasional hard evidence to justify them. Real homeowner/squatter clashes are, therefore, meticulously recorded. One example is Christopher Cox and his family, of Ryde on the Isle of Wight, whose experience is enough to confirm all an owner's worst fears. Cox found squatters in his flat when he returned from holiday. It took him eight weeks, and an outlay of Pounds 2,000 in legal costs, to get back into his home - reputedly after he had refused to pay Pounds 1,000 demanded by the squatters in return for a promise to leave. The Cox case gives excellent reason to review what is likely to be limited 'household legal expenses' insurance cover. It follows, too, that such a case adds much to an insurance brokers' sales pitch. But equally, sorting out the ambiguities that can come to light in household insurance cover in the event of a squatting incident justifies a close look at existing home policies. By no means all household policies have a consistent policy on squatting. Squatting problems are such a rarity that insurers rarely include reference to them in a policy's explanatory notes. The Cox case, along with recent well-publicised instances of squatters taking over and damaging large, unsold and vacant houses, sends shivers down the spines of owners with potential target homes (thereby helping to sell more insurance). What these examples do not do is create proper evidence of any shift of squatting activity which might add to the existing minimal threat to owner-occupiers. SQUASH - Squatters' Action for Secure Homes (c/o 2 St Paul's Road, London, N1) - has been formed by existing squatting organisations to challenge the UK government's current consultation paper on the criminalisation of squatting. SQUASH members' arguments boil down to the hard-to-dispute thesis that homelessness, not squatting, is 'the problem.' A survey of SQUASH member agencies reveals that, far from the notion that gangs of brigands are terrorising the holiday-making classes, the largest group of squatters is made up of single people on low (or no) salaries, needing to stay near actual (or potential) jobs. Such people - low-paid workers living in squatted properties - include public service employees, transport staff, nurses, and catering staff. Families with children - some of them former owner-occupiers unable to keep up mortgage payments - form the next largest group. Evidence accumulated from calls received by the SQUASH agencies suggests that as many as one third of squatters in London may now fall into this category. The effect has been to raise the age of the adult squatting population. Of course this kind of sampling means that reviews of squatting activity must be rough and ready. Nevertheless, London squat figures drawn from many directions indicate that over 90 per cent of squatters go no further than into unused public sector property. This does not match the home-owner's terror of a readily mobile army of house-takers or flat-wreckers. (Not that this helps to improve the image of squatting - an almost universally negative one.) The occasional squatting scare does no harm for one company, which gets paid to put strangers into empty houses. Homesitters Limited (Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, tel: 0296.630730) has completed 9,000 home-sits over the past 11 years. The company aimed initially at establishing a regular client base of private owners who were keen to have their houses attended to, and pets fed, while they were away. That remains a core activity. But the business now also includes commercial work for estate agents, dealing with unoccupied re-possessed properties, and for the owners of larger unsold properties, where regular occupation can deter vandals. The 'homesitters' entrusted with these jobs are, for the most part, retired people. Their minimum age is 40, their maximum 68. Within that range there are plenty of active, experienced homeowners who can safely be left in charge of another owner's home. 'All of our homesitters are asked for three references, and all three are taken up,' says Adele Barclay, a director of Homesitters. The vetting is critical for both sides. From the beginning, the company has employed all its registered homesitters directly, rather than on a casual basis. That adds up to 440 sitters (plus partner, usually) available to house-sit for a few weeks, or months. 'It obviously depends on their availability,' Adele Barclay says, 'but we would normally say that each homesitter might expect four to six house sits each year, averaging two weeks, so they might expect to be out for eight to 12 weeks each year.' Two weeks is an average homesit, but the company does run to long-term sittings: the longest so far has been a 32-month occupation of a property awaiting probate clearance. (In that case, successive teams of homesitters had to be used, to make up the time.) Other commercial jobs can include 'sitting' in - or, rather, by - part-finished or otherwise uninhabitable houses. In those cases the company can offer a sitter with a caravan. As a standard rule, homesitters must not leave the home in their charge unoccupied for more than three hours in daylight and an hour at dark. But owners can stipulate 24 hour cover if they want. If a sitter cannot complete an assignment, if he or she becomes ill, or has to go home for whatever reason, the company provides immediate cover. So far as private sittings are concerned, wherever possible homesitters meet the owners first - to see if they get on all right, and to learn any quirks of a house. Much of the company's repeat business is from owners having the same sitters look after their home each year; so it is of value that an owner is comfortable with the choice of sitter. It is also critical that arrangements are made for any pets. Over the years there has evolved a distinct price scale for looking after pets. 'Children's household pets - stick insects, fish, gerbils and such-like - we wouldn't normally make any extra charge for,' says Barclay. But cats cost 65 pence a day, and a small dog would be Pounds 1.70. Bigger animals are a matter for discussion. As for the cost of the sitting itself: owners pay an initial one-off registration fee of Pounds 25.00, and reimburse homesitters for travelling costs if they visit the premises at the outset. After that, costs are Pounds 15.50 a day plus basic food and travel costs for the sitter. If - as is likely - the registered sitter brings his or her partner, there is no extra expense for the owner, either in fees or expenses.</p>

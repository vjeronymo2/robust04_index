			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Makarov: "One More Poll Has Been Conducted"] </F>   [Text] A poll conducted among officers of the Minsk Higher  Military Engineering College showed that 52 percent of those  surveyed do not see any prospects for their continued service,  and 25 percent have already decided to leave the Belarusian  Armed Forces. As many as 96 percent of the servicemen expressed  their discontent with the legal status and material security of  Belarusian officers (by the way, 67 percent of college officers  do not have their own housing), and they believe that if Belarus  continues to conduct such a military policy, our Army will end  up without a future.    In the opinion of those surveyed, their situation may  improve  if they are granted privileges, which officers in the Belarusian  Interior Ministry and the Russian Federation Armed Forces are  currently enjoying, including free passes for city and suburban  transportation, reimbursement of fares for officers' and their  families' holiday travels within the CIS, free medical treatment  in spas, full compensation for rent charges, possibility of  receiving preferential loans, etc.    Regarding officers' attitude toward contract service, 30  percent of those surveyed disapprove of it, 34 percent refused  to answer, and 36 percent support it, but only provided that the  state fulfills its responsibilities.</p>

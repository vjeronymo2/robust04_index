			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TAX MAN APOLOGIZES;  </P> <P> PUBLIC RETRACTION IS DUE THOSE WRONGLY NAMED AS DELINQUENT  </P> <P> Ray Fowler scanned his morning newspaper to see whether any of his friends or  neighbors had made the list of Los Angeles County taxpayers who were late  paying their property taxes. The last thing he expected to find was his own  name.  </P> <P> "It is just not a happy experience to go whipping down the delinquency column  and find yourself listed there," he said -- especially since he had paid his  taxes. He said the list, prepared by the county tax collector, left his friends  and neighbors with the erroneous impression that "Ray Fowler is a deadbeat" and  brought him "strange looks" at his bank.  </P> <P> "It was like having a pie thrown in your face," said Lillian Romero-Gomez, who  was shocked to find her name on the list, even after she had sent copies of her  paid tax bill to the tax collector's office.  </P> <P> They and a few other taxpayers complained to their county supervisor. The  result was a change in county policy. From now on, taxpayers erroneously  identified as delinquent can get a public apology from the tax collector in the  form of a published retraction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mindful of Image  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County tax collector's office, mindful of its image, recently  led a successful lobbying effort in Sacramento that led to a change in state  law allowing counties to delay publication of the lists for up to a year in  order to ensure their accuracy.  </P> <P> The county is required by state law to publish the lists of delinquent  taxpayers. But it does not make the same effort to notify those who are due  refunds.  </P> <P> About 2,500 taxpayers a year are believed to overpay their taxes but never  receive refunds because the county cannot find them. Unclaimed money is  deposited into the county treasury after a four-year waiting period.  </P> <P> This year, the coffers were boosted by $479,626 in overpaid property taxes,  including $7,387 due a single unwitting taxpayer.  </P> <P> County officials said it would be unfair for the general taxpayer to bear the  expense of tracking down taxpayers who, in the words of one official, are "poor  record keepers." They said it is the taxpayers' responsibility to keep track of  how much they pay.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Published Each September  </P> <P> As for the county's delinquency lists, nobody knows how many taxpayers' names  end up there mistakenly. The lists are published every September in community  newspapers, and nearly 100,000 names appeared last year.  </P> <P> Tax officials say mistakes are inevitable because of the sheer volume of  property tax bills -- a staggering 2.5 million -- and the complexity of the tax  system.  </P> <P> Barbara Sanchez, manager of the tax collector's secured property division, said  she "would be surprised if I have 50 people" a year complain that their names  were published in error. Until now, the tax collector has sent letters of  apology to taxpayers "and to whomever they tell us they want us to write,"  including gossipy neighbors, Assistant Tax Collector David Collins said.  </P> <P> That was not enough for Supervisor Pete Schabarum. He recently won his  colleagues' approval to require the tax collector to publish an apology when  requested by a taxpayer. Tax Collector Sandra Davis said her office will  determine whether an error has been made. Wording of the apology has not been  worked out.  </P> <P> Schabarum proposed the new policy after complaints from several constituents,  including Fowler.  </P> <P> Fowler, owner of apartment buildings in Claremont, said he saw his name on the  list published in his community paper, the Claremont Courier.  </P> <P> He said he paid his taxes in December, 1987, but because of a processing error,  received a delinquency notice in the mail the following June, the month the tax  collector sends notices to delinquent taxpayers.  </P> <P> Forgetting that he had paid, he sent another check. Perusing his financial  records the next day, he found proof of his earlier payment and stopped payment  on the second check.  </P> <P> "How many other citizens have paid twice under such circumstances?" he wrote  Schabarum. "If the county records show I'm delinquent, and I don't have an  infallible system and am busy, as well as basically compliant, I'm inclined to  pay."  </P> <P> Tax Collector Davis, in a letter of response to Schabarum, said Fowler was at  least partly responsible for the mix-up.  </P> <P> "Mr. Fowler did not review his records before taking action and sent a check to  cover the delinquencies. Had he determined that payment was made and so advised  this office, research would have uncovered the processing error and it could  have been corrected so that no default or published notice would have  occurred."  </P> <P> But Fowler and two other taxpayers interviewed said they tried for months to  clear up the matter with the tax collector before contacting Schabarum, whose  office resolved the problems within a few weeks.  </P> <P> Referring to the tax collector's office, Fowler said, "Most of them treated me  as if they were not in the tax collector's office, but in the felony division  of the Sheriff's Department, and I was the culprit."  </P> <P> Mindful of its image, the tax collector's office recently began training its  operators in "telephone etiquette." In addition, the Board of Supervisors has  allocated $4 million to add phone lines and increase staff in the tax  collector's office.  </P> <P> "Taxpayers do not want taxes raised, but they want immediate service," said  Sanchez, pointing out that the tax collector's office processes more than 4  million tax payments a year and is still not fully computerized.  </P> <P> Karen Greenbaum-Maya, another Claremont taxpayer who wrote Schabarum, said she  was "outraged" to find her name on the delinquency list.  </P> <P> "That's not how I wanted to appear in the paper, as delinquent in my taxes,"  she said. "I am a psychologist, and I work in the area where I live, and that's  embarrassing."  </P> <P> And, "as far as we knew," it was unfounded, she said.  </P> <P> Greenbaum-Maya admitted that she was not entirely blameless. She and her  husband indeed owed taxes, but she said they were unaware of it until they saw  their name in the newspaper. She said she never received a notice in the mail  in June.  </P> <P> Greenbaum-Maya said that after she saw her name in the paper, "we did the  conscientious thing" and immediately called and wrote the tax collector's  office to try to clear up the matter.  </P> <P> Despite her efforts, she said her and her husband's name appeared in the  newspaper a second time. The lists are published three consecutive weeks.  </P> <P> The taxpayers have mixed views about a public apology.  </P> <P> "The county uses its money poorly enough as it is," Fowler said. "The issue is  really at the front end. Why did this whole thing happen in the first place?"  </P> <P> Greenbaum-Maya and Romero-Gomez said they welcome retractions.  </P> <P> "That's the fair thing to do," Greenbaum-Maya said.  </P></p>

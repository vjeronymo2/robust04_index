			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yang Ho-lun (2799 0735 0243) and Li Chia-hsing </F> (2621 0857 5281) (Southern Report): "The Effect Caused by the  Voice of Southern Taiwan in the Kaohsiung Area--Four Laymen Will  Use 800 Watts of Power to Invade Greater Kaohsiung"]    [Text] [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    In the last two months in the Kaohsiung area, more and more  taxi drivers and factory workers have gotten into the habit of  listening regularly every day to the programs broadcast on  "Nan-Sheng Tien-T'ai" [Voice of Southern Taiwan] radio station  at 90.7 megahertz FM, because on this "unofficial frequency,"  which has not yet been legally applied for, they can receive  never before heard sensitive political topics and genuine local  and media "news that slipped out."    [passage omitted]    Founded on the concept and the background of the "Ch'uan-Min  Tien-T'ai" [All People's Radio Station] in the Taipei area, the  development of the Voice of Southern Taiwan has been rather  similar. In the same way, it has first locked onto taxi drivers  and metropolitan factory workers as its listeners. The age  distribution is concentrated at 20 to 35 years of age, and it  seeks men as its principal market.    Based on the reaction from the listener hotline in the more  than two months since it began broadcasting, the Voice of  Southern Taiwan has attracted the market goal that it originally  locked on to, and has gradually taken the opportunity to expand  to every level. So, the Voice of Southern Taiwan not only  extended its five hours of programming to from seven o'clock in  the morning to eleven o'clock, deep into the night, but  established a broadcasting studio in Taipei and used the  "hotline telephone" of the telephone and telegraph office for  hosts in the south and the north to conduct simultaneous  immediate on-site broadcasts and become a new non-main line  voice suddenly appearing in the southern air.    Because they have a shortage of funds, resources, and  manpower, the program content first concentrates on innovation  and defeating the opponent by surprise moves, like the use of  the telephone hotline for simultaneous north-south conversations  to overcome the drawback of the heavier concentration of  political, economic, cultural, and social resources in the north  of Taiwan than in the south. In the past it was necessary to  spend time and money to invite famous people and famous  spokesmen down. At the Taipei studio of the Voice of Southern  Taiwan, they also can make immediate on-site broadcasts and at  the smallest cost break the limitations of time and space and  satisfy the southerners' need to probe regional subjects.    And they select 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm to broadcast this  "Southern Taiwan at Dusk" program, because this period is  precisely the "golden opening" when the evening newspaper is  already published, and the parliament and government are in  recess, and the television news still has not appeared, cleverly  standing out in a gap in the market.    In addition, like what began on 28 February, the Voice of  Southern Taiwan has especially made a special series that spans  seven days, including lively historical data, oral stories,  reports of commemorative activities in various places, scholars'  expert commentary, and field survey reports. Particularly  valuable was the first revelation of a diary of Uncle Wu  Po-hsiung [0702 0130 7160] the year before he was murdered in  the 28 February Incident. In it he recorded in great detail such  sadnesses of the time as the descriptions of government  officials, fluctuating prices, the sound of gunfire all around,  and the anxiety in people's hearts. It was valuable "field  historical data" of the 28 February Incident. When the announcer  read that on 16 March 1947, the day the author was caught, it  was "blank"---and later Aunt Wu Po-hsiung added the  blood-stained words: "...he died and his body floated to the  side of the river." Readers were choked up and listeners noses  were stinging. [passage omitted]    The Voice of Southern Taiwan has 200 watts of transmitting  power (All People's Radio Station only has 100 watts), and is  expected to expand its power to 400 watts before early March,  and increase it to 800 watts in April. At that time, its  transmitting range could extend to Chia-I, P'ing-tung, and the  P'eng Hu offshore islands from the present greater Kaohsiung  area, becoming the greatest electronic medium of the  out-of-office forces. (The area has 5 million residents.)    At the same time, the Voice of Southern Taiwan also has  begun  a "program exchange" with All People's Radio Station to expand  its dissemination. Within the next few days, it will overcome  equipment and technology problems by conducting southern and  northern simulcasts. In the future, after the establishment of  the Taichung station planned by Hung Chi-ch'ang [3163 1142  2490], northern, middle, and southern broadcasts will be  formally joined and they will be moving toward the goals of a  total island linkup and a local medium and truly put an end to  the era of mainline monopoly of the electronic media.    As the influence of the Voice of Southern Taiwan  progressively increases, although such people as Huang Chao-hui  [7806 2507 6540] and Ch'en Chu [7115 5468] are putting their  support on the table, there are only four people who have put  their whole heart and soul into it, and they all were formerly  laymen--the station master, Kuo Chien-chih [6753 1696 2535]; the  program designer, Lin Ti-chuan [2651 3336 1227]; and broadcast  engineers Huang Po-ch'ao [7806 0590 6389] and Wu I-chao [0702  0310 0340].    Station master Kuo Chien-chih smiles and says that he  studied  economics and formerly ran his own factory and knows nothing  about a radio station. With Huang Chao-hui "bravely giving  orders" and driving them on, after more than two months  preparation, they had a trial broadcast and immediately formally  began broadcasting. Everyone is learning as he works. Now it is  generally considered that they have achieved a little bit of  grueling success and the greatest joy is receiving encouraging  calls from listeners every day.    He recalls when they first began at the end of last  September, for fear of interference and obstruction, everything  was done in secret. In particular, transmitting and broadcasting  equipment was all first broken down outside the country and made  into parts, and after being transshipped through two countries  as hardware, it entered Taiwan. After that, technicians were  engaged at a high price to come south from Taipei to reassemble  them at a secret location, and they were transported to the  station and hurriedly set up.    Since broadcasting formally began last 10 December, station  workers all have discovered that a number of faithful listeners  follow the development and growth of program content, and in the  short period of over two months, it has seen surprising results.    Lin Ti-chuan, who studied politics and is program planner  and  hostess asks with total confidence, "Who would still dare to say  that our station's listeners do not have standards?!"    She brought up an example as explanation. When they first  began broadcasting, because some of the criticism programs were  misunderstood to "torture" the Democratic Progressive Party  (DPP), quite a few habitual listening "open platform political  view club" DPP supporters one after the other called the station  to protest, scolding by linking the Three-Character  Classic and threatening wording. However, with the patient  explanation of the programming people, one by one they demanded  that "they themselves turn around and respect their weakness and  maintain their poise." From observing recent on-site hotline  dialogues, these formerly easily emotional listeners, because  they themselves had been respected, had clearly begun to learn  to use reasonable and democratic methods to participate and  discuss. Lin Ti-chuan and Kuo Chien-chih both believe that this  proves that it is only necessary to give people respect and they  will have higher standards, and not blindly doubt and put them  down.    In the period that they began broadcasting, one of the  things  that was most gratifying to station personnel was to have a taxi  driver affirm his support for the Voice of Southern Taiwan by  especially sending a large cake to the station on 10 January,  the day that they "completed a month" of broadcasting, at his  own expense mimeograph advertising flyers for the station and  distribute them everywhere, and send each of the hosts a card on  Christmas day. He is considered a "deathly loyal and sworn"  supporter.    Once after a program was broadcast in which K'o Ch'i-hua  [2688 2475 0553] personally described the situation at the time  of the White Terror, several listeners immediately called in to  the hotline with choking voices to encourage old Mr. K'o to  persevere. The station workers were extremely moved.    Since last year when broadcasting in the central area began  to greatly increase and a share of listeners' two-way dialogues  on the hotline have been directly broadcast live, the  interactive relations between the broadcast media and listeners  have become closer than ever. Lin Ti-chuan also believes that  this is Taiwan's newest wave of revolutionary consciousness  movements. Listeners' rights and voice have never been given so  much importance and enhancement. Moreover, the effect of the  broadcast hotline has been more absorbing than the effects of  television and the flat medium.---Because the "reader reaction"  pages in the press are less timely than the electronic media and  the "viewer hotline" on television often appears to lack  strength and be loosely organized and unnatural, because the  picture is dull.    [passage omitted]    So, the Voice of Southern Taiwan like the All People's Radio  Station, as distinguished from the mainline media accustomed to  their own speech, expands "listener time" as much as possible in  several of their programs. It concentrates its funds on  assembling "collective line microphone systems" that other  stations do not have and emphasizes strengthening dual or even  three-way or multi-directional interaction of the station,  listener, and balanced oversight objectives to act as the most  effective "people's public instrument."    Presently, the Voice of Southern Taiwan programming still is  mainly political, topical, and local and daily life information,  but as they attract manpower and resources and after they are  legalized, their foundation will change to a company  organization and seek a special and a higher station site,  increase the injection of youth, news, and cultural programs,  and increase the purchase of on-site relay vehicles to utilize  important materials and select information for reporting. All of  this is to gradually orient their efforts into the system.    Although the initial period has been short, the Voice of  Southern Taiwan already has moulded a few "famous voices": Like  Lin Ti-chuan with the sharp diction; Su Jung-jui 5685 2837 3843  with the pleasant clear-toned voice and precise facts; and old  Mr. Ou Ming-lang 2962 2494 2597, the eighty-year-old host of  "Uncle Talks About Antiquity." They all have their regular  listeners, and they often have listeners write letters to the  station pouring out their aspirations. These are the intangible  fruits of "righteous work."</p>

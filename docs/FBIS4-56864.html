			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 6 May (EFE) -- State hospital services  returned to normal today following the 72-hour national strike.  The 55,000 mobilized health workers, however, threatened to  stage an indefinite strike if their salary demands are not met.    The health minister said that only 30 percent of all health  workers participated in the strike. Workers' leaders, however,  claimed that the percentage of participating strikers was  larger. Services at hospital outpatient clinics dropped  substantially during the three-day strike.    Workers rejected the recent salary increase granted by the  government, characterizing it as "miserable." Health Minister  Jaime Freundt-Thurne said the state does not have any money for  new salary increases.    Health workers earn an average salary of less than $150 per  month. They criticized the minister for refusing to negotiate  with their union, and threatened to stage an indefinite strike.</p>

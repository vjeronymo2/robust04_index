The purpose of this disclosure is to aid in the collection of outstanding debts owed to the Federal Government, typically, to provide an incentive for debtors to repay delinquent Federal Government debts by making these debts part of their credit records. Disclosure of records is limited to the individual's name, address, Social Security number, and other information necessary to establish the individual's identity; the amount, status and history of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claim arose. The disclosure will be made only after the procedural requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) have been followed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system: Storage: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Hard copy documents are manually filed at agency and regional office sites; and on disc pack and magnetic tape at central computer sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> Retrievability: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This varies according to the particular accounting system within the Operating Division, Agency and Regional Office.

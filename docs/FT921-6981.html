			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / British Midland to cut domestic flights BRITISH Midland Airways, the UK's second-biggest scheduled airline, has carried out its threat to cut domestic services in favour of international routes. It is ending flights between London's Heathrow Airport and Liverpool at the end of March. It will use the freed landing slots at Heathrow to run six flights a day to Brussels. British Midland, 25 per cent owned by Scandinavian Airline System, threatened in December to end the flights as part of its campaign to be allocated more slots at Heathrow. The airline also announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.5m last year, compared with a loss of Pounds 11.9m in 1990.</p>

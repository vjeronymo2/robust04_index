The regional Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR) is seeking to join  the group but the coalition members, including the Christian  National Union (ZCHN), the Confederation For an Independent  Poland (KPN), the Peasant Agreement (PL), the Movement For the  Republic of Poland (RDR), the Peasant Christian Party (SLCH) and  the Centre Alliance (PC), have put off the decision till next  week. The coalition's hesitance is caused by its "reservation  towards one of the Rzeszow leaders of this political  association."    The agreement signatories are discussing the name of the new  bloc and its election manifesto.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Royal Insurance to sell Dutch arm ROYAL Insurance has agreed to sell its Dutch operations for a net Pounds 166m to European Partners for Insurance Co-operation (Epic), a newly formed three-way joint venture in which Royal has a one-third share. The other two partners are Aachener und Munchener (AMB) of Germany and Fondiaria of Italy. The cash raised will improve Royal's solvency margin - a rough measure of an insurer's financial strength - by 5 percentage points to an estimated 34 per cent. It will also cut the group's gearing ratio by 11 percentage points, Royal said. Analysts had been expecting a gearing ratio of 33 per cent at the December 1991 year end. However, Royal is still expected to cut its final dividend when it releases annual results on Thursday next week, in spite of the benefit to the group's finances from this deal and the Pounds 250m sale of an 18.8 per cent stake in AMB last December. Royal's shares rose 2p to 232p yesterday. Royal has been regarded as the weakest of the large UK composite insurance groups. It said yesterday that the strategy of pursuing the alliance in Europe was driven by Mr Richard Gamble, who became group chief executive on January 1. The deal recognised that Royal could not make the necessary investment to take advantage of opportunities in Europe on its own. Analysts said that even after the Epic deal Royal had to reduce the size of the group and that further sales of businesses were likely. Royal and its two partners in Epic have been in talks about the joint venture since last autumn. Each is investing Pounds 59m in Epic's share capital, and Epic will also borrow Pounds 34m. Epic is buying Rodutch, which owns Royal's Dutch business Royal Nederland, for Pounds 205m and Rodutch is to buy Royal Leven, Royal's Netherlands life company, for Pounds 20m. At December 31, 1990, Royal Nederland and Royal Leven had net assets of Pounds 66m giving Royal a Pounds 100m book profit on the deal. Together the two businesses' net premiums were Pounds 190m in 1990. The three partners in Epic aim to build it into a European business outside their home markets which will also be able to attack the east European market. The plan is to transfer other non-domestic operations to Epic. Royal will put in its activities in Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Malta, Portugal and Spain, which together have annual premiums of about Pounds 100m. AMB will contribute businesses in Belgium and France. If all these businesses were combined today, Epic would have annual premiums of Pounds 450m. Lex, Page 20</p>

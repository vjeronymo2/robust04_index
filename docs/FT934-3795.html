			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard powers forward The startling share price performance of Standard Chartered, the banking group, continued apace yesterday, with the stock climbing to another all-time high as marketmakers, caught in the grip of an ever-tightening bear squeeze, moved to close their short positions in the stock. Standard Chartered shares have risen almost six-fold since January 1991 when they reached a 10-year low of 208p, as the market anticipated the bank's move to cut its dividend payment, the first reduction by one of the UK banks in recent times. Since August 1992 Standard shares have moved up virtually in a straight line, from 365p to yesterday's Pounds 12 level. The stock shortage in Standard reached its peak around midday yesterday as Swiss Bank, one of the leading marketmakers, triggered a backwardation in the price by bidding Pounds 12 a share when other marketmakers were offering to sell stock for considerably less. The backwardation was held for some time, eventually subsiding as the shorts were filled in, and leaving the shares a net 40 higher at 1193p. Standard Chartered has been one of the big driving forces in the banking sector's strong showing this year. The bank has long been rumoured as a bid target, with Lloyds Bank, which retains a 4.6 per cent stake, still said to covet the group, which it first tried to acquire in the early 1980s. There were wild rumours circulating in the market late on Friday that one of the big Swiss banks was casting an eye over Standard. A number of the big broking houses said yesterday that Standard shares had overreached themselves and were due for a reaction.</p>

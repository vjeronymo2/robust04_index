			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / High hopes for Brussels trade deal EC and US trade negotiators meet in Brussels tomorrow amid expectations that they can bring off a deal on the Uruguay Round of trade talks, tempered by the knowledge that, as one EC official put it, 'we have been here before'. Hopes of concluding the nearly six-year-old world trade liberalisation talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have been dashed at too many previous 'breakthrough' negotiations for anyone to be unreservedly optimistic now. Officials from both sides argue that President George Bush is desperate to get at least a headline deal on the Uruguay Round in time to lift his declining chances of re-election on November 3. For the EC, a deal offers a chance to shift attention from the crisis over the Maastricht treaty. It would also defuse a dispute with the US over the EC's oilseed subsidy regime that has threatened to explode into a tit-for-tat trade war. The Brussels talks were timed, one senior EC official says, to make it possible for next Friday's emergency summit of EC heads of government in Birmingham to set its seal on any agreement. Mr Bush set out his hopes for a deal in a recent letter to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission. The EC and US have softened their positions on farm subsidies, the main obstacle to a deal since the collapse of the Gatt summit in December 1990. But both will have to cede still more, and then sell the result to their Gatt partners. The French government remains set against further concessions to the US, after taking a beating from farmers in last month's referendum on Maastricht and facing defeat in general elections next spring. Its raw new farm minister, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, was sent to Brussels this week to block any Gatt agreement which would damage French farmers' ability to export. Technically, Paris cannot veto an agreement. But in the midst of the Maastricht crisis, it remains to be seen whether France's partners would risk isolating President Francois Mitterrand - much less whether German Chancellor Helmut Kohl would risk damage to the Bonn-Paris axis which has carried European integration forward. The hope is that France is substituting gesture for substance, and will record its hostility to an agreement without forcing an EC crisis over the issue. What is most agitating France - the EC's principal food exporter - is a provision in the Uruguay Round draft 'final act', published last December, to cut the volume of subsidised farm exports by 24 per cent, in addition to a 36 per cent cut in the value of subsidised exports. The second main EC-US difference is the extent to which payments to European farmers in compensation for price cuts agreed in the Community's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be exempt from a 20 per cent domestic subsidy reduction, as called for by the draft 'final act'. The last 'near miss' on these issues was July's Group of Seven summit in Munich, at which Britain proposed the volume of subsidised food exports be cut by 21 rather than 24 per cent. However, EC farm commissioner Mr Ray MacSharry has pushed hard for 'aggregation' - allowing the EC to cut exports of sensitive farm products by less than 24 per cent if it cuts deeply enough in less sensitive areas to reach an average 24 per cent cut. Mr MacSharry said in Dublin yesterday: 'It is absolutely clear that the Community requires a certain level of flexibility' - but he is understood to be willing to make this flexibility limited and detailed. Mr MacSharry has also demanded that the EC's compensation payments under CAP reform be indefinitely exempt from Gatt subsidy cuts. If the agriculture impasse is unblocked in the next few days, it is still uncertain whether separate Uruguay Round disputes on trade in services, market access, and intellectual property rights can be resolved. But then, if the farm dispute is not unblocked, negotiators may never find out. Mr Max Baucus, the influential chairman of the Senate international trade subcommittee, has warned against a 'last-minute push to conclude the Uruguay Round' for partisan political purposes, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. In a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, trade representative, Senator Baucus complained about the politicisation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and said a similar end-of-term push to get a Gatt deal would not result in the 'best possible' agreement.  ------------------------------------------------ Agricultural Support in the OECD (Dollars Bn)  ------------------------------------------------                       1990    1991    Percent                                       change  ------------------------------------------------ EC                    86.3    83.6     -3.2 US                    35.5    34.7     -1.7 Japan                 29.8    31.5     +5.5 Canada                 7.1     7.7     +8.2 Switzerland            5.3     5.1     -2.9 Finland                5.3     4.5    -14.5 Total OECD           180.2   177.0     -1.8  ------------------------------------------------ Source: OECD  ------------------------------------------------</p>

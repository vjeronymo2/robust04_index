			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Palestine aid talks break down Talks on foreign aid to support Palestinian self-rule broke down yesterday in an Israeli-Palestinian dispute over whether some of the funds could be used in east Jerusalem. The conflict drew a rebuke from the World Bank, sponsor of the talks, which said the aid issue was too important to be 'derailed by the two main parties'. The bank indicated it would try to resume the negotiations, but set no date for reconvening the delegations from donor nations. A Palestinian official said 6 per cent of the Palestinians' Dollars 160m 1994 operating budget was proposed for projects in Jerusalem.</p>

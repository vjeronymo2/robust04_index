			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Arts: Borodin plays Shostakovich - Concert The Borodin String Quartet is with us again, this time to play all 15 of Shostakovich's quartets at the Barbican. Music-lovers who have heard these Russian artists will need no more than this reminder, but some further description is in order for the others. So: this is a peerless ensemble, whose every performance has the patina of long-considered experience and musical wisdom. The playing is technically superb - but one scarcely notices that, because expressive musicianship is so completely to the fore. Hearing the Borodin can be a revelation of the miraculous range and depth of the string-quartet medium. Unfortunately they cannot be recommended to novice listeners, who might find subsequent quartet-recitals grey and disappointing by comparison. The Borodin exemplify the quartet ideal: four strongly individual voices (even the second violin), perfectly matched, able to slip between solo status and supporting roles at a moment's notice, always retaining the sense of a contrapuntal dialogue. It is a mere bonus that their palette of tone-colours happens to be unsurpassed, as likewise their long-sighted perspective on every quartet they play. Shostakovich's rich cycle of quartets has two quite peculiar strengths. One is that they are all 'mature' works: the First, which we heard on Monday with its two immediate successors (the Borodin programmes are chronological, not mix-and-match), was composed after the Fifth Symphony - and 13 years after his precociously brilliant Symphony no. 1. The other is that as the composer grew ever more fearful of the 'ideological' scanning to which his large-scale works were subjected by cultural apparatchiks, he came to reserve his most candid, heartfelt scenarios for the quartet medium, relatively un-public and safely under-noticed. The Borodin owns the special authority of having studied every quartet with Shostakovich himself. (Or at least its incomparable violist and cellist did: they are original members from 1945, whereas the two violins joined them a mere 20 years ago, the year before the composer died.) Not a page goes by without some illuminating touch unthought-of by other ensembles, and the calculated force of each whole work develops in a clean trajectory. If novice listeners will risk going to hear these players and spoiling their appetite for any less exalted team, they will at least have the satisfaction of knowing how a great, irreplaceable quartet sounded. Remaining concerts in the cycle: tonight, Friday, Monday and Wednesday next</p>

"I have decided to seek reelection because there are still many  challenges facing Orange County.  </P> <P> "I want the opportunity to continue our war on drugs, which has mobilized our  entire community to significantly decrease the demand for drugs," he said.  "Jail overcrowding is another critical issue that needs to be resolved."  </P> <P> No one has yet filed nomination papers to run against Gates, who has served 15  years as Orange County's sheriff-coroner. The filing deadline for the election  is March 9.  </P></p>

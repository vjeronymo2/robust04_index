			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Lower lira set to boost Merloni Merloni, the Italian white goods group, expects pre-tax profits to recover to about L45bn (Dollars 27m) for 1993 against L4.8bn the previous year. The improvement stems from higher margins because of the lower lira and the one-off effect in 1992 of a L24bn foreign exchange loss. Net group earnings in 1992 were only L1.6bn. Mr Vittorio Merloni, chairman, said that last year's sales soared by 30 per cent to more than L1,700bn, thanks to the first-time consolidation of Pekel, the Turkish white goods group 54 per cent owned by Merloni. Stripped of the acquisition, the increase would have been about 15 per cent, he said. Merloni had raised its share of the European white goods market by about 1 percentage point, to more than 9 per cent, behind Electrolux, Bosch-Siemens and Whirlpool, he said. Mr Merloni, who hopes to reach a 10 per cent market share, did not exclude further acquisitions, particularly now the group's net financial indebtedness was under control. Merloni's net indebtedness actually rose to L230bn last year from L206bn in 1992. However, that was swelled by the Pekel takeover, without which the total would have been about L185bn. Following the advance repayment of a L100bn convertible bond, announced yesterday, net debt was now about L180bn. The lower lira should have boosted margins by about L80bn last year, said Mr Merloni. However, about half the competitive edge gained had been used to maintain or even reduce prices. Of the remaining L40bn, around half had been used for extra promotion or restructuring, while only the remaining L20bn had fed through to the bottom line, he said.</p>

			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CYCLING TOUR OF PALM SPRINGS;  </P> <P> BRADY SPRINTS TO WIN SECOND STAGE ROAD RACE  </P> <P> John Brady of 7-Eleven sprinted away from a pack of riders Saturday to win the  75-mile second stage of the Tour of Palm Springs bicycle race in 2 hours 45  minutes 29 seconds.  </P> <P> Mike McCarthy of Celestial Seasonings was second and David Farmer of Team Crest  was third.  </P> <P> Jay Vonderahe of Team Montgomery, who was fourth, is the overall leader going  into today's criterium finale. Norm Alvis of 7-Eleven is second and Scott  Moninger of Team Crest is third.  </P> <P> Brady, 24, of Dublin, credited teammate Alvis for helping him into position to  win. A group of cyclists, fighting strong desert winds, were bunched through  most of the race. Breakaways were short-lived, and leaders were quickly  swallowed by the group. Brady, regarded as an excellent sprinter, followed  Alvis through the pack, then sprinted about 50 yards from the finish.  </P> <P> Brady finished second in road races in St. Louis and Ohio the last two  weekends, but just ahead of Greg LeMond, last summer's winner of the Tour de  France. LeMond was scheduled to race in Palm Springs, but canceled to remain  with his wife in Minnesota, where she is expecting.  </P> <P> Today's criterium begins at 11:45 a.m. in downtown Palm Springs. The final will  be preceded by a women's race at 10 a.m.  </P></p>

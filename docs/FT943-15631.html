			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Lords appeal for investors' scheme The Investors Compensation Scheme (ICS) is to seek leave to appeal to the House of Lords against a ruling by the appeal court on a case involving home income plans. The judgment ruled that the scheme did not have discretion to decide levels of compensation according to what it considered fair. ICS said the ruling could 'undermine the whole basis of the scheme', and force the process to become long and unnecessarily legalistic.</p>

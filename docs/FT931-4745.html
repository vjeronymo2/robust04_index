			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Deportees issue deadlocks peace process THE Palestinians will not resume Middle East peace talks until Israel agrees to stop deporting people from the occupied territories, its leading negotiator said yesterday. It was announced last night in Washington by US officials that the US and Russia were today expected to issue formal invitations to the foreign ministries of Israel, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon and to Palestinian leaders to resume Arab-Israeli peace talks in Washington on April 20. But Mr Haidar Abdel-Shafi told Reuters in Jerusalem that the talks would remain deadlocked as long as Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, reserved the right to deport people. Israel deported 415 Palestinians to southern Lebanon in December and has so far refused to implement fully UN Security Council resolution 799 which calls for their immediate return. Mr Abdel-Shafi's assessment of the peace process came shortly before Britain added its diplomatic weight to efforts to get the talks restarted by meeting representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in London. Mr Douglas Hogg, minister at the Foreign Office, ended a two-year British ban on top-level contacts with the PLO in talks with Mr Faisal Husseini, the leading Palestinian in the occupied territories, Mr Hael Fahoum, who heads the PLO European section in Tunis, and Mr Afif Safieh, its London representative. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said yesterday his government would not be following the British example because of disappointment at the PLO's failure to be of assistance on terrorism issues. Britain informed the US in advance that it was resuming ministerial contacts with the PLO and did not encounter any opposition. Israel, however, complained about the resumption of British contacts, arguing that it would damage the peace process. Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, hoped that the British move and an earlier Belgian decision to upgrade the Palestinian mission in Brussels signalled a more positive European role in the peace process. Mr Hogg said after his meeting with the three Palestinians that they understood the importance of resuming bilateral negotiations with Israel. 'Further movement on the question of deportation would greatly facilitate their ability to come back into the talks,' he added. Mr Safieh described the meeting with Mr Hogg as 'warm, constructive and very promising'.</p>

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / BAe maintains dividend despite Pounds 81m loss: Shares rise 11% as City welcomes strengthened cash flow Defence profits increase to Pounds 500m BRITISH AEROSPACE reported yesterday a pre-tax loss of Pounds 81m last year compared with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 376m in 1990. The result was much in line with City expectations but better-than-expected cash flow in the second half of last year, as a result of a reduction of working capital, sent BAe shares 11 per cent higher. The shares closed yesterday at 303p, up 30p in a day which saw the highest volume of trading in the company's shares since July 1988. The company maintained its final dividend at 16.1p bringing the total for the year to 25p a share, the same as 1990. Profits before tax and exceptional items amounted to Pounds 154m against Pounds 400m. This was Pounds 4m higher than its autumn forecast. Exceptional restructuring charges of Pounds 235m were taken to cover the company's rationalisation programme. However, after a substantial cash outflow in the first half of last year, the company said it achieved an underlying cash inflow of Pounds 630m in the second half mainly because of strength in its defence activities and a reduction in working capital at its Rover car subsidiary. With the benefit of its Pounds 432m rights issue, the company finished last year with a net cash balance of Pounds 323m against Pounds 711m. BAe's defence business accounted for the lion's share of the group's earnings with trading profits before interest of Pounds 500m compared with Pounds 486m. Commercial aircraft operations reported a trading loss of Pounds 37m compared with a surplus of Pounds 14m. The regional aircraft operations faced particularly difficult market conditions, said Sir Graham Day, BAe's interim chairman. The Rover car subsidiary faced tough market conditions but contained trading losses before interest to Pounds 52m, compared with Pounds 65m the year before. The property development business saw its losses grow to Pounds 24m last year from Pounds 8m, while construction activities increased profits to Pounds 40m from Pounds 28m. The group's total sales were virtually flat at Pounds 10.56bn last year compared with Pounds 10.54bn in 1990. Sir Graham said BAe expected to appoint a chairman and finance director at its annual meeting in April or May. Commercial aircraft side deeper in loss, Page 25; Lex, Page 22</p>

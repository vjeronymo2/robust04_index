			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Ministers delay London rail plan THE Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme, by far the biggest public transport project planned for central London, is in danger of being delayed or cancelled because of public spending pressures, it emerged yesterday. The government confirmed that the bill authorising the line's construction, due for its second reading next week, had been delayed pending a re-appraisal of the project's costs. Planned as a link between Paddington and Liverpool Street stations, the CrossRail project would allow the running of trains between east and west London. Trains would stop at stations in the West End and the City on the way. Commuters could travel straight to some destinations without changing to London Underground, relieving pressure on the Central Line. The line was due to open at the end of the decade but the Treasury is now asking whether the cost of the scheme can be justified given the downturn in central London employment. One internal study is understood to have suggested that the recession could cut 20 per cent off the traffic passenger flows originally forecast for the service in the year 2001. The government is under pressure to reach an early decision on the project because 250 people are already employed on it and Pounds 211m is due to be spent on detailed design and parliamentary consultation pre-construction work over the next three years. London Underground, already concerned about delays to the planned Jubilee Line extension to Docklands, reacted furiously to the CrossRail threat. 'To question CrossRail now by clutching at the flimsiest of mathematical straws would be a classic case of economic myopia,' it said.</p>

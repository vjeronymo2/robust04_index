			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko </F> by Myroslav Levytskyy: "Ukraine Expects Accord"]    [Text] In the busy schedule of Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Anatolyy Zlenko, 21 to 22 March is reserved for an official  visit to Poland. Before his departure to Warsaw, he gave an  interview to our correspondent. Minister Zlenko emphasized that  Ukraine attaches special attention to Poland both in terms of  politics and diplomacy. For Ukraine, the existence of  independent Poland is of strategic importance, as is the  existence of independent Ukraine for Poland.    Ukraine expects that the visit to Poland will help it  achieve  more understanding in interstate relations, stabilize relations,  encourage closer cooperation and coordination of efforts on the  international arena -- both in the system of international  organizations and regional cooperation.    [Levytskyy] The opinion is widely held that Ukrainian-Polish  economic relations are not developing in an appropriate way.    [Zlenko] Over the past two years of Ukrainian-Polish  relations, a relevant legal base was created and 45 necessary  agreements were signed, a considerable portion of which are in  the economic sphere. However, figures for Ukrainian-Polish trade  do not reflect potential opportunities. The $500 million is far  from the level that would give either side the feeling of fully  exploited opportunities and mutually beneficial economic  cooperation. Economic agreements should receive more attention,  and we must also create mechanisms for their implementation.    [Levytskyy] Still, which of the 45 agreements with Poland  have already brought tangible results?    [Zlenko] Almost all of them work at present, but not at  their  full capacity, though.    [Levytskyy] In January and in early February, the  U.S.-devised "Partnership for Peace" initiative received very  mixed opinions. Now, six weeks after Ukraine became a member of  the "Partnership," could you point to any concrete advantages  that membership in this initiative has given Ukraine?    [Zlenko] Ukraine was the first CIS country to join this  program. We did this to hold relevant consultations, acquire  relevant experience in military and political spheres, and  finally, to resolve issues of our national security through the  "Partnership." We are currently preparing a document outlining  forms and extension of Ukraine's participation in the  "Partnership."    We are working hard on this document. We will determine  everything that is of any interest for Ukraine, based on our  possibilities, including economic ones, so that we could  definitely establish the volume of our cooperation with that  program.    [Levytskyy] But I am curious what price Ukraine will have to  pay for its participation in the "Partnership?"    [Zlenko] This question cannot be answered before we finish  our document.    [Levytskyy] What economic effects will political  participation in this program have on Ukraine?    [Zlenko] The "Partnership" program is first of all military  and political in nature. But the very fact of cooperation in  the framework of this program, the fact of agreement, can  incline our partners to also resolve economic issues. We do not  link our membership in this program with resolving economic  problems. We see it in the much broader context.    [Levytskyy] Political parties in Poland, Ukraine, and other  former socialist camp countries are actively discussing the idea  of creating a political and economic center or an alliance for  coordination of efforts. Promoters of such an alignment dubbed  it the "Inter-Sea Area" [Mizhmorya]. Are you familiar with this  initiative? What do you think about it?    [Zlenko] We have an initiative intended to establish a zone  of stability and security in the Central and Eastern Europe. We  are working on this idea, and have conducted organizational  measures -- also with the participation of countries that  expressed their interest in it. I believe I gave a  comprehensive answer to your question. We are proceeding from  the assumption that some kind of security vacuum is emerging in  Europe which needs to be filled.    This initiative could be used to solve all issues based on  trust and the creation of the political climate so that it could  serve as a preventive measure. This would allow us to preempt  events, instead of following them, as is the case in the Balkans.    No matter what name this initiative has -- the "Inter-Sea  Area," "Inter-Ocean Area," or "Between Heaven and the Earth" --  it is designed to provide conditions for national security  guarantees.    [Levytskyy] Jacek Kuron and other Polish politicians have  repeatedly stressed that Ukrainian-Polish relations could only  get rid of negative tendencies when Polish history is written by  Ukrainians and vice versa. What is your attitude toward this  problem?    [Zlenko] This problem was discussed during my first visit to  Poland in 1992. We agreed on the need to write such history.  We have reached understanding. Unfortunately, this is idea is  unfolding very slowly. However, it is not dead. Joint  commissions are actively working on revising history textbooks.  This work is drawing to a close.    [Levytskyy] One more question regarding mutual  understanding.  An idea was proposed some time ago to cast Polish television  programs to Ukraine, and Ukrainian to Poland...    [Zlenko] This is an interesting thought. However, it needs  some work yet. The Ukrainian State Television is putting  together its programs intended to access other countries. This  issue needs to be specified so one can develop a clear position  and know how to implement this idea.    [Levytskyy] Some delegations, Polish among them, met with  representatives of political parties on their visits to Ukraine.  At present, there are three directions in the Polish Eastern  policy -- the first one is orientation toward Moscow, the second  gives priority to cooperation with Ukraine and Belarus, while  the third option advocates the soonest possible jump into the  United Europe with no regard to the fate of Eastern neighbors.  Do you plan to meet with any leaders of political parties?    [Zlenko] We orient ourselves toward the Polish official  policy. Besides, I have plenty of meetings in the government,  Sejm, and Senate that will give me the picture of current  trends. But let me stress it again -- we are primarily oriented  toward the official politics.</p>

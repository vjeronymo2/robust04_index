			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEARS 4TH-QUARTER PROFIT FALLS 79%;  </P> <P> HUGE RESTRUCTURING CITED, BUT ANALYSTS SAY IT'S JUSTIFIED  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., the largest U.S. retailer, said Thursday that its  fourth-quarter earnings dropped 79% to $117.4 million as the company launched a  massive restructuring to boost future earnings.  </P> <P> Chicago-based Sears said the fourth quarter included a $500-million  restructuring charge. In the year-ago period the company earned $554.4 million.  </P> <P> Despite the poor appearance of the results, Sears and analysts said they were  pleased with the retailer's health. Without the restructuring, net income rose  11% to $618 million. Revenue rose to a record $14.56 billion from $13.36  billion.  </P> <P> Sears shares closed unchanged at $42.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> The huge retailer announced its sweeping restructuring in October after a  sluggish third quarter.  </P> <P> "This has been a year of major transition," Edward Brennan, Sears chairman and  chief executive, said in a statement. "The actions announced last October . . .  will position Sears to compete more effectively in the future."  </P> <P> "The transitional phase changes are going to help 1989 results and the  considerable expenses are well justified," added analyst John Landschulz at  Cowen &amp; Co.  </P> <P> The company's full-year earnings dipped to $1.45 billion from $1.63 billion in  1987. Revenues rose 9.5% to a record $50.25 billion last year from $45.90  billion in 1987.  </P> <P> Sears, which also owns Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter Financial Services and  Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group, said last fall that its third-quarter  earnings fell 16% amid intense retail competition and slumping securities  volume.  </P> <P> Sears restructured to avoid being taken over, announcing cost cuts, a large  stock buyback and the sale of the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago and  Allstate's group life-health insurance business.  </P> <P> In addition, Sears said it would change its retail strategy of frequent sales  and promotions to one of "everyday low pricing" to reduce inventories and boost  sales.  </P> <P> Sears Merchandise Group lost $113.5 million in the fourth quarter after a  $442-million charge from the restructuring. Without the charge, the group  earned $328.5 million on revenue of $9.52 billion.  </P> <P> The unit, which contributes about 60% of Sears' revenue, suffered from fierce  competition in the retail industry, but Brennan said the group's revamping is  proceeding on schedule.  </P> <P> Allstate Insurance earned $206.3 million in the fourth quarter, compared to  $217.2 million a year earlier. Earnings suffered mainly from a $58.6-million  restructuring charge.  </P> <P> Dean Witter, the company's financial services arm, earned $26.3 million in the  fourth quarter, versus a loss of $33.8 million in 1987 after the October market  crash.  </P> <P> Sears's Discover credit card earned $6.7 million in the fourth quarter against  a loss of $31 million a year ago.  </P> <P> Dean Witter is a "fortress of earnings strength," said Josephthal &amp; Co.  analyst Janet Mangano, who said the financial unit and Discover were the  highlights of Sears' results. "They were core to profits in 1988 (and) will  continue in 1989."  </P> <P> Coldwell Banker earned $61.9 million last quarter, in contrast with a  $5.1-million loss a year ago.  </P></p>

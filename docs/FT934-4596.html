			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / PLO calls for US talks intervention Just a week and a half before the scheduled start of Israel's troop withdrawal from the Gaza and Jericho areas, the Palestine Liberation Organisation yesterday called on the US to help break the impasse in autonomy negotiations, warning that the December 13 deadline for the start of autonomy was 'sacred'. Israeli officials, by contrast, strenuously played down any talk of a crisis, with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin insisting that a delay of a few weeks would not be too serious, and reiterating Israel's commitment to completing its military pullout by next April. Crucial autonomy questions - concerning the size of the Jericho autonomous region, how the army will redeploy in Gaza to protect Jewish settlers there, responsibility for border crossings, and more - have yet to be resolved at the Cairo Israeli-PLO negotiations. Mr Nabil Sha'ath, chief PLO negotiator, left the Egyptian capital yesterday for Tunis declaring the Israelis were deliberately angling for an 11th-hour deal 'in an attempt to reap the maximum benefits'. The PLO's appeal for American intervention, which came at the end of a two-day leadership meeting in Tunis, may well be answered. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, is due to begin a Middle East visit today. Mr Sha'ath said Mr Christopher would meet Mr Arafat in Amman on Monday, and again in Tunis later in the week. In the occupied territories themselves, meanwhile, Israeli troops shot and wounded two Palestinians in a car near Gaza City. Hundreds of Jewish settlers rioted in the Arab West Bank town of Hebron, firing shots into the air and smashing house and car windows.</p>

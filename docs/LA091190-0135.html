			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> NORTH TUSTIN GROUP SEEKS INCORPORATION  </P> <P> A group calling itself Citizens for More Local Control will announce plans  today to promote the incorporation of North Tustin.  </P> <P> Bruce Nestande, a former Orange County supervisor and state assemblyman, and a  six-year resident of North Tustin, will act as chairman of the group.  </P> <P> Marvin Rawitch, the group's initial organizer, said the plan is to put  incorporation on the ballot by June, 1991.  </P> <P> "We are divided into two spheres of influence and are being nibbled away by  piecemeal annexations," Rawitch said. "And staying as a county island no longer  seems to be a viable option. As a county island, the kind of local control that  we would like to have is very limited."  </P> <P> Rawitch said the group is in the process of selecting officers and directors  and will be seeking grass-roots support.  </P> <P> A study funded by Foothill Communities Assn. and unveiled in June at a town  hall meeting indicated that a utility-users tax would be needed for the  28,000-resident community to succeed as a city.  </P></p>

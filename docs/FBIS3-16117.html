			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Ivan Ivanov and </F> Vladimir Mostovets]    [Text] Helsinki 11 Mar -- The heads of government of Russia  and Finland, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Esko Aho, at the bilateral  talks that took place between the government delegations, spoke  of the necessity of drawing up measures to provide effective  support at state level for practical cooperation between Russian  and Finnish firms and enterprises in order to reinforce the  upturn in trade that has been observed in the past year. The  ITAR-TASS correspondents were told this and about the results of  the talks by Valeriy Grishin, first deputy head of the Russian  Federation Government press service.    Valeriy Grishin said that during the in-depth discussion of  questions of Russian-Finnish relations it was remarked that  there were no fundamental political problems between them. At  the same time, it was noted that the considerable drop in the  level of trade between Russia and Finland since the mid-1980s  remained an object of concern to both sides, as the current  level was far below the two countries' potential. V.  Chernomyrdin noted in this connection that Russia regards  Finland not only as a good neighbor but also a prospective  partner, and he stressed that the Russian Federation Government  will provide assistance to the Finns' aspirations not to give up  the positions they have won in our market.    The two sides' delegations assessed the conclusion of an  accord to make additional deliveries of Russian weaponry and  special equipment in part payment as an important step toward  resolving the acute problem of Russia's indebtedness.    There was also a detailed exchange of opinions around the  problems of Russian and Finnish participation in the processes  of European integration. The government heads are united in the  view that the process of Russia's drawing closer to the European  Union and Finland's entry into the European Union will take  account of the interests of ensuring Russian-Finnish trade and  economic links. V. Chernomyrdin stressed that Russia is in  favor of strengthening regional cooperation in the Baltic  region, moreover, he favors cooperation aimed not at exchanging  statements about intentions but at achieving practical results.    Touching on the problems of relations between Russia and the  Baltic countries, the head of the Russian cabinet noted that our  country continues to be seriously concerned over the position of  the Russian-speaking population in Latvia and Estonia. He also  pointed out that Tallinn and Riga were not prepared to heed the  recommendations from human rights organizations and experts from  the CSCE and European Union in the human rights sphere.    Viktor Chernomyrdin invited Esko Aho to pay an official  visit  to Russia.</p>

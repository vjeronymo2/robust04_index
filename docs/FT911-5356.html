			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / The European Market: Inquiry signals change in Commission's steel policy - The sector is now subject to normal competition rules THE Z Club sounds like a seedy, backstreet night club. The Z Club was indeed slightly disreputable. But it was also highly exclusive. It was the most elaborate attempt yet by Europe's steel producers to rig the market for their products. For most of the 1980s, the club brought together the main European stainless steel producers for detailed discussions on how to restrain competition. In the next few months, European Commission competition officials will discover whether a successor to the Z Club has been rigging the market for heavy beams and sections used in the construction industry. The EC last week confirmed its officials in January raided the offices of four steel manufacturers - British Steel, Usinor Sacilor of France, Arbed of Luxembourg, and Peine Salzgitter, the German group - to gather information on the suspected cartel. Two trade associations in Germany and France were also raided. The investigation seems to signal a change of Brussel's policy towards steel. For more than a decade, the EC coaxed the industry through the crisis of excess capacity which hit it in the mid-1970s. The manifest crisis measures under the 1952 Treaty of Paris, which imposed import limits and production quotas, were phased out in June 1988. During the crisis, the EC officially sanctioned collusion between the main producers, institutionalised by Eurofer, the European steel producers' association set up 1976. It helped police the system to limit competition and stabilise market shares. The investigation into construction steel seems to mark an important shift in the wake of the end of the quota regime. A competition policy official said last week:'It is as though we have moved out of the old ghetto of steel policy. 'We now have a philosophy here that the steel industry is a sector like any other.' The companies could face fines up to a maximum of 10 per cent of turnover if they are found guilty. This EC signalled this shift last July when its inquiry into the Z Club warned it would in future take 'severe action' against cartels. The club brought together the presidents, commercial directors and export managers of six European producers, including British Steel, Krupp and Thyssen. Its anatomy was exposed in the formal record of the EC's decision, which was hidden away in the EC's official journal for July 1990. British Steel, which presents itself as the paragon of free market virtue, proposed co-operation on prices at a meeting in Dusseldorf on February 27 1984. After a string of meetings, several producers agreed bilateral 'inter-penetration' deals to limit exports and imports. By the time the club met in Paris on April 15 1986, a formal agreement was in sight which was signed at a meeting a month later in Dusseldorf. The agreement specified delivery quotas, a complex voting procedure for club members, a system of fines for companies breaking the quotas, the make-up of a secretariat, a pricing committee, and a market forecast committee. The only external evidence of the lengths to which the producers were going to fix the market came on October 1 1986 when the Z Club members raised their prices on the day the formal agreement came into effect. That was followed by a series of substantial price increases in the next two years. Yet the club's existence was not a secret. In late May of 1986, Sir Robert Scholey, the British Steel chairman, wrote to EC vice-president Karl-Heinz Narjes, who was responsible for the steel industry, about the agreement to establish the cartel. Five months later, Sir Robert wrote again, claiming to have forwarded a copy of the cartel's constitution. Although Vice-President Narjes replied that he could not sanction the cartel, he took no action to break it up. The six producers were together fined only Ecu425,000 Pounds 293,000) on the grounds that they thought competition rules were modified throughout the sector by the manifest crisis measures. The EC was an accessory to a crime it was itself investigating. The investigation into construction steels was prompted by an inquiry in Norway last year which discovered restrictions on imports designed to maintain domestic steel prices. It seems unlikely this investigation will uncover anything quite so elaborate as the Z Club. The companies have learned to become more circumspect. They talk of 'orderly marketing arrangements', not price fixing. According to industry specialists, senior executives rarely take part in such meetings, leaving them to commercial directors whose actions can be disowned. There may have been tacit agreements to limit imports to stabilise market shares. Dr Derek Tordoff, of the British Constructional Steelwork Association, says :'I understand that some form of tonnage quota agreement may have existed in the past'. But it seems unlikely there was direct price fixing. There have been persistent complaints from steel consumers in the UK that prices for heavy sections and beams are far stickier than for other products such as hot rolled coil. With the downturn in construction markets, the amount of steel processed by fabricators for use in buildings has fallen from 1.4m tonnes in 1989 to a rate of 1m tonnes this year. With supply well in excess of demand, prices should have fallen. Yet the fabricators who buy directly from British Steel say the companies pricing policy has not changed. Although prices on the Continent are sometimes 20-30 per cent lower than in the UK, customers say they find it difficult to get foreign groups to bid for contracts. When they do, the prices are within a whisker of British Steel's. One fabricator with a plant in the UK and on the Continent says :'It is cheaper for me to buy British Steel steel abroad and then ship it back to the UK'. British Steel, which is not commenting on the investigation, could retort that prices quoted by stockholders, the middle men in the industry, have fallen dramatically even if its prices have not. British construction groups use old-fashioned Imperial measures for steel which are difficult for Continental producers to supply. Two forces may be pushing the industry away from cartels and collusion between a large number of national producers, towards competition between more concentrated more international groupings. Firstly, industrial restructuring is promoting growing concentration and seemingly, more competition. The 8m-tonne-a-year market is now dominated by a joint venture between Usinor Sacilor and Arbed and British Steel. Usinor Sacilor is buying its way into the UK market through acquisition, while British Steel is doing the same on the Continent. Secondly, the Treaty of Paris may be reverting to its original role. It was originally based on laissez-faire principles to eliminate tariff barriers, subsidies and cartels. Sir Leon is attempting to restore the treaty's historic purpose. If they are found guilty, the producers will be dealt with far less leniently than the members of the Z Club.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Agnelli arm buys Perrier options IFI International (Ifint), the Luxembourg-based holding company partly owned by Italy's Agnelli family, has acquired an option to become the largest single shareholder in Exor, the investment group which controls the Perrier mineral water group. Ifint told the French stockmarket authorities yesterday that it could raise its existing 13.5 per cent stake in Exor, to just over 21 per cent. However, a Perrier spokesman said the deal will have no impact on the mineral water group. It is not known whether Ifint plans to exercise its option, although the mere fact of owning it means the group is considered under French law to have lifted its stake in Exor to above 20 per cent, at which level it has to make an announcement. If Ifint exercises its option, it will overtake Ms Corinne Mentzelopoulos, whose family is Exor's main shareholder and who now owns 18.6 per cent of the group. Analysts said this is unlikely to change the Mentzelopoulos' control of Exor. Exor made no comment yesterday and securities analysts confessed to being baffled by the deal. The Agnelli family could be strengthening its French industrial portfolio, which already includes stakes in BSN, the food group, Accor in hotels, and the Pechelbronn holding group, said Mr Sylvain Massot, food and beverages analyst at Morgan Stanley's London office. Ifint paid around FFr700m (Dollars 119.5m) for its existing 13.5 per cent share in Exor in January, making it then the group's third biggest shareholder. It has now acquired options for another 7.86 per cent from Rovida, a Swiss-based holding company and currently the second largest shareholder, which had 18.2 per cent of Exor's stock. Ifint, 23 per cent of whose ordinary shares are owned by the Agnelli-controlled Istituto Finanziario Industriale, bought its stake as part of a complex share swap with Ms Mentzelopoulos.</p>

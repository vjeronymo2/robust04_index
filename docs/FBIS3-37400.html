"The main task of the Central  Bank is to curtail inflation", the newspaper quoted him as  saying. "Jointly with the IMF and the World Bank a package of  anti-inflation measures has been drafted in order to keep the  situation under control and then considerably decrease the rate  of inflation. The moderately tough financial policy which was  determined yet in November 1992 will be preserved. However, the  Central Bank is not going to implement the course at any price  which can result in mass unemployment and a further decrease in  living standards", he said.    Among other priority tasks Khandruyev listed "further reform  in the settlement system and improval of the work of commercial  banks". The newspaper commented that the bank will call on  commercial banks to increase their charter capital, improve the  licensing system, introduce world banking standards.    The Russian VESTI newspaper published on the front page  reports by Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha and Fuel  and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik. "The agro-industrial  complex faces a very difficult economic and financial  situation", the newspaper writes. "The debt to agriculture  amounted to 2.3 trillion roubles by the beginning of 1994, while  the agro-industrial complex, in its turn, owes 1.8 trillion  roubles for material resources". Zaveryukha believes that "the  situation in agriculture can be stabilised only by state  subsidies".    Shafranik said that mutual non-payments "had aggravated the  crisis situation in fuel and energy complex to the maximum".  Russian and CIS consumers owe the industry 11.6 trillion roubles  for 1993 which is a 6.6-time increase compared to the previous  year.    "Russia should not turn into a dumping ground for poisonous  waste from the world", the KRASNAYA ZAVEZDA said in an article  devoted to the dumping problem. It stressed that, according to  a Greenpeace report, 96 attempts to bring to Russia dangerous  toxic waste with a total volume of 34 million tonnes has been  registered since 1987. More than a half of the attempts - 58 -  took place during the last two years. Over 80 per cent of waste  brought to Russia is of the German origin. Besides Russia, in  1990-1991 nearly eight thousand tonnes of toxic waste were  brought to Poland, 5,000 tonnes to Estonia, 3,500 tonnes to  Romania, 270 tonnes to Ukraine and 40 tonnes to Lithuania, the  daily added.    The PRAVDA, commenting on the NATO ultimatum to Bosnian  Serbs, noted that "one cannot by pay attention to the more than  strange metamorphosis of the United Nations". Instead of  fulfilling the peace-keeping mission it actually turns into a  "world gendarme who is ready to punish and does punish mostly  those who do not suit the forces lobbying in the UN  headquarters, rather than than those who act against peace and  humanitarian principles". "There is an impression that the  United Nations is distancing itself from initially proclaimed  principles and turns from an impartial world arbiter into an  instrument of politics of a group of countries headed by the  USA", the daily said.    The TRUD publishes an interview with Mayor of Moscow Yuriy  Luzhkov who, speaking about privatisation, said: "I believe it  is impossible to sell for nothing state property which was  created and accumulated in decades of work of many generations.  (Privatisation Minister Anatoliy) Chubays either conceals the  true state of things or does not understand anything in what he  is doing".    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA publishes the speech of Communist  Leader Gennadiy Zyuganov who summed up the results of the party  activities in the first year since the August 1991 ban on it was  lifted. Zyuganov noted, in particular, that the Communist Party  "is the biggest in strength and the third in the number of  electorate, has organisations in all regions and enjoys a rather  numerous and influential faction in the Federal Assembly".</p>

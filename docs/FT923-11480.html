			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: West needed to plug leaks in former Soviet oil sector - Neil Buckley begins a three-part series explaining why foreign investment is vital to an industry in crisis THE VAST oil and gas reserves of the former Soviet Union have been the talk of the western oil industry for more than two years, but several recent events have added a new impetus to the great oil rush to the east. In the space of two months came potentially the two largest deals yet struck with a former Soviet republic, Kazakhstan; Mr Boris Yeltsin's appeal to the G7 to write off a chunk of Russia's debt in return for a share of its natural resource; visits to the West by several high-ranking Russian officials seeking more investment; and the announcement of Russia's first government-backed oil industry trade fair in Tatarstan in October. Russia has adopted the hard sell: in Tatarstan, data packages will be available for perusal, and helicopters will be ready to whisk western delegates off to the oilfields. The slide in Russia's oil output has also focused attention on the sorry state of its industry. As Mr Vasili Fedorchenko, an energy expert from Russia's supreme economic council and a former head of a Siberian oil enterprise, impressed on a meeting of London oil executives and financiers last week: 'If there is no reinvestment in the oil industry, it will collapse. To hesitate is to die.' The size of the former Soviet republics' reserves is staggering. They have 43 trillion (million million) cubic metres of natural gas, or two-and-a-half times as much as any other country. The republics also hold the world's seventh largest reserves of oil, at 58bn barrels. These, moreover, are known reserves. In many areas only the top geological layer has been explored, with just 5 per cent of discovered oil and 12 per cent of gas at depths exceeding 3 km (1.86 miles). In the lower strata, there could be much more. Experts believe there is a high probability of discovering other giant or supergiant fields. The Russian Federation holds 90 per cent of proven reserves, with 70 per cent in the Tyumen region of western Siberia. But significant quantities are also to be found in Kazakhstan - sometimes tipped to be a new Kuwait - and in Azerbaijan, as well as other republics such as Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The energy sector received the bulk of investment in industry through to the 1980s, turning the Soviet Union into the biggest producer of both oil and gas in the world. At its peak, in 1988, it produced 12.7m barrels a day - equivalent to more than half of the combined output of members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Gas production reached 740bn cu m in 1989 - more than the next six largest producers combined. Oil and exports accounted for nearly half the Soviet Union's foreign currency income. Since then, production has slumped. Oil output is estimated by the International Energy Agency to have fallen to 9.3m b/d for the second quarter of this year, and is still falling. The blame for the decline lies partly with unbalanced development. Funds were poured into boosting output in the maturing Volga-Urals fields in the 1950s and 1960s when more should have gone into developing new discoveries in western Siberia. When attention shifted, belatedly, into Siberia, the Volga-Urals region was allowed to decline more rapidly than it should have. Fields were also over-pumped with inadequate technology. Clumsy water injection to lift oil has left some fields waterlogged. The most immediate cause of the output decline is, however, rapidly falling investment. In 1989 the oil and gas industry received Rbs12.9bn; last year, Mr Fedorchenko said, it was Rbs8.7bn. This has forced the industry to cut back drastically on exploration needed to sustain the industry. More than 100 drilling teams were disbanded between 1988 and 1991, and total drilling dropped from 5.1m metres, to 3.8m. Meanwhile, enterprises can no longer afford - or even obtain - replacements for ageing equipment and infrastructure. The main equipment plants are in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ukraine (the principal supplier of pipelines and tubing), which all became independent states with the collapse of the Soviet Union, and are now demanding close to world prices for their goods. Key equipment prices have risen by between four and 22 times, Mr Fedorchenko says, while some producing associations have been supplied with less than half the equipment they needed. The pipeline situation is especially acute. Some estimates show that more than 10 per cent of oil and gas leaks from the 300,000 km of pipeline in the former Soviet Union. This can have serious environmental and safety implications. In June 1989, gas leaking from a pipeline beside a railway line exploded as two trains were passing near Ufa, in the Urals, killing 600 people. An adviser to the Russian energy ministry told last week of obsolete pipelines being dug out of the ground and re-used in new locations, because of the shortage of new piping. The tasks - and the opportunities - for foreign companies and investors are immense. Paradoxically, however, many observers consider the most important task to be investment in energy-saving technology rather than in the oil industry itself. Russia expends nearly twice as much energy per head of population as western countries, and must cut its own consumption if it is to reap maximum benefits from its energy industry. In the oil industry, western experts suggest a three-pronged approach is necessary. A first, relatively easy step, is improving field management, and retraining engineers and managers. Simply by 'tweaking' equipment, some experts suggest output could be raised by 10 per cent or more. The second step is for western companies to become involved in boosting production from existing fields. Mr Sergei Roginko, a member of acting Russian prime minister Mr Yegor Gaidar's secretariat, said in London this week that the introduction of western technology could double the production possible with Russian technology in many cases. Elsewhere, where fields have been damaged or waterlogged, whole new seismic and drilling programmes may be needed. The third step is the development of new fields, and exploration for more. The attractions of such developments are clear but so, too, are the pitfalls. Not the least of the latter is the remoteness of some fields and the huge investment required in infrastructure and communications. Ironically, some fields are so large only a drastic upturn in the western oil industry, and in oil prices and demand, could allow even western companies to consider developing them. Further articles in this series will be published on July 31, looking at the improving commercial climate for foreign investors; and on August 7, covering deals signed so far with western companies.</p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Food &amp; Drink: Appetisers THE SPANISH couple we passed at the entrance to London's newest Spanish restaurant, Albero &amp; Grana at 89 Sloane Avenue, SW3 (tel: 071-225-1048), looked typically elegant, writes Nicholas Lander. Even more typically, they were going in to eat at 11pm as we were leaving. Albero &amp; Grana is a brave attempt to introduce Spanish colour and some of the more unusual dishes that top quality Spanish cooking can offer. Although the restaurant takes its name from two colours associated with the bullfight (albero is the sand used in bullrings, grana the red of the matador's cape), there are some sensible design touches which soften the decor and differentiate it from the bustling tapas bar at the front. The restaurant has imported Angel Garcia, a Michelin-starred chef from Madrid who, not surprisingly, will take some time to find his feet. At our dinner, only the main courses - zarzuela, a Catalonian fish stew, a huge plate of grilled fish, and a best end of lamb with garlic puree - really evoked the best of modern Spanish cooking. Restaurant: about Pounds 20 a head. Open seven nights 7.30pm-11pm. Tapas bar: 5.30pm-midnight. One item missing from the smartest dining tables in Britain for the past two years has been Badoit mineral water. Exports were stopped when droughts in France led to a sharp reduction in source levels. Now, it is available again from Majestic Wine Warehouses. One litre costs 97p. There is a deposit of 20p a bottle and crate deposit of Pounds 2 (fully refundable).</p>

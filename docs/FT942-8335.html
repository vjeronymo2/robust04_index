			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Helping 'green' farming to a fertile future - Britain's organic growers want more government support Eating organic food can improve your fertility: that is the conclusion of a recent study in Denmark in which 30 men living on a diet of organic produce were found to have a sperm count double that of their counterparts. Mr Patrick Holden, policy director of the Soil Association, says the study provides evidence that there may be a link between declining male sperm counts and the increase in the use of agrochemicals in the past 50 years. He hopes that statistics like these will boost British sales of organic food, which increased dramatically in the 1980s to Pounds 200m but levelled off during the recession. Demand for organic food is now rising again, but it can cost up to 20 per cent more than food produced by conventional methods, which limits its appeal. Part of the problem for British consumers is that a lot of organic food must be imported because the UK does not grow enough for its own needs. Countries such as Denmark and Germany have thriving organic sectors that have been stimulated by government support. In Germany 10,000 farmers have converted to organic methods and 2.4 per cent of the country's agricultural land is cultivated without the use of artificial fertilisers and pesticides. However, the German government pays the equivalent of Pounds 200 a hectare for farmers to produce in this way, which costs up to 30 per cent more than conventional methods. Ireland recently became the latest member of the European Union to announce substantial support for organic farmers, offering to pay them IPounds 150 a hectare to make up for the higher cost of producing without chemicals. The organic industry in the UK is calling on the British government to offer similar levels of support, but Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, has been reluctant to extend financial aid to Britain's existing 800 organic farmers. Last year, the government allocated Pounds 1m to help farmers convert to organic production - offering a payment of Pounds 70 a hectare. The scheme has not been implemented yet, however, and existing farmers say it penalises them since they have borne the full costs of converting their farms and will receive no government help for it. Mr Holden says this has given many farmers the message that the government is not serious about supporting the organic sector. 'We're committed to farming organically, but we're just hoping someone will see sense and realise how hard they are squeezing us,' says Ms Daphne Saunders who produces organically on 570 hectares on the banks of the Thames in Oxfordshire. The costs of converting a conventional farm to organic methods are substantial as land must be taken out of production for at least a year. Ms Helen Browning, chairman of the British Organic Farmers, says it is taking her up to 10 years to convert her 550-hectare holding into a fully organic farm. 'Soils which have been dependent on artificial fertilisers for 30 to 40 years can go through a withdrawal process and be almost dead for several years,' she stresses. The way to improve the soil in an organic scheme is to grow a fertility-building crop such as clover, but this means that some land is always growing a non-profit crop. 'It is a lifetime's commitment to convert a farm and many farmers won't take that financial risk until they see some government support for it,' says Ms Browning. Another problem for farmers is finding a market for their organic food and particularly one that will pay them a premium to cover the higher costs of production. Ms Browning does a lot of direct marketing of her organic meat and produce and says she is 'snowed under' with demand. But this is not an approach that most farmers would be willing to take. There is no established infrastructure for marketing organic produce. Ms Saunders points out that some British supermarkets were keen to take organic food in the 1980s when it became fashionable, but are now finding they do not get sufficient through-put to make it worthwhile. Mr Mike Calvert who runs CWS Agriculture, Britain's biggest farm group, does not believe that organic farming can be viable over the long-term. 'Our experience has shown that organic farming maybe has a place in a small family farm with access to niche markets, but could never play a part in broader-scale agriculture,' he says. Five years ago, Mr Calvert converted 105 hectares of some of his best land in Leicestershire to organic production, but says it is much more labour intensive than his conventional production. Much of the produce is sold in a farm shop, but it does not command much of a premium over conventionally-produced food. But organic farmers are receiving little subsidy and having to compete against conventional producers who are heavily subsidised by Brussels, Mr Holden stresses. Investment in organic production methods would be a potent way of reforming the CAP, he contends, as it reduces food surpluses in a more cost-effective way than setting aside land. 'We believe there is a case for supporting agriculture, but organic producers deserve the biggest share of that: if they were supported they could fulfil the public demand without charging more for their food,' he says.</p>

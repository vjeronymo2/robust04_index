			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / N-plant risks 'can be priced' Investors would be able to put a price on nuclear risks if the government decided to privatise the UK nuclear power industry, say the US financial advisers to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility. Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment firm, says in a report that experience in countries with privately owned nuclear utilities shows that investors are sophisticated enough to be able to put a price on nuclear shares and trade them. The report says that, in the US, shares of utilities owning nuclear power stations have performed at least as well as other US utilities over the past five years. It points out that investors are more interested in a management's ability to handle risk than in the risks themselves. The report concludes that a privatised Nuclear Electric would be compared to the highly-rated nuclear utilities in the US because of the strong improvements in performance that the company has been able to achieve recently. Morgan Stanley is advising Nuclear Electric during the current government review of nuclear power. Its team is headed by Mr Francis Maude, a former junior Treasury minister who lost his Commons seat at the last general election. The conclusion of the report runs counter to the view of the UK government in 1989 when it decided against privatising nuclear power because it believed that investors would refuse to invest in nuclear shares.</p>

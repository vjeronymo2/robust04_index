			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (9): A trio of success stories - Previous award winners THE former winners of the FT's enterprise award are still winners in their business worlds so far. Not surprisingly, they all agree that the competition is A Good Thing, writes Catherine Milton. 'I could recommend it to anyone,' says Mr Peter Vassallo, managing director of Vassallo Sea Foods, winner in 1991. The judges' record speaks for itself. Mr Tim Hely Hutchinson, the first winner, is now managing director of Hodder Headline, after a Pounds 48.9m takeover this year of Hodder &amp; Stoughton. Mr Vassallo is still managing director of Vassallo Sea Foods, which has grown through the recession. Last year's joint winners, Mr Adrian Breger and Mr Jamie Gibson, of Breger Gibson, remain joint managing directors of their disposable nappy company, which has also remained profitable through the downturn - and in a market dominated by multinationals. The high profile Mr Hely Hutchinson, then of Headline Book Publishing, was winner of the overall award and winner in the 'large start-up' category. With Pounds 1.3m of start-up capital and two subsequent fund-raisings totalling Pounds 2.1m, Headline penetrated an already crowded field dominated by established publishing groups. In 1990 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 609,000 on sales of Pounds 7.8m. Mr Hely Hutchinson thinks he missed out on the publicity that his successors have attracted: 'It was a morale booster rather than anything else. It further raised my standing in the City, among venture capitalists and in the investment community. I didn't get the publicity of last year's winner, though. The award has built up over the years. But I like the watch and was happy to win.' The award serves 'some kind of purpose,' he admits - 'they are good for the winner and venture capitalists themselves are very interested in showing their successes. I heard about the award through my backers.' But he adds: 'You don't suddenly get a lot more orders, or authors, just because of one award and there is always the superstitious fear that if you win an award you hit trouble the next day.' He also enjoyed helping select his successor: 'There was every attempt to make things fair. I think we picked a good winner.' That was Mr Vassallo, who agrees the award brought him publicity and also that helping to judge the following year's candidates gave the added bonus of some useful insights. He says: 'The award gave me exposure to a great number of people who have achieved. They gave me an insight into what is and is not achievable in business and what is and is not achievable in management. 'Being involved in judging the following year's candidates was an illuminating experience. I enjoyed being privy to conversations between top industrialists and top people in the City.' He says it is difficult to say whether the award 'changed' anything: 'It certainly was a talking point, a focus for local interest.' Mr Vassallo exudes the confidence of one who believes in the future of his company. Two years after winning the award everything in the world of seafood is going swimmingly. HE WON the award for the transformation of what had been a family fishmongering business into one of the main suppliers of fish to Britain's supermarkets. The judges praised his business vision - the way he seemed able to anticipate the changes taking place in the sourcing, processing, marketing and sale of fish and exploit them to his company's advantage. He sold the business for Pounds 13m to Albert Fisher in 1991, choosing the food and vegetables wholesaler over several other suitors. On the profits from this deal, struck before the award was won, Mr Vassallo has realised his dream of becoming a rally driver. But he has not taken his eye off the road through the tricky landscape of recession. Since 1987, when venture capital funds were injected into the business, employment has grown from about 70 to about 260 with average sales per employee rising over the last two financial years to Pounds 155,172 from Pounds 139,405. Latest annual sales are approaching Pounds 40m, compared with Pounds 33.4m in the year to August 1992 and Pounds 27.9m over 13 months in 1991 - a sharp increase since 1987 when turnover was under Pounds 3m. With margins tight in the food industry, profits have been a more modest Pounds 2.19m in 1992 and Pounds 1.81m in 1991. The company has just received confirmation of a further investment from Albert Fisher - 'this will continue the growth potential of this company,' says Mr Vassallo. AT Breger Gibson, a spokesman for the two MDs says: 'The award meant a lot to both Jamie and Adrian. They worked very hard and it really was the highlight of the success of the business.' Turnover for the year to March 1992 increased to Pounds 21.8m compared with Pounds 19.5m the year before while pre-tax profits fell a little to Pounds 1.02m from Pounds 1.11m. The last two years were a step change from 1990 when sales were Pounds 11.7m and profits just Pounds 693,000. The whole company enjoyed the award: 'We were all very very thrilled and the associated publicity was a help. As soon as the information was released in the FT all sorts of people that we would not have thought would have known about us started contacting us.' Breger Gibson also enjoyed the visit by one of the judges - 'the visit was actually very interesting. He was very interested in us, which makes a different. It was worthwhile meeting someone from outside the sector.' The 325-stong company is now working towards the 'ultimate flushable diaper'  -'it is our belief that not now but in the next century, that will be used generally across the board.'</p>

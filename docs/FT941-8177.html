			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Observer: Hot wires in Tokyo The Japanese don't normally scribble on other people's walls, especially in Tokyo. So when the local headquarters of the US electronic giant Motorola is sprayed with an anti-US slogan, people stop and stare. Not that yesterday's anti-Motorola graffito, sparked by a US threat to impose sanctions on Japan unless Motorola is treated better, is in particularly bad taste. In typical Japanese style, it amounts to no more than a polite cough by US or even European standards. 'Crush the hard-selling diplomacy of US imperialists . . . ', it reads. Tokyo has not yet resorted to the tactics of America's Japan-bashers in earlier trade disputes. Sledgehammers have not been taken to Motorola's mobile phones. Still, tempers are clearly beginning to hot up in the nine-year-old trade dispute, despite Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's contention that Japan and the US have just embarked on a truly adult relationship.</p>

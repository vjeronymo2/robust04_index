			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGAL VIEW: COURTS BACK THESE MARRIAGE PROPOSALS  </P> <P> My Jan. 5 column about the legal requirements of marriage reminded lawyer and  former law professor Louis M. Brown, a pioneer in the preventive law movement,  of an article he edited more than 10 years ago as part of a "Counseling  Newlyweds" project he helped start at the Beverly Hills Bar Assn.  </P> <P> The project provided newlyweds with one hour of free legal counseling on the  legal ramifications of marriage or living together. Since the project is no  longer in operation, Brown suggested that I might offer a checklist of items  that newlyweds might review shortly before or after they walk down the aisle.  It sounded like a good idea. Besides, my sister, who is about to join the  married ranks, would be thrilled. So, with thanks to Brown for sharing his  article with me, here are a few legal issues to consider.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Separate Property  </P> <P>  -- Ownership. Under the community property laws of California, everything that  you own before marriage is considered "separate property." Thus, all your  earnings before marriage are yours and yours alone. So if you own your own  automobile at the time of your marriage, it will remain your separate property.  However, you may want to share ownership of it with your spouse by either  making it a part of the community property or by giving your spouse a  half-interest in it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spouse's Debts  </P> <P> But changing the nature of the property from separate to community will mean  that it can now be used to satisfy your spouse's debts. In other words, a  creditor may reach community property for debts incurred by either spouse. (By  the way, whether or not you do change the ownership of the car, you'll want to  talk to your insurance agent, to make sure that your new spouse is covered when  he or she drives it.)  </P> <P>  -- Community property. In general, most property and all earnings acquired  after a marriage are automatically considered community property. Interest and  dividends payable on separate property generally remain separate, however. Each  spouse has a one-half interest in community property and equal rights of  management and control.  </P> <P> One spouse can't give away community property without the permission of the  other, but with a will you can leave your heirs one-half share of the community  property. And even if you happen to get married in some out-of-state location,  the community property laws of California will apply if you reside here.  </P> <P>  -- Pre-nuptial agreements. Courts will enforce marriage contracts that divide  a couple's assets in advance, so if and when there is a divorce, there won't be  a fight. Agreements that cover personal behavior, like who will take out the  garbage, are less likely to be upheld, but some people like them because they  help couples discuss and resolve potential problems. (I think they are silly.)  </P> <P>  -- Children. If you have kids, the law will require you to support them. This  is meant to protect the child and save the government from the burden of  providing support.  </P> <P>  -- Life insurance. The law does not require you to have a life insurance  policy, but now that you're married, you might want to consider it. And if you  already have a policy, you may want to amend it and add your spouse as the  beneficiary. Life insurance is even more important if you have children,  because you will want to provide for their security, care and education, if  anything untoward happens to you.  </P> <P>  -- Savings accounts. Speaking of beneficiaries, you'll want to check any other  savings device, such as your employer's pension plan or bank accounts, to see  what name you listed as a beneficiary. You may want to delete Uncle Harry and  add the name of your new spouse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name Change  </P> <P>  -- Names. In many cases, women change their last name to that of their  husband. In fact, it wasn't until 1975 that the Legislature passed a law giving  a married woman the right to use her maiden name in all transactions. The  choice is up to you. However, if you do change your name, you should try to  advise all the necessary parties, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles,  Social Security Administration, insurance carriers, registrar of voters and  your employer.  </P> <P> If you don't do it now, you'll have to do it eventually, like when you renew  your license, or try to vote. It does sound like a terrible hassle, although  one letter to each agency, with a copy of your marriage certificate, should  suffice. (I'll have to tell my wife of four years that; she still hasn't gotten  around to telling all of officialdom.)  </P> <P>  -- Estate planning. Just because you're getting married doesn't mean you need  a will -- it will probably be more important if and when you have children --  but it's not a bad time to begin some estate planning, especially if you have  substantial assets.  </P> <P> After you finish picking a wedding dress, planning the wedding party, sending  out the invitations and choosing the honeymoon site, there probably won't be  time left to visit a lawyer. But now you should be a bit better prepared to  discuss some of the legal binds that will tie you together, or at least know  which questions to start asking.  </P></p>

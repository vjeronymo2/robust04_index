			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Salmon succeeds beer and sandwiches: Praise and criticism for Heseltine's lunch with industry leaders AS THE government steps up its efforts to create a new framework for talking to industry, the initiative has sparked applause from the business community but scepticism among former advisers to Baroness Thatcher, who think it may mark the return to a more corporatist style of government. Tomorrow's meeting between Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and business leaders is to discuss the economy and ways to create better conditions for industry in the 1990s. Mr Heseltine has invited the chairmen or top directors from 19 organisations including Rover, J. Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer, the Post Office, TI and Northern Foods. The 'round table' is expected to gather once or twice a year. Less senior people from the same companies are likely to meet Department of Trade and Industry officials every few months for an exchange of views. The department has declined to publicise the agenda for the meeting, even though details of the lunch menu - parfait of chicken liver, salmon escalope and poached pears - have leaked out. The round table has been welcomed by Sir John Banham, a former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, who says it could help bring together the generally disparate cultures of Whitehall and industry. He reckons that more contacts could 'change the situation of the past few decades in which civil servants have tended to see the average person from industry as a bit like Uriah Heep'. Sir Peter Carey, a former permanent secretary at the DTI, who is adviser at merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, said it was 'helpful' for industry to talk to government about the effects of Whitehall policies. This marked a change from the 1980s, when government 'distanced itself' from business leaders. Less impressed, however, is Professor Patrick Minford, an economist at Liverpool University who was informal adviser to Lady Thatcher's government in the early 1980s. He says gatherings of this kind can turn into a 'talking shop' in which industry expects special favours from government. Prof Minford, who is one of the Treasury's 'seven wise men' of outside forecasters, said Mr Heseltine's round table was 'rather ludicrous'. He added: 'I can see the potential for all sorts of mischief. People from business are invariably a nuisance when it comes to talking about the economy. When the head of the CBI speaks, I shudder.' Sir Bernard Ingham, former press secretary to Lady Thatcher, said: 'There is a danger of slipping back to a situation where people from industry think government can do things for them. Formal meetings between government and industry do little other than warm the self-importance of the people who attend them.' Sir Douglas Hague, a Downing Street adviser to Lady Thatcher between 1979 and 1983, said Mr Heseltine's initiative was 'fairly realistic' because it appeared to be based on getting better information from industry leaders about business conditions. It was important, however, to prevent civil servants from taking a lead in policy ideas involving industry as they 'hadn't a clue' in this area. Sir Christopher Lewinton, chairman of the TI engineering company and a member of Mr Heseltine's round table, said the initiative could lead on to a 'harnessing of brainpower' from business and Whitehall to set up co-operative projects in areas such as semiconductors, aerospace and vehicle technology. Such schemes may be essential, he believes, to put UK industry on a more secure footing for the 1990s. Sir David Alliance, chairman of textile company Coats Viyella, said the generally pro-business attitude of the Thatcher administrations did not go far enough. 'They were on our side but didn't understand us. These are two different things.' Sir David - who is not part of the round table but has had informal discussions with the department recently - believes even small steps to improve discussions between Whitehall and business can be useful. He says, for instance, that for nearly two decades textile companies have produced poor-quality bedspreads for the National Health Service because civil servants have specified unsuitable products.</p>

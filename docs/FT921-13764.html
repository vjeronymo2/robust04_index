			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Observer: Sold out Alex, the yuppie cartoon-character who makes his debut in the Daily Telegraph this morning, ought to be proud of his latest deal. Having been given his first big break at The Independent, the City spiv didn't hesitate to sell out for a hefty pay increase elsewhere. He has also earned a bonus by rubbishing his old employer in newspaper and poster ads. The Telegraph, besides paying Pounds 85,000 a year for the cartoon strip, is spending a further Pounds 250,000 boasting of Alex's defection. The Independent's boss Andreas Whittam Smith is a trifle pained by the knocking copy, but the Telegraph says it is just in fun. Will it work? The Daily Telegraph, Britain's biggest selling heavy paper, has an elderly readership and is heading down market in pursuit of the ruthless young types who admire everything Alex stands for. It is nevertheless giving the Independent, now spending nothing on advertising itself, much free publicity. Whittam Smith, for his part, professes himself convinced that Alex has passed his heyday. His conviction would be more convincing, however, if he hadn't replaced the cartoon with a third-rate strip about a TV celebrity.</p>

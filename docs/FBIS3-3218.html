Of these proposals, 63 were made by NPC delegations and the  rest by deputies jointly.    Various NPC special committees have prepared reports on how  to handle these proposals and will submit their reports to the  presidium of the current NPC session for deliberation.    An official of the bill-handling group said that the bills  cover a wide range of areas, with their focus on the economy.    A considerable number of these bills deal with economic  legislation, the official said.    Bills calling for the enactment of a number of new laws,  such  as a futures trading law, an arbitration law, a credit law, a  real estate law and a mineral resources law, have been included  in the five-year legislation plan of the current NPC Standing  Committee.    He said that deputies also submitted many bills on the  formulation of new economic laws on debt, mortgage and  construction as well as a law against the reaping of staggering  profits. Some bills stress the need to intensify the central  bank's functions of exercising macro-economic controls.    In their bills, many deputies said that measures to narrow  the gap between developed eastern China and underdeveloped  western China should be incorporated into a legal system for the  establishment of a market economy.    Moreover, they called for the enactment of a new economic  law  on how to assist underdeveloped areas in speeding up economic  growth there, the official said.    He said that many bills emphasize the importance of  strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the national  economy and protecting farmers' initiative.    Several bills propose the enactment of a new law governing  investment in agriculture, and the implementation of measures to  curb price rises for farming-related manufactured goods, and to  stabilize grain prices and narrow the difference between prices  of farm products and manufactured goods, he said.    The bills also call for the formulation of a new law  concerning grain trade, another law on agriculture environmental  protection and still another regarding the development of  township-run enterprises, as well as the implementation of  measures to tighten control over the use of resources and  strictly protect farmland.    Many other bills call for the enactment of new laws and  revision of existing ones in order to maintain social stability,  the official said.    Deputies agreed that the building of a clean and honest  government is closely related to the maintenance of social  stability, he said.    To this end, they called for the formulation of a new law to  punish civil servants violating discipline, another law on  compensation for parties involved in misjudged cases, and  general rules governing law-enforcers.    He said that many bills call for the revision of regulations  on penalizing violators of public order, the enactment of an  anti-narcotics law and the revision of existing laws to severely  punish children abductors.    Some bills call for the enactment of a new law concerning  safety in production, a minimum wages law, a law on promoting  employment, a law on pension insurance and a law on protecting  aged people.    Many deputies also called for the formulation of a new law  to  supervise the implementation of existing laws in an effort to  facilitate the establishment of a socialist market economy.    The official said that many bills deal with the promotion of  ideological and cultural progress.    For example, some deputies called for the enactment of a new  law to manage the cultural market, another on higher education  and still another on education input. Others proposed revising  the compulsory education law.    He said that some bills involve national defense and the  protection of servicemen.    The bill-handling group had also received 1,200 proposals  made by deputies, he said.</p>

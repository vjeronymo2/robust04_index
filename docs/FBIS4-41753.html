			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Yarov report under "Detention" rubric: "The </F> Zhirinovskiyites Have Been Entangled Somewhat in Swindling  Operations. An Intermediary Between the LDPR and GMM Has Been  Caught in an Attempt To Defraud a Bank" -- last three paragraphs  are commentary by Mikhail Leontyev]    [Text] As SEGODNYA's correspondents have learned from  reliable sources, over the past weekend the economic crime unit  of Moscow's Southwestern Okrug uncovered and prevented a major  financial fraud. According to the police, on 3 May [as  published] two young men tried to obtain a credit of 600 million  rubles at Perm and Samara banks, producing documents from the  First Federal Bank and Transkredit-bank. An investigation  showed that the businessmen had used forged documents, and they  were soon detained on suspicion of fraud. The two men are  Kazachenko, 25, unemployed; and Travkin, who described himself  as an LDPR assistant deputy chairman in charge of international  affairs. During a search $231,000 in cash was confiscated from  the detainees, as well as four copiers, a Remington pump gun,  and two hand weapons. We shall report more on the case in one  of our next issues.    Especially interesting in this apparently banal crime story  is the fact that it is linked directly to reports of the  Zhirinovskiy party's being financed by certain subcriminal  groups, notably the well-known "Dutch trust company GMM," owned  by Nenakhov. According to information from responsible sources,  the above Maksim Travkin, who earlier worked for Nenakhov, was  an initial link in "informal" financial relations between GMM  and the LDPR.    The emergence of Travkin as adviser to the LDPR deputy  chairman for international affairs (Aleksey Mitrofanov, who is  the next link in the same chain), as well as in lists of  Zhirinovskiy party official parliamentary delegations, coincided  with Zhirinovskiy's open lobbying in favor of GMM. It is enough  to recall the LDPR leader's letter to the premier asking to rein  in financial bodies ostensibly hampering the activity of a  well-reputed company, and also his letters to state TV companies  demanding that they resume GMM advertising, which was suspended  following a letter from the Ministry of Finance. (Incidentally,  Zhirinovskiy's letter for some reason produced an impression  only on the Russian TV and Radio Company, which fulfilled his  instructions diligently).    As for the information about an attempt to obtain credit  with  false documents from the First Federal Bank, the meaning of  "false" is yet to be clarified. The fact is that this bank is  simply one of the semi-fictitious legal entities organized by  Nenakhov. His firm's accounts have been seized by the tax  authorities, which serves as legal cause for refusing to return  money to GMM clients.</p>

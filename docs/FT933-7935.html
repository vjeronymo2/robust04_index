			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tour war The prospect of a price war among tour operators knocked Airtours and Owners Abroad, although both recovered strongly to limit the losses. Airtours finished 3 down at 375p and Owners just a half-penny off at 78p. Although similar talk accompanies the launch of the 1994 brochures every year, this year's has been given added spice by the consolidation in the travel industry this year with Airtours buying two major travel agencies and Thomas Cook taking a big stake in Owners Abroad. Leisure analysts said the new integrated companies were unlikely to want to sustain a situation where discounts being offered by travel agencies are added to price cuts from the tour operating business. 'These things are usually shown up to be phoney wars pretty quickly,' said a seasoned observer. Market perceptions that the MMC report into British Gas was a lot less damaging to the share price than might have been expected triggered a burst of strong buying interest in water shares, viewed as a prime target for regulatory interference. The big trading stocks in the sector all attracted strong support, and were led forward by Thames, 8 better at 533p, North West, 7 1/2 firmer at 528 1/2 p, Seven Trent, 6 up at 532p, and Anglian, 5 higher at 523p. Wessex spearheaded the more thinly traded issues, advancing 10 to 633p, while South West added 9 at 558p. The electricity stocks also made good progress, with Norweb prominent and finally 7 higher at 564p. Analysts said the market was wrong to assume that other regulatory bodies would adopt a similar course to that undertaken in the gas industry. 'An assumption that there is a super-regulator and a utilities-wide policy is a dangerous course to steer and is quite clearly not the case,' said one utilities specialist, who advised caution in chasing the recently buoyant utilities sectors any higher. There was renewed speculation that Grand Metropolitan is about to sell its Chef and Brewer chain of public houses and restaurants. A sale of Chef and Brewer has been rumoured for several months, although drinks analysts believe that negotiations with several parties have foundered over price. GrandMet was thought to be seeking around Pounds 750m for the 1,600-strong chain. Whitbread was one name being suggested yesterday. Its 'A' shares moved forward 9 to 508p. GrandMet eased 2 to 451p. Fears that BICC would announce a rights issue with today's interim results appear to have faded. The shares improved 20 to 417p. Presentations by Kwik Save were said to have encouraged some buying interest and the shares ended 22 higher at 710p. Dealers said renewed whispers in the market of a takeover bid for United Biscuits had no foundation. The shares climbed 4 to 389p.</p>

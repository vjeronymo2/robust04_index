			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 1 (CNA) -- Taiwan registered a US$1.67  billion surplus in its balance of payments in the first quarter  of this year, the most favorable quarterly balance since 1992,  the Central Bank of China (CBC) said Wednesday [1 June].    CBC officials attributed the surplus to increased capital  inflow. Taiwan saw a net capital inflow of US$1.76 billion  during the January-March period. It was the first time the  country's capital account ended in the black since 1988.    The balance of payments is a system recording all of a  country's economic transactions with the rest of the world  during a specified period of time. It is usually divided into  the capital account, which records short and long-term capital  flow, and the current account, which records merchandise and  service trade as well as unrequited money transfers.    In the first quarter of this year, Taiwan's current account  surplus declined to a 13-year low of US$272 million due to a  sharp decrease in the merchandise trade surplus.    Taiwan's foreign trade surplus totaled only US$240 million  during the January-March period because of sluggish exports and  a continued rise in imports.    The aggregate capital and current account surplus should be  US$2.03 billion in the first quarter of this year. Excluding  net errors and omissions, the CBC put the country's balance of  payments surplus at US$1.67 billion.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Norwegians turn a deaf ear to right: A conservative economic message finds no echo NORWAY'S Conservative party, fighting an uphill battle against the ruling Labour party in next Monday's general election, came up last month with a telling message on the deteriorating state of the public finances. Mrs Kaci Kullmann-Five, the opposition leader, picked up on a reference made during the last election campaign in 1989 by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, who told a group of schoolchildren that the government should no more overspend than their parents should buy Mercedes cars they could not afford. In fact, said the Conservative leader, government deficit spending over the past three years amounted to the purchase of more than 300,000 Mercedes, and Labour's plans for the next four years would add another 460,000. The problem for the Conservatives, who are slipping in the polls, is that few Norwegians appear to be listening. On the contrary, the minority Labour government is making much of an improvement in the oil-dependent economy since it took over from a Conservative-led coalition in 1990 in the midst of recession. Last year, gross domestic product grew by 3.3 per cent. Even excluding North Sea oil and shipping revenues, the economy grew by 2 per cent. Much the same performance is expected this year, with a slight improvement forecast for 1994. Oil and gas production rose sharply, with crude oil output rising by 14 per cent to a record 2.22m barrels per day. This year, average daily oil production is expected to hit 2.28m barrels. More tangibly, as far as voters' pockets are concerned, interest rates and inflation have tumbled. Inflation is set to rise slightly to 2.75 per cent for the year as a whole, but at its current level of 2.3 per cent is the lowest in Norway for three decades. Meanwhile, the Bank of Norway has cut its key overnight lending rate no less than 12 times this year from 11 per cent in January to 5.5 per cent today. The three-month domestic Euro-rate stands at 6.2 per cent, compared with 6.6 per cent in Germany and 7.7 per cent for the Ecu. The less good news concerns unemployment. The real jobless rate has grown steadily to 8.2 per cent of the workforce in August and will not stabilise until next year. Compared with its neighbours, Finland and Sweden, Norway has escaped lightly, given that it shares many of the same characteristics of high welfare and production costs and indulged in the same credit-led boom in the late 1980s. Finland and Sweden have both seen their economies shrink for three years in succession and anticipate only a modest return to growth next year. Unemployment in Finland has topped 20 per cent and is at 13 per cent in Sweden. But the jobless rate in Norway still stands at its highest level since the second world war and is a top political priority. So Mrs Brundtland's Labour party, relying on the safety net of oil, has made no bones about using fiscal policy to boost the economy. The result has been a steady slide into deficit from a budget surplus equivalent to 0.5 per cent of GDP in 1990 to a forecast deficit this year equal to 7.5 per cent of GDP. Excluding oil, the figure shoots up further to a deficit of 12.8 per cent of GDP. Government forecasts are also based on a projected oil price of Dollars 19 per barrel, a level significantly above current prices. It is not just Mrs Kullmann-Five who has attacked the issue of the deficit. Mr Hermod Skanland, the governor of the Bank of Norway, has been a persistent critic. 'We can no longer base growth and employment on government stimulation of demand,' he said in a speech early this year. 'Other countries have previously had to embark on the far more difficult path of adopting structural policy measures to improve the functioning of the economy.' What critics like Mr Skanland are worried about is a long-term weakening of the non-oil economy at a time when the benefits of oil revenues should be being used to reform and strengthen what is usually known in Norway as the mainland economy. They want to see, among other changes, government deficits curbed to allow for an easing of Norway's high taxes and measures, such as changes in labour market practices, to improve competitiveness and expand Norway's narrow non-oil manufacturing base. As the Conservatives are finding, however, it is a call that has received little echo in the election campaign among voters whose belief seems to be that the hard times are behind them.</p>

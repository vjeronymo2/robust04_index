			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KID STUFF: A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE WITH YOUNG NATURE LOVERS  </P> <P> Forget the videos and pricey toys. To most kids, heaven on earth is a double  handful of dirt, room to roam and plenty of time to explore every bug and  butterfly that crosses their path. Add to this a knowledgeable (and patient)  grown-up to guide them, and you've got an unbeatable recipe for learning.  </P> <P> Fortunately, there are several competent groups ready to expose your junior  naturalist to the wild side of Orange County. Guided tours, geared for young  people from infancy through college-age, are available at little or no charge  from the following organizations:  </P> <P> Nursery Nature Walks, led by four Orange County mothers under the auspices of  the South Coast YMCA, offers babies, toddlers and preschoolers a chance to get  down and dirty in Upper Newport Bay, Orange's Irvine Regional Park and Santiago  Oaks Park, and Mission Viejo's Wilderness Glen.  </P> <P> "It's a very touchy-feely kind of experience," explained Dana Barney, who  established the program in 1987. "We don't cover a lot of ground (most walks  are about one-quarter to one-half mile) because we let the children set the  pace. If they find a new bug, we talk about bugs; if they want to play in the  dirt, we talk about dirt.  </P> <P> "They're generally pretty grubby by the time we're done, but that's all part of  nature, right?"  </P> <P> Orange County's Nursery Nature Walks were inspired by a larger program serving  L.A. and Ventura counties, which has involved more than 13,000 children and  adults since it began in 1985. Local YMCAs assist both groups with insurance  and publicity. Before leading a hike, volunteer docents must undergo an  eight-part training course covering topics such as geology, botany and American  history, as well as a variety of nature-themed games, songs and sensory  exercises.  </P> <P> Nursery Nature Walks are held several times each month. Times and dates vary.  Most walks last about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. A $3 donation is asked from each  family.  </P> <P> The Friends of Newport Bay, a nonprofit volunteer group dedicated to preserving  the 752-acre Upper Newport Bay State Ecological Reserve, offers monthly public  tours of this natural estuary to families, students and youth groups. (An  estuary, by the way, is "a very productive area where salt and fresh water meet  and mix," says park ranger Nancy Bruland.) The tours run from October through  March, during the migration period for birds, but the best viewing is often in  late November. During the three-quarter-mile hike, visitors meet with experts  on the area's natural history and native birds and plants. Afterward, guests  can explore the bay on their own.  </P> <P> Tours depart every second Saturday of the month beginning at 9 a.m. from the  corner of Back Bay and Eastbluff drives in Newport Beach. The walks are open to  everyone but are mostly accessible to children age 8 and up. There is no fee;  reservations suggested.  </P> <P> The fish and game folks and the county's Department of Harbors, Beaches and  Parks have teamed up to offer two nature programs for families. Beginning next  month and continuing through April, they'll gather 'round the campfire at  Newport Dunes for an evening of nature-themed songs, skits and stories. The  free programs begin at sunset; reservations recommended.  </P> <P> In addition, on the first and third Saturday of each month, park rangers and  local naturalists lead 1 1/2-hour walks through various sites on the reserve.  The walk is open to all ages; there's a fee of $2.25 per person.  </P> <P> What: Nature walks for children and families.  </P> <P> When: Year round.  </P> <P> Where: Upper Newport Bay State Ecological Reserve; Irvine Regional Park and  Santiago Oaks Park in Orange, Wilderness Glen Park in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Whereabouts: Take Harbor Boulevard south from Riverside Freeway or north from  Interstate 5 and head east on Broadway.

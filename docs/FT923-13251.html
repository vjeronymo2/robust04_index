			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Survey of Credit and Charge Cards (7): Competitive pressure rises - Users in the US have become more sophisticated about choosing cards THE growing presence of non-banks in the US credit card market has loosened the banks' stranglehold on issues of credit cards and created a new class of credit cards. Partly as a result of the increased competition, plastic card users have become more sophisticated about which cards they choose and how they use them, increasing the competitive pressure among issuers. The pressure started in earnest in 1990 when telecommunications group A T &amp; T entered the credit card arena, traditionally the domain of the banks, with its Universal card. Within 10 months the Universal card had developed a portfolio of nearly Dollars 2bn and ranked among the 16 biggest credit card companies, essentially carving out a large niche in the market for non-bank cards. A T &amp; T is now the third biggest issuer of cards in terms of volume, and the Universal card controls close to 13 per cent of the total US market. And Sears is becoming an important player in the credit card business. To make matters worse for the bank issuers, the rate of growth in the US credit card market as a whole started to slow shortly after the Universal card was launched. According to The Nilson Report, a California-based newsletter for the card industry, the amount charged to general purpose credit cards rose only 5.9 per cent last year to Dollars 374.4bn, compared with an increase of 15.3 per cent between 1989 and 1990. Perhaps even more damaging, as far as the banks are concerned, has been the surge in consumer demand for lower fees and interest rates triggered in part by A T &amp; T's method of entry into the field. A T &amp; T initially wooed consumers by offering extremely favourable terms including waiving annual fees entirely for customers who signed up in the first year. The banks responded by offering so-called 'enhancements' to their cards, such as free travel insurance and frequent flier miles. Banks were less willing at first to tamper with interest rates, which have made the credit card business extremely profitable. Credit card interest rates, which range from 8.5 per cent to 21 per cent with a median rate of about 18 per cent, have remained essentially static at a time when other forms of consumer lending such as car loans and mortgages have dropped to their lowest levels in more than 10 years. The banks claim that the costs of processing credit cards and the high cost of defaults justify the high interest rate charges. More militant card holders, however, became increasingly vociferous about interest rates late last year and their cause was taken up by Congress, which considered legislation that would put a ceiling on credit card interest rates. The US law makers highlighted the discrepancy between the high rates levied on credit cards compared with other forms of consumer lending at a time when recession had brought down most lending rates. Although the proposed credit card interest rate cap failed to become a law, the adverse publicity, coupled with increasing competition and consumer pressure, prompted many of the big bank issuers to start cutting their rates, at least for preferred customers. Citibank, the largest US issuer with about 30m accounts or about Dollars 47bn in annual charges, recently started offering lower rates to better customers, charging them about 13.8 per cent compared with the 19.8 per cent Citibank charges its standard card holders. About 9m customers are expected to be eligible for the lower Citibank rates. In addition, the new Citibank rates will be variable. Citibank now looks at payment history and usage to determine interest rates. Card holders who charge at least Dollars 1,000 a year, make timely payments and remain within credit limits will get the lower rates, although they will be subject to increased rates if they show a chronic pattern of transgression. Similarly, American Express is offering its Optima revolving credit card holders three types of rates, ranging from 12.5 per cent to 18.75 per cent depending on creditworthiness. Fleet Bank has started letting customers roll existing debt on to its credit card with a 12.5 per cent interest rate, although new purchases on Fleet's cards will be subjected to 17.9 per cent interest charges. Annual fees may be the next area to come under attack. Although A T &amp; T has officially announced a Dollars 20 annual fee for its card, it is still offering to waive first-year fees for some 'selective' new customers and bank issuers may be forced to follow suit. Card issuers generally get about 10 to 15 per cent of their profits from annual fees. Lower interest rates and selectively waived fees will almost certainly cut into revenues, but issuers hope the impact will be offset by a rise in card-holder spending and lower attrition of existing card holders. Other new trends include the advent of the secured card, where banks get collateral in the form of a security deposit at the bank for higher risk consumers who have had trouble getting approval for a standard credit card. In June last year, Citibank launched a secured card pilot programme and it is now expanding the test. Citibank's secured card carries a 19.8 per cent annual rate. Customers deposit amounts equal to the credit limit, between Dollars 300 to Dollars 5,000, in the bank in an 18-month certificate of deposit paying 5 per cent interest to secure the credit card. Fraud is also a growing concern. According to Citibank, credit card fraud cost issuers about Dollars 1bn in 1991. In an attempt to combat fraud, Citibank this year introduced a photocard with a colour photo of the card holder bonded into the plastic on the back of the card. In spite of the growing number of concessions credit card issuers are making to consumer demand, it is unlikely that these will have a significantly detrimental impact on earnings from this lucrative business. Consumers, however, are likely to continue to benefit in the months to come from the ongoing competition.</p>

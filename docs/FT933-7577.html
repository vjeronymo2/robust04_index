			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Sotheby's optimistic despite cut in dividend SOTHEBY'S Holdings, the auction house, has cut its quarterly dividend from 15 cents to 6 cents per share, but remains optimistic about future earnings. The company, which recently reported a 48 per cent expansion in second quarter net income, had indicated at its annual meeting in June that it might cut its dividend. Mr Michael Ainslie, president and chief executive, said the reduction 'reflects the implementation by the board of the previously articulated position that the company would not maintain a dividend payout in excess of earnings.' Last year Sotheby's earnings dropped 69 per cent to 7 cents per share, but it paid a dividend of 60 cents which was covered by profits from the sale of inventory and the reduction of its loan portfolio.</p>

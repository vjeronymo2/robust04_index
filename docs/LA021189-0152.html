			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EVEN WITHOUT BILL HALEY, THE COMETS STILL ATTRACT '50S ROCK 'N' ROLL FANS  </P> <P> John (Bam Bam) Lane had just been graduated from high school in Cumberland,  Pa., when he answered a wantad for a drummer in a band in nearby Chester.  </P> <P> He had to lie about his age -- the ad said applicants needed to be at least 21  -- but he beat out 18 other drummers for the gig. "It wasn't until after I got  the job," Lane said in a telephone interview this week, "that I found out it  was with the Comets."  </P> <P> As in Bill Haley and the Comets, backup band to a man who was among the first  to combine R&amp;B, country and pop in such early '50s rock 'n' roll hits as  "Rock Around the Clock" and "Shake, Rattle and Roll."  </P> <P> Lane joined the group in 1967 and toured with Haley until the rock pioneer's  death in 1981. The last of the original Comets left the group then, but Lane  has been on the road with a new set of Comets ever since. The group will play  Saturday at a benefit for the International Surf Museum of Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> In his early days with Haley, Lane toured about 10 months each year, including  4 to 5 months overseas. "In Europe, we worked about every country there is,"  Lane said. Although Haley was rarely recognized on the streets of the United  States, he was regularly mobbed in England and Europe.  </P> <P> In 1967, in the midst of a rock 'n' roll revival, Bill Haley and the Comets  broke attendance records set by the Beatles and Rolling Stones at London's  Royal Albert Hall, and through the late '60s Haley regularly was the headliner  on European tours over bands such as the Spencer Davis Group. "That was one  thing in Europe -- Bill was always the headliner," Lane said. "Even to this  day, he is still No. 1 over there."  </P> <P> Those early years were heady ones for the young drummer from Cumberland, who  celebrated his 19th birthday in London, his 20th in Dublin and his 21st in  Paris. Haley, he said, was friendly and mild-mannered, but always expected a  professional attitude from his band.  </P> <P> Haley scaled back his touring in 1977 and hit the road about twice a year until  his death. The Comets keep touring, Lane said, to keep Haley's name alive and  to satisfy his fans. They tour solo and also take part in '50s-revival package  tours.  </P> <P> Two Comets from the '60s -- Dave Linkous and Spider Webb -- recently rejoined  the band, and three other members joined after Haley's death. The group  performs songs from Haley's repertoire, along with other hits from the '50s.  </P> <P> "After Bill passed away, we didn't know how it was going to go," Lane said. But  the public has responded: "We've had three and four generations of a family  come to see the band. . . . It was really something that I didn't expect."  </P> <P>  Bill Haley's Comets will perform Saturday at 8 p.m. at Huntington Center, at  Edinger Avenue and the San Diego Freeway. General admission tickets are $6 in  advance, $7.50 at the door. There will be dancing, and '50s attire is  encouraged. Information: (714) 897-2533.  </P> <P> </P></p>

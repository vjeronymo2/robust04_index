Our colleague reports from  Kabul:    [Unidentified reporter] Simultaneous with the arrival in  Kabul of large groups of the neutral jihad commanders and  mediators, the head of Jalalabad Jihad Council announced that a  nationwide peace session will be held in this city soon. He  said: In order to convene such a session, coordination has taken  place among all the jihad factions and commanders and the  neutral political forces, including Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami  [Islamic Unity Party]. They have agreed that a prompt and  nationwide measure should be undertaken to resolve the current  crisis in Afghanistan.    Head of another peace group, named the Reform Council  [Shura-ye Eslahi], announced in Kabul that President Borhanoddin  Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar have agreed with  his mediation to end the current conflict.    A source affiliated to Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami reiterated his  party's neutral stance in the current conflict today, and  stressed the need for the intensification of peace efforts to  end the war. He described the current war as a conflict which  will achieve nothing but the further weakening and reduced  credibility of Afghanistan's revolutionary and jihad groups.    These peace efforts are being undertaken at a time when the  two main warring sides have reported fresh fighting in the  northern region of Afghanistan. Opponents of the government say  that thousands of troops loyal to the president have been  surrounded in the Nahrain region, northeast of Baghlan Province.  On the other hand a source close to the government has said  that president's forces have achieved remarkable victory in the  ongoing battles of Baghlan, Jowzjan, and Fariab Provinces.    On the military status of the warring factions, an Afghan  mojahedin commander said: In recent days the Hezb-e Eslami  [Islamic Party] and General Dostam's forces have concentrated  their efforts on inflicting blows on the government's vulnerable  military centers in the northern region of Afghanistan.</p>

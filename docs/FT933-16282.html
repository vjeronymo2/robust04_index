			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Lecturers to strike in row on contracts FURTHER education lecturers yesterday decided to strike in September over new contracts introduced by employers, John Authers writes. The contracts sent to colleges on Thursday are initially only for new appointments and lecturers gaining promotion. They would cut annual holiday leave by half - from 14 weeks to seven - and add an hour to the working day. Yesterday the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education, meeting at its annual conference in Bristol, condemned the contracts. It also refused to negotiate formally with the College Employers' Forum, which represents most college principals, while the new contracts remained on the agenda. It said that it would negotiate only 'without preconditions'. Mr Roger Ward, chief executive of the forum, has rejected this demand.</p>

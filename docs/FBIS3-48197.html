During the meeting, President Kim conferred the Order of  Diplomatic Service Merit, Kwanghwa Medal, on the Spanish  minister before exchanging opinions on ways to further promote  bilateral cooperation.    The president especially thanked Minister Solana for the  support his country, as a non-permanent member country of the  U.N. Security Council, extended to South Korea over the North  Korean nuclear issues.    Meanwhile, at a press conference Minister Solana said the  North Korean nuclear issues should be resolved in a rightful  direction in the interests of world security.    Solana said it is desirable that the nuclear question will  be  settled before the need arises for the U.N. Security Council to  take a sanction.    Also saying that there is a growing need of cooperation  between Korea and Spain in the areas of international politics  and economy, Minister Solana expressed the hope that his visit  would contribute much to expanding friendly cooperative ties  between the two countries.    The Spanish minister flew into Seoul on Sunday [16 January]  for a three-day official visit. He was the first Spanish  foreign minister ever to visit Seoul since the two countries  entered ambassadorial relations in 1950.</p>

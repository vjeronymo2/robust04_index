			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Dark descent to a political minefield: As the UK government finalises its plan for coal, Michael Cassell examines the explosive events of the past six months John Major must have been grateful for the brief respite offered by the journey home from Birmingham to Great Stukeley. Behind him was a difficult, one-day European summit and the toughest week of his premiership; worse was to come. Four days after last October's EC gathering, called in the wake of Britain's forced exit from the European exchange rate mechanism, British Coal had sent shock waves through the coalfields. Out of 50 pits, 31 had to be shut, some in days and all in six months. More than 30,000 miners faced compulsory redundancy; another 120,000 jobs in supplier industries could go. Neil Clarke, recruited as chairman of British Coal to mastermind the 'ultimate privatisation', expressed regret. Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, tried to soothe the pain with a Pounds 1bn aid package extracted from the an unwilling Treasury. Major was sorry for the miner's 'anguish', but the commercial argument was compelling and irrevocable. Within 48 hours, ministers would be facing defeat at the hands of their backbenchers. Two years earlier, the government's privatisation of an electricity supply industry, which takes 80 per cent of British Coal's output, had sown the seeds of the dilemma. March 1993 was supposed to see an end to subsidised coal contracts and the demise of a rigged market, as the generators, PowerGen and National Power, would then be free to buy where they wished and to strike new British Coal contracts. Last autumn, complex legislation to privatise British Coal was already being prepared, with a sale due this summer. It was widely accepted that the 65m tonnes of coal bought by the generators in the year ending next week would fall to about 40m tonnes in 1994, and later to 30m. Prices and contract periods, however, remained unresolved. A jobs shake-out was inevitable. Heseltine wanted to lock all the parties in a room and 'bang heads' until agreement was reached. But in the words of one DTI minister: 'We couldn't do an old-style, ministerial fix. We explored all the avenues. But it was like going down a one-way street and continually turning off into blind alleyways.' As contract negotiations stretched into late summer, the DTI and Treasury stepped up equally slow-moving talks with British Coal aimed at replacing miners' redundancy terms. The company convinced Heseltine a fair package would limit the damage. It told ministers: 'If you sugar the pill, we will deliver the goods.' But the pill remained unpalatable. In mid-September, Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, leaked a ministerial letter listing 30 doomed pits. Heseltine admitted further closures were coming but battled for pay-offs matching the old terms. A Coal Board insider recalls: 'The Treasury was utterly predictable. It was reluctant to match the old redundancy terms. We became embroiled in an intellectual argument over why miners should get preferential redundancy terms to any private-sector employees.' A colleague of Heseltine adds: 'If the Treasury had not been so bloody-minded, we could have bitten the bullet earlier and 10 pits could have gone in the summer.' The prime minister intervened. Heseltine got an average Pounds 28,000 a man, less than British Coal wanted. On October 2, he and Tim Eggar, his energy minister, reported to a prime minister preoccupied with preparations for the following week's party conference. A closure announcement had to go ahead. 'A' day, as it was entered in the diaries of British Coal executives, was Tuesday October 13. Until the day before, the company would not tell Heseltine which pits were to close. 'We refused to tell him. We knew from bitter experience that the government machine leaked like a sieve and we did not want to pile on the agony at the collieries,' a British Coal manager recalls. On October 12, Heseltine and Clarke met to make final preparations for the announcement. The next day, Clarke called in the press while Heseltine made his own announcement: 'It was a stupid mistake,' says a close friend. 'It took the heat off Clarke and left Michael looking like the bad guy, instead of the white knight riding to the rescue with Pounds 1bn. But he wanted to face it head on.' The details provoked an immediate storm. According to a British Coal executive: 'People in the industry were prepared for the worst. It was the wider backlash which caught everyone out.' Backbench Tory MPs were as angry as the general public at the scale and immediacy of the plan. MPs were hit by an avalanche of protest letters. 'They were proper letters, type-written, correctly spelt and predominantly from natural Tories,' says one MP. For a day or two, ministers thought they could ride it out. At a party in 12 Downing Street to celebrate the 40th birthday of Gus O'Donnell, the prime minister's press secretary, one minister said the storm would quickly abate. A minister involved in seeking a solution to British Coal's dilemma recalls: 'We were already in a sea of troubles and failed to foresee the chemical reaction which the closures would set off.' Any hope the row would be short-lived was quickly dispelled by Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the influential 1922 backbench committee of Tory MPs. Sir Marcus pronounced the terms 'unacceptable' and his colleagues 'incensed'. Scargill suddenly found Mr Winston Churchill, the Tory MP for Davyhulme and Sir Winston's grandson, among his champions. Downing Street was forced repeatedly to amend its version of events. Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, though informed of the plans, was not told about the Heseltine press conference. She was furious. An employment department insider reflects: 'There was little love lost between them before. There is even less now.' On October 18, the eve of parliament's return, the nation turned off 2m lightbulbs in protest and men from Frickley colliery dumped coal outside Heseltine's Oxfordshire home. After a weekend ring-round of Tory MPs by the party whips, Richard Ryder, chief whip, warned that the government faced defeat at the hands of its own party. Major summoned six ministers to a meeting. Heseltine spelled out the 'unanswerable case' for closures. Two and a half hours later, he had reluctantly accepted the need for a change in tactics. The blow had to be softened. He went straight into session with officials. The next morning, Monday October 19, Downing Street admitted ministers had been 'so close to the detail' of the closure decision they had failed to assess its impact. Major summoned an emergency cabinet meeting to hint at a change in tactics. A cabinet colleague remarked: 'We had all taken our eye off the ball. It was a cock-up.' Afterwards, at a Carlton Club lunch with the executive of the 1922 committee, the prime minister indicated that although 10 pits would have to go, the remaining 21 would be looked at again. The peace offering was not sufficient. One committee member said afterwards: 'I am still loyal to John Major. I hope he survives, but he won't if he continues in this way.' An hour later in the Commons, Heseltine said there would be a temporary reprieve for some pits but no further, detailed review. Any changes would be 'at the margin'. Next morning, he faced his own, angry backbenchers in committee room 14 of the Commons. A show of hands went against him, forcing from him assurances that he would take a broader look at the fuel market for generating electricity. An MP present reflected: 'We put him through the mangle.' Hours later, Lord Wakeham, former energy secretary and chairman of the ad hoc cabinet committee on coal, told the Lords there would be a wide-ranging review to ensure the coal market had been correctly assessed. Major confirmed the new approach in the Commons and welcomed a trade and industry committee decision to hold its own inquiry into energy strategy. On October 21, Trafalgar Day, as 40,000 miners marched through London, Heseltine paced the Commons, homing in on waverers who could help defeat the government in that day's Labour-organised debate. Nobody was spared. One sceptic remarked: 'What can you say when you have a shopping list of 12 items and you're offered 14?' A bravura Commons performance from Heseltine won the day and a majority of 15. A few days later, he announced there would be a white paper on UK energy policy, a tactic which provided a vital breathing space. But as advice and opinions poured in, another blow landed. Four days before Christmas, Lord Justice Glidewell declared the closure decision unlawful and demanded a review procedure involving an element of independent scrutiny. A humiliated Heseltine admitted the government had 'got it wrong'. By January 19, he was running into fierce, internal opposition to his compromise proposals, entailing a subsidy of about Pounds 10 a tonne, clearly identified to consumers as the cost to be paid for public concern. A supporter summed up the plan: 'It was about paying for your conscience.' At a cabinet committee meeting, Heseltine found himself confronting an alliance of ministers - including Michael Howard, the environment secretary, Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Gillian Shephard - threatening to block the plan unless subsidies were short-term and rapidly reduced. Howard, with the support of Clarke, had tabled an alternative strategy. He argued that, if some pits were to be kept open, the decision should be openly based on social, rather than economic, reasons. The government would tell the Commons that, on social grounds, it would pay time-limited subsidies to individual pits. But the idea soon hit trouble, with ministers unable to devise criteria under which individual collieries could be kept open. The plan was rejected. Friends of Shephard and Howard continued to brief the press against Heseltine for his handling of the affair. As the prime minister left for India on a trade mission, irritated Downing Street sources complained: 'It doesn't do anyone any good to brief against their colleagues.' By the end of January, Heseltine won further support in reports from independent consultants which backed the government's grim prognosis for coal. Wakeham's cabinet committee was by now concluding that additional coal purchases by the generators would have to be subsidised. The Commons trade and industry select committee, however, contrived a classic political compromise, suggesting more than half the threatened pits could be saved if the market for coal was increased over five years at a cost of about Pounds 500m. Its report left Heseltine and his colleagues to calculate how far they had to go to stave off the threat of defeat. One minister claims: 'Sensible analysis immediately became a pathetic, political numbers game.' As Heseltine struggled to find a formula, he became embroiled in a row over the generators over how much coal they would take. John Baker, National Power chief executive, told him they were being invited to 'dig our own grave . . . to solve your coal problem'. Some ministers revelled in the discomfort of a man toppled from his party pedestal: 'Junior Thatcherite ministers think it has all been wonderful,' says a Heseltine ally. Stories suggesting he is fed up, disenchanted and even seriously ill have flowered in Westminster. 'All rubbish,' says a friend. 'Michael admits the coal business has been the most frustrating and intractable problem he has ever faced. He is frustrated that the affair has swallowed so much of his time. But that is it.' With his 'final offer' now about to be disclosed, Heseltine may look back for a moment or two on the affair. He does not seek to lay most of the blame on British Coal and Neil Clarke, though he is not overly impressed with the company's behaviour. In any case, the fate of the industry and those who serve it should soon be a matter for new owners. He may be forgiven for praying 'not a moment too soon'.</p>

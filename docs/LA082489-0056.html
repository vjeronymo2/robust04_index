			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: LET THE COMPUTER DO YOUR DIALING  </P> <P> The recent strike at Pacific Bell and other regional phone companies made it  very difficult to reach directory assistance in many areas of the country. In  my case, it wasn't a major problem because I have my own "directory assistance"  on both my IBM compatible computer and my Apple Macintosh.  </P> <P> A number of programs allow you to look up telephone numbers, addresses and, in  some cases, fax numbers of businesses and government institutions throughout  the country. Hot Line Two, PC Yellow Pages and the Fortune 500 Prospector can  be used on IBM and compatible machines. Macintosh users, whose units can be  equipped with a compact disc drive, have access to information from more than  110,000 companies via the National Directory of Addresses and Telephone  Numbers.  </P> <P> A compact disc drive is an optional add-on device using discs similar to those  in audio systems that, unlike regular disk drives, can only be used to retrieve  information.  </P> <P> Hot Line Two, published by General Information Inc., is a telephone dialing  program that comes on disks with a directory of phone numbers and addresses for  more than 10,000 companies, government agencies, universities and other medium  to large organizations. Hot Line Two can also be used for your personal  directory; it stores up to 64,000 listings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> InfoPacks Focus on Specific Industries  </P> <P> The program can be used even while your computer is running other programs.  Locating a company through a search takes a couple of seconds at most. Once the  program finds the number, the user presses a key to have the program dial the  phone, if your computer is equipped with a modem.  </P> <P> Regardless of whether you use the national listings, Hot Line is a handy phone  management program. It allows you to automatically dial the lengthy access  codes that some long-distance companies require and is able to dial numbers  directly off the PC screen, even if they are stored elsewhere such as in a word  processing or database management program. It can also keep a record of  outgoing calls.  </P> <P> In addition to the basic directory, General Information sells special sets of  disks, called InfoPacks, that focus on particular industries. InfoPacks are  available for advertising/public relations/media, colleges and universities,  computer/high tech, finance, travel and the Department of Defense. The company  also publishes a disk with 14,000 toll-free numbers.  </P> <P> Hot Line Two stores its data in the same format as Ashton-Tate's best-selling  database program, dBase III. In addition to using Hot Line Two to dial the  phone, you can use its data files with dBase or any of the many programs that  read dBase files. That would be handy for those who want to use the data for  mass mailings.  </P> <P> The data from Hot Line Two and the various InfoPacks is excerpted from General  Information's National Directory, a printed book that contains information on  more than 110,000 businesses and organizations. The printed version is  available for $54, which includes shipping.  </P> <P> Hot Line Two sells for $99.95 from General Information Inc., 401 Park Place,  Suite 305, Kirkland, Wash. 98033. Phone (800) 722-3244.  </P> <P> Hot Line Two runs only on IBM compatibles, but Mac users with a compact disc  drive can get the National Directory of Addresses and Telephone Numbers. The  data comes from General Information, but the compact disc and Macintosh  software is a product of Xiphias, a Marina del Rey company that specializes in  entertainment and business software for the compact disc market. Like Hot Line  Two, the software that comes with Xiphias' version of the National Directory  can be used to dial the phone once it has located a number.  </P> <P> Because the directory is stored on compact disc, there isn't the same space  limitation as on a floppy disk-based product. In addition to more than 110,000  phone numbers and addresses, it includes fax numbers from about 80,000  companies, according to Xiphias President Peter Black. The fax numbers,  according to Black, can be accessed by the software that controls a Macintosh's  fax modem, making it possible to generate and send your own mass fax mailings.  </P> <P> Listings can be selected by name, location or type of organization. That makes  it possible to use the data to create customized phone or mailing lists. The  program can print mailing labels or save data in a format that can be moved to  virtually any database management, spreadsheet program or some word processing  systems on the Mac, IBM PC or any other computer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Select by Type, Address  </P> <P> The compact disc has a suggested retail price of $195, but some dealers will  sell it as part of a $245 three-disc package that also includes two discs from  other companies. Xiphias can be reached at 13464 Washington Blvd., Marina del  Rey, Calif. 90292. Phone (213) 821-0074.  </P> <P> Digital Publications of Norcross, Ga., sells several disc-based databases for  personal computers. One of its products, PC Yellow Pages, features a database  of toll-free phone numbers from 10,000 U.S. businesses as well as an additional  customized list of 5,000 companies from your area with address and phone  numbers.  </P> <P> Firms can be selected by name or type of business. The program, which sells for  $129.99, also offers a database of Fortune 1,000 companies with addresses and  names of chief executives. Like Hot Line Two, the program is able to dial the  phone and accept additional listings.  </P> <P> The company also sells specialized directories designed for people who want to  send advertisements or press releases via direct mail. The PC Press Assistant  ($695) includes addresses for 5,000 trade magazines, newspapers, television and  radio stations. Magazine listings include the type and size of the publication  along with the name of the news editor. In many cases, it also includes fax  numbers. It is compatible with Quadram's JT Fax board, making it possible to  automatically fax press releases to editors.  </P> <P> The company also sells listings of wholesalers and manufacturers as well as  customized mailing lists for particular regions of the country. Digital  Publications can be reached at 5390 Peachtree Industrial Blvd., Norcross, GA  30071. Phone (404) 448-6881 or (800) 777-1470.  </P> <P> MZ Group, in cooperation with Fortune magazine, has published the Fortune 500  Prospector. Far more than a directory, the program and accompanying database  allow you to identify key executives, sales information, profitability, assets,  earnings and other information from both the Fortune 500 and the Service 500.  Also included for each company are name, address, phone number, stock symbol,  exchange, fiscal year end, industry classification and a brief description.  </P> <P> The program allows you to enter personal information on companies, including  the names of contacts and company-specific tracking information such as  follow-up dates or other notes. There are also three custom fields and a field  for free-form notes. You can also add new companies to the database.  </P> <P> The program, which sells for $299, is available from MZ Group, 1388 Sutter St.,  Suite 612, San Francisco, Calif. 94109. Phone (800) 345-9111.  </P> <P> Computer File welcomes readers' comments but regrets that the authors cannot  respond individually to letters. Write to Lawrence J. Magid, P.O.

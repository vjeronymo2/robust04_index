			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Defence giants go to battle stations for the Great Game: The desire of BAe and GEC to win VSEL reflects a wider conflict With British Aerospace and GEC mobilising for a tug of love over VSEL, the submarine maker, the real battle has begun for the future of the UK defence industry. The number of defence contractors is shrinking rapidly, and the choices left to companies wishing to merge and cut their costs are narrowing fast. Competition over any defence company up for grabs is likely to be fierce. BAe would apparently have liked to buy helicopter-maker Westland when GKN bid earlier this year, had GKN not started with an almost unstoppable shareholding. Now the attention has switched from air to sea systems. BAe wants to be the project manager which controls the key contracts in ships as well as aircraft. GEC, tired of its role as a supplier to BAe, is keen to expand its naval presence and become a larger full-scale project manager in its own right. VSEL will go to one or the other. GEC has the advantage of being able to bid in cash, while BAe does not face the competition difficulty of owning two shipyards. The proximity of two large naval contracts - a Pounds 2.5bn order for Trafalgar hunter-killer submarines and a Pounds 500m order for landing ships - could make VSEL an attractive proposition. But Britain's other small defence contractors are on their guard. There is a great deal of common ground between the mid-life refitting of nuclear submarines, which will soon be done exclusively at Devonport in Plymouth, and their construction. It would make sense for whoever owns VSEL to own Devonport, which is due to be privatised over the next 18 months, the same timescale on which the Trafalgar order will be placed. Land systems - tanks and armoured personnel carriers - are also spread among a wide range of companies and could be rationalised, too. Some deals may seem to create strange bedfellows. Yet in the absence of pan-European mergers, companies are having to find their savings where they can. Several of the large US deals, most notably Lockheed's merger with Martin Marietta, have also brought together companies with little in common but their defence interests. Savings on central overheads and the ability to manage defence contracts and ministries skilfully are the strongest arguments in favour of the deals. Savings will be generated whichever company wins VSEL. Central overheads will be reduced and design and marketing teams consolidated. There are also management gains to be made. Project management in defence is a particularly black art and one which BAe in particular has practised well. If either BAe or GEC can teach VSEL how to become a risk-taking prime contractor managing a Pounds 2.5bn fixed-price order for Trafalgar submarines, then the merged companies, and the ministry of defence, should benefit. The endgame, however, leaves BAe and GEC staring awkwardly at each other over the chessboard. Resolving the BAe-GEC issue is going to be the Great Game of the next decade.

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COST PANEL TO REVIEW 'RED LINE' SUBWAY  </P> <P> Mindful that government officials are in a frugal mood, the county  Transportation Commission has set up a cost-reduction panel to review the  second stage of the Metro Rail's "red line" subway project.  </P> <P> The 17.3-mile "red line" segment is a linchpin of the projected 150-mile  countywide system, and will cost about $2.8 billion. Transportation  Commission's executive director, Neil Peterson, said that with the recent news  that the estimated cost of the second phase is $338 million higher than earlier  projected, "it is absolutely necessary to convene this panel" with an eye to  "controlling costs." About 15% of the engineering work is completed, and the  initial 4.4-mile segment of the "red line," running from Los Angeles' Union  Station to Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street, is about one-third complete.  </P> <P> The total $2.8-billion cost is being paid for by federal gas tax revenues,  local Proposition A funds, state gas-tax funds and city and special business  tax revenues. By 1995, all 46 miles and 39 stations of the Los Angeles portion  of the system is expected to be operating. The entire line, out to North  Hollywood, is expected to be open in 2001.  </P></p>

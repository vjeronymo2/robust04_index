			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (17): The banks face tough demands - Trade finance services / Efficient financing is vital for effective export promotion. Alan Mackie looks at the way two banks, the UK's Barclays and Germany's Commerzhank, organise and manage export financing services Barclays Bank is still the biggest of the 'big four' UK banks, despite a bruising shake-out over the past two years. Its strength in export finance is built on a network of over 1,000 overseas branches in more than 70 countries, which provide market intelligence on local conditions and credit risk. It has developed a range of trade finance products tailored to the most complex demands of buyers - be it an ECGD based package, a deal involving forfaiting, credit insurance, factoring or a combination of different products. Factoring is a popular payment mechanism because it generates immediate cash. Barclays also does a fair amount of invoice discounting in addition to conventional confirmation of letters of credit (l/cs). Barclays has two special schemes, Tradeline and Tradeflow. Tradeline is a short term financing facility for exporters that already have insurance. This enables an exporter to offer credit to foreign buyers with whom it has never traded before. Tradeflow is a short-term revolving loan facility backed by Barclays own credit insurance policy that provides credit for businesses with an export turnover of less than Pounds 2m a year. Unlike conventional cover, which is taken out on total turnover, this scheme offers the small exporter insurance on individual export orders, as long as finance is taken. Conventional ECGD backed buyer and supplier credits can be extended up to 10 years - or more, depending on country and product - and deals can be negotiated in a broad range of foreign currencies. Barclays also specialises in combining ECA cover with other products and services. General lines of credit are put in place with overseas banks to facilitate this kind of trade. A forfait can be popular because of its user friendliness and great flexibility. It provides up to 100 per cent finance on a non-recourse basis, meaning that, unless exporters are in some way in default, they will not have to return funding if, for example, the buyer subsequently does not make payment. Barclays also arranges leasing finance and syndicated structured loans for bigger export orders. Services are organised by customer need: the provision of finance; payment protection; and assistance with payment collection. The starting point is the local branch manager. Branches are equipped to deal with all short term finance (up to one year), as well as the Tradeline and Tradef low schemes. Where more specialised or medium term assistance is required, customers are channelled to more specialised departments. Enquiries, for example, for longer term credit or for more specialised services are referred either to the regional international manager or the director of the trade finance unit who, having established the specific service needed, will direct the business to the requisite department. An invoice presented for factoring is referred through the regional international manager to Barclays Commercial Service which acts as the exporter's factor and makes a service charge. A leasing enquiry is referred to Barclays Leasing and a request for a buyer credit or project finance structure is directed to Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The export financing efforts of the 'big four' banks draw faint praise from the Institute of Export whose recent survey of exporters' experience of banking services found small to medium-sized exporters, who account for 56 per cent of UK exports, unhappy with the general lack of understanding of their problems by local bank managers and the trend towards greater centralisation. Barclays has, to some extent, met this charge with its Tradeflow scheme for small exports. One practical complaint, meanwhile, is the way that foreign receivables  - even from blue chip European companies - are shrugged away as collateral by British banks. The Institute would like the banking industry to start thinking European. Top management is aware of the need to change these hidebound insular ways, but some old habits can die hard. Commerzbank is an old established medium-sized German bank. Its 12 per cent share of total German foreign trade is only eclipsed by Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. What it lacks in muscle, it has to make up with reliability, a fast response time to executing orders and being flexible to customers' requirements. It offers a wide range of payment services for German exporters to receive export proceeds and is in a position to provide various kinds of short-term financing including: overdraft facilities, short-term loans up to 360 days at fixed interest, discounting of Bills of Exchange with recourse to exporters, discounting of receivables resulting from deferred payment and l/cs confirmed by Commerzbank without recourse to the exporter. Subject to the bank's readiness to assume country risk, the bank is prepared either to confirm l/cs if so instructed by the opening bank and, in the absence of such an instruction, to accommodate the exporter with silent confirmation. The bank also offers a range of guarantees/bonds including bid bonds, performance bonds and payment/downpayment guarantees. Medium-term export financing in Germany is highly competitive. Around 50 per cent is spoken for by Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), the government-owned finance provider. Unlike the commercial banks, KfW is not required to make a profit and recently had its charter changed to enable it to bid for OECD business - although its roots are still firmly in emerging markets and the developing world. Much competition focuses on the 15 per cent of commercial risk (down and interim payment) not covered by Hermes, the official German export credit insurer. The main medium-term export business is in buyer credits. Commerzbank evaluates the rating of the borrower's country, the rating of the borrower (and what collateral it has outside the country), as well as the status of the German exporter, before determining what part of the commercial risk it is prepared to take on. Supplier credits are less popular because there is still some recourse to the German exporter in the event of default. Hermes does not insure general credit lines, but Commerzbank arranges credit lines with foreign banks which are a way for foreign importers, approved by Commerzbank, to purchase German goods and services. Once a German supplier has been found and approved, the deal can be covered by Hermes. Commerzbank offers a variety of ways for the exporter to cover its exposure. A common one is a forfait financing. Commerzbank runs a four-person unit providing this service. The bank also arranges Euroloans mainly through its affiliates and branches in Singapore, Luxembourg and London to cover the commercial financing of big export orders. Exporters have become far more street-wise in approaching banks for finance and are more prepared to shop around. The big exporters are hiring foreign exchange dealers and other specialists to better define their export finance needs. Nevertheless, there is still a demand from small to medium sized exporters for advice on how to package their needs. The first point of contact is the local branch which usually deals with all credit requests under one year. The general rule is that any business that falls within a framework of standardi sed loans may be done at branch level, including certain foreign country risk assessments related to the confirmation of l/cs. But all medium to long term loan business has to be referred to head office. When it comes to obtaining supplier/buyer credits banks and exporters will generally approach Hermes in tandem. Sometimes an exporter will come with export cover already confirmed. German exporters arguably appear to have a better relationship with their banks than their UK counterparts - perhaps reflecting a culture which some regard as more consciously 'international.' Their focus is shifting to seeking additional or alternative finance in the countries to which they are exporting - as well as in Germany. Local banks also face increasing competition from specialised export financing banks within Germany and Europe as a whole, and from international credit insurers  -a trend welcomed by German exporters, says Hans Juergen Mueller, managing director of the Federal Association of German Export Trade.</p>

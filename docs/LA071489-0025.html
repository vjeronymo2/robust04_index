			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER CONVICTED AS DRUG DELIVERER AFTER COCAINE IS FOUND IN NEWBORNS  </P> <P> An addict who gave birth to two children with traces of cocaine in their  systems was convicted of drug delivery Thursday under a law routinely used  against drug dealers.  </P> <P> "A derivative of cocaine which the defendant had introduced into her body  passed into theirs" through the umbilical cord, Circuit Judge O. H. Eaton Jr.  ruled in the non-jury trial.  </P> <P> Jennifer Clarise Johnson, 23, faces up to 30 years in prison, but prosecutor  Jeff Deen said he would recommend that she continue in a drug-treatment program  and receive a long period of probation.  </P> <P> Deen said the verdict is "a new tool for prosecutors to put a stop to this  great problem in this state and in the nation."  </P> <P> A key issue in the case was whether a newborn is a person after birth but  before the umbilical cord is severed. The state made that argument to justify  prosecution under a law making it a felony to deliver drugs to minors.  </P> <P> "I am convinced and find that a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has  not been severed is a 'person' within the intent and meaning" of Florida law,  Eaton said. He ruled also that the term "delivery" includes passage of cocaine  through the umbilical cord after birth.  </P></p>

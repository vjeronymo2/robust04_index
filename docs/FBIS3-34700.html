			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin "granted </F> jointly to both Israeli television channels" by political  reporter 'Imanu'el Rosen and Channel 1 party affairs reporter  Shlomo Raz in Jerusalem on 10 February -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Rosen] Sir, you have often  complained recently about 'Arafat. You said he should sweat it  out in Tunis. And yet in the end, he accepted practically every  demand Israel posed in the sphere of security. Has 'Arafat  changed in any way?    [Rabin] I am not saying he accepted every demand; we too  compromised here and there. I thought there were basic things  on which we had to insist, and I am happy that the sides drew  closer to each other on that. I do not want the outcome to be  presented as if he alone did all the conceding; we did some too.    [Rosen] What concessions did we make?    [Rabin] We ceded on several issues pertaining to the border  crossings; several issues pertaining to the right to hold Muslim  religious rituals in al-Nabi Musa, for instance; to permit the  holding of baptism rituals in the Jordan River three times a  year, and in special cases that have to be coordinated with us;  even with a flag.    [Raz] Yet last night, before the agreement was signed, you  and the military advisers who surrounded you seemed to be  wavering, unsure that the agreement should be signed.    [Rabin] Not at all wavering or unsure, rather anxious to do  everything to ensure our vital security issues.    Allow me to add something: I have been hearing criticism of  the Army involvement. I am simply unable to understand both  politicians and media people. I remember when I once said I did  not involve the Army in the months-long negotiations -- the  secret Oslo negotiations which gave us the Declaration of  Principles [DOP] -- there was an outcry of criticism: How can  you keep the Army out of it? That was a matter of principle, a  political decision. Now, when the implementation of that  agreement is at stake, the implementation of security issues, I  see it as my pragmatic As#?V????l duty to involve the Army.    [Rosen] Someone wrote about a putsch this week.    [Rabin] Right. I have never heard baloney worse than that.  [passage omitted]    [Raz] I assume a meeting between you and 'Arafat should not  be expected in the near future.    [Rabin] I see no reason to attend such a meeting before  everything is finalized.    [Rosen] I assume this will not happen before 13 April.    [Rabin] There are no sacred dates. Even the DOP stipulates  that the dates are based on the assumption that agreements will  be attained. From my point of view, what matters is attaining  an agreement that, with all this complexity, stands a chance to  succeed.</p>

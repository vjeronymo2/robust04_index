			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Markets Report: Talks push lira higher The Italian lira rose sharply yesterday in response to increasing evidence of co-operation between the partners of the Freedom Alliance, victorious in last week's election, writes Philip Gawith. The Italian currency was bolstered by the meeting of Mr Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League, and Mr Gianfranco Fini, the third main partner in the alliance. Contact was also re-established between the league and Mr Silvio Berlusconi, leader of the alliance. Earlier this week markets had been unsettled by comments from Mr Bossi saying that Mr Berlusconi was unfit to head the next government. This led to a break-off in talks between the two parties. Helped by the improved political sentiment, the lira broke through L960 against the D-Mark. Traders said the breach of this important technical level triggered covering of short lira positions. This accelerated the lira's advance with the currency finishing in London nearly 11 lira firmer at L954 from L965 at Wednesday's close. Elsewhere the dollar ended the day strongly, driven up by rumours of a possible tightening of monetary policy, and technically-driven buying. After slipping during the morning to a low of DM1.7085 against the D-Mark, the US currency rallied in the afternoon to finish in London at DM1.7181 from DM1.7151 on Thursday. Sterling, meanwhile, showed little response to encouraging output data showing industrial production rose by 0.8 per cent in February. The pound finished in London at DM2.5204 from DM2.5173. It was virtually unchanged against the dollar, at Dollars 1.467 from Dollars 1.4678 on Wednesday. The gyrations of the lira were the focus of attention with traders describing it as a 'wild day'. The D-Mark started the day a bit firmer, helped by reports of a smaller than anticipated rise in unemployment in March - 20,000 compared to a 25,000 forecast - and French industrial production falling by 0.2 per cent in January, against expectations of a 0.2 per cent increase. When reports of the Bossi/Fini meeting emerged, however, the lira started to climb, putting pressure on the D-Mark. Elsewhere in Europe, the D-Mark's performance was mixed. Against the French franc it was stronger, closing at FFr3.426 from FFr3.420. The peseta, however, continued its recent rebound to close at Pta80.75 against the D-Mark from Pta80.89. The Portuguese escudo finished slightly weaker at Es101.5 from Es101.3. Earlier it had risen to a seven-week high at Es100.95 per D-Mark. The Bank of Portugal maintained its recent policy of high short-term rates, injecting one-day funds at 14 per cent, keeping the emergency overnight lending rate at 13 per cent, and also providing five-day funds at 13 per cent. Overnight rates jumped up to 80 per cent from a close of 30-40 per cent on Thursday. Dealers said investors were buying overnight funds to take speculative positions against the escudo. German call money rates eased below 6 per cent after the Bundesbank allocated DM7bn of securities repurchase funds in a seven-day tender set at 5.73 per cent, the prevailing repo rate. The added liquidity helped call money fall to 5.75/5.90 per cent from 5.85/6.05 per cent on Wednesday. Since January, the Bundesbank has had only limited options for adding extra liquidity to the market due to the effective abolition of section 17 funds. Previously, public authority funds held at the Bundesbank under section 17 of the Bundesbank Act had been transfered to the money market to relieve short-term liquidity shortages. It was the first time since these changes that the Bundesbank had set a short-term tender. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, said the repo was a 'money market management operation, rather than any important policy signal.' He said a lowering of the discount rate this month was unlikely given the trade-weighted weakness of the D-Mark following the recent upsurge in the dollar. There was little activity in the futures market with the June three month euromark contract finishing one basis point weaker at 94.53. In France, meanwhile, the central bank left its intervention rate unchanged at 5.90 per cent at a securities repurchase tender held to inject funds into the money market today. In the UK discount market the Bank of England provided late assistance of Pounds 45m after earlier putting Pounds 623m liquidity into the market. The shortage was forecast at Pounds 850m. The recent rally in interest rate futures petered out with the June short sterling contract finishing the day unchanged at 94.50. The rally in the dollar ahead of the speech by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, proved misplaced when he confined his comments to consumer confidence. The June eurodollar contract was unchanged yesterday at 95.54, implying short term interest rates of 4.46 per cent in June compared to 3.87 per cent  -4 per cent now.</p>

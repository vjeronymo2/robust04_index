			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Taiwan jet deal threatened by technology battle TAIWANESE legislators yesterday threatened to block a USDollars 6bn (Pounds 3.95bn) purchase of 150 F-16 jet fighters from the US unless Washington agreed to transfer some production technology to the island, Reuter reports from Taipei. 'We will kill the deal if the US does not agree to technology transfer,' Mr Ting Shou-chung, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist party deputy in the parliament's defence committee, said after a closed session to discuss the government's budget request. 'It would be unthinkable and ridiculous if we did not have an offset agreement to manufacture parts,' Mr Ting said. Legislators said the defence ministry requested the first instalment of a USDollars 6bn budget to buy the F-16 fighters. State radio said the money would be paid over nine years and the first aircraft would be delivered in 40 months. The US reversed a decade-old policy and agreed to sell the F-16s to Taiwan last September despite strong protests by China, which claims sovereignty over the island. Mr Chen Li-an, defence minister, said the political sensitivity of the deal made it impossible for Taiwan to obtain a commitment for technology transfer from the aircraft's maker, General Dynamics, before the purchase was completed. The chairman of parliament's budget committee, Mr Liao Fuw-peen, criticised the budget request. Mr Ting and Mr Chen said they were confident of having enough support to block it. Mr Ting noted that opposition in parliament was a major reason for last year's collapse of a deal for Taiwan Aerospace Corp, partly owned by the Taiwan government, to buy a stake in the operations of McDonnell Douglas for USDollars 2bn. The legislators and state radio said Mr Chen also requested an allocation of funds for the purchase of 60 Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters from France. Taiwanese newspapers reported in November that a contract to buy 60 Mirages for about USDollars 2.6bn had been signed in Taipei, though Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's trade and industry minister, has denied that the deal had been finalised. China has closed France's consulate in the southern city of Guangzhou and cut French companies out of a USDollars 1bn subway contract there in retaliation for the reported deal. Taiwan's trade surplus plunged 29 per cent to an eight-year low of USDollars 9.48bn last year, slashed by rapidly rising imports and the global economic slowdown, the finance ministry said yesterday. Exports grew a moderate 7 per cent to USDollars 81.48bn, restrained by weak demand in major foreign markets such as the US and Japan. Imports surged 15 per cent to USDollars 72bn, boosted by a consumer spending boom and purchases of materials and equipment for Taiwan's six-year, USDollars 300bn infrastructure building plan. In December alone, the trade surplus shrank 44 per cent from a year earlier to USDollars 510m. The 1992 surplus was the lowest since USDollars 8.5bn in 1984. Economists predicted a figure between USDollars 7.5bn and USDollars 8bn.</p>

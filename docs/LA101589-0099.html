			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> IN HONG KONG, GETTING OUT IS BECOMING BIG BUSINESS  </P> <P> In this bastion of free enterprise and profit making, an industry is blossoming  that cashes in on fear of the coming takeover by Communist China.  </P> <P> From marriage counselors to immigration consultants, thousands in this British  colony are capitalizing on a growing desperation about 1997 -- when Hong Kong  comes under China's rule. Some appear to be profiting illegally.  </P> <P> Emigration industry specialists say hundreds of millions of dollars are being  spent by nervous residents who want to flee the colony. And, they say, business  is bound to improve.  </P> <P> The June 3-4 crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing has sparked  more interest in emigration than ever before.  </P> <P> Last year, 45,000 people left Hong Kong, mostly for the United States, Canada  and Australia. The number is expected to rise this year.  </P> <P> A survey in August said 2 out of every 5 residents want to emigrate, indicating  that few among the colony's 5.7 million people believe in China's promise to  maintain Hong Kong's economic system for at least 50 years.  </P> <P> On a recent weekend at the Hong Kong Convention Center, about 50,000 people  packed a show on overseas investment and immigration opportunities.  </P> <P> Australian women sporting bright blue 10-gallon hats hawked houses in Perth.  Videos showed sandpipers speeding down a Uruguayan beach and told of the  wonders of investing in that Latin American country. A movie beckoned, "Come to  New Zealand and be free."  </P> <P> One consultant's Chinese sign promised a Peruvian passport for $1,500 and 20  days in Lima. The Peruvian Consulate said it was impossible.  </P> <P> Another consultant was selling $100,000 investments in the United States,  although America does not accept business immigrants.  </P> <P> "There's always a window," said former chemist Junny Co, with a wry smile and a  wink as he passed out leaflets with the investment information. "I'm selling  the American dream."  </P> <P> Surveying the crowd, Peter Tse, a real estate agent for an Australian company,  heaved a sigh.  </P> <P> "There's a sucker born every minute," he said. "I'm just selling houses. But  the consultants, they're exploiting fear."  </P> <P> Indeed, in the emigration industry consultants are the big money makers,  charging as much as $50,000 for a successful case.  </P> <P> Consultants help prospective emigrants fill out forms, draw up business  proposals and determine whether they have the necessary credentials to  emigrate.  </P> <P> Since January, the ranks of Hong Kong-based consultants have swollen to 600, a  100% jump, according to Alex Lee, an advertising executive at Saleslink Ltd.,  which co-sponsored the convention. Hundreds more, including American lawyers,  added to the flock when they set up temporary shop in hotel rooms around the  colony.  </P> <P> At the conference, Jagson Cheu elbowed his way out of a booth run by a New  Zealand investment company.  </P> <P> "They want all my money just to go to the bottom of the world -- I can't  believe it," said the securities trader. "But I don't have a choice, I need  help. Right now I'm just looking for the cheapest thief."  </P> <P> Despite dozens of complaints of fraud to the Hong Kong Consumer Council, the  government does not monitor the industry, and there is practically no way to  sue a consultant.  </P> <P> Horatio Cheung, the only nonprofit consultant in the colony, tells of 290  people who were denied Canadian citizenship after being bilked out of thousands  of dollars by a consultant who tried to get around Canada's residency  requirement.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided a law firm in Toronto,  and several Canadian lawyers have been charged with perjury and other crimes in  connection with illegal immigration practices.  </P> <P> Those who can't afford a consultant are going back to school to get necessary  skills to emigrate. Some countries, like Australia, welcome certain workers,  such as pastry chefs and carpenters. Singapore, which is facing a labor  shortage, recently lowered its standards for immigrants, sparking 30,000 Hong  Kong residents to mob the application office.  </P> <P> But competition for seats in Hong Kong's few universities is intense. The Open  Learning Institute, Hong Kong's newest college-level facility, recently  received 60,000 applications for 5,000 spots for the upcoming school year. The  government-run school made about $380,000 from applications alone.  </P> <P> Fears about the takeover have also helped Hong Kong's matchmaking industry.  </P> <P> Maria Mo, manager of the International Computer Marriage Consulting agency,  says clients looking for a spouse with a foreign passport have increased by 50%  since June 4. Her company now gets up to 200 inquiries a month and charges at  least $1,000 for completed marriages.  </P> <P> R. Shek, who is looking for a Western husband, said the crackdown made her want  to leave Hong Kong as soon as possible.  </P> <P> "Hong Kong life used to be peaceful," said Shek, an executive secretary at an  international firm, "but now it's time to leave. I don't have enough money to  buy a passport, so marriage to a Westerner is the best route for me."  </P> <P> But this sector, too, is tainted by suspect practices. One matchmaker showed  letters from foreign men to his office, offering marriage for a "reasonable  price," or $35,000.  </P> <P> The immigration business has spawned its own service industry with TV and radio  talk shows, newspapers and magazines.  </P> <P> The Emigrant magazine started last year and now boasts 14,000 subscribers and a  thick advertisement section, pushing land in Jamaica, passports in Latin  America and factories in South Africa.  </P> <P> "We have people in line at all hours buying back issues," Editor Katherine  Kreuter said. "This is definitely a growth industry."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> Britain has agreed to turn over Hong Kong to China in 1997. The colony, a  bastion of free enterprise, fears communism. And those who can afford it are  looking for a way out.  </P></p>

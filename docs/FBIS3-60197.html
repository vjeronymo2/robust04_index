			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Anti-Narcotics Operation"] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has approved plans to  launch a major government operation against cultivation and  smuggling of narcotics in the nation. She said in the high-level  meeting of the Anti-Narcotics Task Force at her house that the  major drug smugglers will be arrested at any cost and political  pressure of any kind will not be accepted. As for cultivating,  use, and smuggling of narcotics in our country, it is still on  the rise. The situation is so serious that this trade is  regularly protected by some circles in our country. Some members  of the law enforcement agencies are also allegedly involved in  it. Now they discuss political patronage for this trade openly.  The U.S. government went as far as to say that some persons in  the legislature are also involved in this trade. The drug trade,  in addition to increasing the number of drug abusers, has also  given the United States and Western nations an opportunity to  denounce Pakistan. Our economic aid was also stopped because of  this. There is no doubt that the "drug Mafia" in Pakistan has  become very powerful during the last few years, and it has the  blessings of the administration, law enforcement agencies, and  politicians. The drug trade within the country is carried out  under the supervision of this Mafia. Despite the efforts of  government law enforcement agencies, heroin factories in tribal  areas still have not been destroyed. The drugs smuggled from  Afghanistan are available in addition to it. Although the Saudi  government has sentenced some Pakistanis to death recently and  also has given Pakistan a list of smugglers, the big fish of the  Mafia has not been apprehended. The efforts to control this  Mafia started during General Ziaul Haq's time, however, only  minor dealers were arrested. This determination was announced by  the governments that followed Zia, however, the drug Mafia was  never really affected. During the caretaker government, names of  some of the big fish were published, and a series of raids were  started. Some of them were arrested, however, those who control  this trade, and whom the Pakistani agencies know well, were not  arrested. It is clear from the record that the efforts to catch  the big fish or the drug lords have been nothing more than  slogans. Now Madam Bhutto's government has made this  announcement all over again. We expect that some serious work  will be done and the proposed operation is not just paperwork.</p>

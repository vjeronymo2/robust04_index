			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / T&amp;N set to gain from US asbestos settlement T&amp;N, the British engineering and motor components group, has moved closer to burying its past as Britain's leading supplier of asbestos following a landmark court settlement in the US. The settlement, announced in a Philadelphia federal court, establishes a framework for personal injury claims and should enable T&amp;N to cut its liability provisions for asbestos-linked legal action. Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, said yesterday those provisions  -Pounds 21.1m last year - could be halved by the turn of the century and wiped out altogether within 10 years. 'We're delighted at this decision, and I expect to see a favourable impact on our profit and loss account within two years.' T&amp;N, forecast to report first-half profits of Pounds 50m next month, has been pursuing the US settlement for more than a year through the Center for Claims Resolution, representing 20 companies including National Services Industries, Pfizer and Union Carbide Plastics. It claimed victory after US district Judge Lowell A. Reed supported a class action brought by the companies, under which they will together pay some Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) over 10 years to settle asbestos cases awaiting adjudication in state and federal courts. The decision was welcomed yesterday by City analysts, who said it could mark the end of T&amp;N's exposure to asbestos cases. 'This should lead to considerable savings on legal costs, especially as more than half the provisions relate to US cases,' said Mr Colin Fell, at Kleinwort Benson. Mr Charles Burrows, at James Capel, predicted a gradual decline in claims. They warned, however, that T&amp;N would put the asbestos issue behind it only if it won its legal battle with Chase Manhattan, the US bank, which is claiming Dollars 185m damages over contamination of its New York headquarters. Although Mr Hope said T&amp;N was likely to win the case, lawyers for Chase Manhattan predicted that the New York courts would deal more robustly with the company than in previous hearings. Mr Michael O'Connor, senior associate counsel and vice-president of Chase Manhattan, said: 'We have spent millions bringing this lawsuit. We would not be spending those resources if we were not confident of a favourable outcome.' The company also faces the prospect of legal action by New York's Port Authority over asbestos used at the World Trade Center and LaGuardia airport. T&amp;N's shares closed up 8p at 247p.</p>

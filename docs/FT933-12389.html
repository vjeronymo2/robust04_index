			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Manufacturing fuels surge in growth ROBUST manufacturing output fuelled another strong rise in economic growth in the second quarter, official figures showed yesterday. Provisional estimates show that gross domestic product rose by 0.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter, following a 0.4 per cent increase in the first three months of the year. Compared with a year ago GDP was 1.5 per cent higher. Excluding production of oil and gas, the economy grew by 0.5 per cent compared with first-quarter figures after growing by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter. This underlying measure of GDP was 1.3 per cent up on the same period a year ago. The figures suggest the economy is recovering more quickly and strongly than was anticipated by both the Treasury and many economists. The Central Statistical Office said strong manufacturing output was the principal force behind the second-quarter rise. Service-sector output was also estimated to have increased between April and June, with banking and financial services acting as the main spur to growth. The provisional figures show output of the service industries up a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent on the previous quarter and 1.5 per cent up on a year ago. Within this the distribution, hotels and catering sector - which includes retailers and wholesalers - grew by 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter to stand 2 per cent up on a year ago. The CSO said output from transport and communications industries had risen but the public sector remained flat on the previous quarter. Economists have been surprised at the growth in the first two quarters of the year - particularly growth of non-oil GDP - but they have noted that the economy is not recovering as quickly as it did from the last recession at the start of the 1980s. After the trough in the first quarter of 1981 GDP grew by 0.7 per cent, 0.8 per cent and 0.3 per cent for three successive quarters. GDP then fell back by 0.1 per cent in the first quarter of 1982. In the four quarters since the trough of this recession - the second quarter of last year - output has risen by 0.3 per cent, 0.3 per cent, 0.4 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively. Many economists have now improved their growth predictions for this year. Mr Kevin Gardiner, of SG Warburg, said growth would reach 1.7 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 1994. Mr Paul Turnbull, economist for Smith New Court, forecast a rise in GDP of 2 per cent this year and 3.25 per cent next year.</p>

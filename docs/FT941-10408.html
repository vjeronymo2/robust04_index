			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Joint venturers to develop Argentine mine Australia's MIM Holdings and International Musto Explorations of Canada have announced they will jointly develop Argentina's first world class mine in a Dollars 600m project. The Bajo de la Alumbrera copper and gold mine in the Andes foothills, 1,000km north-west of Buenos Aires, is said to be the largest of its kind in Latin America and one of the ten largest in the world. Musto completed an 18 month feasibility study of Bajo de la Alumbrera last year. It established reserves of 5.8bn lb of copper and 10m troy ounces of gold, giving the mine a life of at least 20 years. Argentina's Andes are believed to have geology similar to Chile, which has a major mining industry. But development was until recently hampered by restrictive legislation, political and economic turbulence and lack of a local mining tradition. Last year Argentina reformed its mining laws, scrapping controls on foreign investment. Mr Lukas Lundin, Musto's president, said the open cast mine would begin production in 1997 at an initial rate of 200m lb of copper and 470,000 ounces of gold a year. He expects a return on investment of at least 15 per cent. The companies have signed a letter of intent and plan to sign a contract in March. The mine will be developed as a 50:50 joint venture with MIM responsible for operating and financing the project. Mr Phil Wright, MIM's executive general manager for corporate development, said MIM would provide Dollars 240m for the project, with the remainder coming from bank project financing. The property belongs to the state-owned YMAD mining corporation, which will take a 20 per cent share of net profit. Musto holds 100 per cent tenancy of the mine. The government has promised not to change the project's tax treatment for 30 years, exempted import duties for equipment and placed a 3 per cent cap on royalties.</p>

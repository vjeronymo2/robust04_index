			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / UK Company News: Simon pulled back from the brink - Maurice Dixson's changes at the engineering company Mr Maurice Dixson has seized Simon Engineering by the scruff of the neck and in eight action-packed months dragged it back from the brink of receivership. The speed of change at the group, best known for making access equipment such as fire rescue gear, is likely to slow following the announcement just before Easter of a Pounds 52.5m rights issue. Mr Dixson has described the issue as 'the cornerstone that puts us on a sound financial footing'. The issue was flagged earlier in March, when the group announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 160.3m for 1993. But Mr Dixson was determined not to go ahead until protracted negotiations with the group's many lenders had been finally untangled. The talks were concluded on March 30, leaving Simon with new banking and bonding facilities, from Lloyds and Barclays in the UK and from the Fifth Third Bank in the US, on completion of the rights issue. Since Mr Dixson became chief executive on September 1 last year his main priority has been to drive down debt through a programme of tighter controls and disposals. Shining through the flood of red ink in the 1993 results were two signs of hope. Debt had been reduced from Pounds 148m when Mr Dixson took over to Pounds 117.8m at the year end and the cash haemorrhage had been staunched, mainly by getting working capital down. In the first half the net cash outflow was Pounds 43.7m. In the second half there was a net cash inflow of Pounds 13.1m. The debt reduction has been achieved by disposals, mainly the sale in January of its 50 per cent share in TR Oil Services for Pounds 6.2m and February's sale of Unichem International to the Western Company of North America for Dollars 19.8m (Pounds 13.5m). The two sales ended Simon's involvement in chemical services. Further disposals are likely, particularly Simon Petroleum Technology, which incurred losses of Pounds 5.5m for 1993, compared with profits of Pounds 2.6m in 1992. This division includes Robertson, the oil exploration group which accounted for almost half the Pounds 101.5m of goodwill written off last year. Market conditions have been behind the bad performance in this division, but after the rights issue, Simon will be able to take its time with the disposal. Mr Dixson thinks it is a good business with good people. It could be sold this year but only 'if we can get the right deal'. Mr Dixson's overall strategy is to concentrate on three core businesses  - the access division, the storage division and Simon-Carves, the process engineering contractor. He believes the three are complementary. Of the three only storage reported an operating profit for the year, up from Pounds 8.3m to Pounds 8.5m on turnover of Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 39.3m). Mr Dixson sees this as a stable business with strong potential for growth and assets that can be used as a hedge for Simon-Carves, where the assets are people and technology. In addition the division has the only deep water site on Humberside not owned by Associated British Ports. The 200-acre site already has good road and rail heads in place, and the group is seeking to unlock the value. Access incurred a loss of Pounds 14.2m, including exceptional losses of Pounds 10.3m, on turnover sharply ahead at Pounds 161.7m (Pounds 134.8m). This compared with a profit of Pounds 2.2m in 1992. However, Mr Dixson sees plenty of opportunity for this division to build on its world market share of 15 per cent. The management has been replaced and European production is being concentrated in Gloucester. Once the restructuring is completed this summer, he sees no reason why the division should not be returning 10 per cent. Losses at Simon-Carves rose from Pounds 1m in 1992 to Pounds 3m last year on turnover down from Pounds 89.2m to Pounds 51.3m. Mr Dixson says the division completed its Pounds 260m contract to build an electronic factory at Yerevan in Armenia at the end of 1992 with very little on its order books. He believes, however, that the group is well poised to take advantage of an upturn in demand. It will be further helped by new banking and bonding facilities. In order to carry through his plans Mr Dixson has reorganised the board. He appointed Mr Tim Redburn, formerly of Lep, as finance director, in place of Mr Alan Jarvis, and precipitated the resignation of Mr John Barker, who was responsible for building Simon into the world's biggest producer of powered access equipment. Of the old guard, the sole survivor is Mr Peter Cook, aboard since 1977, who, in January, was relieved of his responsibilities as managing director of the industrial services division. He has been concentrating on the disposal programme, and will be retiring at the end of the year. Mr Ron Wheeler, who replaced Mr Barker at the head of access, has not been given a seat on the board. Mr Dixson has also appointed Mr Guppy Dhariwal, an old GEC colleague, as financial director of access. Under the 5-for-9 rights issue the group is issuing 55.9m new shares at 100p. The issue, fully underwritten by Hill Samuel and SG Warburg, was approved by shareholders last Friday. Pro forma gearing will be cut from 264 per cent to 51 per cent, with a further reduction expected by the end of the year. City analysts believe this year should see the completion of Simon's restructuring, with benefits starting to flow through to shareholders in 1995. 'It's not a new era dawning,' said one. 'But they are in control.' Mr Dixson is more positive, yesterday buying 22,223 ordinary shares at 115p. After taking up his rights he will hold 100,000 shares. 'I am completely satisfied that we will be able to build a profitable engineering group around the three core businesses. We're looking at a company that really does have a tremendous future.'</p>

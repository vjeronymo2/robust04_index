[passage omitted]    Sulayman Majid al-Shahin, the under secretary at the Foreign  Ministry, who had welcomed Ekeus on his arrival, said that the  prominent UN official's visit to Kuwait was important because it  exemplified the UN Security Council's surveillance over the  Baghdad regime's mass destruction weapons.    He added that Ekeus will brief Kuwaiti officials on the  achievements of the UN commission with regard to destroying  Iraqi mass destruction weapons and the long-term monitoring of  the Iraqi regime's armament program.    For his part, Rolf Ekeus said that the commission did not  feel satisfied up till now with the results of its work in Iraq,  which meant that the UN economic sanctions imposed on the  Baghdad regime, because of its aggression against the State of  Kuwait, will remain in force.    Ekeus added that with regard to chemical weapons, the  commission did not feel reassured because of the lack of  complete information from Iraqi regime officials that would  enable the commission to confirm that all these weapons had been  destroyed or removed.    Ekeus stressed that there were still serious problems to be  solved with the Iraqi regime officials at a meeting to be held  in March. He said he believed that as long as the UN commission  was able to work in Iraq, the Baghdad regime would not be able  to implement any comprehensive armaments program. He emphasized  that UN control was effective in this field and that the UN  Security Council will rely on the reports of the commission when  it came to make any decision related to considering the lifting  or reduction of the sanctions imposed on the Iraqi regime.</p>

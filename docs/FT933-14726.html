			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Brinkmanship in Baghdad IF NOTHING else, President Saddam Hussein is consistent. Since the invasion of Kuwait nearly three years ago, the Iraqi leader has persistently refused to obey UN Security Council resolutions. Time and again he has challenged the authority of the world body. On occasion defiance has been a prelude to retreat but, when he has proved inflexible, the Gulf war allies have had, jointly or individually, to consider a military response. The justification for such a response under international law needs to be fully demonstrable, because it is vital to act under the authority of the UN and to maintain, so far as possible, the political cohesion of the international alliance which was created to force Iraq out of Kuwait. That legality and political cohesion were stretched beyond the limit by the US missile strike on Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad last month. The attack, in retaliation for an alleged plot to assassinate former President George Bush, was justified by Washington under a country's right of defence provided for by Article 51 of the UN Charter. Several of America's allies expressed no more than 'understanding' for the raid. Others were deeply sceptical about the reasoning behind it, sensing that it owed more to President Clinton's domestic difficulties. There should be fewer doubts at the UN or in Baghdad about the consequences of the latest confrontation with the Iraqi leader. As part of its programme to deny Iraq weapons of mass destruction, UN teams have sought to install cameras at two missile testing sites south-west of the capital. Although, under the terms of the ceasefire resolutions, Iraq was permitted to retain missiles with a range of less than 90 miles, UN officials rightly suspect that Iraq would use its test facilities to develop weapons with a longer range. They want to make sure that Iraq has no such opportunity. Iraq argues that by installing cameras the UN would be violating its sovereignty and this action could be used subsequently as a pretext for shutting down other factories used for industrial purposes. Neither argument carries weight and by refusing to allow the remote-control cameras to be introduced, Iraq only deepens suspicions about its intentions. Unlike the American missile attack last month, the present confrontation is limited to two sites and one issue. The buildings housing the Iraqi test facilities are clearly grouped and the Iraqis know precisely what is required of them. The permanent members of the Security Council might reasonably argue that Saturday's refusal by Iraq even to allow inspectors to seal the missile sites while negotiations continued provided justification enough for military action. Even so, they must be mindful of the need to explain and justify. Once that is done, the responsibility of any subsequent military action belongs to Saddam Hussein. He must learn to expect consistency from the UN.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Unsettled picture on mortgages Figures released yesterday by the British Bankers Association gave a mixed picture of the state of the mortgage market, and failed to resolve doubts about the strength of the recovery in the housing market. The association reported a 10 per cent increase to Pounds 1.58bn in new gross mortgage lending undertaken by leading British banks last month, compared with Pounds 1.43bn in April. The statistics also showed a rise in the number of new mortgages approved by banks from 26,989 to 30,000, and a rise in their total value from Pounds 1.38bn to Pounds 1.58bn. But the amount of gross lending in May was scarcely higher than the Pounds 1.56bn equivalent in the same month last year, and there were more approvals in May 1993, amounting to 33,690. Similarly the value of loans approved in May last year - at Pounds 1.63bn - was higher than those approved last month. Mr David Dooks, assistant director of statistics at the association, contrasted the rise in new gross lending undertaken by banks last month with the sharp drop from Pounds 974m to Pounds 806m in the new net lending carried out by societies. He said banks seemed to be regaining some of the share of the mortgage market that they had ceded to building societies. Banks performed strongly against societies last year but fell back somewhat in the early months of this year as societies became more aggressive. The leading British banks include eight of the 20 largest mortgage lenders in the UK. Lord Inchyra, association director-general, said that the latest statistics appeared to suggest that the lower figures in April were an anomaly - perhaps caused by the shorter working month rather than a reaction to tax increases. The banks' figures gave 'a slightly rosier view of the mortgage market than the recent building society figures,' he added. Mortgage lenders say that the unsettled picture presented by the monthly figures comes partly from the rush to take advantage of the very low fixed-rate mortgages temporarily on offer earlier this year, which affected the flow of business. While there are still some within the sector who are confident about the recovery, many lenders seem to be less optimistic now than they were three months ago.</p>

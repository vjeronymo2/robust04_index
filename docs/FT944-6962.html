			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How To Spend It (The Electronic Age): Staying in touch - A variety of fads are catching on around the world. FT writers report on what is happening where For people crammed into the second most densely populated corner of the world, those in Hong Kong have a strange fear of losing touch. The colony has one of the world's highest penetrations of mobile communications, from cordless telephones to pagers. One person in every three - effectively, every household - has one such piece of apparatus. The fascination with mobile phones starts young. Plastic models are displayed alongside traditional rattles and building blocks. It is a fair bet that the first word uttered by the Hong Kong baby is not 'Mummy' but 'Wei]', the telephone greeting. None of this has been lost on telecommunications companies, both locally and overseas. As Hong Kong also has one of the most technologically sophisticated audiences, the range of telephones and pagers is as big as it is diverse. Top criteria are size - slim versions are best - and long-distance capabilities, a must for those whose working day can be spent on either side of the Chinese border. Yet, the rave among white-socked schoolgirls and be-suited businessmen alike is a relatively simple product with a uniquely Hong Kong twist: the multi-lingual pager. These svelte models - slimmer than a packet of cigarettes and infinitely more hip - continue to provide all the information which is de rigueur for Hong Kong students, taxi drivers and tycoons. Hutchison and Motorola advertise their joint multi-lingual pager with a slogan designed to win the hearts and minds of today's bi-cultural youth in an apt semantic hybrid: 'Gam man fong kung hoi happy hour ma?' ('Are you on for happy hour after work tonight?'). The Motorola Advisor, a pager that can be used only in Hong Kong and Macau but is loaded with functions guaranteed to appeal to the button-happy, plus a memory storing up to 40 messages, also has an astute marketing strategy. The television commercials depict a youth with pop star looks and a bouquet of flowers who always arrives at places where his friends are not. The message is clear: if only he had a multi-faceted, multi-lingual Motorola pager then he, too, could take part in the happy-hour karaoke.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH KOREA'S STOCK MARKET HITS SKIDS  </P> <P> South Korea's stock market plunged Thursday in its biggest daily fall in  history, sparking violent protests by investors against the government.  </P> <P> Trusts joined panicking individuals in selling across the board, sending the  composite stock index dropping by 28.96 points to close at 726.11. The previous  record decline in a day was 27.53 points on April 12 last year.  </P> <P> The market has now fallen about 22% this year on general pessimism over the  country's economic future.  </P> <P> Brokers said furious investors held demonstrations at securities offices in  Seoul's business district, Myongdong, and at the headquarters of securities  companies in Yoido.  </P> <P> A broker said one distraught investor at a demonstration at a Daishin  Securities branch blamed President Roh Tae Woo for encouraging people to buy  stocks.  </P> <P> "She said now she has so many losses, it makes her sick to see Roh's face on  television," the broker said.  </P> <P> Yonhap news agency reported demonstrations at branch offices in Taegu and other  provincial cities.  </P> <P> "Roh regime, take responsibility for the stock market plunge and get out,"  chanted 200 investors in Puchon, south of Seoul. In Taegu protesters yelled:  "Spineless Roh Tae Woo, get out."  </P> <P> Witnesses said more than 300 riot police surrounded the Korea Stock Exchange in  Yoido to head off protests.  </P> <P> Analysts said investment trusts had to sell some of their holdings to raise  cash to satisfy people who were asking for their money back.  </P> <P> "We have a double whammy here," said Edward Kim at Daewoo Securities.  "Investors are selling and trusts are selling.  </P> <P> "It's overreaction, panic. You cannot logically explain the market's movement.  It's illogical," he said.  </P> <P> Brokers said the threat of police action to break up a strike at Hyundai Heavy  Industries huge shipyard in southeastern Ulsan also depressed sentiment. The  government declared the strike illegal after an emergency Cabinet meeting on  Thursday.  </P> <P> The index started out 1990 on an upbeat note and marked a high on Jan. 4 at  928.82.  </P></p>

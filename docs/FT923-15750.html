			<p>920701 FT  01 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Efta and Czechoslovakia go ahead with trade pact A FREE trade pact between Czechoslovakia and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) comes into effect as planned today,despite uncertainty over the future of the Czech and Slovak republics. Mr Hans-Jorg Renk, Efta spokesman, said both sides would pursue 'business as usual', pending a review of the accord in September. Efta officials hope that, whatever happens, the two republics will maintain a customs union and common currency, making renegotiation of the pact unnecessary. Efta, grouping Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, also hopes this month to conclude negotiations on free trade pacts with Hungary and Poland. Mr Renk said talks with Hungary had made good progress, despite earlier complaints by Budapest that Efta countries were insisting on tougher terms than the EC, with whom Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia all have association accords. Outstanding problems concern trade in farm goods, where Efta countries have shown themselves reluctant to open their markets to cheaper east European produce.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / De Klerk hit by stone South African President F W de Klerk was struck by a stone thrown by an African National Congress supporter yesterday, highlighting the growing incidence of political intimidation during the campaign for April's all-race elections, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. Screaming ANC supporters drove Mr de Klerk from a coloured township in the Northern Cape region. He was unhurt. 'We are not afraid of the ANC. We will not allow ourselves to be intimidated. We will not cringe. We will not run away,' he said.</p>

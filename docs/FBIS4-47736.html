			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has  described the fuel scarcity being experienced nationwide as  artificial. In his message on workers' May Day celebrations in  Kaduna today, Gen. Abacha explained that the problem was caused  by selfish and unpatriotic elements who do not want to see the  progress of the nation. The commander in chief warned that  government would clamp down on their activities with  ruthlessness to solve the problem.    The message, which was read by the administrator of Kaduna  State, Colonel Lawal Jafaru Issa, (?lauded) Nigerian workers for  their courage and wisdom. The head of state asked the workers  not to be misguided by selfish politicians and their  collaborators in the business and financial sector, that are  bent on sabotaging government's efforts to improve the welfare  of the people.    He said government was aware of the suffering of the worker,  and would ameliorate it by tackling fiscal and monetary policies  that would bring about reductions in prices of goods. Gen. Sani  Abacha announced that the Federal Government was currently  creating structures for the implementation of the Nigerian  Social Insurance Trust Fund Decree, to replace the National  Providence Fund, aimed at advancing the welfare of workers.    According to him, government has granted the sum of $385,000  for the running of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity  this year, while it has also ratified the International Labor  Organization Convention 104 and 155.</p>

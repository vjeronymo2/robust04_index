			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING ON STRONG AS A BROADWAY 'CAT';  </P> <P> KATHLEEN TURNER RELISHES THE CHALLENGE AND CACHET OF PLAYING TENNESSEE  WILLIAMS' STEAMIEST CHARACTER  </P> <P> Decked out in a lace slip and little else, Kathleen Turner's beckoning form  looms over the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on West 49th Street, easily seducing  passers-by from the two other marquees in view.  </P> <P> Without a glance at the title -- "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," that drama club  perennial -- you might think Turner's competition was "Lovers in Heat" at the  World Porn Spectacular down the block, not Somerset Maugham's "The Circle,"  another Broadway revival playing under demure signage across the street.  </P> <P> Turner makes no apologies for stalking audiences with such impudence; this is  her first sashay onto Broadway in more than a decade, and, with her role as  Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams' fervid melodrama, the actress shrugs, "I  couldn't imagine just creeping in unnoticed."  </P> <P> She hasn't.  </P> <P> Turner caused Boston Globe critic Kevin Kelly to loose an alliterative stream  that would shame the most ardent publicist: she was "steamy, sultry, sexy,  socko, sinuous, syncopated, scintillating," his review stammered, before  closing with a veiled hope: "serenade-able . . . "  </P> <P> Even the New York Times' Frank Rich, said Turner was "mesmerizing to watch,"  observing that "to see this actress put on her nylons, a ritual of exquisitely  prolonged complexity, is a textbook lesson in what makes a star."  </P> <P> Still, Turner hopes to show more than an ability to unroll her stockings. At  age 35, she senses a crucial point in her career; seductress roles will grow  scarcer as she ages, Turner notes, so the screen siren who made a name playing  sexy, dangerous women wants to prove she can act as well.  </P> <P> The role of Maggie, which Turner calls "kind of a Hamlet for women," met her  objectives. She instigated the current production, which is directed by Howard  Davies and features Charles Durning as Big Daddy, Polly Holliday as Big Mama  and Daniel Hugh Kelly as their favorite son, Brick.  </P> <P> "I needed a good play, not just some vanity role that would get me on stage in  the flesh, " she said. Not that the flesh part bothered her: "When I get  older," she says, "there'll be plenty of time to do Lady Macbeth and all that."  </P> <P> Turner, of course, isn't the only Hollywood figure who feels a need to prove  something on a New York stage. This season, she joins actors ranging from  Dustin Hoffman ("Merchant of Venice") to Justine Bateman ("Crucible"), who have  found Cliff Notes-certified classics the perfect vehicle for their talents.  </P> <P> "I don't suppose there's any film or TV actress who isn't sometimes made to  feel her medium is second-rate," Turner said. "This play can only enhance my  reputation. It's got a cachet, it gives me what they call 'legit' acting  credentials."  </P> <P> The play, which Williams himself called "the American 'Lear,' " depicts the  dying hours of a Mississippi patriarch, Big Daddy Pollitt, and the duplicitous  maneuverings of his eager heirs. Act I is essentially a monologue by the  frustrated, clawing Maggie, who seeks to excite her taciturn husband, Brick.  She yearns for a child to consummate her membership in the Pollitt clan, but  the drunken Brick spurns her affection, unable to shake the memory of his  friend Skipper, a suicide.  </P> <P> Audiences of the 1958 film version might have wondered why Brick, played by  Paul Newman, scorned the ardors of Elizabeth Taylor's Maggie. The present  revival returns to Williams' original text, which confronts the homosexual  nature of Brick and Skipper's friendship less obliquely.  </P> <P> More importantly for Turner's purposes, it also shifts attention from Big Daddy  to Maggie; unlike "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof's" two other Broadway productions --  the 1955 premiere and a 1974 revival -- where Big Daddy thundered his way  through the third and final act, the original text calls for that potentially  distracting character to be out of Turner's way by the end of Act II.  </P> <P> "I've never wanted to be a supporting actress," she explains. "I'm damn good on  stage and I want to show it."  </P> <P> That doesn't mean she's unfazed by criticism, however. To Rich's complaint that  "she lacks the vulnerability of a woman 'eaten up with longing' for the man who  shuns her bed," Turner responds, "Vulnerable? I thought I was doing it. I mean,  I get gulps from the audience."  </P> <P> This vulnerability issue touches a nerve with Turner. "All my life I've been  hearing that I'm not vulnerable enough. I don't know what the hell they mean,"  she said. "Does 'vulnerable' mean some essential inability to function? I  guess, then, I've got a problem with it."  </P> <P> Since her first screen role as "Body Heat's" murderess 10 years ago, the  Missouri-born Turner has artfully constructed her persona as a femme fatale.  Roles in such movies as "Prizzi's Honor," "Crimes of Passion" and even as the  voice of voluptuous Jessica in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" created the image; an  off-screen acerbity and impatience with the celebrity press added to it. In  interviews, she's known to assume Spanish and British accents, drop into  character unexpectedly, and dismiss the talents of the '40s icon she's often  compared to, Lauren Bacall.  </P> <P> "I'm an expert at presenting Kathleen Turner, capital K, capital T, whether  it's finding the right sentence to say, or the right way to say it. I have a  kind of carriage that projects the beautiful, powerful presence of a woman,"  she said. "That's my job."  </P> <P> Thus, Turner was quick to tell an interviewer that she had forgotten when the  Academy Awards ceremony was scheduled this month. Not recognized for her role  in "War of the Roses," not asked to present an award to anyone else, the  once-nominated Turner (for "Peggy Sue Got Married") proclaimed: "Am I going to  watch the Oscars? Hell no! They didn't remember me, so I can't be expected to  remember them."  </P> <P> When not engaged in the sultry affectations she sees as her job, however,  Turner offered views on the state of theater, and the play she put together and  previewed in Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburg and Wilmington, Del., before  opening on Broadway.  </P> <P> She admires Williams' involved speeches, which "start off intensely  naturalistic, but then switch to such tremendous poetry. It's amazing how he  does it," she said.  </P> <P> Turner concedes, though, that the play's topical themes haven't held up as well  as Williams' poetry: Homosexuality, infidelity and cancer are no longer taboo  subjects.  </P> <P> "There's no shock value any more in having a woman come on stage and take off  her dress," Turner said. "But I think that change in attitude removes a  distraction, it makes the play's real content much stronger. The real issues  are about honesty, not homosexuality."  </P> <P> More recent works didn't have the same appeal.  </P> <P> She admires David Mamet, but "would never in a million years do what Madonna  did in 'Speed the Plow.' I didn't like 'Burn This.' 'The Heidi Chronicles?' How  could I do it? I'm not New York-bred, and I'm not Jewish."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Turner, who lives in Greenwich Village with her husband, real  estate developer Jay Weiss and her 2-year-old daughter, Rachel Ann, aims to  appear in at least one play and one film each year. In the fall, she plans to  begin shooting a detective movie, "Hard Boiled." After that -- and after a  hoped for second child -- Turner said she'd like to perform in more vintage  works, perhaps a Noel Coward play, or, coincidentally, to once again return a  play made into an Elizabeth Taylor movie to the stage: Shakespeare's "The  Taming of the Shrew."  </P> <P> "I was having this fight with (actor) Ron Silver, and I thought, 'You know, we  could really knock each other out on stage as Katherine and Petrucchio," she  said.  </P> <P> In addition to the credibility that major stage roles add to her movie career,  Turner asserted an almost evangelical belief in theater's value to society.  </P> <P> "I have this idea that outside church, theater is one of the few places you can  be close to somebody and be part of a group experience at the same time. It's  amazing the trust that occurs, just from being so physically close to so many  other people. It's a way of lifting the isolation that people feel so much  today.  </P> <P> That feeling of trust has its limits, though, even for a star as assured as  Turner. Pointing to a box overhanging the Eugene O'Neill's intimate stage, she  recalled an audience member who seemed all too close.  </P> <P> "I'm on the bed kicking up my legs, putting on my stockings, and I look up, and  the guy sitting in the box is staring at me through binoculars. Even for me,  that's a little too much."  </P></p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Banker 'controlled sham company' The former chairman of Wallace Smith Trust, the collapsed merchant bank, had 'complete control' over a separate Canadian company alleged to be at the centre of a Pounds 100m fraud, an accountant who worked directly to him told the Old Bailey yesterday. Mr Patrick Nicholas, a prosecution witness, said Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, the bank's former chairman, had made him a director of Dundalk Investments, a company officially based in Edmonton, Alberta. Had he known the true nature of Dundalk's activities, he would never have got involved with the company, Mr Nicholas said. The prosecution alleges that Mr Smith swindled Pounds 100m from other banks to prevent Wallace Smith Trust collapsing after it ran into financial difficulties. It claims that Mr Smith used Dundalk, a 'sham' company without any assets, to carry out a series of transactions which gave the impression that Wallace Smith Trust was trading profitably. Mr Smith denies charges of theft, obtaining money by deception, false accounting and fraudulent trading. Mr Nicholas, a director of the Canadian company, worked from an office in Jermyn Street, London. He told Mr Timothy Barnes QC, prosecuting, that Mr Smith had complete control over Dundalk's activities. Mr Nicholas's own unofficial investigation into Dundalk's finances showed it had no assets of its own, he said. The trial continues.</p>

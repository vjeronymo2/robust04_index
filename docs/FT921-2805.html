			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Housing starts boost hopes of US recovery THE Bush administration's hopes of economic recovery were boosted yesterday by evidence of a revival in both house construction and industry. A strong advance in housing starts, coupled with a more modest increase in industrial production, provided two more of the 'robins on the lawn' that Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury Secretary, has cited as indicators that an economic springtime is on the way. The strongest sign of a recovery was a 10 per cent surge in housing starts in February. The Commerce Department said 1.3m privately owned homes were started in February, 29 per cent higher than a year earlier. Single-family homes provided the greatest strength, with 1.15 starts in February - up 15 per cent from January, and 43 per cent higher than in February 1991. The heavily overbuilt apartment sector remained weak, however, with starts dropping to 128,000 units, 21 per cent down from January and 24 per cent lower than a year ago. Industrial output rose 0.6 per cent in February, but this was still not enough to reverse the sharp drop in production in January. The US Federal Reserve said a rebound in production of motor vehicles and parts accounted for around half of February's gain, adding that overall industrial production stood 1.4 per cent above its level a year earlier. At the same time, the consumer price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3 per cent last month, lifting the year-on-year inflation rate to 2.8 per cent, from 2.6 per cent in January, according to Labor Department statistics. But core inflation - excluding the volatile food and energy components of the price index - showed a slight decline to 3.8 per cent year on year. The new statistics appeared to set the stage for an economic revival which, while less exuberant than the recoveries from previous recessions, could, nevertheless, prove more robust than many economists had predicted until recently. 'Inventories are declining, so industry is set up for a recovery. The key is whether there is full follow-through on employment,' said Mr James O'Sullivan, an economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. Some economists are concerned that the most recent indications of recovery may have been fuelled by some short-lived injections of cash into consumers' wallets, such as the annual arrival of tax refund cheques from the Internal Revenue Service. They would feel more comfortable about the durability of the recovery if companies showed signs of hiring new workers. Strong export growth and an influx of cash contributions from US allies in the Gulf war helped cut the US external deficit sharply last year, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The deficit in the current account of the US balance of payments shrank to Dollars 8.62bn, compared with Dollars 92.1bn in 1990. While the deficit in merchandise trade fell by 32 per cent to Dollars 73.6bn, the US surplus in trade in services increased by 36 per cent to Dollars 35.9bn.</p>

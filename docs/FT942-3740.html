			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Violent protestors at Orly Airport The return of British Airways yesterday to Orly airport after a 20-year absence was marred by noisy and at times violent protest demonstrations, writes Paul Betts at Orly Airport. Some 200 employees of the small French independent carrier Air Liberte tried to stop passengers from checking in on flights operated by BA and its French affiliate TAT, leading to scuffles and three arrests. The protesters failed to stop the four BA and TAT services, although the flights suffered delays and passengers were forced to check in inside the terminal departure lounge. Although restricted to only four return flights a day, BA in partnership with TAT is seeking to operate up to 11 daily return flights from Orly to Heathrow starting in October. Air Liberte's chief executive, said yesterday was the beginning of an airport landing and take-off slots 'war'.</p>

			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Inquiry uncovers wide abuse of EU subsidies Mr Justice Liam Hamilton's report into the Irish beef processing industry uncovered widespread and flagrant abuses of the European Union's intervention system and lack of adequate supervision by the Department of Agriculture. The report criticised lax controls imposed by the agriculture department on the intervention system for buying up beef from farmers, and recommended that responsibility for managing it be placed with an independent body. However, the Irish government said that changes introduced in recent years to the way intervention is run would address some of the weaknesses cited in the report. The EU's system of intervention was set up as a safety net for farmers by guaranteeing minimum prices for meat and other farm commodities. The system became deeply embedded in the Irish farming economy, which produces seven times more beef than it consumes, with, until recently, 75 per cent placed in intervention stores. Beef bought into intervention is kept in cold storage until it can be sold in the EU or exported to third countries - often with the help of export refunds to cover any discrepancy in price. But the system is open to abuse as it is managed in many countries at a local level with ad hoc inspections. The Irish beef tribunal found that officials from the Goodman group's international arm consistently misreported weights of beef used at boning plants in Dublin and Waterford. By reporting higher weights than were actually used, the group was able to claim substantially higher export refunds. On one occasion in 1986, the report cites the advancement of IPounds 2.3m (Pounds 2.27m) in export refunds for 70,000 cartons of beef, while it was found that part of the meat did not exist and that 6,800 cartons had had their weight increased by 3.8kg each. At the same time, Goodman had been able to export significant amounts of non-Irish beef from intervention stores to Iraq in return for export credit guarantees from the Irish government. Mr John Donelly, president of the Irish Farmers' Association, said the beef industry had worked hard at developing markets overseas and that not a pound of beef had been placed in intervention for the past year. Irish farmers are hoping to exploit openings left by the additional restrictions placed on British beef exports because of mad cow disease. Reforms of the common agricultural policy have aimed to curtail the growth of intervention by reducing minimum prices.</p>

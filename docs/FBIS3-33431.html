Deputy Mandenave condemns the  international community which is putting pressure on President  Jean-Bertrand Aristide while the Army is acting as it wishes, at  the same time labelling the parliamentarians' trip to Washington  as a dilatory maneuver.    [Begin Mandenave recording in Creole] [passage omitted] I  remain convinced that it is necessary to have a government that  is not a government of resignation. The current government has  resigned. A government cannot spend all its time dealing with  the day-to-day business of the state. But the path must be  cleared before the president appoints a prime minister. General  Cedras must step down first. Everybody knows that the Malval  government failed because the Army and the Revolutionary Front  for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti members prevented it  from functioning. [end recording]    Furthermore, Deputy Mandenave says he is expecting nothing  positive from the dismissal [corrects himself] sorry, from the  other office of the Senate at the initiative of Sen. Dupiton.  In the opinion of Deputy Mandenave, that is nothing more than a  meeting between friends. [passage omitted]</p>

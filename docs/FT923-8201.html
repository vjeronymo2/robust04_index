			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Positive inflation data leave Dow in doldrums Wall Street MORE good news on inflation failed to stir US stock markets yesterday, which remained subdued by mid-August summer doldrums, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.27 at 3,320.83, above its mid-afternoon low when the index had fallen almost 20 points on computer sell programs. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down 1.12 at 417.78, while the Amex composite slipped 1.62 to 386.46 and the Nasdaq composite eased 0.75 to 570.85. Turnover on the NYSE was 177m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 909 to 787. The morning's inflation data was positive for market sentiment, but the 0.1 per cent increase in July producer prices was in line with analysts' expectations and, therefore, had no significant impact on prices. With calmer overseas markets, and little change in bond yields, equities lacked a lead from external influences, and with many market participants away for the summer break, prices traded in a narrow range in light turnover. McDonnell Douglas was a feature for the third consecutive day. After a delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side, shares in the defence and aerospace group rose another Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 as investors continued to react positively to last week's announcement of a major restructuring, and the subsequent brokers' upgrades triggered by the news. In the past three days McDonnell's stock has risen almost 20 per cent. Federal Express dropped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 41 1/8 in active trading after Morgan Stanley and Robinson Humphrey cut their first quarter earnings forecasts. Wells Fargo rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 69 1/2 on the news that Mr Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, had increased his stake in the bank from 9.7 per cent to 10.75 per cent. Safety-Kleen fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 26 1/4 on speculation that the Environmental Protection Agency, the government's pollution watchdog, would reject a call for tougher rules for used oil disposal. The company was expected to have benefited from the new rules. In the same sector, Fluor Corporation climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 39 1/2 after a subsidiary of the company received a contract from the Department of Energy to manage the clean-up of an uranium production plant in Ohio, which could be worth up to Dollars 4bn. On the Nasdaq market, Nordstrom rose Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 in heavy turnover after Lazard Freres, the investment bank, initiated coverage of the stock with a 'buy' recommendation and forecast that 1993 earnings would come in at Dollars 1.65 a share. Parametic Technology jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 42 1/4 in active trading after the data processing technology company won a contract worth at least Dollars 10m to provide engineering software to Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment. Canada TORONTO share prices posted a sizable decline in active trading which was boosted by heavy first-day trading in the common shares and instalment receipts of Nova Scotia Power. Based on preliminary figures, the 300 TSE index fell 26.92 points, or 0.79per cent, to close at 3,377.75. Declines led advances 292 to 243, volume of 38.2m shares was above the previous 28.8m, and trading value was CDollars 404m against CDollars 302.9m. Included in the volume were about 5m shares and 3.5m receipts of Nova Scotia Power, which closed at 10 1/2 .</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries BAT is up to its eyeballs in regulators. In UK financial services, it faces a new disclosure regime and the costs of untangling the personal pensions fiasco. In US financial services, the Californian insurance reform movement has come back to haunt it. In tobacco, where the US anti-smoking lobby is getting ever more vociferous, BAT is now fighting to save its Dollars 1bn bid for American Tobacco from an anti-trust challenge. A normal company might start to feel persecuted. But suppliers of cigarettes and life assurance do not expect to be loved. Not that the regulatory pressure is all bad. While the personal pensions disaster has done little to dent BAT's new life and investment business, it can only hasten consolidation in the industry and BAT has the money to spend on fire sales. On the cigarette side, the blocking of the attractive American Tobacco deal would be a blow. But at least the threat of an excise duty hike has receded for the moment. Nevertheless, the thickness of the regulatory jungle is tending to obscure BAT's healthy trading picture. The shares slipped yesterday despite the resilient financial services profits and strong recovery from the US cigarette business. At this rate, BAT will be more than justified in matching the 8 per cent interim dividend increase at the final stage, so pushing the yield to 6.3 per cent. That looks cheap even by the standards of other tobacco stocks. Whether it takes full account of the regulatory and legal risks is another question.</p>

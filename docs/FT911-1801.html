			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Seoul to squeeze companies out of land speculation COMPANIES belonging to South Korea's largest business groups will be denied new bank credit from next Monday if they fail to dispose of idle land by then, according to a new set of measures aimed at curbing real estate speculation. The package of measures, the most stringent yet to be taken in the government's attempt to reduce speculation, followed an order by President Roh Tae Woo that economic ministers take all possible steps to force business groups to sell surplus land. Speculation in real estate has prompted sharp increases in land and rental prices in South Korea. It has also caused a widening in the gap between rich and poors, creating tensions. 'The measures show that we are serious about tackling the problem of wealth distribution and about bridging the gap between the haves and have nots,' said Mr Kim Hak Joon, senior chief assistant to the president for policy research. But the new package will further add to strains between the government and the chaebol, the large business groups which dominate the economy. Government-business relations have already been damaged by a government plan to encourage greater specialisation by the highly diversified big business groups. Under the plan, to be implemented from June, each group will select three companies as core business groups. These companies will be freed from existing credit controls. According to the measures announced yesterday, however, the number of core businesses could be further reduced for companies which do not sell their idle land. The economic planning board, the top economic ministry, said groups which do not dispose of idle land will be restricted to just one core business. Last year, the government listed 57.44m pyong (189.55m square metres) of land owned by 48 conglomerates as non-business land. They ordered the conglomerates to sell the land by May 4 this year. But as of Tuesday, only 34.57m pyong, or 60.2 per cent of the land, had been disposed of. Under the anti-speculation measures, 38 subsidiaries of 21 business groups will be denied new credit from Monday. The affected groups include, Hyundai, Korea's second biggest conglomerate, and Daewoo, the fourth largest. In addition, 17 business groups will be restricted to one core business unless they dispose of excess real estate by the end of May. These groups also include Daewoo and Hyundai.</p>

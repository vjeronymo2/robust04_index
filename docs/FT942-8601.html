			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Bonds: Fed decision on interest rates prompts rush of new issues The decision by the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates on Tuesday removed a significant uncertainty from the Eurobond market yesterday and encouraged the launch of a spate of issues in several currencies. However, there was a feeling that a lot of unwanted bonds were still cluttering up the system and until underwriters had cleared their books, the rush of new supply would have to wait. Credit Local de France, the triple-A rated French municipal financing agency, came back to the market for the second day running to raise Pounds 150m via a 10-year bond priced to yield 37 basis points above the equivalent gilt. Joint lead manager Samuel Montagu said the decision to plump for sterling had been prompted by good overseas and UK demand for the UK currency following the US rate rise. However, some syndicate managers said that the pricing on the bonds should have been set around the 'low 40s'. When the paper started to trade, the spread widened to 39 basis points over gilts. Frequent borrower Eurofima, the Swiss-based group which funds the purchase of railway rolling stock, launched its well-flagged French franc deal yesterday, raising FFr1bn through an offering of 10-year paper priced to yield 16 basis points above the equivalent French government bond. The bonds were taken up principally by continental and Japanese investors. Lead manager CCF said it was possible that the deal would be increased at a later date. Elsewhere, the Swiss franc sector was active with five deals amounting to the equivalent of Dollars 420m. Dealers said at least four more deals were in the pipeline, mainly from double-A and triple-A rated companies. European Investment Bank set the ball rolling when it issued a SFr200m bond maturing in June 2001. DSL Finance offered SFr100m of 10-year paper while Abbey National Treasury Services made a private placement of SFr100m of bonds maturing in December 1997. There were two further domestic deals by German banks which were thought to be swapping the proceeds into D-Marks. The Hungarian National Bank issued Sch1bn of seven-year paper while Bank Austria offered DM250m of similarly dated paper with attached warrants through Morgan Stanley.</p>

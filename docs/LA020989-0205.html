			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ACTOR FOX WEDDING BRINGS THREATS  </P> <P> Michael J. Fox received 5,000 threatening letters from a woman who was upset he  got married, a district attorney investigator said today. The woman suspected  of writing the letters, Tina Marie Ledbetter, 26, was arrested in Westlake  Village last week but was released after she posted $100,000 bail, investigator  Gary Schram said.  </P> <P> Fox, 27, who won two Emmys for his portrayal of the insufferable conservative  son of liberal parents on the NBC series "Family Ties," married his former  co-star on the show, actress Tracy Pollan, last July. Fox began receiving  unsigned letters last February, said Al Albergate, spokesman for the Los  Angeles County District Attorney's office. "The letters threatened the lives of  Fox, his wife and their yet-to-be-born child," Albergate said.  </P></p>

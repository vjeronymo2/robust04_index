			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Business and the Environment: Heads down - Who is responsible for the pollution caused by abandoned mines Pollution from the Wheal Jane tin mine in Cornwall - where 80m gallons of water contaminated with toxic metals spewed into the River Carnon for several weeks - has highlighted the environmental problems caused by abandoned mines. The National Rivers Authority, the UK's pollution watchdog for rivers, is worried about the dozens of abandoned coal mines where rising waters in the old workings are polluting rivers in South Wales and Yorkshire. The NRA says that in Yorkshire there are 36 significant discharges from disused coal workings causing serious pollution to 40 kilometres of river. The capital cost of treating the 10 most serious discharges in Yorkshire is estimated to be more than Pounds 10m. In addition, there would be substantial operating costs. The question of who pays 'remains to be determined' says the NRA. Pollution at Wheal Jane turned the river and the estuary leading up to Falmouth a rusty red, halting water sports and endangering oyster beds and fish. The NRA has been carrying out the clean-up and working on long-term solutions for preventing a recurrence. The cost of these operations is expected to be in excess of Pounds 1m - some estimates put it at Pounds 3m. Although the NRA works on the principle that 'the polluter pays', it seems impossible to apply it in incidents of this kind. The Water Resources Act of 1991 says that those responsible for polluting rivers can be prosecuted and the NRA can recover from the polluter the costs of cleaning up. But abandoned mines are specifically exempted from the clause. The Department of the Environment says that this is because many of them are so ancient that it would be impossible to discover the original owners. There is also the difficulty in proving that the water comes from a specific mine. These areas are usually riddled with old workings and the flood waters may mingle to come out at one point. Environmentalists are pressing for the law to be changed and companies which abandon mines made liable for pollution from them. Liana Stupples, water campaigner for Friends of the Earth, says there is a 'yawning gap' in the law. Such a change would make life difficult for British Coal. It would mean a heavy financial liability which could deter investors if, as promised, British Coal is privatised by a Conservative administration after the upcoming general election. As long ago as 1981 the Royal Commission on Coal and the Environment, the Flowers Report, recommended that the costs of remedial action for existing mines abandoned by the National Coal Board (the predecessor of British Coal) be met by central government. But it said that the costs of pollution from any coal mines abandoned in the future should be met by the Coal Board. The all-party Welsh Affairs Committee of the House of Commons has just started a new investigation into the problem in South Wales where more than a dozen abandoned coal mines are causing pollution. The Welsh Region of the National Rivers Authority is carrying out a two-year study costing Pounds 100,000 which is funded jointly with the BOC Foundation for the Environment and Community. It will examine the River Pelena in West Glamorgan, the main tributary of the River Afan which flows into Swansea Bay at Port Talbot. The aim is to find 'the best and most simple way of preventing the polluted water from killing our rivers'. David Walker, the NRA's environment and quality manager for Wales, says that acidic discharges from old coal mines contain high concentrations of dissolved iron. 'A clear stream can turn a vivid orange and the bed coated with iron oxides stifling life and rendering it almost fishless,' he says. Gareth Wardell, Labour MP for Gower and chairman of the Welsh Affairs Committee, said the situation is 'very, very bad' and that the pollution could change the entire ecology along the rivers. 'There is no doubt that the law has to be changed,' he said. The foundation, established by BOC with Pounds 1m to help clean up pollution, is also sponsoring research into coal mine pollution on the Little Don river near Sheffield. There have been numerous public complaints and trout have been killed in some Yorkshire rivers. The problem is most severe in the River Calder near Tormoden, in the Don and Little Don near Sheffield and the Rother and its tributaries near Chesterfield. At the Wheal Jane abandoned tin mine the polluted water has been controlled and is being pumped out into a dam for treatment. So far the NRA has spent Pounds 100,000 containing the incident. Carnon Consolidated, which bought the mine from RTZ in a management buyout, made a loss in 1990 but broke even in 1991. It is not in a position to pay big bills and, in any event, denies liability. There are about 50 other old tin mines in the Carnon Valley area and water from them could have come out through the Wheal Jane outlet. 'I do not feel we should pay for the clean up,' says Kevin Ross, managing director of Carnon Consolidated. 'I do not accept that we are responsible for a history which has left us with all the other old tin mines. We are not flush with cash but we will do whatever is within our capacity to help.' Peter Maxted, local spokesman for Friends of the Earth, says the flooding at Wheal Jane was a tragic accident which should never have happened. FoE and other local organisations are pressing for a public inquiry. 'It is very frightening,' said Doris Ansari, Truro's Liberal Democrat councillor on Cornwall County Council. 'We do not know what the long-term effects will be.'</p>

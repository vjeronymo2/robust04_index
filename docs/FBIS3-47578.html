			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii on Friday [14 January] denied reports that the Finance  Ministry will compile a draft budget for fiscal 1994 on February  5.    Speaking at a regularly scheduled news conference, Fujii  said  he has not heard about a specific schedule for next year's  national budget.    Major newspapers reported the ruling coalition parties, at  Thursday's meeting of their leaders in charge of policy affairs,  decided to announce a tax reform plan for next year on February  3 and the Finance Ministry's draft budget two days later.    The ministry wants to begin compiling the next year's budget  "as soon as possible" while closely watching developments in  Diet debate over political reform bills, Fujii said.    Fujii denied the United States has proposed holding a  ministerial meeting as a way to break through stalled  "framework" trade talks with Japan.    The comment came after U.S. Trade Representative Mickey  Kantor on Wednesday recommended holding such a meeting between  the two countries before U.S. President Bill Clinton and  Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meet in Washington on  February 11.</p>

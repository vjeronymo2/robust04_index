			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRATEFUL TO SUPERVISORS  </P> <P> I wish to publicly express gratitude to Supervisors Mike Antonovich, Pete  Schabarum, and Deane Dana for denying a petitioner's request for a zoning  change at the Lost Hills Business Center.  </P> <P> Their denial of the change prevented a defense contractor from opening a  gyroscope-manufacturing business in which hazardous chemicals, gases and toxic  wastes would have been stored near homes and A.E. Wright Middle School, where  1,250 students are enrolled.  </P> <P> I want to thank the supervisors for their insight in recognizing the potential  risks this change represented and their wisdom in denying the petitioner's  request.  </P> <P> SHARON BROWN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P> <P> Brown is president of A.E. Wright Middle School Parent-Faculty Club  </P></p>

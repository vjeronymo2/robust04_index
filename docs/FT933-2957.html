			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Survey of Relaunching the Ruhr (4): A fight for survival WITH German coal mines reducing their output, the medium-sized companies which produce mining equipment in the Ruhr are set for a fight for survival, writes Ariane Genillard. One move to boost business has been to establish a consortium to sell mining equipment in Russia. But in order to solve the problem of the Russian companies' lack of hard currency, a barter deal will be brokered by Raab Karcher, the diversified trading arm of Veba, the Dusseldorf-based energy group. Raab Karcher, which had a turnover of DM10.5bn in 1992, is interested in developing business links in the former Soviet republics. It has recently signed a contract to import 350,000 tonnes of coal from the Karagandaugol mine in Kazakhstan. Proceeds from coal sales, to be marketed mostly in Germany, the UK and France, will partially go toward repaying the German enterprises delivering mining equipment in Russia. The barter deal, which will be partially financed with subsidies from the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, aims to give a boost to small mining equipment producers by opening new markets for them in eastern Europe. Manufacturers of mining equipment and spare parts are struggling to cope with falling orders as German mines plan to reduce hard coal capacity from the current 65.5m tonnes output to an estimated 50m tonnes by the year 2005. For Raab Karcher, the local market for imported coal could grow, however. German utilities and steel groups are contractually obliged to buy coal from the Ruhr valley at the subsidised price of DM288. Meanwhile, imports of hard coal, which last year reached 14m tonnes, can be sold to smaller industrial users at prices ranging between DM70 and DM80 - a market which Raab Karcher hopes to tap into.</p>

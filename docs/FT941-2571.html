			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Spring snow is a grey area - Skiing The snow in lower Austria is melting fast: I have just enjoyed a great day's skiing in Kitzbuhel, but it is impossible to ski all the way down the Hahnenkamm without hitting patches of mud. Temperatures began to rise a couple of weeks ago. Christian Berger, tourist director for the Soll area, said: 'Until 2 weeks ago we had wonderful conditions even though this was the warmest winter for 100 years. But last week the temperatures were higher than in Turkey or Greece. It was 25'C in Innsbruk and even 21'C up here in the mountains.' Now, there is virtually no snow - slushy or otherwise in some low-lying villages. When we drove past Hopfgarten on the other side of the mountain from Soll, a popular haunt with British skiers, the lack of snow was plain for all to see. My plans to ski down from Soll have melted along with it. But then the pistes down to Hopfgarten are traditionally the first to lose their snow. The conditions alarmed a dozen or more members of the Allegany Ski Club from Maryland. They arrived from the US a week ago for what they were hoping would be 'skiing like they have in the Rockies'. They were shocked to see so many green fields basking in so much sunshine. Mike Fetchero, the organiser, found himself under siege from his group, most on their first skiing trip to Europe. 'It's a long way to come for Florida-type weather,' he said. 'I admit that most of the group was upset by the spring-like conditions, but by taking a two-hour bus-ride up the Stubei glacier, we've had some good skiing. And we've met so many nice people and enjoyed such good sight-seeing that it doesn't really matter.' But this does not mean Austria has no snow. The ski club did not really need to bus to Stubei, one of seven Austrian glacier areas which currently report good snow, and which manage year-round skiing. Kitzbuhel still has plenty of good skiing between Jochberg and Pass Thurn, and although you can no longer ski from Soll to Hopfgarten, you can still get to Brixen, Westendorf or Scheffau. It is just that conditions are more than a little spring-like. 'It is spring on Monday after all,' said Marion Telsnig at the Austrian Tourist Office in London. 'The conditions are good,' she said, 'for the time of year. The problem with British skiers is that they expect to ski from 8am until the lifts close every day. The Austrians are a little more laid back about it. They realise that in springtime, you ski till lunchtime and then - when the snow gets a little sticky - you do something else.' Whatever the official line, skiers are entitled to expect decentish skiing in the first part of March, and this time last year they had it even here in low-lying Kitzbuhel. But this year, both Austria's and Italy's lower slopes are becoming bare earlier. France, on the other hand, with higher skiing areas, is still reporting great skiing. Austria itself still has good snow on both upper and lower slopes in its stalwart traditional high-spots of Ischgl, Obergurgl and St Anton. Whether you call it slushy, spring-like, good, or excellent, the quality of skiing in Austria's lower resorts in middle to late March is something of a grey area. But not really a white one. Meanwhile, out of my window I can see it is snowing again - not enough to whiten the lower slopes, but a handy sprinkling higher up. If it carries on, spring might have to wait after all.

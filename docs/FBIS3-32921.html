			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 15 Feb (DPA) --  In the past few hours, Chiapas peasants have occupied several  ranches and a municipal mayor's office, within the framework of  growing social unrest which is shaking this state of  southeastern Mexico, the locale of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN] guerrilla revolt since 1 January.    Members of the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization  (Organizacion Campesina Emiliano Zapata--OCEZ), who belong to  the pro-government Ayala Plan National Coordinating Board  (OCEZ/CNPA), occupied the mayor's office in Chanal Municipality,  and demanded the dismissal of local authorities who they claim  are corrupt.    Peasants and town residents have occupied another eight  mayor  offices in Chiapas for over a week. They are demanding the  construction of public works or the dismissal of municipal  authorities.    In Chilon, another Chiapas municipality, some 600 peasants  peacefully occupied 18 farms encompassing 3,000 hectares. They  are claiming property rights to the land, while the National  Coordinating Board of Indian Peoples (Coordinadora Nacional de  Pueblos Indios--CNPI) did the same thing on 11 farms  encompassing 14,000 hectares in Bachajon.    Oscar Romeo Perez Cordova, a member of the Chilono Attorney  General's Office, said he has received at least 18 complaints of  land occupations from the land owners daily.    The CNPI declared, for its part, that the lands occupied in  Bachajon belong to its members, who were stripped of their land  by ranchers and cattlemen of the region.    The social unrest in Chiapas lies within the framework of  the  armed revolt of the EZLN, which in a recent communique urged the  people to oust all the municipality mayors claiming they are  illegitimate.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Poll in Dominican Republic 'tainted' Foreign observers monitoring the Dominican Republic's presidential election have concluded that there were widespread irregularities. The observers said there are indications of a deliberate effort to tamper with the election, held on Monday. Mr Steven Solarz, a US former congressmen and a member of the observers' team, said that thousands of Dominicans had been denied a vote because their names were not on electoral rolls. The observers believe that these were deliberately excluded, he added. 'It may be that these irregularities have changed the result of the election,' he said. The observers said that a disproportionate number of people disenfranchised were supporters of opposition parties. Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, leader of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, who is aiming to become the country's first black president, has charged that 150,000 to 200,000 people were denied a vote on Monday, and that most of these were his party's supporters. Tension rose in the Dominican Republic yesterday as the electoral board rejected a request by Mr Pena Gomez for a halt in the count and for an investigation of his charges against the ruling party. Military patrols in Santo Domingo, the capital, and in other cities were increased and many Dominicans stayed home, fearing violence between party factions. Mr Pena Gomez's allegations that the Social Christian Reform Party of President Joaqun Balaguer, had perpetrated a fraud in the election, have been rejected by the 87-year-old president, who is seeking a seventh term. Mr Balaguer, claiming victory yesterday, said he had confidence in the board and that the voting had been 'clean and orderly.' The board's latest returns indicate that, with 92 per cent of the vote counted, Mr Balaguer had a lead of only 22,000 over Mr Pena Gomez. About 3.3m million people were entitled to vote. It is not known when the electoral board will formally declare a winner. The result of the 1990 election, narrowly won by Mr Balaguer amid charges of fraud by opposition parties, was announced two months after election day.</p>

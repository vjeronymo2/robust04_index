			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Personal pension sales hit by fears over mis-selling The number of people taking out single premium personal pension policies fell sharply in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period of 1993. Figures released by the Association of British Insurers suggest sales have been hit by widespread concern over the possible mis-selling of personal pensions to people transferring a lump sum from a pension scheme run by a former employer. Last December, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, launched a review of pension transfer business, after publishing a pilot study which suggested a majority of pension transfers failed to meet regulators' requirements. The ABI figures show that numbers of single premium pensions sold fell from 166,000 in the first quarter of 1993, to 110,000 in the first three months of this year. 'Pensions may well be reflecting the uncertainty of transacting business in the transfer market in the light of the current SIB review,' the ABI said. However, comparison of the two quarters showed the impact on premium income to the life companies was not substantial. Excluding Department of Social Security rebates and incentives, new single premium pension income fell only by about 7 per cent, from Pounds 1.21bn to Pounds 1.12bn. The pension figures come against a background of a general fall in new life and pensions business. New annual premium income from life insurance and annuities fell by 9 per cent from Pounds 417m in the first quarter of 1993 to Pounds 378m in the first three months of this year. Even single premium income in these areas was down slightly to Pounds 2.5bn. Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of the ABI, said life and pensions products had faced strong competition from other forms of savings, such as personal equity plans, where investors had to take up entitlements before the end of the tax year. The SIB has already issued guidance intended to improve the standards of selling in personal pensions business. Life policies price war, Page 9</p>

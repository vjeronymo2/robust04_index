			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Bank steps up plea for independence MR RUPERT Pennant-Rea, deputy governor of the Bank of England, yesterday stepped up the Bank's campaign to take control of interest rates. He said this would improve the UK's inflation record and help businesses and householders plan their finances on a long-term basis. Mr Pennant-Rea, giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, said if the government agreed to give the Bank responsibility for monetary policy it could be made accountable to parliament 'in an open and transparent way'. Mr Pennant-Rea said Britain's poor inflation record since the 1940s was 'a consequence of having a non-independent central bank'. The government should re-constitute the Bank as an 'executive agency' charged with 'pursuing price stability', so removing political pressures from the job of setting interest rates. Control over setting interest rates would put the Bank in a stronger position to influence the government over fiscal policy than the present role where it advises the chancellor. This is because the Treasury would be less capable of allowing a large fiscal deficit to be eroded over time by inflation after a period of low interest rates. While Mr Eddie George, Bank governor, has already suggested making the Bank independent in monetary policy, Mr Pennant-Rea yesterday took the argument a step further by sketching out how the arrangement would work. Government ministers, however, are not convinced it would benefit the economy. The Bank's case may be helped by the committee's report on its role, due early next month. Mr John Watts, the committee's chairman, said after yesterday's hearing that its members were 'moving in the direction' of suggesting Bank independence. Mr Pennant-Rea said it would be 'undesirable' to give the Bank control of interest rates without involvement by politicians. So the broad statutory requirement over price stability should be supplemented by a specific strategic objective from 'government and parliament' to keep inflation within a specific band, for instance between zero and 2 per cent. Mr Pennant-Rea said this target could be changed depending on economic circumstances. The government's current objective for underlying inflation is to keep this between 1 per cent and 4 per cent. The deputy governor shrugged off a criticism from Mr Quentin Davies, a committee member, that by changing the inflation target government and parliament could loosen the Bank's grip on monetary policy. After the hearing Mr Pennant-Rea said letting politicians alter the target would be 'prudent'. They would not be able to change it very much because this would infringe the Bank's statutory responsibilities.</p>

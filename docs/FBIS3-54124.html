			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that he has  instructed the Israeli delegation to the talks with Syria to  verify whether both countries were negotiating a peace agreement  that would stand alone or one that was linked to another accord  on a different track. Rabin noted that the United States  believed that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was showing signs  of moderation and moving closer toward Israel's interpretation  of peace. Yet Syria had not changed its position one iota on  the price Israel would have to pay in exchange for a peace  agreement. The Syrians were demanding a full withdrawal and as  far as Damascus was concerned this was non-negotiable.    As for the negotiations with the PLO, Mr. Rabin explained  that the PLO had made several attempts to back out of certain  issues, mainly in the field of security, that had already been  agreed upon in the Declaration of Principles. However, in  Rabin's assessment, the Palestinians had realized that Israel  was adamant in its position regarding internal and external  security. Therefore, Rabin said, one could say that a certain  degree of progress had been made recently.    Moving on to the issue of the border crossings, Rabin said  that Israel insisted on having the right to examine every person  crossing the border in what he called a sterile room, manned  exclusively by Israelis. There would be a Palestinian presence  at the border terminal, but Israel would be responsible for the  passageway between the bridge and the border terminals. Our  correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Prime Minister Rabin was  speaking at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.</p>

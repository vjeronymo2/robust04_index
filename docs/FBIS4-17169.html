			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Provincial Chronicle" rubric] </F>   [Text] Yakutsk -- Yakutia's State Assembly has declined to  discuss the draft agreement on reaching civil accord in Russia.  The deputies motivated their decision by their unwillingness to  become involved in political gambles at the top. In their  opinion, the nationally approved Constitution of Russia may  serve the goals of civil accord quite well.</p>

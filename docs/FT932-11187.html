			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Government Bonds: Rally in UK gilts as prices increase by up to half a point UK GOVERNMENT bond prices bounced by as much as half a point yesterday, prompting suggestions that the market had fallen too far in reaction to early signs of economic recovery. The gains came as the gilts market reopened after Monday's public holiday. While bonds with maturities up to 10 years rose by between a quarter and a third of a point, the biggest gains came in the longest-dated issues, implying that the buying was driven by UK institutions rather than foreign investors. This helped to reverse part of the steepening of the UK yield curve apparent in recent weeks. Ten-year bond yields had risen by around 40 basis points during April, half of that in the last week, pushing up the yield spread over German government bonds to nearly 150 basis points. Yesterday's move was 'largely a technical response' to this price fall, demonstrating that underlying demand for gilts remained firm, said Mr Simon Briscoe, an economist at Greenwell Montagu. The June long gilts future contract ended the day at around 104 3/16 , up from 103 31/32 , on moderate volume of nearly 30,000 contracts traded. GERMAN government bonds also rose after last week's losses, although traders and economists generally remained pessimistic about the prospects for long-dated bunds in the weeks ahead. The positive mood in the market yesterday was due in part to the announcement that DM3bn of 10-year federal government bonds with a new coupon of 6.75 per cent had been sold, in line with market expectations. A similar amount is expected to be sold at auction today. Economic data in the next few days, including unemployment figures by the end of the week, are expected to give further support to the market in the short term. The Bundesbank is also generally expected to use today's sale of repurchase agreements to shave a further 5 to 10 basis points off the key official money market rate, lending further support to the market. However, yesterday's moves did not shake the widely-held belief that longer-dated bunds could lose ground in the coming weeks, and that shorter-dated paper offers the best opportunity for gains. The June bund futures contract on Liffe ended the day close to where it began, at 94.80, having lost ground to 94.56 at one stage. MOST other European bond markets continued to outperform the bund market, repeating last week's experience, as investors were reported to be continuing to look to switch from Germany into higher-yielding markets. Ten-year French bonds gained a quarter of a point, even though the June 'notionnel' futures contract ended the day down at 117.24 from 117.36 on nearly 140,000 contracts. Italian bonds gained a third and Spanish bonds a half, with Scandinavian markets also benefiting from the repositioning away from the D-Mark. US TREASURY prices rose sharply at the long end yesterday as speculation intensified about the outcome of the Treasury's study into the debt mix, which is due later today. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  25/32 at 104 1/4 , yielding 6.787 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/4 , to yield 3.727 per cent. Trading was thin throughout the day as the market awaited news of the Treasury's study into whether it should reduce future issues of the long bond and increase issues of shorter-dated paper. The moves would be made to cut the government's interest costs. There was considerable speculation yesterday about the findings of the debt-mix study, including suggestions that the Treasury might scrap some issues of the 30-year bonds. Prices rose strongly yesterday afternoon after the Treasury announced plans to issue more bills in its weekly auctions, a move that dealers assumed meant issuance of the long bond would be cut substantially.</p>

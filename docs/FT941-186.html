			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / 'Misleading' Maxwell receiver reprimanded A leading insolvency practitioner charged with recovering assets belonging to Robert Maxwell was yesterday severely criticised by the Commons social security committee for allegedly misleading MPs. Mr Peter Phillips of Buchler Phillips, who is the receiver of the Maxwell personal estate, over-emphasised potential recoveries in a way which allowed his firm to 'maximise its fee income and to garner more publicity opportunities', the committee says in a report published yesterday. It claims that he had provided estimates of gross potential realisations from the estate of more than Pounds 8.7m, when he knew the figure he would be able to collect was far smaller. The scathing report is the most critical yet issued by the committee, chaired by Labour MP Mr Frank Field, which began examining the operation of pension funds in July 1991 after the collapse of the Maxwell business empire. The report concludes that the personal estate of Mr Maxwell should now be declared insolvent and a trustee in bankruptcy appointed. It urges that this job should not be given to Mr Phillips. Mr Phillips yesterday said he was 'outraged' at the report. 'I can only view this as a publicity-seeking exercise from a committee which sadly, after months of investigation, has produced nothing of any impact,' he said in a statement. 'Mr Field has continually and deliberately ignored the facts I have presented to him. With hindsight I now regret the enormous amount of time I have spent helping the committee.' The report says that Mr Phillips and his lawyers, Nabarro Nathanson, have charged more in fees - at Pounds 1.1m - than the total value of the Maxwell assets that he will be able to recover. It says that his firm's and his lawyers' average hourly fees - at Pounds 167 and Pounds 193 respectively - are the highest rates among the four sets of Maxwell insolvency practitioners, and highlights that he charged a higher proportion of his work at partner rates than the other firms. Mr Phillips said the work he was carrying out needed more experienced staffing, and stressed that he had recovered assets totalling more than Pounds 5.3m, much of which had then been claimed by other parties. Members of the committee were irritated by early discussions they held with Mr Phillips at which they believe they were misled over the amount of money that he would be able to realise. Mr Neil Cooper, of accountants Robson Rhodes, liquidator of the Maxwell-controlled fund manager Bishopsgate Investment Management, said: 'There remain a number of questions to be answered on Maxwell to do with banking, regulation, the duties of auditors and the like. I think they are much more important than this sort of thing.'</p>

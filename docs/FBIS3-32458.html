			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The principal drug cartels are said to be financing  the election campaigns of some candidates for the Congress,  especially in Cauca Department.    The allegation about the influence of hot money [dinero  caliente] in the political campaigns was made by Juan Jose Chaux  Mosquera, currently a member of the House of Representatives.    The Liberal politician spoke with Fernando Garcia, this  paper's correspondent in Popayan, and told him that in Cauca  dirty money is already circulating in politics.    He lamented that several candidates for public office are  accepting money from "friends of drug trafficking, which could  impede peaceful debate, since it will lead to political  corruption."    Although Chaux Mosquera did not reveal the list of persons  aspiring to congressional office who are allegedly receiving  financial backing from drug traffickers, he said it is easy to  identify them since they are handing out large sums of money in  northern Cauca.    In the halls of Congress there were insistent rumors during  the last weeks of legislative activity that relatives of persons  who have been linked to drug trafficking would be running for  congressional office, especially in the Atlantic Coast region.</p>

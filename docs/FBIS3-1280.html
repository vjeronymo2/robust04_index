Speaking at a press conference at South Africa's Ciskei  Embassy in King William's Town on Wednesday, leader of a  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] task force Mr Zam Titus  also said the SADF [South African Defense Force] was fully aware  of the situation in all parts of Ciskei and ready to take action  at a moment's notice.    He declined to say whether the SADF was already in the  territory.    He said he understood that Brig Gqozo was still at the  presidential palace in Bisho, but busy packing.    Earlier Ciskei's minister of foreign affairs, Mr Mickey  Webb,  said he had had a glass of grape juice with Brig Gqozo in the  palace that afternoon. "He's packing his suitcase. His wife is  arranging his belongings."    Mr Titus said Ciskei's ministers were no longer in power or  in control. "We will be talking to them tomorrow about how they  move out...they are out and that is the situation and that is  quite clear."    The TEC team met representatives of the territory's civil  servants on Wednesday evening and a follow-up meeting would be  arranged within the next fortnight.    The task force said in a statement after the meeting that a  process to look into the grievances of public servants had been  established.    Grievances already identified would be given urgent  attention.    A member of the TEC task force on the civil service, Philip  Dexter, said Ciskei government workers should not be concerned  about their pensions.    The task force was going to ensure "real transparency" on  issues such as this.    He said the safety of pensions was guaranteed in the  constitution -- the strongest guarantee one could get.    The new administration, headed by joint administrators Piet  Goosen and Rev Bongani Finca, would ensure that all civil  servants would have the right to join the union of their choice.    He said the TEC team would have to move into the government  offices in Bisho as soon as possible to establish a physical  presence there. On Thursday the team would be review the  positions of department heads.    Mr Titus said he would be in charge of reviewing the  territory's laws, in co-operation with a larger team. "For  starters we simply have to provide that all existing laws will  continue," he said. However, unjust laws would be changed.    The joint administrators of Ciskei would review Ciskei's  representation on the TEC.    Steps would be taken on Thursday to ensure a proper  inventory  of public property was compiled.    People asked Mr Titus whether stability could be restored to  Ciskei within two or three days. He was confident that the  territory was moving towards this situation. "We already have  the co-operation of everyone that matters. The TEC, working  hand in hand with the South African Government, are in effective  control of the situation."</p>

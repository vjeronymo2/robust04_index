			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Interest loss of Pounds 4.5m in port sell-offs criticised DELAYS DURING the privatisation of the first five trust ports cost the government at least Pounds 4.5m, the National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, says in a report today. Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, said although the five sales were completed by March last year, generating a Pounds 169m levy for the government, only Pounds 54.4m was paid to the Department of Transport at the time. The remaining Pounds 114.6m was left unpaid until February and March this year because of disagreements between the ports and the department over the expenses incurred. The interest lost, assuming simple Treasury bill rates, was at least Pounds 4.5m for the six months to last December alone. The office says the department should have sought legal advice on whether it had the right to require further interim payments, and it suggests changes in the process when further ports are privatised. Yet the office's general conclusion was that the department had been 'successful in this first stage of the privatisation of the trust ports'. It backed the controversial decision to sell the Tees and Hartlepool port authority to the second-highest bidder, Teesside Holdings, for Pounds 180m. Sir John repeated the department's judgment that to reject the port authority's recommendation solely in order to maximise the levy proceeds would be hard to justify. Tees and Hartlepool, Clyde, Forth, Medway and Tilbury all privatised voluntarily last year. They account for more than half the turnover of the 15 ports whose turnover exceeds Pounds 5m at 1991 prices. These ports can be forced to be sold to the private sector under the Ports Act 1991. The five privatisations took place before the act came into force. Gross proceeds from the sale of the five ports came to Pounds 380m. The government received Pounds 169m of the proceeds as statutory levy, while the cost of the sale amounted to Pounds 12.8m. The port authorities spent Pounds 9.6m of this, while Pounds 2.2m went to management and employee buy-out teams. The remaining Pounds 1m was paid to the department's advisers. The department's marketing produced a 'sound basis for competition', with the four tendered sales producing between six and 19 inquiries. The fifth port, Forth, was sold by flotation. However, Sir John said competition was limited in the final bidding for Clyde, where two of the three bids were unsatisfactorily low, and for Medway, where a withdrawal left only one bidder.

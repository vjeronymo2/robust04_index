			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Coal miners threaten strike Russian coal miners threatened yesterday to stage an all-out strike from April 13 that could deal a blow to the fragile economy and shake the government. About 500 miners' representatives from across the country adopted a resolution calling for an indefinite strike unless the government honoured a promise to pay money owed for salaries. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin had promised to grant the coal mining industry 1,200bn roubles (Pounds 465m) this month to cover salaries.</p>

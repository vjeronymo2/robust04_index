			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Brussels secures cut in regional aid for Germany THE European Commission has negotiated a substantial cut in German regional aid to the western parts of the country and west Berlin, in a move designed to attract more corporate investment to poorer EC states. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, announced yesterday that Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Bonn's economics minister, had agreed to reduce the coverage of regional aid in the former west Germany from the current level of 39 per cent of the population to 27 per cent this year. Special tax and investment preferences designed to draw companies to the former west Berlin would go by the end of 1994. Sir Leon, whose brief is to control state aid that distorts trade or investment within the EC, hailed the agreement as important to Community cohesion. 'We need to let aid to the poorer regions work to its full effect, and this can only be done by limiting the counter-attraction of the richer, central states of the Community.' Germany, unlike many of its EC partners, gives most of its aid in the form of regional, rather than sectoral, schemes. This regional aid has been running at Ecu4.5bn (Pounds 3.1bn) a year to the former West Germany, overwhelmingly to west Berlin and the Randgebiet (the zone along the old border). EC officials say that in the protracted negotiations with Bonn, which initially wanted to spread the aid cuts over seven years, they were helped by two factors. First, Bonn has been searching for savings to offset the large amounts of money it is spending on east Germany, which have Brussels' blessing. Second, what used to seem the darkest of depressed areas in the west has paled before the dereliction in much of the east. News of the reductions was greeted with caution in Bonn. An economics ministry official said the agreement would still have to be endorsed by the Bundestag, but he thought that it would pass largely unscathed. The business community in west Berlin has greeted the prospect of losing its subsidies with surprising equanimity. The main complaint has been the uncertainty over the timing, although the electronics group, SEL, did say when announcing 2,000 redundancies that the number might have to increase as a result of losing the Berlin benefits. The Bonn cabinet yesterday formally agreed to ban the sale of all products containing ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by 1995. Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister, said Germany was the first country to take such a decision, with the rest of the EC expected to follow in 1997.</p>

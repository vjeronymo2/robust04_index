			<p>Trafficking   <F P=102>   PY1106003994 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2354 GMT 8 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> PY1106003994 </F> <F P=104>  Madrid EFE </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Peru recommended today at the  plenum of the 24th OAS General Assembly that a link be  established between human rights, terrorism, and drug  trafficking.    Alejandro Leon Pazos, the Peruvian permanent OAS  representative, suggested that a new chapter of international  provisions on human rights take into account the true intensity  of the violence generated by terrorism and drug trafficking.    Leon stated that effective international measures of  condemnation should be adopted, and the appropriate sanctions  meted out to offenders, in order to eradicate terrorism and drug  trafficking.    The Peruvian delegate today addressed the delegates from the  34 OAS member states who are meeting this week in the Brazilian  Amazonian city of Belem, in Para State.    Leon noted that the recent Vienna Conference on Human Rights  regarded the various forms and manifestations of terrorist acts,  methods, and practices, as well as the nefarious ties existing  between terrorist agents and drug trafficking, as activities  aimed at destroying human rights, fundamental freedoms, and  democracy; and as activities that threaten the territorial  integrity and security of all states.    Leon added: "The international community must urgently  strengthen the indispensable cooperation measures aimed at both  preventing and fighting terrorism."    He added that the OAS "must clearly condemn terrorism as a  form of human right violation that affects our peoples, and  consequently it must act immediately and effectively to stop  this criminal scourge, instead of limiting ourselves to watching  the tragic consequences it brings to our nations."    The Peruvian Government is waging a war against Shining Path  terrorist guerrillas and to this end has adopted the death  penalty, thus violating an OAS convention.</p>

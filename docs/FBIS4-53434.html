			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 19 KYODO -- Japan and the United  States began an exploratory round of trade talks Thursday [19  May] aimed at breaking a three-month deadlock on how to widen  foreign access to the Japanese market and reducing Japan's vast  trade surplus.    The meeting came amid fresh government data that showed the  U.S. trade deficit with Japan jumped 25.4 percent in March to  5.80 billion dollars. The U.S. posted a record 59 billion  dollar deficit with Japan last year.    Both Japanese and U.S. officials were cautious in predicting  the outcome of the day's trade meeting at the Office of the U.S.  Trade Representative.    "We will not know anything until we meet," said Sozaburo  Okamatsu, Japan's vice trade minister for international affairs.    Okamatsu made the brief remark to reporters as he and  Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs,  entered the office.    The Americans sounded equally cautious.    "We will have to wait and see what the Japanese officials  bring," a senior U.S. official told reporters on condition of  anonymity Wednesday.    At stake is the fate of the accord the two countries  concluded in July last year to set up a new framework for  bilateral trade designed to widen the access of foreign goods to  Japan and reduce Japan's global trade surplus.    Negotiations on how to implement the terms of the framework  agreement broke down in February when Japan refused to accept  the U.S. definition on "objective criteria" for measuring  Japanese imports.    The rupture of the trade negotiations, which came at the  Feb.  11 summit in Washington between President Bill Clinton and then  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, shook financial markets and at  one point sent the U.S. dollar close to a record low against  the yen.    Clinton and other senior U.S. officials have since made what  appeared to be conciliatory remarks on bilateral trade ties, but  officials in Tokyo say they are uncertain about Washington's  intentions.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters  during a visit to Congress on Wednesday that the U.S. has not  budged.    "Our position is exactly as it was in February. It has not  changed at all," Kantor said.    Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs Lawrence  Summers, a member of the U.S. team involved in the trade talks  with Japan, also insisted that the U.S. has not changed its  position.    "I think (our) position has been consistent," Summers said  in  a separate meeting with reporters.    But Summers conceded that Washington will keep an eye on the  shaky political situation in Tokyo when U.S. officials sit at  the negotiating table with Japanese officials.    "Clearly, as we go forward in the negotiations, we have to  recognize the political situation in Japan, and that obviously  is one of the factors that goes into the strategy," he said.    While both Tokyo and Washington seem eager to get the  framework talks back on track by the time Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata meets Clinton at the Group of Seven (G-7) summit of  industrialized nations in Italy in early July, U.S. officials  say there is no deadline for a deal.    "We are not putting any artificial deadline on them. We  think that would be a mistake," a senior U.S. trade official  said.</p>

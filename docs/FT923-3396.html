			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Resilient Lisbon looks for selective growth - Portuguese equity performance The small Portuguese bolsa has been more resilient than many of its competitors to the pressures which have driven equities down this year. While share prices have fallen, the local market has performed better than most of its European counterparts. Analysts believe that it will continue to do so for the rest of this year, although investors will have to be more selective. The Banco Totta &amp; Acores (BTA) index rose by 5.1 per cent in the first six months ending June 30, out-performing most other European indices, including the FT-SE 100 which rose 1.1 per cent in the period; only Zurich, Paris, Frankfurt and Milan rose by more than Lisbon, according to Baring Securities. During the second quarter, the BTA index was among only four in Europe which bucked the trend of falling indices. Since June, the Portuguese market has been buffeted by domestic and international factors. Fears over the future of the EC, with uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the French Maastricht referendum on September 20, helped take the BTA index down to 1,971.9 on Thursday, still above its 1,869.6 year low of February 12, but against a peak of 2,156.4 on May 11. The market was also adversely affected by the flight out of the country in July of Mr Pedro Caldeira, a leading stockbroker, leaving behind him debts exceeding Esc 400m (Dollars 3.2m). The scandal, coming shortly after the suspension of two brokers for irregularities, has undermined investor confidence, though analysts believe it may have a salutary impact. There were positive factors. Interest rates, which had been declining slowly since the start of the year came down more abruptly in August when the central bank reduced its intervention rate twice within a week and announced plans to lift all capital controls by the end of the year. Dealers thought that more cuts were on the way, but analysts say that this will depend on clearer signals that inflation is falling. It is expected to be around 9 per cent this year, at the higher end of the 7-9 per cent range government forecast. On September 1, the authorities abolished the requirement for Portuguese companies which want to borrow in foreign currencies to deposit the equivalent of 25 per cent of the amount in escudos with the Bank of Portugal in an interest-free deposit. Companies hope that this will also help to push down Portuguese interest rates, thereby reducing the gap between domestic and international levels. 'This has big implications for companies with a high level of debt,' says one analyst. 'Their income side will benefit. For good companies which struggle under a heavy weight of financial charges, the fall in interest rates will have a very significant effect. Some companies could see their profits double as a result.' Interest rates for investors have declined markedly. Whereas they could get 14.5 per cent on six month money at the beginning of August, this is down to 11.5-12 per cent. 'The fall in fixed income yields will encourage investors towards the floating market, and that's good for the stock exchange,' says a stockbroker. In addition, the ongoing reform of the bolsa will raise market efficiency and transparency. Supervision has been tightened and the gradual expansion of continuous trading, along with the first effective steps to link the Lisbon and Oporto exchanges, will also help. But optimism has to be tempered with caution. 'Investors will have to be much more selective,' says a fund manager. 'It is increasingly important to look at sectors. For example, construction stocks are up by almost 25 per cent this year, but the overall index is down.' He believes that most financials will underperform selected industrial stocks as the fall in interest rates cuts into bank margins and profits. More than 50 per cent of the index consists of financial companies, so if their shares are depressed it drags the index down. Companies likely to do well are those involved in major modernisation and infrastructure projects. These include a new bridge over the Tagus from Lisbon, expansion of the Lisbon underground, several power plants and a cross-country gas pipeline, the renovation of the railways, new motorways to Spain, as well as major industrial investments in new factories such as the Ford-Volkswagen Dollars 2.8bn joint venture car plant in Setubal. All this activity will give work, not just to construction companies but also to manufacturers of a wide range of related products. Selected financial institutions such as Banco Comercial Portugues and Banco Portugues de Investimento, more adaptable to change, are expected to do well, while interest rate sensitive stocks such as Sonae could also benefit. The economy is expected to grow by about 2.5 per cent this year and is forecast to grow by 3 per cent in 1993, so, barring major international shocks, prospects look relatively positive. 'We've had a very unfavourable environment with high interest rates and a tight monetary policy. Now conditions are becoming more favourable,' says a stockbroker.</p>

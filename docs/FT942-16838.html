			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Rwanda PM and UN team die in rampage A spate of murder and pillaging in Rwanda yesterday claimed the lives of Ms Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, and at least 11 Belgian United Nations soldiers. Rampaging troops are also alleged to have killed 17 Jesuit priests at a religious centre, according to Radio France Internationale. The murders follow the death on Wednesday night of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana, president of the impoverished east African country, along with the president of neighbouring Burundi. Rwandan diplomats claim the two men were assassinated - their aircraft downed with rockets. Fierce fighting was going on in the Rwandan capital of Kigali yesterday, with the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) joining the fray and possibly attempting to wrest power from the army. UN officials said Rwanda's woman premier was abducted by presidential guards shortly after she left her home in Kigali. The soldiers disarmed her UN guards and in the confusion she escaped and took refuge in a UN compound. The presidential guards broke into the compound and dragged her away. The UN was later informed she was dead. In Washington, President Clinton said Ms Uwilingiyamana had been 'sought out and murdered' by Rwandan security forces. A UN official said presidential guards earlier disarmed 13 Belgian peacekeepers sent to investigate the presidents' crash at the airport. 'We have now recovered 11 bodies. Two are still unaccounted for. They were dead from bullet wounds. You can call it an execution,' the UN spokesman said. It was not clear if the presidential guards were acting under orders from some authority or were rogue elements. The Belgian troops were part of the 2,500-strong, 20-nation UN mission. Three Rwandan cabinet ministers are believed to have been abducted, also by the presidential guard, and Radio France Internationale said at least one had been killed. Gen Habyarimana and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi died as they were flying back from regional peace talks in Tanzania. All on board their aircraft were killed, reportedly including two Burundi ministers, five senior Rwandan officials including the army chief of staff and the aircraft's French crew. For years both Rwanda and Burundi have seen brutal clashes between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The killing of the two presidents has immediately derailed Rwanda's UN-sponsored peace process, already under strain. A three-year civil war waged by the Tutsi-led RPF ended with a peace agreement last year. But President Habyarimana, a Hutu, who took power in a 1973 coup, has caused some anger by delaying formation of a national government under a power-sharing deal with the RPF. Even before Gen Habyarimana's assassination, Rwanda was tense. Two government ministers had been hacked to death. The bankrupt government was weighed down by a drought and by an influx of 400,000 refugees from tribal killings in Burundi. Gen Habyarimana's death has left a power vacuum in Rwanda. Army troops, presidential guards, gendarmes and rebels were all reported to be involved in violence in Kigali. In Nairobi, Mr Habi Mana, the Rwandan ambassador, blamed the death of the two presidents on the rebel RPF. 'The plane was blown up by a Soviet-made Sam-7 missile, which have been used by the RPF in the past,' he claimed. 'The Rwandese army has no Soviet military equipment.' But the RPF denied it was involved in the attack. 'The plane was shot down from the airport base, which is controlled by the gendarmerie. The area is heavily guarded and totally out of bounds to the RPF,' Mr Paul Dusaidi of RPF said in New York. Diplomats believe Gen Habyarimana may have been the victim of a power struggle between rival military factions. Belgium, the former colonial power in both Burundi abnd Rwanda, said after an emergency cabinet meeting last night it planned to protect its nationals in Rwanda, but gave no details. The UN Security Council last night denounced the violence in Rwanda, but took no decision on whether to leave UN peacekeepers in place.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Remote, populous and poor  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RWANDA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AREA AND PEOPLE 26,340 sq km (10,170 sq m) 8.2m population (1992), of which: About 85% are Hutu, a farming people, with rest mainly Tutsi, semi-nomadic herdsmen, plus some Twa, a group related to Pygmy people of Zaire 120,000 live in the capital Kigali.

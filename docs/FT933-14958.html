			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / The looming crisis in industrial country public debt What cannot continue will not do so. The accumulation of public sector debt by the governments of the industrial countries will have to stop. The question is how will it be stopped and when. Over the past quarter century, the ratio of aggregate gross public debt to gross domestic product in OECD countries has risen from a little under 40 per cent, to 68 per cent (see chart). In only two brief periods has the ratio fallen: during the inflationary economic expansion of the early 1970s and again during the expansion of the second half of the 1980s. Unfortunately, the rise in the debt ratio during recessions has more than offset the paltry declines during the expansions. No wonder the June OECD Economic Outlook remarks wryly on the need to avoid 'the kind of mistake made in the late 1980s when some of the unexpected buoyancy of public revenues associated with above-average growth was used to reduce tax rates rather than to ensure greater fiscal consolidation and to reduce debt.' True, net public debt is not as daunting as gross public debt: for 1994 the OECD forecasts the former at 39 per cent. The net debt ratio has not risen as much either, by 9 percentage points between 1984 and 1994, against 14 percentage points for gross debt. But the trend is similarly adverse. Of the seven industrial countries whose heads of government met in Tokyo last week, only Japan had managed a significant improvement in its public debt postion between 1984 and 1994. Belgium and Italy already have outstanding net public debt greater than their GDPs. Particularly important, in view of the country's size, is the US deterioration, from a net public sector debt ratio of 24.9 per cent in 1984 to the 40.7 per cent forecast for next year. High real interest rates put all debtors, including governments, on a treadmill. Since the beginning of the 1980s, long-term real interest rates have averaged between 4 and 7 per cent, says the OECD, with short-term rates little lower. In the stable 1960s, by contrast, real interest rates were 1 to 3 per cent. Consequently, real interest rates have been well above underlying rates of economic growth for a long time. Even though estimated long-term real interest rates have recently fallen, they remain higher than rates of economic growth, inevitably so during a recession. The OECD explains these high real interest rates by: the fiscal and monetary policy mix, with fiscal deficits, in particular, averaging 3 per cent of GDP since the mid-1970s; investor demand for a premium against inflation risk, particularly important in the early 1980s; and the liberalisation and globalisation of capital markets. If real interest rates on public debt exceed the economy's likely growth rate, as they have recently done, governments must run a primary fiscal surplus - an excess of revenue over non-interest expenditure - if the ratio of debt to GDP is to be kept stable. Should they run large primary deficits during a recession, they must run offsetting surpluses thereafter. The task can be daunting. Mr Major's government is now running a primary deficit of 5.7 per cent of GDP. This is two percentage points larger than the surplus in 1988. The danger is of a vicious circle from deficits to interest rates and back again. If governments fail to run large enough primary surpluses, global real interest rates tend to rise. As public debt increases, the fear of debt crises also pushes up risk premiums in interest rates. Unsurprisingly, Italy is the only major industrial country whose estimated long-term real interest rates, at 6 per cent, are above their 1980-92 average, despite recession. Governments that borrow in their own currencies do not default. They inflate. At present, investors are feeling tolerant towards most OECD governments. Whether they continue to do so depends less on whether current deficits are cyclical or structural, which nobody knows, and rather more on when investors think they will end. Governments that expect creditors to be infinitely forbearing are due for a shock.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------      INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985.

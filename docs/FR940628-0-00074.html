			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One operator felt pipe should be excluded from hydrostatic testing under &sect;195.304(b) to the same extent as other components. The operator said that hydrostatically testing short sections of mill tested pipe is duplicative, costly, and not needed for safety. Although the NPRM did not propose to alter the existing requirement that replacement sections of pipe of any length must be hydrostatically tested to part 195 standards before operation, we do not agree with this commenter's contention. Normal pipe mill tests are not duplicative of part 195 tests, and are not a proven safe alternative to part 195 requirements. However, for short sections of replacement pipe, part 195 test requirements could be met anywhere, including, by prior arrangement with the operator, in the pipe mill. So if an operator wishes to avoid field testing of short replacement sections of pipe, it only needs to assure that the mill tests of those sections were done in accordance with part 195 test requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.406&blank;Maximum operating pressure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The changes to &sect;195.406 are discussed supra under &sect;195.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 195.412&blank;Inspection of rights-of-way and crossings under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> navigable waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 195.412(a) requires an operator, at intervals not exceeding 3 weeks, but at least 26 times each calendar year, to inspect the surface conditions on or adjacent to each pipeline right-of-way. Because some surface condition activities that affect the safety and operation of pipelines are more visible from aerial patrols than from walking or driving the right-of-way, RSPA proposed that the section be changed to clarify that aerial patrols are an optional method of compliance. No comments were received regarding the change and the THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the change (5 members did not vote). Accordingly, the change to &sect;195.412(a) is adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section (b) requires operators, at intervals not exceeding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 years, to inspect each crossing under a navigable waterway (except offshore) to determine the condition of the crossing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the inspection is to look for any damage, unanticipated loading, or loss of protection that could threaten the safety of the pipeline. We stated in the NPRM that bored crossings are usually so deep that there is little likelihood the pipeline could be affected by waterway-related events, such as scouring or anchor dragging. We proposed to add an exception to &sect;195.412(b) to cover bored crossings that are too deep to be subject to waterway-related damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the rule (5 members did not vote). However, a state pipeline agency suggested the existing regulation be retained. The agency stated that a pipeline operator cannot be 100 percent sure a bored crossing is so deep it cannot be affected as stated. RSPA received four additional comments, three of which expressed an opinion that the phrase ``too deep to anticipate damage from waterway conditions or vessel traffic'' is vague and inappropriate. The other commenter said the proposal is unduly restrictive and should be refocused from bored crossings to a more generic performance standard potentially including all crossings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the comments received, RSPA agrees with those who opined that ``too deep to anticipate damage from waterway conditions or vessel traffic'' is too vague. In the absence of a recognized standard on the subject, it is too speculative to judge when bored crossings are buried at a sufficient depth to be safe from damage by external forces. Therefore, it is in the interest of public safety that the current rule requiring inspection at intervals not exceeding 5 years be retained. Accordingly, the proposed change to &sect;195.412(b) is not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Section 195.416&blank;External Corrosion Control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 195.416(a) states that each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, conduct tests on each underground facility that is under cathodic protection to determine whether protection is adequate. RSPA is clarifying the rule to reduce any misunderstanding regarding what is meant by ``underground.'' The word ``underground'' in this paragraph has meant any facility that is buried or in contact with the ground. This rule clarification will not change the burden on operators because RSPA compliance inspectors have consistently required any facility in contact with the ground to be cathodically protected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA received two comments regarding the change to &sect;195.416(a). One commenter recommended that offshore pipelines be excluded from annual testing requirements. RSPA believes there is no acceptable substitute for regular testing to determine if corrosion protection of all lines, both onshore and offshore, is adequate. Accordingly, ``in contact with the ground or submerged'' is added to the rule to assure that all underwater pipelines, both onshore and offshore, are included in the definition. The other commenter suggested requiring the testing of ``carrier pipes'' in casings. ``Carrier pipes'' are normally buried and subject to the rule. The THLPSSC voted 10 to 0 in favor of the proposed change (5 members did not vote). The revision to &sect;195.416(a) is adopted as modified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 195.416(f) requires that any pipe found to be generally corroded so that the remaining wall thickness is less than the minimum thickness required by the pipe specification tolerances must either be replaced with coated pipe that meets the requirements of part 195 or, if the area is small, must be repaired. However, the operator need not replace generally corroded pipe if the operating pressure is reduced to be commensurate with the limits on operating pressure specified in &sect;195.406, based on the actual remaining wall thickness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

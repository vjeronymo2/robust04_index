			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP WEDNESDAY: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BASKETBALL REGIONALS;  </P> <P> DIVISION II GIRLS;  </P> <P> ENGER SCORES 43 POINTS AS VISTA ELIMINATES CANYON WITH 80-38 VICTORY  </P> <P> So coach, you say this was only Chris Enger's second-best effort?  </P> <P> "She played better against Mt. Carmel last year in the playoffs," Vista Coach  Joe DeMaria said about his star center's performance Tuesday night against  visiting Canyon.  </P> <P> This was after watching the Panthers defeat Canyon, 80-38, in the first round  of the Southern California Regional Division II girls' basketball playoffs.  Enger scored 43 points.  </P> <P> Enger couldn't precisely remember that Mt. Carmel game last year but memories  of this one were still vivid.  </P> <P> "This is the best we've played in the playoffs so far," said Enger, whose  career high is 44.  </P> <P> "I thought we could win, but not like this. When you're talking playoffs,  everyone's good. No way did I think that we'd blow them out like that."  </P> <P> Aside from a close first quarter -- Vista, after being down, 8-3, took a 12-10  lead into the second quarter -- Canyon (22-6) wasn't even in the same gym.  </P> <P> Enger started off with four points in the first quarter, then became a scoring  machine for the next 16 minutes of play, scoring 20 and 15 points in the second  and third quarters.  </P> <P> "We started getting the ball to her on the weak side," DeMaria said. "That  seemed to open it up and Kelli (Schott) got some shots for us."  </P> <P> Said Enger: "Kelli and everyone got me the ball. Everyone always contributes."  </P> <P> Top-seeded Vista (26-3) switched from a zone to man-to-man defense after the  first quarter -- "That seemed to help," said DeMaria -- and ran a fast break  that broke Canyon fast.  </P> <P> "They didn't defend against us a lot," said Enger. "We just beat them up on the  break. That really opened it up for us."  </P> <P> Vista led, 35-22, at the half and pushed the margin wider with a 29-9  third-quarter run. In that period, Canyon's only field goals were on  three-pointers from Christa Ramirez -- one with 3 seconds left -- and one from  Keri Erkenbrack.  </P> <P> Erkenbrack (21) and Ramirez (7) were questionable for the game, both having  been injured in a Southern Section soccer game Saturday.  </P> <P> News of the injuries filtered down to Vista's players, and they weren't taken  seriously, according to Enger.  </P> <P> "They are their top scorers," she said. "If they're athletes, they'll be out  there."  </P> <P> DeMaria began substituting late in the third quarter but didn't take Enger out  until she set the gym record with 3:10 remaining.  </P> <P> Scoring in double figures for Vista, which advances to Thursday's second round,  were Schott with 17 and Dana Christofferson with 11.  </P> <P> Canyon Coach Bill Fitzgibbons said his players did a good job of defending  against Enger early but had problems thereafter.  </P></p>

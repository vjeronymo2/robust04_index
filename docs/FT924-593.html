			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Murder verdict in US-Mexico drug case The brother-in-law of former Mexican president Luis Echeverria has been found guilty of conspiring to murder Mr Enrique Camarena, an official of the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), in a case that led to a sharp dispute between Mexico and the US, Damian Fraser writes from Mexico City. Mr Ruben Zuno Acre was tried with the Mexican doctor Mr Humberto Alvarez Machain, who had been kidnapped by agents working for the DEA in 1990 to face charges in the US. The case against Dr Alvarez Machain was dismissed by the judge last week. The kidnapping of Mr Alvarez Machain and subsequent trial infuriated the Mexican government.</p>

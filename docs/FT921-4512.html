			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Observer: Overworked Richard Lines, chairman of the acquisitive specialty chemical company MTM, seems to be under an unusual amount of pressure of late. First his well-connected company upsets the stock market by revealing that it is having difficulty getting its auditors to sign off the accounts. Then he resigns as chairman of the board of governors of Teesside Polytechnic. The energetic Lines, who since 1979 has been MTM's driving force, had thrown himself wholeheartedly into his Polytechnic role, even giving Pounds 100,000 of his own money to found three academic chairs to strengthen its research. As chairman he helped the Poly win the go-ahead for a new University College on Teesside together with Durham University and the Teesside Development Corporation. MTM says Lines had been considering resigning from the Poly board for some time, and the two events are unrelated.</p>

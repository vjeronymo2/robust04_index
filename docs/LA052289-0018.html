			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : THE WINANS AND WHITNEY HOUSTON AT THE WILTERN  </P> <P> Singing Winans actually outnumber singing Jacksons, and most of the vocally  prodigious Detroit family -- which has successfully brought gospel lyrics to  the black pop mainstream -- made it to the stage in a sometimes indulgent but  always passionate performance Friday night at the sold-out Wiltern Theatre.  Brother and sister BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans were joined by several more sibling  Winans, Mom and Dad Winans, and even prominently featured Whitney Winans.  </P> <P> Actually, Houston was introduced by her real name but might as well have been  family, sharing as she does their way of swooping and dipping all over a poor,  defenseless syllable. Call it the Megalo-Melismatic school. The show's second  half was filled with what the New Testament writers might call "vain  repetition": ballads stretched out so the singers could challenge each other  with repeated renderings of the same word or phrase. Showing off for the Lord?  Maybe. But the more compact, upbeat numbers offered a joyously noisy brand of  bouncy black pop all too rarely heard with any kind of lyric these days.

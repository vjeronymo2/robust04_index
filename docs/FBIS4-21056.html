			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Matiello and Ana Maria Mandim: "Brizola </F> Prevented Federal Police Operation on Hill"]    [Text] Governor Leonel Brizola confirmed yesterday in  Washington that it was his decision to cancel an operation set  up by the Federal Police--with the support of the Army--to take  Alemao Hill (Northern Zone) last 10 December and end its control  by Orlando Conceicao ("Orlando Jogador"), the most wanted  trafficker in the state.    The operation was planned over a period of four months  following an initial raid on 31 August 1993, when 40 Federal  Police agents were met with heavy weapons fire on that same  hill, where "Jogador" controls the distribution of drugs to  seven neighboring hills. The hill was being protected by 160 men  armed with AR-15 rifles, Uzi submachineguns, and automatic  pistols. "The counterattack by the traffickers, who were  descending in columns, was a tactic used in military combat,"  says a police officer who took part in the first operation.    Preparation--That reception impressed the police and the  Army. Federal agents spent the next four months studying  photographs and maps of the area. The new raid was to be  launched on 10 December. It called for 70 agents to take  possession of strategic points on Alemao Hill at around 1900 so  that eight Army helicopters could then attack the summit the  following morning.    Brizola explained his cancellation of the invasion by saying  in Washington--where he has gone in connection with the release  of a World Bank loan that will be used to clean up pollution in  Guanabara Bay--that he felt that the operation was disorganized  and that it lacked coordination with the State Police.    According to his special adviser, Fernando Britto, the  governor does not rule out cooperation between the Army and  Federal Police in the fight against drugs and weapons. "But from  the way the operation was being carried out, its character was  much more a matter of bullying than anything else," Britto added.    Alarm--According to federal agents, the absence of  coordination with the State Police was intentional. The purpose  was to prevent the traffickers from being warned. After the  first raid, in August, the Federal Police prepared a detailed  report on the way they had been received by the traffickers,  with an emphasis on what was considered military tactical  organization.    In Washington, the governor said that "if raids on the hills  actually solved anything, there would be no more traffickers or  outlaws or anything else in Rio de Janeiro, because the  dictatorship wore itself out conducting operations of that kind,  even with the use of helicopters, and it didn't help at all."  Leonel Brizola reiterated that bringing the matter "to the  surface" now was an "act of political exploitation."</p>

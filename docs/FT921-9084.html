			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar climbs on rumour THE DOLLAR climbed to its highest this week against the D-Mark, boosted by rumours of unrest in the former Soviet Union and defensive comments from Federal Reserve chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, writes Peggy Hollinger. The US currency finished near the week's high in London at DM1.6070, up from DM1.5905. In New York it ended at DM1.6073. Mr Greenspan's comments late the previous night that he would oppose a devaluation policy left the US unit stronger at the London opening. Then came Mr Eduard Shevardnadze's warnings of a coup in Russia, and talk of Libya preparing for a punitive western military strike, and the dollar shot through the DM1.60 level. Traders dismissed the importance of the rumours of Soviet unrest, however. 'People wanted to be in the mood to buy dollars,' commented Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank. It was not the first time Mr Shevardnadze had spoken of unrest. 'The market was ready to listen, even though it was old news,' Mr Feeny added. He said it was also unlikely that the Fed would cut rates in the near term. Many felt that the US dollar would consolidate overnight as the speculators take their money and run. This week's rise has largely been based on technical factors and rumour. However, the dollar will today get its first solid piece of data since Friday's disastrous jobs figures. US retail sales for January are expected to be flat. The US unit had a harder time pushing through the psychologically important Y127.50 barrier - the level at which the Fed and the Bank of Japan had intervened last month - to finish in London at Y127.55, compared with Y126.85 on Tuesday. It slipped in New York to close at Y127.40. The market still feared intervention around the Y128.50 level. Comments from Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese finance minister, that it was not yet time for a weak yen reinforced those fears. Sterling continued to trade within a narrow band against the D-Mark, strengthening from DM2.8650 to DM2.8750. The D-Mark was weaker against most currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, as a result of the rumours of Soviet unrest and also dollar strength. The lira improved from 752.43/53 per D-Mark to 751.75/85. Traders suggested that investors were keen on the extra yield available in the lira over the D-Mark. The peseta climbed from 62.99/63.02 per D-Mark to 62.95/97. The Spanish currency's strength ensured that sterling remained a mere 10 basis points above the ERM grid for most of the day. Sterling's weakness in the ERM would appear to be the main obstacle to a rate cut in the UK. There was continuing speculation that the Bank of Spain could ease monetary policy after it announces inflation figures today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The No. 22 of June of  the Russian paper PATRIOT carried an article on the career of  Kim Yong- sam under the title "15 Years After" upon his Moscow  trip.    The paper notes that Kim Yong-sam threw off his "election  commitments" in less than one year after he took office as  "president" and, while visiting the United States, signed a  secret agreement with his masters across the ocean on opening  the South Korean market to U.S. farm products. With this, Kim  Yong-sam has actually brought sufferings to the 6 million South  Korean peasants, says the paper, and continues:    Why? He sought to induce the United States not to agree to  the package solution to the nuclear issue proposed by the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the talks with the DPRK  and establish an "international cooperation system" against the  DPRK.    Recalling that Kim Yong-sam had always made "tough  anti-fascist speeches" while active in an opposition party for  over 30 years, the paper says: When he became the leader of the  New Democratic Party in 1974, he made an oath that he would  devote his whole life to the struggle for genuine freedom and  the restoration of democracy.    When he was ousted from the seats of opposition leader and  "national assemblyman" in autumn of 1979, he cried: "Although  the ruling quarters are trying to rob me of everything  necessary, they cannot take away my political philosophy," the  paper derides him, asking why can such a man who waxed so  eloquent not be an opposition leader?    The paper quotes the title of an article of the South Korean  magazine KIL "40 years of Perfidy and Betrayal of Kim Yong-sam  Were Decades of Mad Acts To Become President."    It was not until the lapse of 15 years that the South Korean  people understood whom Kim Yong-sam's political philosophy  serves, it remarks.</p>

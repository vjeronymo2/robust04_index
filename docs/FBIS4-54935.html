			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Let us hear Levente Suekoesd's  report from the headquarters of the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP].    [Suekoesd] Good evening. The atmosphere is quiet and calm  here. [passage omitted] The party's chairman, who has just  arrived, is not in a very good mood. What do you think of the  results so far?    [KDNP Chairman Laszlo Surjan] I think that many people are  surprised by the partial results indicating an absolute lead by  the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]. According to our  analysis, the MSZP's program and its present leadership does not  justify this result at all. However, nostalgia -- wanting to  bring back the calm of the 70's and the 80's -- can explain  this. I think that those who have chosen the Socialists from  the current political forces for this reason are mistaken.  [passage omitted]    [Suekoesd] Where did your party do well, in the larger towns  or in the provinces?    [Surjan] In my view, it is unequivocal that our party's  strength lies in the smaller towns and villages. The party was  not strong in Budapest even in the 40's and it seems that this  is the same in the 90's too. All this means that we have to  deal with strengthening and building the party before the local  government elections.    [Suekoesd] What can the second round bring?    [Surjan] The second round could bring extremely significant  changes. [passage omitted] Although it is true that in 1990  those leading after the first round kept their lead, this is not  necessarily true. I think that the next three weeks will be  spent trying to concentrate the forces in a way that a left-wing  turnabout, which does not lead forward but back to the past, be  held back or prevented.</p>

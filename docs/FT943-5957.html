			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Russia withdraws Yesterday's ceremonies, marking the final withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany and the Baltic states, celebrated the peaceful liberation of central Europe from the Red Army and drew a line under the second world war. History has, once again, given Russia and Germany the chief responsibility for the peace, prosperity and freedom of central Europe. Fortunately, the Germany that has emerged from two world wars and the Cold War is a stable, democratic country firmly anchored in Nato and the European Union. Meanwhile, Russia seems committed to re-integrating itself into the world economy and repairing the damage caused by 75 years of self-imposed tyranny. The litmus tests of these countries' future behaviour will be Moscow's continued willingness to honour the independence of the Baltic states and united Germany's toleration of post-war frontiers that leave most of former Pomerania and Prussia in Polish hands. Russia and Germany have much to gain from growing economic prosperity and self-confidence in the central European and Baltic states which, all too often in the past, have been crushed by the machinations of their neighbours, acting in concert. But the greatest gainer from the decline in the power and influence of the Red Army could be Russia itself. Under communist rule the Soviet Union became the most militarised society on earth. The health and wealth of Soviet citizens were sacrificed in the vain effort to wear down the west. Now, at last, Russians and citizens of other former Soviet states have an opportunity to use their talents and resources to repair the environmental, economic, social, physical and psychological scars left by the ill-conceived communist experiment. Nostalgia for the imperial past is misplaced. The decks have been cleared for Russia to concentrate on its own affairs. So far as its security is concerned, the main tasks are to keep its nuclear weapons under watchful control and to replace the sprawling conscript army of the past with a smaller, better equipped and trained professional force. The main challenge, however, is to build an economy responsive to consumers, whose needs were neglected for decades. The old economy produced world-class rockets but terrible shoes. Russia's military withdrawal from Europe should free up the men and resources needed to shift the balance at last towards a productive civilian economy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Henan Governor Ma Zhongchen (7456 1813 5256): </F> "`Two Leaps' in China's Rural Reform and Development"]    [Text] Comrade Xiaoping once pointed out: "From a  long-term point of view, reform and development of China's  socialist rural areas may experience two leaps. The first leap  is to abolish the system of people's communes and adopt the  contracted responsibility system on a household basis with  remuneration linked to output. This is tremendous progress, and  we must unswervingly uphold the new practice for a long time to  come. The second leap will come when we successfully adapt  ourselves to the needs of scientific farming and socialized  production, expand agricultural operations to an appropriate  scale, and promote the collective economy. This is additional  great progress which can only be accomplished through a long  process."  <H5>  I. "First Leap" in Rural Reform and Development Brought </H5> About an Historic Change in Rural Economy.    As a result of the abolition of the system of people's  communes and the adoption of the contracted responsibility  system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output,  the rural productive forces have been brought well into line  with production relations, rural households are gradually  becoming a primary main body of the production and operation of  commodities, productive forces have been freed and developed,  the micro structure of the rural economy has experienced  fundamental change, and miraculous growth has been registered in  all major indicators of the rural economy. At present, the  progress of the rural reform is giving impetus to urban reform,  while the latter, in return, is pushing forward the former. The  organic integration of urban and rural reform has opened up a  new chapter in the history of rural economic development. The  rural economic structural reform has not only brought  comprehensive development to the rural economy, but also given  mighty support to the rapid growth of the entire national  economy. It has not only changed the economic and social  structures of rural areas, but also provided us with useful  experience in shifting the highly concentrated planned economic  structure toward a socialist market economic structure. And it  has not only brought benefits to peasants, but also provided  them with democracy. The effective realization of the "first  leap" in China's rural reform and development has laid a sound  foundation for eliminating the backwardness and poverty of rural  areas, and for providing peasants with sufficient food and  clothing and then helping them attain a "fairly comfortable  life."  <H5>  II. "Sudden Emergence and Rapid Development" of Township </H5> and Town Enterprises Is an Inevitable Result of Realization of  the "First Leap," Thus Opening Up Broad Prospects for  Industrialization and Urbanization of Rural Areas.    Thanks to the adoption of the contracted responsibility  system on a household basis with remuneration linked to output,  rural labor productivity was enhanced rapidly, and large numbers  of rural labor forces were freed. Under the then situation of a  lagging urbanization process, it was an inevitable result of the  "first leap" that these freed labor forces were shifted to  township and town enterprises as well as to tertiary industries.  The development of township and town enterprises has not only  brought peasants bigger income and accelerated the shift of  rural labor forces, but it has also gradually turned the rural  economy into a non-agricultural and urbanized economy, helped  pure rural laborers develop themselves into professionals of a  pluralistic society, and changed the unitary collective-owned  economy into a diversified economy that relies mainly on the  public ownership. As a product of the socialist market economy,  township and town enterprises are gaining increasingly greater  strength amidst market competition. Moreover, through their  successful exploration of how to develop the socialist market  economy, they have proved to be a new growth point in China's  national economy, which is full of life and vitality. Alongside  the rapid development of township and town enterprises, a number  of new-type medium and small cities and townships are undergoing  an expansion process. The present practice by which the  majority of surplus rural labor forces are shifted to  township-town enterprises and tertiary industries, while the  minority make up the deficiencies of the urban manpower, has  accelerated China's urbanization process and brought about a  fundamental change in the dualistic urban-rural structure. What  is more, it has also helped the rural market to develop from a  sealed regional market into an open market which exercises  management by grouping enterprises and keeps well in line with  the usual practices of both domestic and international markets.  Some foreign experts have acclaimed China's township and town  enterprises as another great miracle created by China's  successful rural reform.    China has long been plagued by a situation in which the  labor  supply demand, a labor market has not yet taken shape, peasants  are poorly informed, and the service system remains imperfect.  As a result, peasants are swarming into cities blindly,  creating various problems of urban management. These problems  can only be solved through deepening of reform. On the other  hand, due to its traditional covertness, the surplus rural labor  power will not produce as huge a social pressure as that created  by an unemployed urban population. However, we must not lower  our guard. In 1993, the total number of China's surplus labor  force in rural areas stood at about 120 million; yet by the year  2000, China's rural labor force will total about 500 million,  registering an average growth of 10 million new laborers each  year. According to the statistics that an average of 5 million  rural laborers have shifted to non-agricultural industries every  year during the past 15 years, the surplus rural labor force  will reach about 150 million with the addition of the present  over 100 million. [figures as published] Failure to provide  appropriate guidance to these surplus rural laborers will result  in a huge waste of manpower and also many serious social  problems. The only way to solve this problem is to gradually  expedite the urbanization process of rural areas, turn  agricultural labor power into non-agricultural manpower, reform  the existing dualistic urban-rural residence management system  step by step, put into practice a unified system on floating  residences in both urban and rural areas, and give shape to a  unified urban-rural labor market.  <H5>  III. Gradually Realizing the "Second Leap" Is the Future </H5> Orientation of Rural Reform and Development.    It is an historical process to advance gradually from the  "first leap" to the "second leap." Since this process cannot be  fulfilled completely in a brief space of time, there must be a  transitional period which aims at further emancipating and  developing productive forces. Changes have now taken place in  the rural economic foundation, economic ties between urban and  rural areas are becoming tighter, and rural economic reform is  more exposed to the impact produced by other structural reforms,  including fiscal and taxation, banking, investment, and foreign  trade. Under such a situation, in order to bring about the  "second leap" in rural reform, instead of conducting reform only  in isolated individual fields, we should uphold the reform  principle of "promoting the whole while making key  breakthroughs" in accordance with the general design of  urban-rural integration. Firstly, we will adapt ourselves to  the demands of both domestic and international markets, and  promote the comprehensive reform of the socialist market  economic structure. We will apply appropriate policies to  protect prices of major agricultural products and at the same  time establish a system for stockpiling special-purpose grain  reserves as well as risk funds for grain production. Secondly,  we will adopt new policies for the readjustment of industrial  and agricultural investment ratios. Third, efforts will be made  to gradually unfold reform of the land system. Land contracts  will be extended for another 30 years after their expiration, so  that farmers have the right to use their land for a long period  of time. To avoid the situation in which land operations are  restricted to a small scale and land is divided into bits and  pieces, which is not beneficial to scale operation and  technological progress, we advocate during the land contract  period of the method "increasing or decreasing the number of  people without increasing or decreasing the land." Meanwhile,  we will establish a land circulation market, thus creating  conditions for extensive application of scientific and  technological results and for the socialization of production.  During the course of implementation, all localities are  required to act in line with the realistic development levels of  productive forces, work out measures in light of local  conditions, provide guidance to different types of areas, adopt  a positive and steady approach, and proceed in an orderly way.  We should refrain from exercising rigid uniformity and applying  fixed formulas, for history has shown that by hastily  readjusting production relations regardless of real development  levels, we are unable to fulfill the goal of developing  productive forces and improving the material and cultural lives  of the people. On the contrary, such practice will lead to a  negative situation and sabotage productive forces to a serious  extent.</p>

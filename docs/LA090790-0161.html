			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW TWIST TO THE NEA FLAP -- PROTECTING ARCHIVES;  </P> <P> RADIO: PACIFICA, WHICH OWNS KPFK-FM, MAY REJECT GRANT TO SUPPORT TAPE LIBRARY  WHERE SOME OF ITS RACIEST PROGRAMS ARE STORED.  </P> <P> The Pacifica Foundation -- already embroiled in a controversy over restrictions  on allegedly indecent radio programming -- is mulling rejection of $30,000 in  National Endowment for the Arts grants to protest what it sees as a multifront  federal censorship campaign.  </P> <P> Moreover, the dispute underscores what many NEA grantees have complained may be  perceived as unanticipated far-reaching effects of a provision of the arts  endowment's 1990 appropriation bill. That provision bars federal support to any  arts project that is "obscene" and lacking in artistic merit.  </P> <P> In the case of the Pacifica Foundation, the NEA has offered money to support a  tape archives that includes some of the raciest early work of such people as  Lenny Bruce and George Carlin -- dissemination of which might run afoul of the  bitterly contested obscenity control clause. The NEA has required grant  recipients to sign a certification they will comply with the anti-obscenity  provisions of the money bill.  </P> <P> The Berkeley-based foundation, also known as Pacifica Radio, operates six  unconventional stations -- including KPFK-FM in Los Angeles -- in four states.  The stations have been challenging increasing pressure from Congress and the  Federal Communications Commission to restrict "offensive" or "off-color"  programming.  </P> <P> Pacifica has often taken on Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), author of a 1988  amendment that requires the FCC to crack down on "indecent" broadcasts. The  amendment requires the FCC to aggressively ban "indecent" material.  </P> <P> Little known in the course of the FCC dispute, however, has been Pacifica's  status as an ongoing recipient of NEA funds -- though the arts endowment  support is not directly involved in Pacifica's programming over KPFK, KPFA and  KPFB in Berkeley, WBAI in New York City, KPFT in Houston and WPFW in  Washington. The foundation also operates Pacifica Radio News, a network with 40  clients.  </P> <P> This year, according to David Salniker, Pacifica's executive director, the NEA  offered the parent Pacifica Foundation a $20,000 grant for ongoing support of  the Los Angeles-based Pacifica Radio Archives, which maintains a library of  more than 40,000 documentary tapes. An NEA award of $10,000 was also received  for a Berkeley-based program that trains women and minority group members in  the technical aspects of radio production.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview earlier this week, Salniker said that, while the  grants may first seem inconsequential in the context of Pacifica's $4.5-million  annual budget, the foundation had become alarmed at the possible implications  of NEA funding restrictions for the archives, in particular. The collection  includes tapes of interviews and other materials involving political  controversies beginning with the McCarthy era.  </P> <P> The tape collection, Salniker said, also includes largely unexpurgated  interviews with counterculture stalwarts including poet Allen Ginsberg,  novelist Jack Kerouac and radical political leaders Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin,  Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton.  </P> <P> Salniker said the Pacifica Foundation's executive committee discussed the NEA  grant dilemma in early August and recommended to the foundation's full board  that the two NEA grants be rejected as a protest to the NEA policy requiring  grantees to acknowledge the restrictive provisions of the money bill in writing  before their grants may be paid. The full board will take up the issue in early  October.  </P> <P> Initially, Salniker said, Pacifica got involved last year in ongoing attempts  to try to set aside the FCC restrictions also authored by Helms. When the NEA  obscenity oath controversy broke out earlier this year, he said, the situation  struck Pacifica as not an isolated problem, but part of a broader-brush  censorship fight of which the FCC component had simply been the first shot  fired.  </P> <P> "There is a consensus within the organization," Salniker said, "that these  restrictions are an abhorrent attack on cultural freedom."  </P></p>

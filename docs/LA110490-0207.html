			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: CLAREMONT;  </P> <P> LEAF BLOWER BAN APPROVED  </P> <P> In response to numerous complaints about noise and dust pollution, the City  Council voted 4 to 1 to ban gasoline-powered leaf blowers as of Feb. 1.  </P> <P> But the council agreed to permit the restricted use of electric and  battery-operated blowers, which reportedly produce a less abrasive sound at a  lower decibel level.  </P> <P> They may be operated from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Councilman Algird Leiga voted against the ban, saying he was unsure that the  benefits to the environment would offset the economic hardship for  self-employed gardeners. Mayor Nicholas Presecan, calling the situation  "no-win," said he voted for the ban with reluctance.  </P> <P> The ban came after an hourlong public hearing during which most speakers  opposed the blowers. The city, following a July recommendation from its  Community Services Commission, prohibits all blowers on municipal property.  Vacuums are used instead.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Judy Wright said the ban was necessary because professional  gardeners and implement manufacturers had failed to police themselves.  </P></p>

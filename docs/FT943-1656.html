			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Dollars 130m GM contract for Saab Sweden's Saab Automobile said yesterday it had received a SKr1bn (Dollars 135m) order from General Motors, one of its joint owners, for the supply of 40,000 manual gearboxes a year over five years, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. It is the second large order which Saab has received from GM since the US group took a 50 per cent stake in the company five years ago. It will increase Saab's production by around 50 per cent to 115,000 manual gearboxes a year while deliveries to GM will rise six-fold to 48,000 gearboxes a year. The order was placed by GM's US Powertrain Division, GM's main US development centre. The gearboxes, used in Saab's 900 and 9000 models, will be fitted to a new GM model which is due to be manufactured in the US later this decade. In 1990 Saab received an order for up to 65,000 gearboxes a year for GM cars produced in Europe. Deliveries are currently running at only 8,000 a year because of the recession in the German car market. Bouygues Offshore, a unit of Bouygues of France, has signed a FFr840m (Dollars 158m) contract to rebuild Nigeria's Forcados oil terminal for the Nigerian unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Japan's four steel pipe makers - Sumitomo Metal, Nippon Steel, Kawasaki Steel, and NKK - are set to export steels pipes to Russia between October and the end of this year. Electrolux of Sweden is considering a joint venture with Polish washing machine producer Swiatowit Myszkow to develop appliance sales in central Europe. Electrolux has signed a letter of intent with Myszkow to start assembling Electrolux products in January next year.</p>

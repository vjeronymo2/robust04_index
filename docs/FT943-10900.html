			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Oman and India agree Dollars 850m venture Oman and India have signed an agreement for the construction of a 50-50 joint venture urea export fertiliser plant at Sur on the Arabian Sea coast 200km south of Muscat. A memorandum of understanding for the Dollars 850m venture was signed by the state-owned Oman Oil Company (OOC) and India's chemicals and fertiliser minister, Mr Ram Lakhan Singh. The Indian government will buy the entire output from the Indian joint venture partners, Maharashtra-based Rashtriya Chemicals &amp; Fertilisers and Gujarat-based Krishak Bharati Co-operative. The urea plant will have a capacity of 1.4m tonnes a year. Construction will start in 1996 with completion planned for 1999. India will pay Oman at prevailing market prices. The agreement in principle to build the plant was reached last year during a visit to Oman by India's prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao. Sur was chosen as the construction site because of its natural harbour for terminal and loading facilities and proximity to Oman's centrally located gasfields at Fahud, Yibal, Huwaisah, Saih Rawl, Barik and Huraymah. It is also the nearest Omani port to the off-loading terminals on India's Gujarat coast. Oman has been quick to seize on the potential of India and Asia as export markets for its natural resources. India's demand for fertilisers has been rising 3-4 per cent a year. The venture with India is part of Oman's strategy to broaden its export base and diversify. Oil production amounts to 800,000 barrels a day and with gas is responsible for three-quarters of annual budget revenue. About one-third of Oman's gas reserves are now committed to Asian markets under the Oman Liquefied Natural Gas Company, a joint venture between the government, three foreign shareholders of Petroleum Development Oman, and three Japanese companies. The oil sector is handled by the Oman Oil Company, which negotiates with western oil companies and seeks downstream export markets. It is also involved in various ventures including the urea export plant, pipelines and refineries.</p>

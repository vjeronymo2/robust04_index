			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Conservatives seek political life beyond Treurnicht the last and most fervent champion of apartheid  - is in the market for a new policy, and a new leader. Its dream of creating separate tribal homelands for each of the white and black tribes of South Africa  - originally the platform of the National Party, but latterly the goal of the Conservatives  - was firmly rejected in the referendum. The voters' verdict on Mr Andries Treurnicht, the CP leader, was equally harsh. He is unlikely to survive the humiliation. The whites-only poll was the Conservatives' last chance to win power through the ballot box; a 'no' vote would have forced the ruling National Party to resign, leaving the CP with certain victory in the ensuing general election. Now there will never be a CP government  - unless the military should decide to install one, a most unlikely prospect. The CP can still claim to represent more than 1m voters  - fully 30 per cent of the white electorate  - but it cannot force through its lunatic plans for social engineering. Even before the referendum defeat, the party had begun to jettison some of its policies in a move to occupy the centre-right of white politics. An influential group of younger, more moderate CP members of parliament  - led by the witty and articulate Mr Koos van der Merwe, and the brothers Pieter and Corne' Mulder, members of a famous South African political family  - sought to hijack party policy from older reactionaries who clung to old-style apartheid. They defended the campaign for a separate Afrikaner state by arguing that this was no more odious than the demand for an independent Croatia, merely a reflection of the ethnic nationalism sweeping Europe. They forced the ultra-conservative leadership of the party to reverse its decision to boycott the poll, arguing that the CP could not refuse to fight with honour. Then they unilaterally announced policy changes which caught senior leaders off guard. Mr van der Merwe said the CP would not reinstate apartheid. However, this was largely sleight of hand: apartheid laws would not be needed in the white homeland which Mr van der Merwe proposed, because blacks would not be citizens of such a state. They could be kept out by visa curbs, rather than the hated pass laws. The maverick MPs also said the CP was willing to negotiate political reform with blacks. Official party policy has been to boycott the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the multi-racial forum which is negotiating a new constitution. Party officials now say they are ready to talk  - though not in Codesa, where voting rules favour the National Party and the African National Congress (ANC). But most importantly, the CP compromised on its central demand that whites should occupy 87 per cent of South Africa as their own homeland, with millions of blacks crowded on to tribal states on the remaining 13 per cent. That was the original plan of apartheid: a constellation of black states federated to a large white nation. The concept of a loose confederation will remain, even after yesterday's defeat; but it seems likely that the CP will dramatically scale down its demand for land. Eventually, the more moderate party faction would probably settle for strong regional government in areas such as the Western Cape where there are large numbers of whites, rather than a fully-fledged geographic homeland. The CP is likely to end up placing more moderate demands on the table at Codesa. But it is too early to say whether the party will split over the issue. Mr Treurnicht is almost certain to step down, but the battle has yet to begin between Mssrs Mulder and the more conservative Mr Andries Beyers. Once the choice is made, the defeated candidate could lead an exodus of loyal MPs out of the party. That could leave an ultra-radical core of right-wingers in the Conservative party, with a 'new right' faction sitting at the table in Codesa. Conceding defeat in the referendum, Mr Treurnicht warned that the white 'struggle for freedom and survival' had entered a new phase. It was 'continuing in even greater earnestness than before'. The new phase would not include armed action, but he added: 'We say to de Klerk, don't force us under a Marxist government.' It is clear the wishes of 876,000 white voters who voted 'no' cannot simply be ignored. In fact, the right could prove more dangerous than ever. Many of the more fanatical Conservatives will feel the constitutional route to opposition has been blocked: the hard core now claims to have a moral justification for violence. Their numbers would be few  - witness the pitifully small demonstrations staged by the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB) during the campaign  - but a few well-placed bombs could cause considerable havoc, and seriously damage the prospects for reform.</p>

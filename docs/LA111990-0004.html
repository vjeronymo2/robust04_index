			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MATH AND SCIENCE EDUCATION  </P> <P> After reading "How U.S. Failed in Science" (Nov. 8), we are disgusted at the  quality of scientific knowledge possessed by most Americans. It is obvious to  most of us here at Caltech that the U.S. school system is unable to teach  science properly.  </P> <P> Indicative of this lack of knowledge, the sample questions printed in the  article, as used by the National Science Foundation's poll, show a lack of  scientific understanding. Of the 10 survey statements printed, two were  impossible to answer. Most of the others were very vague and subjective.  </P> <P> Statement 6, "The universe began with a huge explosion," is known as the Big  Bang Theory. Even though it is widely supported in the scientific community, it  is only a theory.  </P> <P> Statement 7, "In the entire universe, there are thousands of planets like our  own on which life could have developed," is pure conjecture. The best  telescopes have only been able to recognize dual-star systems in nearby solar  systems. The resolution of current telescopes is far from capable of  distinguishing planets in any solar system but our own. There is neither proof  nor counter-proof of the existence of life outside of our solar system.  </P> <P> How can we expect people to answer these questions correctly when many of them  cannot be answered? Perhaps the members of the National Science Foundation  should themselves be judged before judging others.  </P> <P> MARK LAKATA &amp; MIKE ROZAK, Pasadena  </P></p>

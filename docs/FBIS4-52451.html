			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cabinet has approved a plan to buy two  second-hand frigates, each worth Btl.5 billion, Defense Minister  Wichit Sukmak said yesterday.    Wichit said that the Navy initially would purchase only one  frigate as Thailand and the US still had to discuss details such  as expenses for training crews and providing weapons on the  ships.    "We have to thoroughly check everything first," he said.    Wichit said the frigates would be bought under a  hire-purchase arrangement, which was considerably cheaper than  buying new ships at BtlO billion each.    The hire-purchase agreement will take effect in 1995 under a  contract which has to be renewed every five years. Wichit said  that the Navy would stop payments after the frigates reached 75  per cent of their life-span.    Meanwhile, commenting a report that the military was unhappy  with its tight budget allocation, Wichit said that military  accountants were trying to operate in line with government  policy.    "We will spend on things which need prime attention first.  However, we can ask the government to increase the budget if  necessary," he said, adding that the final decision rested with  the government.    Wichit conceded, however, that the budget restrictions would  have some effect on the military structure. He stressed that  the main duty of the armed forces was to protect the country.  He added that an intelligence centre was crucial to the  successful performance of the military.</p>

			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / The Week Ahead: US growth expected to boost Tomkin RESULTS DUE Tomkins, the UK conglomerate, is expected to report profits of Pounds 174m and earnings of 13.5p in the year to May today. This compares with Pounds 132.1m and 12.7p a year earlier. Growth is expected to have been driven by a stronger performance in the US and for the first time will include profits from Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling and baking group it bought last year. MFI, the furniture group, is expected to report a fall in pre-tax profits today to about Pounds 43m, from Pounds 66.1m last year. Analysts downgraded their profits forecasts at the half-year results in January, when MFI said trading had declined sharply after Black Wednesday damaged consumer confidence. It also said sales had been down year-on-year in the first five weeks of its 10-week new year sale, which usually accounts for about 30 per cent of annual turnover. The Rank Organisation announces half-year results on Thursday, with pre-tax profits expected to be at or below last year's Pounds 94m. Some forecasts are as low as Pounds 82m, based on a poorer performance from Rank Xerox. The first half is not a good guide to the performance of Rank's directly-managed businesses - such as holidays, video duplication and bingo  -where profits tend to come in the second six months. More eagerly awaited will be statements on current trading. Few expect anything definitive on the group's future relationship with Rank Xerox. Great Universal Stores, the UK's largest mail order company, which reports on Thursday, is forecast to lift pre-tax profits from Pounds 441.5m to between Pounds 465m and Pounds 470m. The dividend is expected to rise from 40p to 43p. Analysts believe the company will have benefited from a increase in mail-order buying, while its market share continues to rise.

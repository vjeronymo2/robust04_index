			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Trade News: VW enters joint venture to produce cars in India Volkswagen of Germany, the leading European carmaker, has linked up with Eicher Goodearth, the Indian motor vehicle and tractor manufacturer, to produce and market a range of Volkswagen cars for the Indian market. The two companies announced that the new joint venture company would invest up to Rs6bn (Dollars 191m) in a manufacturing plant, expected to start production in 1997. The two partners would start the venture and decide the extent of equity for each company after a feasibility study. Volkswagen will be competing with several of the world's leading carmakers to establish a presence in India's newly liberalised passenger car market, which is estimated to double by the year 2000 to between 450,000 and 500,000 cars. These include General Motors, Chrysler, Ford, Peugeot, Daimler-Benz, Volvo, Hyundai, Mitsubishi and Daewoo. VW will also have to compete with the Indian Maruti, made in collaboration with Suzuki Motors of Japan, which has a dominant place in the Indian market. Mr Martin Posth, VW board member and chairman and president of Volkswagen Asia-Pacific, said that his company considered India one of the world's major emerging markets, especially since Asia is expected to account for most of the growth in the global vehicle market. Mr Posth said his company chose Eicher as a partner because of its widespread distribution network and professional management. Eicher manufactured India's first tractor in 1960 and entered into the light commercial vehicles sector in the 1980s, manufacturing small trucks and pick-up vans in collaboration with Mitsubishi Motor Corporation of Japan. Eicher has achieved a local content of over 90 per cent for these vehicles. Volkswagen is keen to maximise the level of local content, and hopes to capitalise on Eicher's experience in this area. Only then could their cars be competitive in the Indian market, Mr Posth said, indicating that his company would focus initially on medium-sized cars. Mr Vikram Lal, chairman of the Eicher group said that India offered the VW group the advantage of a diverse and cost-effective additional automobile base. Volkswagen will not restrict itself to a single model, but proposes to introduce a range of cars in India - though focusing initially on medium-sized cars - unlike several other global vehicle giants entering the market with a single car. Bharat Shell, a joint venture between the Indian government-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Shell Overseas Investment, is to construct a new lubricant blending unit at Uran, near Bombay, to manufacture Shell brand lubricants for the Indian market, writes Shiraz Sidhva. Mr Vikram Mehta, managing director of Bharat Shell, said yesterday that the company decided to set up its own unit because of capacity constraint at Bharat Petroleum's unit at Bombay, where the Shell range of lubricants are blended. The Rs1.3bn company, in which Shell has a 51 per cent stake, hopes to enter India's domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) market, which the government has yet to privatise. Bharat Shell already manufactures LPG for industrial use for markets in western India and plans to enlarge the spread its network nationally.</p>

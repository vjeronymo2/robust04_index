			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Banco Santander lifts operating profit 32% BANCO Santander, one of Spain's largest commercial banks, yesterday reported a 32 per cent increase in operating profits to Pta29.08bn (Dollars 278m) for the first quarter of 1992, citing a 26 per cent rise in its lending margins. Santander, which owns 10 per cent of Royal Bank of Scotland and 13 per cent of First Fidelity Bancorp in the US, said its group net profit rose 19.35 per cent to Pta20.69bn in the first three months of 1991. The bank said its interest-bearing current account - launched in the autumn of 1989 - had made an important contribution to the improved lending margin. These accounts originally cost most Spanish banks dear after they joined battle with Santander but the high interest rates originally being offered have since cooled considerably. Despite Santander's good first quarter figures, banking analysts in Madrid are still predicting a difficult year for local banks.</p>

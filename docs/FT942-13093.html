			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Big powers promise a united front on Bosnia: Diplomats plan to restrict Serbs to 49% of republic as fears grow of renewed fighting in north-east The newly established four-power 'contact group' on Bosnia promised yesterday to present a united front as they apply pressure on both Bosnian Serbs and Moslems to agree a negotiated settlement. The group - comprising Russia, the US, the United Nations and the European Union - resolved at its first meeting in London to avoid the splits between the west and Russia which have dogged attempts to secure an accord between Moslems and Serbs. The group's representatives - aiming to capitalise on an apparent easing of tension as the Serbs withdraw from the enclave of Gorazde under threat of air strikes - hope to travel to Sarajevo tomorrow. They will then visit Pale, the Bosnian Serb headquarters. The group's plans were announced by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, in Geneva after a meeting with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister. In a gesture of western keenness to include Russia in the peace process, Mr Christopher took Mr Vitaly Churkin, Moscow's chief negotiator in former Yugoslavia, with him when he flew from London to Geneva on his US Air Force jet. The contact group hopes to revive a peace plan under which the Serbs would limit their share of Bosnian territory to 49 per cent - they hold 70 per cent now - while the remaining territory would be occupied by the new Croat-Moslem federation. Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of UN operations in former Yugoslavia, said early today that Bosnian Serbs had effectively complied with a Nato ultimatum to withdraw their heavy weapons from within the 20km (12 miles) exclusion zone around Gorazde. As a result, there was no need for immediate air strikes. 'On the basis of information available right now, and subject to further verification, I have come to the conclusion there is no need to ask Nato for air strikes at this time,' he told reporters in Zagreb. Bosnian radio yesterday accused Serb forces of shelling Moslem positions near the north-eastern town of Brcko, at the narrowest point of the corridor linking Serbia to Serb-held Bosnia and Croatia. Serb media meanwhile accused the Bosnian Moslem army of planning an imminent offensive in northern Bosnia. The exchange of allegations follows reports from witnesses that the Bosnian Serbs are preparing to launch an offensive in that area, and charges that Croat forces have been massing to the north. Preservation of the self-styled 'Serb Republic' in Bosnia depends on main-taining the land corridor. There were reports from Serb sources, confirmed by some independent observers, that Moslem forces had violated the ceasefire in Gorazde by trying to trap a Serb unit within the enclave so it would become a target for Nato airstrikes when the ultimatum expired today.</p>

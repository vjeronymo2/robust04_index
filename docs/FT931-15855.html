			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at Trocadero companies RECEIVERS were appointed last night to the five companies which own the Trocadero leisure and office complex in Piccadilly, central London, and the adjacent Island Site. The companies, which include Power Trocadero Ltd, are owned by Power Corporation, the Irish property development group. KPMG Peat Marwick, the receivers, were unable to quantify the total debt of the companies in receivership, last night. It is thought that lenders to the companies were mainly Japanese banks, with Sanwa Bank being the lead. Last summer Power Corporation passed its final dividend when profits for the 15 months to March 1992 fell and because of 'temporarily high' gearing as a result of buying out the outstanding 50 per cent of the Trocadero. The Trocadero and the Island Site had been a joint venture between Power Corporation and Brent Walker, the overborrowed property and leisure group. But in March last year the joint venture was unravelled and Power Corporation bought out the Brent Walker stake with the intention of finding another partner. It appears not to have been able to find a buyer. The Trocadero is believed to be fairly fully let. The receivers said that the companies would continue to be run on a going concern basis and orderly disposals of assets sought. The companies put in receivership directly employ about 50 people.</p>

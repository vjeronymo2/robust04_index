			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: John and Gill go up the hill to fetch a pail of voters - Plans to expand nursery education are likely to be very popular This is not the first time Mr John Major has talked of his ambition to expand nursery education, which yesterday became a 'cast-iron commitment' for all 4-year-olds. Last December, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said: 'It would be an ambition of mine over time to move to universal nursery education, but I stress that is an ambition. We do not at the moment have detailed plans to do so. We don't have the resources.' At that time the then education secretary Mr John Patten was dismissive of the idea, saying it was 'too expensive'. His successor, Mrs Gillian Shephard, seems rather more sympathetic. Her reaction yesterday was to say: 'This is terrific news. I and my department are now geared up for early action.' She intends to complete the 'first wave' of expansion in the lifetime of this parliament. The department is still consulting with different interested groups on how the expansion should be managed. However, Mr Major's speech was taken as a hint that the government hoped to provide 'vouchers' which could be used to pay for either private or public nursery provision. He said: 'It must promote diversity and parental choice and it must be carefully targeted in a way that expands and does not crowd out the private and voluntary provision.' Several factors suggest expanded nursery education could be popular. First, the sharp increase in the take-up of private nursery care suggests there is rising demand among the middle classes. Figures produced by the National Commission on Education showed that numbers in private nurseries increased by 259 per cent between 1980 and 1991, from 22,017 to 79,029, while the numbers left with childminders more than doubled. Over the same period provision by local authority day nurseries had dropped. Secondly, the UK performs poorly in international comparisons. Estimates for 1991 (the most recent figures available) published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suggest that the UK trails countries such as Germany, France and Belgium in nursery provision. In the UK 60.7 per cent of four-year-olds were in education, compared with 100 per cent in France, 99.4 per cent in Belgium and 70.6 per cent in Germany. Several educationalists have published reports in the last year calling for nursery expansion. The National Commission on Education, an independent educational think-tank whose launch was welcomed by Mr Major, called for the phased introduction of universal provision. Its wanted to see 95 per cent of four-year-olds and 85 per cent of three-year-olds in nursery school by 2010. The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce went further, calling for the compulsory school age to be raised from five to six, so that resources could be recycled to offer free half-day learning for all children from the ages of three to five. Both bodies felt such moves would tackle the UK's growing problems with adult illiteracy and innumeracy. Mr Major's pledge may also have been influenced by Labour's exploitation of the issue. Provision is currently at the discretion of local education authorities, and Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, this year published Department for Education figures showing that 40 per cent of three and four-year-olds are provided with nursery education under Labour authorities, compared with 13 per cent in Conservative boroughs. Political reaction was lukewarm. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats pointed out that former prime minister Baroness Thatcher had pledged 22 years ago, when education secretary, to introduce universal nursery education for all three and four-year-olds.  ------------------------------------------------------------- LEARNING CURVE  ------------------------------------------------------------- Number of places in early childhood care and education  ------------------------------------------------------------- Type of provision                  1980        1991   % change Nursery education               130,997     177,863         36 Reception class                 205,673     272,178         32 Local authority day nurseries    22,017      79,029        259 Playground                      367,868     248,420         16 Childminders                     98,495     233,258        137  ------------------------------------------------------------- Source: National Commission on Education  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Speaking in Jerusalem after meeting Israeli leaders and  senior Palestinians from the occupied territories, Mr Hurd said  he had emerged from his talks convinced that both sides still  had a strong incentive to work out their differences. "They all  see the importance of getting on with it," he said. "Unless  people in Israel or the occupied territories can see that there  is actual progress, as opposed to the repetition of  declarations, they will lose trust in the process. It is very  important they should not." Although he emphasized that Britain  was not directly involved in the peace negotiations, he said  that the Government was willing to help Israel economically and  to assist the Palestinians practically. In particular Mr Hurd  pledged that Britain was in favour of liberalising trade between  Israel and the European Community. He said that today, during a  visit to the occupied Gaza Strip, he would unveil a package of  technical assistance to help Palestinians establish self-rule.    His visit has been dominated by the failure of Israelis and  Palestinians to agree to the terms of their "land for peace"  accord in the territories. Mr Hurd came face to face with some  of the difficulties when he met Yitzhaq Rabin, the Israeli Prime  Minister, who read out the entire contents of a fax received  last week from the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Israel  insists that the Palestinians reneged on earlier commitments to  resolve three outstanding differences holding up the start of an  Israeli withdrawal from the territories.    The Palestinians who met Mr Hurd complained that Israel was  using unfair tactics at the negotiating table, and said that  daily life for the two million Arab inhabitants of the  territories had changed little since the signing of the peace  accord in Washington last September.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROMANIA DENOUNCED AS REPRESSIVE  </P> <P> Romania was isolated and denounced today as Europe's most repressive state.  </P> <P> Foreign ministers at a 35-nation conference on human rights singled out the  government of President Nicolae Ceausescu as the odd man out in a changing  Europe.  </P> <P> "While strong currents of change are felt throughout Europe, there is one  government -- Romania -- which apparently has decided to go against the tide,"  Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Hans van den Broek said.  </P> <P> Ceausescu's sweeping plans to modernize Romania include the destruction of  thousands of villages of the ethnic Hungarian minority.  </P> <P> None of Romania's East Bloc allies at the conference came to Ceausescu's  defense at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.  </P></p>

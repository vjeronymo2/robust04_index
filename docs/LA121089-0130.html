			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HONOR EARTH MOTHER  </P> <P> As a Native American and citizen of San Diego County, I wish to comment on the  plan of the Campo Reservation to add a landfill to their land ("Unlikely Allies  Fight Indian Landfill," Oct. 28).  </P> <P> I find myself speaking words that go against Campo's tribal chairman. Yet, as  the eldest grandson of the last Kwaaymii, I find myself at a loss to agree with  the plan of raping our Earth Mother to deposit others' waste.  </P> <P> Oh, I know of the struggle to survive, to hang on till all of our treaties are  honored. But will you dishonor the very thing you wish honored -- the land, our  Mother?  </P> <P> People of Campo! Are we to give up our Native Americanness, or are we to stand,  as no one else can, in our own native country and protect her very existence  for the sake of a few greenbacks? There must be another way.  </P> <P> STEVEN TOMAS TWO HAWKS PFINGST  </P> <P> Solana Beach  </P></p>

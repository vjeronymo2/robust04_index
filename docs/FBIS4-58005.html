			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 28 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Salvadoran  Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Salaverria has said that El  Salvador cannot receive, even temporarily, Haitian refugees as  suggested by the United States to all Central American countries.    According to an article published today in LA PRENSA  GRAFICA,  Salaverria said the United States is presenting this possibility  not only to Central America, but to the Caribbean and some South  American countries.    The government official explained that the United States has  made this suggestion in light of the fact that hundreds of  Haitians are fleeing their country because of the difficult  political situation. The Haitians are leaving their country in  boats, many of which are being intercepted at sea.    Foreign Minister Salaverria said that the United States is  looking for a third country that will temporarily accept these  people while the causes that motivated them to leave their  country are investigated. If it is found that they fled their  country for economic reasons, they will be returned to Haiti.  However, if they fled for political reasons they will be  allowed to enter the United States.    Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani has said that the  Salvadoran Government has not received an official request from  the United States, but if it does, "this will have to be  studied."    Salaverria said that El Salvador, a country that is still  recovering from a 12-year war, saw many of its citizens flee to  other countries, mainly the United States, Canada, Mexico, and  Australia.    "Our duty is to improve our domestic situation to offer  favorable conditions for the return of our fellow countrymen,"  the minister said. Salaverria added that the Salvadoran  attitude does not "reflect a lack of sensitivity on our part,  but rather it reflects our situation."    Meanwhile, Health Minister Gustavo Argueta said that El  Salvador faces serious problems because it is the smallest  country in the area and it is overpopulated; therefore, offering  space to the Haitian refugees "would be illogical."</p>

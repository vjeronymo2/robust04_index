			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Batarcan (1572 1044 1422 0221), Ju Mengjun </F> (0215 1322 6511), and Chang Wanlong (1603 8001 7127):  "Mongolian Prime Minister Jasray Fetes Premier Li Peng"]    [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 28 Apr (XINHUA)--Tonight, Mongolian  Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray arranged a grand state banquet  in honor of Chinese Premier Li Peng, who is paying an official  visit to Mongolia.    The magnificent banquet hall was ablaze with lights and  filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere to welcome the guests.    Prime Minister Jasray first made a welcoming speech and  proposed a toast. He said: "Mongolia and China are friendly  neighbors. In recent years, through both sides making joint  efforts, bilateral relations have become more active, the legal  foundation has been consolidated, and the scope of cooperation  has been expanded. I am satisfied by this."    Jasray pointed out that developing good-neighborly and  friendly relations with China was, and will continue to be, one  of the primary principles of Mongolia's foreign policy.    He said: In 1960, Premier Zhou Enlai, China's famous  statesman, paid an official visit to our country and signed the  Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty between the two  countries; 34 years later, Premier Li Peng makes an official  visit to Mongolia again. He said: "Your Excellency Mr Premier,  your visit to our country is the continuation of the established  regular senior and summit meetings between Mongolia and China  and I deeply believe that your visit will hold an important  position in the history of Mongolian-Chinese relations."    Talking about the domestic situation, Jasray said that  Mongolia is undergoing a difficult period of transition to the  new market economic structure. He deeply believes that, with  the positive efforts of our people and the support of the  international community, the country will certainly succeed.    He said that he was glad to see that China had made great  achievements in carrying out reforms in line with China's own  national conditions. He said: "We sincerely hope that the PRC,  which has worldwide influence, will continue to be stable and  prosperous and will continue to develop. China's peaceful  foreign policy is an important factor for guaranteeing peace,  stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the  world as a whole."    In his speech of thanks, Premier Li Peng said: In the 45  years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between  China and Mongolia, although there have been twists and turns  for certain historical reasons, we were still glad to see that  the leaders of the two countries have continued to exchange  visits in recent years. Personnel exchanges at various levels  have been frequent and mutual understanding and trust have been  deepened, while gratifying progress has been made in exchanges  and cooperation in various fields. This has brought major  benefits to both countries and both peoples. The present state  of Sino-Mongolian relations did not come easily and we should  treasure it dearly.    Li Peng said: Thirty-four years ago, Premier Zhou Enlai  visited Mongolia and signed the Friendly and Mutual Assistance  Treaty. This treaty has played an important role in the  development of bilateral relations between the two countries.  He said: "Tomorrow, we shall sign a new treaty on  Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperative relations. I believe  the signing of the treaty will open a new page in the annals of  Sino-Mongolian relations, will further advance the development  of bilateral relations, and will bring about broader and  brighter prospects for friendly cooperation between the two  countries. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to  relations with Mongolia and is willing to join hands with the  Mongolian Government in creating a long-term, friendly, and  cooperative relationship extending beyond the 21st century.    Li Peng said: Both China and Mongolia are now striving for  the development of their own national economies. A stable and  developed China will make contributions to peace and prosperity  in Asia and in the world.    He said: "We respect the Mongolian people's choice of their  own development course and sincerely hope and believe that the  Mongolian people will overcome the temporary difficulties,  restore the economy, and effect national regeneration."    Li Peng pointed out: Peace and development remain two major  themes facing contemporary human society. The Chinese  Government and the Chinese people are willing to join all  peace-loving states and peoples, including Mongolia, in making  unremitting efforts to build the new order of peace, stability,  cooperation, and development in Asia and in the world.    Premier Li Peng's wife Zhu Lin; Ismail Amat, state  councillor  and minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; Han  Shubin, minister of railroads; Qi Huaiyuan, director of the  State Council's Foreign Affairs Office; and Wuliji, chairman of  the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Regional People's Government, who  are accompanying Premier Li Peng on his visit to Mongolia, were  also invited to the banquet. On the Mongolian side, those  attending the banquet included Prime Minister Jasray's wife,  Dulemasulun, Deputy Prime Minister Purebdorj, Minister of  Foreign Relations Gombosuren, and other senior officials.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE LIVES: SHALL WE TRANCE?;  </P> <P> IT'S NOT EASY TO MAKE IT AS A MEDIUM, EVEN IF THE SPIRIT IS WILLING  </P> <P> WHENEVER I THINK that my job is tough, I get this little reminder from the  Universe that it could be worse.  </P> <P> As I confessed in a previous column, I have a weakness for the supernatural.  Perhaps it's just part of being a free-lance writer, but I'm continually drawn  to metaphysically fit folks who have mysterious ways of knowing where my next  assignment is coming from. And they keep telling me that being a swami is no  bed of roses.  </P> <P> Take Thomas Jacobson of Beverlywood, a genial  ex-Marine-turned-successful-trance-medium. He and "Dr. Peebles," his spirit  compadre, have appeared on national television and radio and are the subject of  a new book, "To Dance With Angels."  </P> <P> Still, "people are constantly accusing me of fraud," Jacobson says. "Or, at  best, of being a well-intentioned, deluded person."  </P> <P> I can sympathize. It's bad enough going to parties and telling people I'm a  free-lance writer, which everyone's job-status converter instantly translates  into "failed real estate agent." But at least I can drop the names of  publications, such as this one, for validation.  </P> <P> "At the beginning, I told people I was in alternative communications," Jacobson  says. "Finally, I got up the courage to tell people I'm a spiritual medium."  That must be some icebreaker at a party. "The reaction is never boring," he  acknowledges. "Either they have to go to the bathroom all of a sudden or they  want to talk all evening."  </P> <P> Mystics are also besieged by curiosity-seekers. "You have to let people know  that you're out having a good time, just like everybody else," says Louise  Woods, a Santa Monica seer who identifies herself as a metaphysical counselor.  "People say, 'Oh, you're psychic. Tell me about this and this.' " She handles  it the way a doctor or a lawyer would. "I give them my business card and tell  them to make an appointment," says Woods. "I don't do house calls."  </P> <P> Speaking of houses . . . "Imagine me trying to get a loan on a home," says  Jacobson, who listed "voice medium" as his occupation on both his loan  application and his tax forms. (Can he claim Dr. Peebles as a dependent? I  wonder.) "It's tough," he says. "You're trying to be credible, but you're doing  something that most people see as incredible."  </P> <P> Actually, I don't think what he does is any more incredible than the theory of  continental drift. But you can't go by me. In my profession, I have to make  numerous leaps of faith. For example, I work on spec.  </P> <P> "I've had a real quandary with business," Jacobson says. "On the one hand,  there's this attitude: If you're so psychic, why don't you make money? But on  the other hand, if you make a lot of money, you're not considered to be very  spiritual."  </P> <P> No matter what you earn, authorities will view you with suspicion. "When I  first started working, I called downtown and asked what statutes were on the  books," says Fern, a Los Angeles astrologer. "They said, 'You have the wrong  office. You need to talk to the Vice Squad.' So I called. They answered the  phone with 'Bunco.' I inquired about getting a business license, and they  sneered, 'What exactly do you do, lady?' "  </P> <P> Actually, Bunco could use someone like Fern. "I'd been reading for a very nice  woman who worked at a bank," she recalls. "And I'd given her some dates for  little things. Then one day she came in and said, 'Oh, Fern, these dates have  worked out real well. Now I want you to do something important. I want you to  pick out a good time for me to do some embezzling.' I said, "Number one, your  chart doesn't look good for that and, number two, I don't do that.' "  </P> <P> Gee, and I thought it was frustrating sitting alone in a room for hours,  staring at a word processor. At least I don't have to divine where and when my  editor will meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger or hold myself up to public  ridicule when my predictions are printed in the National Enquirer. No one  expects miracles from writers, only words.  </P> <P> But some days they don't come easy -- to me anyway. Of course, I haven't taken  any courses in mediumship like Molli Nickell. "I learned automatic writing,"  says Nickell, editor-publisher of Spirit Speaks, an all-ghost-written  Brentwood-based magazine created to share guidance and wisdom from the spirit  plane. "I shift into a meditative state and say a little prayer and ask my  spirit teachers for guidance and words come into my head and I just write."  </P> <P> Right. I'm sitting in front of my computer with my eyes closed. I've said a  little prayer and begged my spirit guides to help me finish this column. That  was an hour ago. And this piece is due by the end of the day. Suddenly, I get a  message.  </P> <P> "We don't work on deadline," the spirits say.  </P></p>

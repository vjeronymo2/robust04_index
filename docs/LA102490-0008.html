			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> HEARING PLANNED ON CONTRACT PROPOSAL  </P> <P> A public hearing on a contract proposal by a union representing 600 Conejo  Valley Unified School District employees is scheduled Thursday.  </P> <P> The California School Employees Assn., representing classified workers, has  proposed a 30% raise over the next three years, plus 15% of the district's  lottery money each year.  </P> <P> For the first time since 1985, the union's proposal would give the workers a  flat percentage raise, instead of basing their raises on the state funding  received by the district.  </P> <P> Area residents will be able to comment on the proposal at the hearing,  scheduled for 7:30 p.m. at Westlake High School.  </P> <P> District officials said they will present their offer at the school board's  Nov. 8 meeting. A second public hearing, to discuss the district's position, is  planned for Nov. 20.  </P> <P> Negotiations on the contract, which expires Dec. 31, are expected to begin in  early December, officials said.  </P> <P> For three years, classified employees -- including secretaries, custodians,  maintenance and food service workers -- received raises ranging from 2.88% to  4.59%, plus 8% of the district's lottery funds.

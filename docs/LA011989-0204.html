			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: IN THIS CASE, BEAUTY IS IN TASTE OF BEHOLDER  </P> <P> Wes Jackson specializes in cooking dishes probably best reserved for blind  tastings.  </P> <P> "They don't look so hot when they go in the oven -- or all that great when they  come out, either," he says of the microwave desserts that have gained him some  culinary note.  </P> <P> "But they taste absolutely wonderful."  </P> <P> So wonderful that two of his original recipes -- the hot fudge pudding cake he  shared with Guys &amp; Galleys and an applesauce cake -- were finalists in the  annual cook-off sponsored by the Times-Picayune paper in New Orleans.  </P> <P> Jackson, 35 and a bachelor, lives in Laguna Niguel when he's not traveling the  Western states in his role as an investigator for the security division of a  nationwide women's specialty apparel company.  </P> <P> He says that while he enjoys cooking a great variety of dishes, invariably it's  the desserts he's asked to bring to a potluck.  </P> <P> "I've done a lot of experimenting with microwave cooking since I got my first  one in 1981 and discovered that the cookbooks that come with the ovens are  generally awful," he says. "The hot fudge pudding cake came about when I was  fooling with different combinations of brown sugar and cocoa."  </P> <P> And it's one dish that looks strange, indeed, when you pop it in the oven.  After spreading in the basic ingredients, you sprinkle on the brown sugar and  cocoa and pour hot water over the whole mixture -- creating a murky substance  floating on top.  </P> <P> Jackson suggests you look the other way and -- like the cook-off judges -- let  your palate decide.  </P> <P> He got into cooking while attending the University of North Carolina, from  which he earned a degree in business administration. "It was a simple matter of  learning to cook or starving to death," he says. Since then, he has  considerably honed his skills in most things except red-meat dishes ("I prefer  chicken or fish and lots of vegetables").  </P> <P> "But for fun, I'm a dessert person."  </P> <P> Each week, Orange County Life features a man who enjoys cooking and a favorite  recipe.

Stir in milk and butter. Pour  mixture into a microwave ring mold or a round glass dish with an inverted  drinking glass in middle. Sprinkle top with mixture of brown sugar and cocoa.  Pour hot water over top (this may run over the side of the dish, so line the  bottom of the oven with paper towels). Cook on high for 5 minutes, rotate dish  and cook 5 more minutes on high. Let stand 5 to 7 minutes and serve warm.  </P></p>

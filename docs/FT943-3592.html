			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Czech fund aims to raise Dollars 45m Oppenheimer &amp; Co, the New York investment bank, and Nikko Securities International are expected next week to launch an investment fund to invest mainly in companies in the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic Fund, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange, plans to raise at least Dollars 45m, though the final figure could be higher depending on investor demand. The fund will have a minimum of 65 per cent of its assets invested in Czech securities, with the balance in other central European countries, including Austria, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. The objective is long-term capital appreciation. Shares in the fund, priced at Dollars 15 each, are expected to be offered to investors on September 26 in the US, Japan and internationally. Quest for Value Advisors and Advantage Advisers, both part of Oppenheimer, have been appointed investment adviser and investment manager respectively to the fund. The fund's regional adviser is BAI Fondsberatung, a subsidiary of Bank Austria Investment Bank. The Czech Republic is the main focus of investment funds targeted at emerging central European markets. Last week, the Robert Fleming-managed Czech and Slovak Investment Corporation said it was raising up to Dollars 25m dollars in additional capital for investment mainly in Czech securities. The country is the only post-communist country to win an investment grade rating from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>

The Mt. Pinos turnoff is at Frazier  Park, north of Gorman (on Interstate 5, halfway from Los Angeles to  Bakersfield). The area provides 14 miles of set track and 21 miles of marked  wilderness trails, ranging in difficulty from easy to advanced. One moderate  3-mile trail with a 600-foot elevation gain reaches the Mt. Pinos summit.  </P> <P> Although Mt. Pinos primarily is a day-use area, snow camping is available in  established campgrounds. Facilities are limited, but cross-country rentals and  lessons, food and some accommodations are available in Frazier Park.  </P> <P>  Recorded information on snow and road conditions is available by calling (805)  245-3449; but the Forest Service will answer specific questions at (805)  245-3731.  </P> <P> BILL STALL  </P></p>

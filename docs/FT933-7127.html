			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Counties seek EC funds to offset defence cuts THE COUNTIES of Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire are making a joint bid for European funding to counter the impact of defence cuts. The counties are lobbying the government, which has until the end of this month to apply to the EC for a Pounds 15m share of the Pounds 100m Konver fund. The fund, announced in April by Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, and set up in June, is to help revitalise areas dependent on the defence industry and military bases. It is the first collaboration by the three counties on such an approach. The bid, announced yesterday, is supported by the counties' training and enterprise councils, by local MPs and MEPs, and by the newly formed Western Development Partnership in Avon, a public and private-sector forum for economic development. Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire depend heavily on the defence industry. Large local employers include British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and Dowty, and there are about 70 military bases. It is estimated that Avon has lost more than 7,000 defence-related jobs in the past six years. The Confederation of British Industry has compared the impact of defence cuts in south-west England to the effect on south Wales of the rundown of the coal and steel industries. The Konver fund will require matching finance from government, local authorities or the private sector. It is subject to the principle of additionality - that it co-finances projects which would otherwise not go ahead and will have additional impact on the areas concerned. The Department of Trade and Industry has to inform Brussels by August 31 of the areas and kinds of project for which it is seeking Konver funds. The DTI would then assess specific projects. A study for the European Commission last year identified 24 EC regions where defence employment was at least double the European average, including Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire, as well as Cornwall/Devon, Hampshire/Isle of Wight, Cumbria and North Yorkshire. Defence company Flight Refuelling is to shed 200 of its 1,000 workers at Wimborne, Dorset, it said yesterday. It blamed cuts in the aerospace and defence industries for the losses, which follow the axing of 100 jobs in March.</p>

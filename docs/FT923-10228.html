			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World News in Brief: UK competitors sent home in drugs scandal Three British compet-itors were sent home in disgrace from the Barcelona Olympics after positive drug tests, in what is one of the most damaging scandals in Britain's Olympic history. Expelled before competing were Jason Livingston, 21, a 100m runner, and weightlifters Andrew Saxton, above, and Andrew Davies, both 25. The drugs tests were conducted in the UK earlier this month, with the results made public yesterday. Livingston tested positive for the anabolic steroid Methandianone. He is known as 'Baby Ben' because of his resemblance to his hero, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who was stripped of the 100m Olympic gold medal at Seoul four years ago after failing a drug test. Davies and Saxton, shown yesterday after returning to his home at Cowley, Oxford, gave test samples containing Clenbuterol, a banned stimulant. Saxton protested his innocence. UK sports minister Robert Key promised there would be 'no hiding place' for cheats. Olympics reports, Page 12</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Nasreen vows to keep up fight Ms Taslima Nasreen, the Bangladeshi writer who fled to Sweden last week to escape extremist Moslem death threats, emerged from hiding yesterday to proclaim she would keep up her fight against 'fundamentalist insanity' in Bangladesh and around the world, Hugh Carnegy reports from Stockholm. Rejecting criticism that her aggressive attacks on the suppression of Moslem women had provoked fundamentalists in a country where they previously had little influence, Ms Nasreen said Bangladesh was becoming less secular, while fundamentalism was 'on the rise'. 'Everyone must speak out clearly and explicitly against fundamentalism wherever it is in the world. One must speak out against the powers of darkness,' she told a press conference in Stockholm. She said women in Bangladesh were 'the slaves of men'. Ms Nasreen, 32, who fled to Sweden while on bail facing charges in Dhaka of promoting religious unrest, said she intended to return home 'when things are cooler', but gave no indication when that might be. In the meantime she intends to visit other western countries, including Norway and France. Moslem fundamentalists in Bangladesh have demanded she be hanged for her outspoken comments and writings.</p>

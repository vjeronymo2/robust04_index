Fernandez made the statement as he was leaving a breakfast  meeting with President Ramon J. Velasquez during which they  analyzed the country's current situation and the issues the  Caldera administration will face.    Eduardo Fernandez insisted that he will not return to the  post of secretary general of his party, indicating that it is a  role he has already fulfilled. He said Copei is a party that  reaches agreements, and that is why it would endorse Caldera's  request for support so he can have the political backing  necessary to manage the country over the next five years.    [Begin Fernandez recording] The magnitude of the country's  problems demands an effort of national understanding and unity.  We must foster a climate to face the country's basic problems.  [end recording]    Asked about the initiative to allow National Convergence to  lead the Senate, he said it is one possibility that must be  analyzed, adding that it is very possible it will become a  reality.</p>

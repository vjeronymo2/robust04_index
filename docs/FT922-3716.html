			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Today's Television Channel 4's consumer affairs programme Check Out 92 (8.30) asks why there is so little discussion of prostate cancer even though it kills 9,000 people a year in Britain. The answer is obvious: the disease occurs exclusively in men and anything exclusive to men is anathema to television. The medium is obsessed by women's rights, beliefs, complaints, emotions and maladies. 'It's a man's world' chants the monstrous regiment and, after 13 years under Mrs Thatcher and 40 under Elizabeth II, we dutifully nod our heads and switch to the week's fourth programme on breast cancer and cervical smears. It is a good night for those who like true stories about secret agents. Timewatch (8.15 BBC2) tells of a Europe-wide terrorist network called 'Gladio'. Inside Story (9.30 BBC1) undertakes to reveal 'the story of Russia's master spies' which until now have been 'shrouded in secrecy'. Really? Channel 4's new series of comedy pilot shows, Bunch Of Five (10.30), began fairly well last week with a sort of 'Young Ones Plus'. This week Frank Skinner is a would-be pop star living with his parents.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS;  </P> <P> PUBLIC'S HELP SOUGHT IN INFANT-DEATH CASE  </P> <P> Police investigators, stymied in their efforts to identify a baby found dead in  a garbage can last week, are turning to the public for help.  </P> <P> Police need information from anyone who may have known or noticed a pregnant  woman who was recently nearing delivery but is now without a newborn.  </P> <P> Investigators have already checked one such tip but it proved false, said Lt.  Phillip Satterfield, who is heading the investigation.  </P> <P> "A child is dead, and we don't have clue one right now," he said.  </P> <P> The body of the newborn girl was found in a garbage can about 6:15 a.m. last  Friday by a groundskeeper at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, at the northern edge of  Cypress. Police are still awaiting autopsy results, but early indications point  to exposure as the cause of death.  </P> <P> Anyone with information on the case should call the Cypress Police Department  at (714) 229-6600.  </P></p>

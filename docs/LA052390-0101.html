			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OXY CHIEF DEFENDS FIRM'S FUNDING OF MUSEUM;  </P> <P> ENERGY: ARMAND HAMMER TELLS SHAREHOLDERS THAT THE OIL COMPANY GAINS GOOD WILL  FROM HIS ART COLLECTION.  </P> <P> Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., on Tuesday defended the  company's controversial support of a $95-million museum being built to house  his private art collection.  </P> <P> In response to questions during Occidental's annual shareholders meeting in  Santa Monica, Hammer said he was donating his collection for the people of Los  Angeles. "Why am I doing this? One reason: You can't take it with you." The  line brought laughter from shareholders.  </P> <P> "The second reason is, I think it's good for Occidental," said the 92-year-old,  apparently healthy chairman. The collection has been seen by millions of people  on tours around the world, he said, bringing Occidental "a lot of good will,  and a lot of the things . . . that Occidental has accomplished have been due to  the good will established by these exhibitions."  </P> <P> The Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center, now under construction  adjacent to Occidental's Westwood headquarters, is scheduled for completion in  November. Total construction and endowment costs will be about $95 million.  </P> <P> Construction of the museum continues while a Delaware court mulls a proposed  settlement of shareholder lawsuits challenging the museum's construction. The  settlement would limit the museum's construction and financing costs and  restrict the amount of money Occidental can give to other Hammer charities.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Hammer said an auditorium shelved when costs ballooned could  now be built as early as next year if private fund-raising efforts succeed. He  said the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York was working with Occidental on  expanding the new museum's bookstore as a way to raise money for the  auditorium.  </P> <P> He also confirmed that he had "irrevocably deeded" ownership of his  $400-million art collection to the controversial museum that will bear his name  and that is being paid for by Occidental.  </P> <P> Hammer signed an agreement to transfer ownership of his collections to the  museum upon his death, an Occidental spokesman said. Until then, the art will  be exhibited in the museum once it opens, but Hammer will retain ownership. The  collections include paintings by old masters and notebooks of Leonardo da  Vinci.  </P> <P> Previously, questions about the art's ownership and provenance have arisen  during court challenges to the museum's construction, with documents disclosing  that Occidental, not Hammer, paid for significant portions of the collections.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Hammer also disputed a claim by Joan Weiss, the sole heir of  Hammer's late wife, Frances Hammer, alleging that Weiss is entitled to a half  interest in Hammer's collection.  </P> <P> Also at Tuesday's meeting:  </P> <P> * Shareholders defeated for the third year in a row a shareholder proposal  setting a mandatory retirement age of 72 for directors. Nine of Occidental's 17  directors are older than 72. For his part, Hammer gave no indication of wanting  to step down despite his age. He turned 92 on Monday.  </P> <P> * Occidental also said it would devote half of its $1.4-billion capital budget  to oil and gas operations and said it plans to drill 35 exploratory wells in  China, Indonesia, Latin America, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan, Syria and the  British North Sea in 1990.  </P></p>

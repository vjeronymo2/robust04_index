			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Shanghai rebuffs foreign traders THE SHANGHAI Metal Exchange has rejected applications from several major overseas firms, saying China is not yet ready for foreign members, according to official reports, reports Reuter from Beijing. The exchange's deputy director, Mr Hu Yuezheng, quoted by the official China Daily, said American Express, Merrill Lynch and Samsung Company of South Korea had sought seats on the exchange but were refused. 'The time is not ripe,' Mr Hu said. 'We will not rush into recruiting international members, as foreign organisations have started trading in (the exchange) through Chinese members.' Mr Hu said foreign members could not be recruited as long as the quality of Chinese metal lagged behind international standards, the futures trading rules did not conform to international norms and a multi-currency exchange system was not in place to facilitate settlement. The Shanghai Metal Exchange has 55 Chinese members serving nearly 1,700 clients. Trading was active in the first half of 1993. By the end of June, turnover had reached 145bn yuan (Pounds 16.8bn) - three times the total for the whole of 1992, the China Daily said.</p>

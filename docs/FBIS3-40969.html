			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva January 25 TASS -- Will nuclear weapons  testing grounds be finally closed? The solution of this  problem, on which politicians, military leaders and diplomats  have been racking their brains for several past decades, may be  brought closer by the annual session of the UN disarmament  conference, which opened here today.    Having completed in 1992 the elaboration of a convention to  ban chemical weapons, it is now getting down to the discussion  of the problem of an all-embracing ban on nuclear tests. The  session is being attended by delegations from 37 states-members  of the conference, including Russia.    "The banning of tests is a very important measure, primarily  from the viewpoint of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,"  Grigoriy Berdennikov, Russia's permanent representative, told  ITAR-TASS. "It is not a matter of concluding a treaty among the  nuclear powers alone, but a matter of complete and universal  prohibition of tests in all the countries of the world. This  will guarantee us against the emergence of a new possessor of  nuclear weapons."    The Geneva session is particularly important in light of  current preparations for a conference of signatories of the  nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty, scheduled for 1995.  This conference may adopt a decision to prolong the treaty  forever.    "The idea of fully banning nuclear tests was advanced by  Jawaharlal Nehru in 1954. We have traditionally backed this  initiative," Berdennikov added. "The treaty to ban tests in  three media was concluded in 1963. We have also signed a treaty  with the Americans to restrict the yield of nuclear tests. We  are observing a moratorium on tests for several years now.  Everybody admits that it has created a good background for  talks in Geneva."    "The main problem after the end of the `Cold War' is to save  the world from the `spreading' of mass destruction weapons and  means for their delivery," the Russian representative said. "It  is very important to reach agreement on security guarantees to  non-nuclear state and on stopping the output of fissionable  materials. The current session of the conference will also  focus its attention on these problems."</p>

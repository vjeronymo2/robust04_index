			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOORPARK STUDENT WINS THE STATE'S FIRST CITIZEN BEE  </P> <P> California's first Citizen Bee, matching 33 high school finalists in  competition covering American history, geography, economics, politics, culture  and current events, was won Saturday by an 11th grader from Ventura County --  on his 17th birthday.  </P> <P> Stephanus Philip of Moorpark, a student at Chaminade College Preparatory, a  private Roman Catholic school in the San Fernando Valley community of West  Hills, was declared the state winner in the 27th round in head-on competition  with Margaret Kuo, 17, of San Clemente High School.  </P> <P> Stephanus, Margaret and third-place winner Ken Kuniyuki, an 11th grader from  Torrance High School, now advance to national competition on June 17 in  Washington, where they will face 73 other contestants from 28 states.  </P> <P> Margaret, a 12th grader who was born in Taipei but has lived in the United  States since she was 1 year old, is the first girl to reach the national finals  in four years of Citizen Bee competition. Stephanus was declared the winner  after he had correctly answered two questions in a row after a miss by  Margaret.  </P> <P> Asked to identify the name commonly given to laws passed by Southern  legislatures after the Civil War to keep blacks from voting and to identify one  such measure, Stephanus replied, "Black codes and literacy tests." He then  correctly identified the Northeast as the region that lost the most seats in  the House of Representatives after the 1980 census.  </P> <P> The first five winners in Saturday's competition, patterned after a spelling  bee, received cash awards.  </P> <P> Pedro Cardenas, a Garfield High senior, placed fifth and collected $250.

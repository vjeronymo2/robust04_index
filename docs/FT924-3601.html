			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Management: Ex-pats and Poles apart Three years after the collapse of communism in Poland, managers recruited locally by foreign companies are experiencing the frustrations of reporting to expatriate superiors. There are at least 1,000 locally-recruited Polish managers working for foreign companies. By offering high salaries (by local standards) the foreign companies were able to cream off the best of the experienced managerial talent as well as attract young graduates. But one expatriate management consultant says: 'The younger staff are beginning to get bored now that they have learned the jobs that they were taken on to do.' Marius Bialek, from H Neumann, an Austrian management consulting company, says: 'I know there is something wrong when good people I recruited a year ago come to me looking for another job.' He believes some frustration will be alleviated by sending the more talented managers to run new offices elsewhere in eastern Europe. As for those who leave, few are likely to seek jobs with Polish-owned companies. Instead they will look to other multinationals. One reason is pay. A senior executive working for a Polish company earns about Dollars 12,000 (Pounds 7,900) a year although top salaries can go as high as Dollars 80,000. Foreign companies pay between Dollars 28,000 and Dollars 72,000 to locally-recruited senior executives. That contrasts, however, with the Dollars 60,000 to Dollars 200,000 a year their expatriate colleagues and superiors are earning. But the era of the expatriate manager in Poland may be limited. Gaspol, for example, is a joint venture between a number of Polish liquified petroleum gas distributors and the UK's Calor group, Primagaz of France and SHV from Holland. Bob West, the managing director, says 'The four expatriates in place should be out of here in three years. After all, I shall never know the market, the language and the country as well as the local people.'</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Arts: Monteverdi a la grecque - Opera Though the English Bach Festival may be in deep financial trouble, its founder-director Lina Lalandi is determined that it will go down, if it must, with all flags proudly flying. The EBF's Monteverdi at Covent Garden on Sunday - his noble L'Orfeo, realised with scrupulous 'period' attention to the composer's musical plan (but no castrati) - may even have had its last performance as well as its first, should its provisional Spanish tour misfire. EBF productions are prepared to a very high standard, very expensively; here, the price of seats in the Royal Opera stalls left too many of them unfilled. Spanish readers should insist upon hearing this Orfeo with all the Latin urgency at their command; it is far too good to be left dangling. It is not exactly a 'revelation', as some earlier baroque excursions by the EBF have been; for after centuries of neglect this 1607 opera has lately been taken up far and wide - in widely different versions and adaptations, some aiming no less keenly at 'authenticity'. But Sunday's performance was satisfying, beautiful, and beautifully consistent in its own particular terms. Those terms were special, though never eccentric. On the one hand, the music was entrusted to period-specialist singers (17 of them, many doubling as solo personae and as choristers) and period-instrument players of a high calibre. The roll-call of the latter matched Monteverdi's specified crew closely; divided between the front corners of the stage - each team boasting its own imposing viola da gamba - their virtuosity and their vividly various timbres conquered the flat Royal Opera acoustic brilliantly. We have heard leaner 'authentic' treatments of the music, but the richer, boldly dramatic contrasts here sounded plausible as could be. On the other hand, the customary EBF concern with visual period-details was suspended in favour of Getting Back to the Greek (Miss Lalandi is Greek.) Instead of replicating the costumes, stage-gestures and dances of Monteverdi's Renaissance time, Tom Hawkes's production was dressed in faithful Ancient Greek clothes - with more sophisticated dyes, perhaps - and antique-style crowns and bracelets by the jeweller Ilias Lalaounis, enacted with restrained, stylised gestures, and in homely choreography by Sarah Cremer. To have shepherds skipping in circles, short chitons and big rustic smiles was a bit of a risk, but nobody actually laughed. The considered depths of the opera were made too palpable for frivolous reactions. Against Howard Williams' vital account of the score, the solo singers and the well-tuned chorus stood out superbly, searching out the expressive force of Monteverdi's lines. The one weakness was their foggy Italian (Monteverdi cared enormously about the words): in the Prologue Naomi Harvey's prettily-sung 'La Musica' was particularly muzzy. Marilyn Hill Smith was a poised Eurydice with a matronly grace, Della Jones a fine, quietly intense Messenger. In the title-part the baritone Russell Smythe was properly heroic, alight with passionate feeling, and with all the necessary resources - Monteverdi's Orpheus is a cruelly taxing sing - to carry him through the great plaints of Acts 3 and 5. Among the lesser players the bass Graeme Broadbent gave splendid weight to Pluto, lord of the underworld, but to praise his colleagues fairly would require listing all of them. Peter Rice's basic design, an elegant three-doored temple frontage, sometimes became transparent to afford visions further back, notably a tableau of Charon ferrying the dead across the Styx. It all hung together, without fuss; we felt we were hearing Monteverdi plain, and very rewarding it was. Sponsor: AG Leventis Foundation</p>

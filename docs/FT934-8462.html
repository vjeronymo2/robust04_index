			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Brussels clears telecoms venture THE European Commission has cleared a joint venture between 12 of the world's largest telecommunications groups, aimed at providing specialised communication services between financial centres. But the Financial Network Association, which includes six European companies, had to give special undertakings that it would not discriminate against private service suppliers. The FNA also undertook not to use revenue from 'reserved' monopoly services to subsidise services such as data transmission, which are already open to competition. The FNA, set up in March 1992, will offer worldwide services to financial institutions through the networks of the companies involved. They are: France Telecom, Belgacom, the Belgian state telecoms company, Italcable of Italy, Mercury Communications of the UK, Telfonica of Spain, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom of Germany, Telstra of Australia, Hong Kong Telecom, KDD of Japan, MCI of the US, Singapore Telecom and Stentor of Canada.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> They ought to penalize Andre Agassi by making him play tennis tournaments  instead of banning him. . . .  </P> <P> With all the quarterbacks going down these days, what was the purpose of  keeping Joe Montana on the field in the closing moments of a game San Francisco  was winning, 26-10? . . .  </P> <P> The Rams' 2-6 home record isn't the worst in club history. They were 0-7 at the  Coliseum in 1962, the year they went 1-12-1 and Bob Waterfield was replaced by  Harland Svare in midseason. . . .  </P> <P> Wonder how much those Georgia Frontiere autographs will be worth in five years.  . . .  </P> <P> I still don't know how Henry Ellard held onto the ball after taking a Ronnie  Lott kind of shot from Dave Waymer. . . .  </P> <P> The Rams and 49ers proved that NFL games can last 3 hours 8 minutes even  without a lot of instant replay reviews. . . .  </P> <P> One reason it's easier to win on the road in football than in basketball is  that football officials aren't swayed so much by crowds. . . .  </P> <P> The way Frank Gifford talks about Southern California, you would never know  that he was raised in Bakersfield and played for USC. . . .  </P> <P> If you're looking for a quiet way to celebrate New Year's Eve, tune in the  Rams-New Orleans game on ABC. . . .  </P> <P> The Raiders should give their "Commitment to Excellence" award to Howie Long  for the first time. . . .  </P> <P> No list of NFL coach-of-the-year candidates would be complete without Art  Shell. . . .  </P> <P> Tim Belcher is expected to be at full strength for the opening of the season,  meaning the Dodgers will be less tempted to rush Orel Hershiser back into the  starting rotation. . . .  </P> <P> Just how good is Greg Smith, the young second baseman the Dodgers acquired from  the Chicago Cubs? Some people think he's ready to start for most teams that  don't have Ryne Sandberg.  </P> <P> But Baseball America rated him only the seventh-best prospect in the Cub farm  system. . . .  </P> <P> New Dodger publicist Jay Lucas has named his temporary office in a trailer,  "Deals on Wheels." . . .  </P> <P> Another Brett Butler plus is that he hit nearly as well against left-handed  pitching (.302) as against right-handed (.313) last season. . . .  </P> <P> Something is wrong with the system when Ken Griffey is making more money than  Ken Griffey Jr. . . .  </P> <P> Look-alikes: Dan Reeves and sportscaster Ed Arnold. . . .  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas and Princeton, who play tonight, have at least two things in  common: They're unbeaten and nationally ranked. . . .  </P> <P> Arkansas is the only school that has both men's and women's basketball teams  ranked in the top 10. . . .  </P> <P> Lloyd Arnold, president and co-owner of Los Alamitos Race Course, is a finalist  for the Proximity Award, which recognizes contributions made to harness racing.  . . .  </P> <P> Lee Trevino's decision to leave NBC for the senior golf tour was much wiser  than John Brodie's. . . .  </P> <P> The bad news out of those Coliseum remodeling discussions was that the Raiders  and Trojans probably will have to play somewhere else for two seasons instead  of one. . . .  </P> <P> Anaheim is closer to landing an indoor soccer franchise than a hockey or  basketball team. . . .  </P> <P> Scott Davis has become a common name in sports. There are the Raider defensive  lineman, the 800-meter runner, the pole vaulter, the tennis player, and the  10th man on Virginia's basketball team. . . .  </P> <P> Promoters Bob Arum and Lou Duva are about to sign a contract with Warner-Time  for monthly pay-per-view TV shows beginning with the Evander Holyfield-George  Foreman heavyweight title fight April 19. . . .  </P> <P> Former middleweight champion Vito Antuofermo plays a bodyguard in "Godfather  III." . . .  </P> <P> The Mike Tyson-Razor Ruddock fight could end the Mirage's string of stinkers.  </P> <P> Remember when the Rams were headed to the Super Bowl and the Raiders to  Oakland?  </P></p>

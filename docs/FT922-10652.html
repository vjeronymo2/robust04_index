			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland's results may pass unremarked by a market obsessed by developments at Midland. Its cost performance bears scrutiny all the same. Though high by the standards of other clearers, a 13 per cent increase in costs seems more reasonable when set against a 12 per cent increase in assets, not to mention a 26 per cent increase in other operating income. The cost/income ratio fell slightly to 54 per cent and would have been just 48 per cent without the loss of Pounds 108m in interest on non-performing loans. How does Bank of Scotland manage to stay in a different league? Given the debate over rationalisation in banking, the answer is instructive. It relies heavily on electronic delivery of services and has eschewed the temptation to develop an extensive branch network south of the border where its loan book has been growing strongest.</p>

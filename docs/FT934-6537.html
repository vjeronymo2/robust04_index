			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Delta puts plans for Asia route expansion on hold Delta Air Lines has put on hold earlier plans to launch a big expansion of its Asia-Pacific operations. Mr Ron Allen, chairman, said yesterday the airline wanted to concentrate on returning sustained profits. Delta - the third-largest carrier in the US - is now consolidating its route structure and considering setting up a low-cost domestic subsidiary. It moved out of the red with a net profit of Dollars 60.4m for its first quarter, ended September. However, the latest results, while encouraging, were still 'not adequate', Mr Allen said. The airline is in the middle of a four-year cost-cutting plan. 'We are looking at every route very critically, Mr Allen said. 'We will reallocate equipment and resources.' He said the first phase of this process would involve the airline's North American operations. The second phase could involve setting up a lower-cost domestic US airline operation to compete with smaller low-cost carriers. United Airlines is also considering a similar move. Mr Allen said Delta was continuing to seek partnerships with other international carriers to reinforce its worldwide network. Delta holds cross equity links with Swissair and Singapore Airlines, and is understood to be in discussions with Virgin Atlantic. However, its prospects on the highly-competitive transatlantic routes also hinged on the US securing a new open skies agreement with the UK. The UK and US are locked in controversy over negotiations on a new agreement between the two countries. The UK last week threatened to limit the number of US airline services to London's Heathrow airport in retaliation to US efforts to curtail British Airways' rights in the US market. Mr Allen said the US government would consider refusing BA an extension of its ticket code-sharing agreement with USAir when it runs out on March 15, unless the UK showed 'more openness' towards US carriers. 'Most US carriers believe in open skies, but we can't keep giving away code sharing without getting reciprocal rights in the UK,' he said. He complained that Delta suffered a bigger disadvantage than its two US rivals, American Airlines and United, because it had no rights to fly to Heathrow and continued to be restricted to London's Gatwick airport. 'We have no rights to fly from the UK to other European points; no authority at Heathrow; we can't serve New York; and our capacity is controlled,' he said. The collapse this week of the Alcazar merger attempt between Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Austrian Airlines, over the choice of a US partner airline had not weakened Delta's relationship with Swissair. Mr Allen said he had been encouraged that Swissair had insisted that Delta be chosen as the US partner for the thwarted Alcazar project. After the improvement in its first fiscal quarter, Mr Allen said the second quarter was likely to be more difficult. Results would also be affected by a Dollars 100m charge to cover the cost of an early retirement programme designed to produce annual savings of between Dollars 68m and Dollars 70m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Netherlands Turnout Almost Lowest </F> in Europe"]    [Text] The Netherlands turnout of 35.6 percent at the  elections for the European Parliament (EP) was one of the lowest  in Europe.    The distribution of seats among the 31 Netherlands  representatives at the EP was in line with forecasts at the  close of voting on Thursday [9 June]. The CDA [Christian  Democratic Appeal] wins 10 seats, the PvdA [Labor Party] eight,  the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] six, D66  [Democrats 66] four, the coalition comprising the Political  Reformed Party, the Reformed Political Union, and the  Reformational Political Federation wins two seats, and the Green  Left one.    The leaders of the main parties expressed disappointment at  the low turnout among Netherlands voters for the European  elections. VVD leader Bolkestein finds the low turnout, not only  in the Netherlands but in other European countries too, grounds  for reflection on the future of the European Union (EU). At the  VVD party council on Saturday, he stated that the EU must  reflect upon some essential questions. "Europe does not seem to  be sufficiently relevant to the voter," Bolkestein stated.    The biggest winner in the European elections in the  Netherlands was D66, increasing its seats from one to four. The  VVD doubled its seats from three to six. Bolkestein described  this as a "good result." But given the low turnout, he does not  believe the results can be taken as indicative of the results of  a national election.    The CDA and the PvdA remain at their former levels with 10  and eight seats, but their actual loss of support was masked by  the fact that the number of Netherlands seats in the EP has been  increased from 25 to 31. The small Christian parties increased  their seats from one to two. The Green Left was the only real  loser, down from two to one seat.    PvdA leader Kok does not believe the results can be compared  to the national political situation. He described the turnout  as "very poor." The Netherlands Euro MP's will have a hard job  in making people feel more concerned by Europe, Kok believes.  CDA leader Brinkman also described the turnout as  disappointing. The good score achieved by the CDA is  "encouraging" Brinkman stated on Saturday at the CDA party  council. Opinion polls had predicted a sharp fall in CDA  support.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Hoseyni Khamene'i, leader of the </F> Islamic revolution, to lecturers, teachers, and workers at Imam  Khomeyni's prayer house marking the week honoring teachers and  workers on 4 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate the  merciful. [passage omitted] I would like to take the  opportunity today to talk about the fact that there are two  points of view in our country and in many so-called Third World  countries.    One view is that the people, the enlightened, and the  decision-makers of the country must rely on a world-dominant  power to build their country and make a future for their  country. [passage omitted] That is one view. It exists in  backward countries. Those who have studied geopolitics know  that it exists in Latin America and in some Asian and African  countries. Some enlightened people and politicians believe  this. [passage omitted]    I very much regret to say that there are, unfortunately,  some  people in some parts of our country today who still have the  same view. They are still under the influence of the remnants  of ideas and tastes of past puppets of the West and the United  States. That is one view.    Another view says no to this: We are a nation; we have  certain capabilities; we must adopt the principle of utilizing  our own capabilities. Of course, if we are ever stuck and see  that someone else has better tools, we will go and borrow his  tools and do our job. Then we will try to manufacture those  tools ourselves. That is a sensible thing to do. [passage  omitted] To a nation, that means scientific, practical,  technical, cultural, and all-round independence. From the  beginning the revolution has pursued this form of independence.    Some other countries have followed this path. Countries  which were nearly razed to the ground after World War II -- as  is usually exaggerated in reports -- have risen and taken care  of themselves and used their own manpower. By managing their  worldly affairs they have today surpassed those who brought such  misery to them in the war. It can be done. That is the other  view.    The aim of our imam [Khomeyni] -- God be satisfied with him  -- was to say to our nation: O people of Iran, O Iranian youths,  O Iranian workers, O Iranian engineers, O Iranian managers, you  can do it without relying on foreigners. The imam wanted to  revive in us the spirit of self-reliance.    Over the last few decades people have said: Iranians? No,  sir! They joked that domestic goods are not quality products.  There is no greater injustice to a nation. Our  domestically-produced goods are today in many instances much  better than foreign-made goods. [passage omitted]    We have many resources. I tell you from the bottom of my  heart, if anyone wishes to know, that my real aspiration is that  one day we can turn off the oil well taps and base our economy  on something other than oil. Let us imagine this country  without oil. [audience shouts approval] Of course, this may not  be practical for some time. During the era of the subservient  and corrupt Pahlavi regime, the enemies of Iran did a great deal  of sabotage by making this nation and this country dependent on  oil. The sabotage done was much greater than can be imagined,  and it makes it impossible for us to realize this aspiration  easily. But this must be done one day. Such a day will come  when the Iranian nation utilizes its innate intelligence to stop  handing these assets to those, who with utmost wickedness,  exploit the national wealth of oil producing countries. On such  a day this nation will be able to stand on its own two feet.    Today, unfortunately, things are different. Thanks to the  betrayal of some oil producing countries, and thanks to their  complicity with the international plundering thieves, oil has  today become a tool in the hands of the consumers instead of  serving the interests of the oil producing states by benefiting  them politically and economically. It has become like an  inferior commodity, whereas it is a commodity without which the  world would have no light, no heat, no movement, and no  industry. Without oil, the modern industrial civilization,  which is founded on machinery, would grind to a halt. This is  how important our oil is. When I say our oil, I mean the oil of  the entire region and the oil resources of the world. Of  course, this region possesses the main resources, and those  states which have joined hands with the plunderers unfortunately  possess the major part of these oil resources.    This very valuable commodity has become a tool in the hand  of  the consumers, and they are also very dependent on it. They  began planning a policy such as this dozen of years ago and it  has today reached fruition. Unfortunately, a handful of  treacherous statesmen of the subservient states cooperate with  them.    Imagine, however, that the Iranian nation, Iranian workers,  Iranian youth, Iranian producers, and Iranian teachers were to  concentrate all their efforts and zeal to build this country by  altering its exports/imports ratio, by reducing consumer demand  and foreign currency requirements, and by building this country  in such a way as to make it free from having to sell its oil at  such a low price. If all this were to happen, can you imagine  what great benefits such efforts would bring to this country  today and in the future? How could this be possible? It would  be possible when the Iranian worker regards work as true  worship. [passage omitted]    May God bestow his success upon all of us that we may  understand our obligations and perform our tasks accordingly,  God willing. May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you  all.</p>

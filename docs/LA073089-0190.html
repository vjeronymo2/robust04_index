			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCANDALIZED BY 'SCANDAL'  </P> <P> The Travel Section is my favorite reading of the week. Doublefold then was my  shock and disgust at the tasteless article by Andrew Marton, "A Scandalous Tour  of Washington" (July 16). Has the Travel Section stooped to trash and scandal  techniques as TV and yellow journalism (have)? I hope not. The article has no  place in (the) wholesome, intellectual, if you will, pursuit of normal American  entertainment. We look to the Travel Section for enjoyment and helpful tips on  places to go, what to see. Not this trash.  </P> <P> I hope that Jerry Hulse, Judith Morgan, Peter Greenberg and (Bob) O'Sullivan  will continue their valuable contributions to our enjoyment and that you will  leave the above to the scandal rags.  </P> <P> VIRGINIA MACKOOL  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Revenue 'key to Nadir probe' MR MICHAEL ALLCOCK, the Inland Revenue investigator alleged by Mr Michael Mates, former Northern Ireland minister, to have first blown the whistle on Mr Asil Nadir by tipping off the Stock Exchange, has given his first detailed account of the close links he says he cultivated with the Stock Exchange. He told the Financial Times that he had close contacts with the Stock Exchange's surveillance unit for nearly 10 years, and that without the help of the Revenue the complex transactions involving Swiss companies could not have been penetrated. Mr Allcock was the head of SO-2, the Revenue's crack investigative unit. In that capacity he investigated the personal tax affairs of Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck International, who fled to northern Cyprus to escape trial on charges of theft and fraud. Mr Allcock was suspended on full pay after allegations of bribery last autumn. Mr Allcock said SO-2 had been given a loose rein by the Revenue. 'You were expected to use your initiative . . . my specific area was the Stock Exchange.' According to Mr Allcock strong informal links were built up between SO-2 and the Stock Exchange's surveillance unit specialising in insider-dealing investigations from 1984 onwards. 'I became a very close friend with a number of individuals working for the Stock Exchange . . . We regularly met for lunch or a beer. We took turns to entertain each other and as a result I was given a lot of information and documents about various individuals, brokers and transactions ranging from multi-file share applications on government issues to share dealings in tax haven companies'. The Stock Exchange has indicated that the SFO's raids on Mr Nadir's offices was based on information gathered over several years. But Mr Allcock claims that the Stock Exchange 'for political reasons' is trying to downplay the strong links between the two agencies. He said how he first became involved in the Nadir case. 'The first I knew that the Swiss companies had something to do with Nadir was when a broker identified one of the companies as being linked to Nadir. The broker had met Nadir's son Birol on a number of occasions.' The information was linked to the activities of various Geneva-based companies which SO-2 subsequently discovered to be linked to Polly Peck share dealings. 'The Stock Exchange investigators worked with me with open arms . . . They knew that their investigative powers were very limited . . . the self-regulatory powers were a joke. They gave us sheets and sheets of information on various trading transactions involving Swiss companies . . . The Exchange built up a portfolio but never managed to get behind the companies.' According to Mr Allcock, SO-2 discovered that many of the transactions linked to Mr Nadir's business empire were cleared through the bank accounts of Turkish students working in London. Mr Allcock emphasised that the information exchanged between SO-2 and the Stock Exchange had 'nothing to do with Mr Nadir's personal tax affairs'. While Mr Allcock insisted he had never passed information directly to the SFO on the Nadir case, it is understood that there was co-operation on other cases. Mr Allcock confirmed that two days after the SFO raid on South Audley Management, a property management company that handled the Nadir family's private affairs, he and his colleague Mr Richard Cook attended a meeting at Vizards, then Mr Nadir's solicitors. He said he and Mr Cook had been anxious to reassure Vizards that SO-2 was not leaking information to the SFO, as had been alleged to Mr Allcock by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Mr Nadir's accountants, who had threatened to cease all further co-operation with the Revenue on identifying Mr Nadir's personal tax affairs. 'The SFO raid was a monumental disaster from a Revenue point of view as the publicity provoked a share price collapse and undermined attempts to get more tax owed to us back from Mr Nadir.' Until then SO-2 is understood to have succeeded in obtaining 'substantial sums of corporate and personal tax owed by Nadir'. Sources involved in the SFO raid at the time insist that large sums of illegally obtained funds were unaccounted for by the Stock Exchange, the Revenue, and the SFO at the time and are still unaccounted for. During a taped interview last autumn with officials of the Board's Investigation Office, the Revenue's disciplinary committee, Mr Allcock was shown a copy of an agenda of a meeting to be held between himself, an Iraqi businessman and an accountant. At the bottom of the memo were handwritten the words 'pay off Pounds 25'. Mr Allcock said: 'I was asked what the 'pay off' meant. I was quite hurt. I said couldn't answer it, it had nothing to do with me . . . I have never been offered bribes, nor have I ever sought them.'</p>

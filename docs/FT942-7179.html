			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sluggish earnings for JR East East Japan Railway (JR East), the semi-privatised railway group, posted sluggish earnings figures for the year to last March due to a decline in revenue from its passenger operations. Consolidated pre-tax profits fell 1.8 per cent to Y108.6bn (Dollars 1bn), on a 0.4 per cent fall in the group's revenue to Y2,343.35bn. After-tax profits fell 0.2 per cent to Y56.7bn. The company said its poor performance in the railway operations eroded the gains from sales increases in its kiosks, travel agent and real estate leasing division. On a non-consolidated basis, JR East posted a 0.6 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y101.5bn thanks to a Y20bn fall in interest payments due to lower interest rates. Revenues fell 0.3 per cent fall to Y1,974.35bn and after-tax profits fell 0.4 per cent to Y56.7bn. For the current year to next March, the company expects consolidated pre-tax profits to remain almost flat, down 0.8 per cent to Y109.6bn, on a 6.7 per cent rise in sales to Y2,502.5bn.</p>

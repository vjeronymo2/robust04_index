			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to approve Virginia's implementation schedule which began on November 15, 1992 for several reasons. First, EPA recognizes that the date by which the Commonwealth was required to adopt Stage II regulations matches the date by which the Commonwealth was required to submit the regulations to EPA. Thus, Virginia could have waited to adopt the Stage II regulations on November 15, 1992 and still have met the required submittal date. Second, the implementation date established by the Commonwealth, November 15, 1992, began shortly after the adoption date of the regulation. Third, the Commonwealth would have a limited ability to remedy this deficiency. If Virginia chose to withdraw it SIP revision and readopt this Stage II requirement, the time table could be based upon a date that is later than November 15, 1992. Finally, EPA believes the Virginia rule otherwise fulfills the Stage II requirements and will provide substantial air quality benefits to the regulated areas. Therefore, EPA believes it is in the public interest to approve and make federally enforceable Virginia's Stage II regulation at the earliest time feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Additional Program Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with EPA's guidance, the Commonwealth requires that Stage II systems be tested and certified to meet a 95 percent emission reduction efficiency by using a system certified by the California Air Resources Board. Additionally, Virginia requires that Stage II systems employed to comply with this program utilize coaxial vapor recovery hose check valves that do not impede the performance of Stage II functional tests. The Commonwealth requires subject facilities to verify proper installation and function of Stage II equipment through use of a liquid blockage test, a vapor space tie test and a pressure decay/leak test prior to system operation. Additionally, every five years, or upon major modification of a facility (i.e. 75 percent or more equipment change), or if requested after an inspection by the Commonwealth that shows evidence of a system malfunction, the source must conduct a liquid blockage test and a pressure decay/leak test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to recordkeeping, the Commonwealth has adopted those items recommended in EPA's guidance and specifies that sources subject to Stage II must make the following documents available upon request: (1) A license or permit to install and operate a Stage II system; (2) results of verification tests; (3) equipment maintenance and compliance file logs indicating compliance with manufacturer's specifications and requirements; and (4) training certification files. In addition, Virginia requires facilities that are not subject to Stage II to maintain files containing the gasoline throughput of the facility and make them available upon request by the DEQ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virginia has indicated that it plans to conduct a compliance inspection for each subject facility at least one time per year with follow-up inspections at noncomplying facilities. These inspections will include both visual and functional equipment inspections. For a detailed listing of the tests to be conducted at the annual inspections, see the technical support document for this action. The Commonwealth has authority to enforce violations of the Stage II requirements, as set forth in Rule 4&hyph;37 and Virginia's policies and procedures document entitled, ``Procedures for Implementation of Regulations Covering Stage II Vapor Recovery Systems for Gasoline Dispensing Facilities'' (AQP&hyph;9). This enforcement authority is found in &sect;10.1&hyph;1307.3 of the Code of Virginia. For further information on Virginia's enforcement authority and penalty limits for this program, please refer to the technical support document for this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Regulatory Changes Affecting Other Petroleum Storage and Transfer Operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 5, 1992, Virginia's State Air Pollution Control Board adopted an amended version of its regulations entitled ``Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution''; VR 120&hyph;01, Rule 4 37, &sect;&sect;120&hyph;04&hyph;3701 to 120&hyph;04&hyph;3715 (effective date_January 1, 1993). Virginia submitted this revised rule to EPA on November 5, 1992 for the purposes of satisfying the Stage II requirements set forth in the Act. However, Virginia's Rule 4&hyph;37 consolidates Stage II vapor recovery requirements for gasoline dispensing facilities with existing regulations that establish Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) related to petroleum liquid storage and transfer categories, including: Stage I vapor recovery, floating and fixed roof petroleum storage tanks, and gasoline bulk plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

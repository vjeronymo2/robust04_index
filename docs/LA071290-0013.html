			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS WARN OF FIRE DANGER DUE TO HUGE BUILDUP OF BRUSH;  </P> <P> PENINSULA: THREE BLAZES IN A WEEK HAVE MADE RESIDENTS FEARFUL. THE DENSE BRUSH  IN INACCESSIBLE CANYONS HAS SPARKED THE GREATEST CONCERN.  </P> <P> In the wake of three brush fires on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in less than a  week -- including one Wednesday -- city and fire officials are warning that a  massive brush buildup in the past few years poses a serious threat to houses,  though they are hundreds of feet from wooded areas.  </P> <P> The most recent fire charred about two acres of grassy hillside in the gated  community of Rolling Hills on a hot but windless morning. It caused about  $3,000 in damage to a barn and resulted in a minor injury to a horse named  Lucky. Firefighters surrounded the blaze just as it was heading into a deep  canyon filled with years of accumulated, highly incendiary sage brush.  </P> <P> "If there were wind, God knows what could have happened," said Councilwoman  Gordana Swanson.  </P> <P> Swanson added that the three fires -- and the Santa Barbara fires that  destroyed hundreds of homes -- have raised fears among her neighbors that the  Palos Verdes Peninsula might be the next hot spot.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County Fire Battalion Chief Rene Rigaud urged homeowners in the  exclusive peninsula communities to clear brush beyond the 100- or 130-feet  perimeter required by city ordinances.  </P> <P> "We are informing people that they may need 200 feet of clearance," Rigaud  said. "We find that cooperation has increased since the Santa Barbara fire and  the three fires in the area. We are getting phone calls from people for us to  come out and inspect."  </P> <P> Citing a recently completed Fire Department survey of brush conditions on the  peninsula, he said that brush is now so high and dense that a fire "can develop  flame lengths of 70 feet when it is going up slope. With wind, from 70 to 100  feet."  </P> <P> Typical winds can carry flying embers much farther, he added.  </P> <P> "Last month, we had a fire on the Palos Verdes Estates golf course, in a small  canyon in some heavy brush, with just a little bit of wind, the ocean breeze.  We had five (fire) starts on a wood roof 600 feet away. That is what worries  us."  </P> <P> In 1973, 13 homes in Rolling Hills were destroyed in the worst fire on the  Palos Verdes Peninsula within memory.  </P> <P> The Wednesday morning fire was caused when live wires from an exploding  transformer landed in dry grass, Rigaud said. Fire investigators suspect  firecrackers as the cause of a Saturday blaze that burned about four acres in  Rancho Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> The largest fire on the peninsula this season, which burned 10 acres near the  Palos Verdes Golf Course last Thursday, was started by children playing with  matches, Rigaud said.  </P> <P> "We have been able to hit them hard and heavy with a lot of manpower and  surround them," Rigaud said. About 120 firefighters responded to the most  recent blaze. Two helicopters hovered overhead but were not used.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates Councilwoman Ruth Gralow said that the ability of the  county Fire Department to overwhelm a fire with heavy concentrations of  personnel and equipment was a major reason the seaside municipality switched  from its own Fire Department to the larger county unit four years ago.  </P> <P> She said the county department's success during the last week shows that the  city made the right choice.  </P> <P> But, despite success in battling the fires so far, Rigaud said he worries about  sage brush -- 20 tons per acre -- lying in inaccessible canyons that might form  a route for fire between neighborhoods. Sage is particularly combustible  because of its high oil content. "The brush gets to seven to eight feet high"  in some canyons, he said.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Councilwoman Ginny Leeuwenburgh, who observed the Wednesday fire,  said that canyon is a particular concern because it is loaded with brush and  runs from land-locked Rolling Hills Estates clear to the ocean.  </P> <P> Fire officials are conducting a detailed survey of the property lines and brush  concentrations in an effort to work out an abatement program with the peninsula  municipalities, which pride themselves on a natural, rustic look.  </P> <P> Walter Warriner, Rancho Palos Verdes superintendent of parks and Palos Verdes  Estates city forester, said officials are putting fire safety above preserving  the pristine conditions in undeveloped areas.  </P> <P> "We do have natural parkland areas in Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes  Estates," he said. "However, we do have a very aggressive weed abatement  program. We respond to any and all requests from the Fire Department."  </P> <P> "In our city, where a quarter of our area is parkland," said Gralow, "our  maintenance guys are working all the time to keep the brush down to Fire  Department standards."  </P> <P> In addition to brush concentrations, Rigaud said that many houses with wood  shake roofs pose an extreme risk in a fire. The houses that were lost in the  1973 fire all had shake roofs, he said.  </P> <P> Among the four peninsula municipalities, only Rolling Hills now requires  non-combustible roofs, such as ceramic or concrete tile. The ordinance, which  was passed last year, applies to new construction and renovations but permits  residents to maintain existing roofs.  </P> <P> "The concern for all of us today is, where are the shake roofs?" said  Leeuwenburgh.  </P> <P> Rolling Hills Estates requires highly fire-resistant roofs -- which include  treated shakes -- on new construction and roofs with lesser fire resistance for  replacements of buildings built before 1980.  </P> <P> In Rancho Palos Verdes and Palos Verdes Estates, roof regulations vary from  neighborhood to neighborhood.  </P> <P> Gralow said she raised the question of shake roofs in the Valmonte area of  Palos Verdes Estates at the Tuesday night council meeting. "We could consider  banning them in the future," she said.  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes Councilman Bob Ryan said it might be a good idea to require  all residents to replace shake roofs, perhaps during a four- to five-year grace  period.  </P> <P> "We have been very lucky we haven't had one of these fires. We are going to  have (to) do something," he said.  </P> <P> "I live on a canyon myself, and I have a shake roof," he said, adding that he  would put a tile roof on his house in conjunction with an upcoming building  addition. "The shake makes it look 'foresty,' but they scare me."  </P></p>

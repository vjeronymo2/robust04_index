			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Appointments: Fauroux joins C Union Commercial Union confirmed its reputation as the most European-minded of the UK composite insurance groups by this week appointing a senior French industrialist and politician to its board. Roger Fauroux, currently president d'honneur of the Compagnie de St Gobain, is a former industry minister in France and was well known to the executives managing CU's sizeable Paris-based French subsidiary. According to executive director, John Carter, Fauroux's mix of private sector and civil service experience made him an attractive addition to a board that has become both smaller and more 'business-focused' in recent years. Nicholas Baring, CU's chairman, says the appointment, coupled with that last year of Professor Henk Melj, a Unilever director, would be of 'particular value to the group in the development of its operations within the EC'. Melj has been involved in mergers and acquisitions. Ian Strachan, the deputy chief executive of RTZ Corporation, was also appointed to the board. Fauroux replaces Robert Brooks, who retires after serving 15 years as a non-executive director. ***** SCOTTISH MUTUAL Assurance has appointed Professor Robert Jack, 63, to be its new chairman. Jack replaces Forbes McPherson who, having extended his term of office to oversee the takeover by Abbey National, will continue as a non-executive director. ***** Bill McDonald, formerly financial controller, is promoted to finance director, and Frank Webster, chief investment manager to director of REFUGE Group. ***** Roy Wood, md of WASA International (UK) Insurance, will retire in March. Goran Larsson will succeed him. ***** Richard Williams is appointed financial director of SCOTTISH LION.</p>

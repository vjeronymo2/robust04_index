			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Fyodor Ignatov] </F>   [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] 17 May TASS -- "The special  services of Kazakhstan and Russia have never worked against each  other, nor will they do it in the future," Director of the  Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin  told a press conference here after signing several documents on  cooperation between the special services of the two countries.  Stepashin added that if Russia did not help set up  counterintelligence services in the CIS countries, this would  have been done by others. "The Russian Federation is least of  all interested in this," Stepashin said.    An agreement on cooperation and interaction between the  former Russian Security Ministry and the Kazakh KGB was signed  for the first time in March 1992. However, as it was noted  during the press conference, no mechanism for its implementation  was worked out and the important document remained paralysed.  It was of a purely declarative nature. The protocols first  signed in Moscow and now in Alma Ata [Almaty] give it concrete  substance.    The heads of the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service  and the Kazakh National Security Committee have signed protocols  in Alma Ata [Almaty] on cooperation in combatting international  terrorism, in ensuring the safety of civilian air traffic, in  conducting economic counterintelligence operations and  combatting smuggling, as well as protocols on joint actions to  combat drug trafficking and corruption, to make effective use,  in mutual interests, the operational and technical facilities of  the radio-counterintelligence units and to ensure the security  of special military and other international railway carriages.  It was noted during the press conference that such broad  cooperation was undertaken for the first time in the CIS  countries.    Replying to an ITAR-TASS question, Stepashin said that his  current visit to Alma-Ata [Almaty] was planned in advance and  was in no way linked with the signing in Dzhambyl on 12 May of  the agreement on operational interaction between the special  services of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. "Kazakhstan  is an independent state and it decides itself whom to cooperate  with," Stepashin added.    This statement was confirmed by sat Tokpakbayev, chairman of  the Kazakh National Security Committee. The special services of  Kazakhstan, he noted, have established close contacts with their  colleagues in the United States, Great Britain, France, FRG, and  several other countries. They are constantly coordinating their  actions to combat international terrorism. This work is not  directed against any third country.    Stepashin and Tokpakbayev made no bones of the fact that  there were quite a few problems yet in the difficult work to  coordinate the actions of the special services of their two  countries, because it was quite a new area of cooperation. The  heads of the special services of Russia and Kazakhstan are sure  that all the problems, cropping up on their way, will be  settled, because there is a mutual desire to do it.</p>

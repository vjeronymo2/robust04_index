			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Guwahati, Feb. 1--In a follow-up to its ruling on  Friday, the Cauhati High Court today directed the Election  Commission to include in the draft electoral rolls, the names of  encroachers on government land who are otherwise eligible to  exercise their franchise.    The draft rolls with respect to these people are to be  published and their names included in the final voters list  after claims and objections, if any, are disposed of in  accordance with law.    Legal experts said today's suo moto order by a division  bench  comprising Chief Justice R.K. Manisena Singh and Justice Neera  Sharma clarifies the operative portions of the court's earlier  ruling. On Friday, the court held Clause 7.4 of the Election  Commission's special revised instructions issued on May last  year, unconstitutional and violative of the Representation of  People Act (1950).    The controversial commission clause prohibited the inclusion  of names of all encroachers on village grazing reserves (VGR),  professional grazing reserves (PGR), forest land,  khas land or any other government land, in the  electoral rolls.    Later the commission modified the directive under pressure  from various quarters, including the state government. It said  the instructions would not apply to those Indian citizens whom  the Assam government does not intend to evict from the lands  under their encroachment until the end of 1993.    Today's court directive has given a new turn to the rolls  revision process in Assam. The final voters list in 86 of the  state's 126 Assembly constituencies have already been published  last month. A special revision of rolls was ordered in the 40  remaining constituencies, perhaps due to a suspicion that they  still contained names of illegal aliens.    Subsequently, the election commission ordered an up-date on  the rolls in all the 126 constituencies in the state, with  January 1, 1994, as the qualifying date. The commission has  finally set May 17, 1994, as the deadline for completing the  entire rolls revision process in Assam that began with its  directive for a special intensive revision on August 21, 1992.    However, the task is far from over. The commission will now  have to prepare draft rolls for the encroachers on government  land who are otherwise eligible to vote. This process has to be  carried out in each of the 126 constituencies, including the 86  where the final voters list have already been published. The  names of such persons in the draft roll can be included in the  final loss only after claims and objections are disposed of.    Minority leaders have welcomed the court order to include  names of encroachers in the draft rolls and their subsequent  publication. They feel this will help those 1000s of other  people whose names are in List II of the draft rolls and whose  citizenship, they claim, is unnecessarily doubted. Many of them  could not put up claims for including their names in the voters  list since they lack the documents stipulated by the election  commission. Many of the encroachers also do not possess proper  documents to prove their relationship.</p>

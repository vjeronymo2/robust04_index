			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 8 (XINHUA) -- Russia today lodged a  protest with the U.S. Government against the violation of its  air sovereignty by a U.S. civilian aircraft yesterday.    Russia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin  summoned U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering today delivering a  statement of the Russian Government on the violation.    A U.S. Lockheed C-130 plane, on its way from Frankfurt of  Germany to Tbilisi of Georgia, penetrated Russia's air space  over the Black Sea town of Adler at 13:54 Moscow time Tuesday,  without making any application in advance, the ITAR-TASS NEWS  SERVICE said.    After the plane ignored warnings from Russian ground  stations  and flew 80 kilometers deep into the Russian space, Russian  military aircraft took off and forced it to land at the Adler  airport at 14:10.    The Russian statement said Russia wishes the U.S. side would  take all measures necessary to prevent the reoccurrence of such  incidents.    The U.S. ambassador expressed gratitude for Russia's  restraint in handling the incident.</p>

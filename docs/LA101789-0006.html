			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIGOTRY ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> John Brooks Slaughter's column, "Bigotry Is Back in Fashion" (Editorial Page,  Oct. 7), and its charge that racism is back on our nation's campuses was  accurate, perceptive and disturbing in its implications about the very places  where an intelligent dialogue should be taking place that would demolish the  very foundations of racism.  </P> <P> Yet these college campuses are now the fertile ground for a new racism that  must not go unnoticed or unattended. This alarming rise in racial ugliness can  be found on every campus, public and private. I teach at a well-known Catholic  university in Los Angeles that has witnessed several such racist incidents over  the last several months and for which yet another "committee" will investigate  and make recommendations. It is discouraging to see this sort of thing on a  campus that prides itself on social justice, but this epidemic knows no  boundaries.  </P> <P> It can only be dealt with by swift, decisive, dedicated action. If the skinhead  mentality is allowed a foothold in academia, future generations are at risk.  Slaughter, president of Occidental College, appears to be one educator who not  only "talks the talk" but who "walks the walk." We need more such campus  leaders.  </P> <P> ALFRED LIGHTFOOT  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by staff reporter Chen Chien-ping (7115 </F> 1696 1627): "China Will Increase Exports This Year"; part 2 of  2]    [Text] Not long ago, State Council Premier Li Peng told  American visitors that China's import and export trade in 1994  would reach $200 billion. The relevant department of the State  Council was optimistic about this, and held that China's imports  and exports would both increase in 1994. They predicted that  exports would increase by 14 to 15 percent, and amount to  somewhere between $104 billion and $106 billion, imports would  increase by 10 percent and amount to $115 billion, and the trade  deficit would remain about $10 billion.    This department held that there are a number of factors  promoting China's export increases in 1994. First, overall  trading conditions would be better than in 1993. In particular,  as the central authorities continue to strengthen macro-control  over the economy, the advantageous effects in increasing exports  will be more prominently shown. For example, the prices of some  major industrial raw materials and capital goods have  substantially declined, and this will make enterprises shift  their attention back to the international market; the strained  conditions of funds and export goods have been mitigated  somewhat; the central authorities have completed the action of  merging the two foreign exchange systems in one move by seizing  this opportunity, and the de facto devaluation of the currency  will certainly stimulate exports. In addition, international  trading conditions are also better than those in 1993, as the  world economy is recovering, the Uruguay Round trade talks have  succeeded, and the protectionist trend in international trade  has been restrained.    Second, with regard to the operational system, establishment  of the modern enterprise system provides an effective way to  resolve deep-level problems in foreign trade enterprises. For  example, previous corporations set up in various trades have  been reorganized into large, transregional, multi-trade,  internationalized conglomerates engaged in both production and  trade. Thus, export- oriented productive enterprises can  directly face the international market.    Third, in the form of trade, processing-related trade [jia  gong mao yi 0502 1562 6319 2496] is now the main trading form  adopted by China, which has become China's obvious advantage in  international trade. It is expected that exports through  processing-related trade will amount to $52 billion, and  increase by over 17 percent.    Fourth, exports made by enterprises with foreign investment  will continue to increase at a high rate. In 1993, more than  70,000 new foreign-funded enterprises were set up, and most of  them are export-oriented enterprises. A larger proportion of  them are capital- and technology-intensive enterprises, so they  will increase exports of products with high added value. It is  expected that their exports will increase at a high rate of over  35 percent, and the volume of their exports will reach $34  billion.    Fifth, changes are occurring in China's main export markets.  Through four years' difficult struggle, the U.S. economy stepped  into obvious growth in the last quarter of 1993. The U.S.  economy has recovered earlier than those of the European  Community and Japan, and this made the U.S. dollar firm and kept  import costs low. Such firmness of the U.S. dollar will last  throughout the year 1994. Being the major consumption market of  the Chinese products, increased imports in the United States  will benefit China. In 1994, China will substantially increase  its exportation of farm produce to Japan, and overall exports to  Japan will also increase at a moderate rate [zhong su zeng zhang  0022 6643 1073 7022]. However, China's exports to the European  Community in 1994 will increase rather slowly.    In 1994, China's imports will increase by about 10 percent.  As far as policy is concerned, the state will further lower  import tariffs for many products, and this will further  stimulate imports. In addition, China will maintain a certain  size of imported raw materials, equipment, and technology, and  will continue to import a large quantity of raw materials for  re-export-oriented processing. The number of foreign investment  enterprises will continue to increase in 1994, and this will  bring about a rapid increase in the importation of equipment and  materials. It is expected that such imports will increase by 50  percent over 1993.    The department concerned held that there will remain quite a  few factors unfavorable to expansion of exports: Protectionist  practices continue to prevail in international trade; it is hard  to solve the contradiction of the distribution of raw materials  which are needed in export business and are also needed in the  development of the national economy; the economic growth rate,  the inflation rate, the currency supply, and the actual process  of economic structural reforms this year in China will all  affect the growth rate of exports. On the whole, however, the  prospects of China's exports and imports in 1994 are good.</p>

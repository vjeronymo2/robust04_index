			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Arts: Thrillers spin a web of black logic - Cinema DEEP COVER (18) Bill Duke NIGHT AND THE CITY (15) Irwin Winkler MAN BITES DOG (18) Remy Belvaux, Andre Bonzel, Benoit Poelvoorde SWEET EMMA, DEAR BOBE (18) Istvan Szabo SCHTONK] (15) Helmut Dietl In Deep Cover, a jet-black, jet-paced crime thriller, there is one way to distinguish the good guys from the bad. The good guys tend to call themselves God: like small, mad-eyed police chief Charles Martin Smith, drawing himself up to five feet two to insist on his omniscient divinity. The bad guys (Gregory Sierra's succulently evil drug baron) tend to behave like God: the OT God of an eye for an eye, an ear for an ear and any other body part available for the barter of rough justice. The original story is by writer Michael Tolkin who showed his metaphysical paces in The Player, depicting Hollywood as Purgatory-on-the-Pacific, and in The Rapture, all about sex, death and the Second Coming. That Tolkin's initial script for Deep Cover was taken over by a second writer, Henry Bean (Internal Affairs), may account for the last-reel gaucheries. These include a Miami Vice-style climax in which the undercover hero (Larry Fishburne) and his crooked-lawyer pal (Jeff Goldblum) have a crime tryst with a major political figure in the virtual broad daylight of a well-lit dockside. Only in a movie. Likewise the late-on hurricane of Washington-linked conspiracy revelations. But take all this cum grano salis: it does not spoil the flavour of what goes before as we watch the black police hero's slide into a blacker moral midnight. Picked for plain-clothes promotion because he has the coolest answer to his police chief's racist riddle - 'What's the difference between a black man and a nigger?' - he is soon having to solve subtler riddles. Like, what is the difference between a good plain-clothes cop who joins the crime game and the baddish plain-clothes lawyer (Goldblum) he befriends, who merely puts a different spin on the blend of foul play with pseudo-probity? And how much does an undercover mission excuse shutting one's eyes to plain-sight atrocities? Fishburne must not flinch when cocaine kingpin Sierra bashes in a crony's face with a pool cue; or when Sierra (again) humbles Goldblum with an after-dinner torture game; or when a live, bullet-perforated person is dumped from a speeding car in a midnight tunnel, with a Parthian gunshot fired at his receding arse. Good movies take a familiar theme - there are only so many to go round  - and then spin fast-witted, revelatory variations on it. As directed by Bill Duke (A Rage in Harlem), Deep Cover is paced and textured like a nightmare. Everything has an accelerated dark-side logic, as the hero realises his dwindling control over his own story and fate's flair for fast-forwarding him towards disaster. Fishburne is good in that rarity - a black leading role that does not semaphore ethnic significance - and Goldblum is even better. As the yuppie who keeps being taken to the cleaners along with his suits, he smiles with terrified elegance at an outpacing world. In Night And The City another man's world speeds out of control. But this time we sense the film-makers' hands operating the machinery. Updating the 1950 thriller starring Richard Widmark as a nightclub tout turned fight promoter, director Irwin Winkler, writer Richard Price (Sea Of Love) and star Robert De Niro take the story out of London - its original setting, courtesy of British novelist Gerald Kersh - and set it in New York. But this is a New York you could order up by telephone. Dial M for mean streets and you would get this instant, special-delivery, heels-on-wheels Manhattan. The bar exteriors look manufactured on a back-lot and the people inside react like a Warner Brothers rent-a-crowd as seedy ambulance-chasing lawyer De Niro - a little guy with a manic manner - holds forth like a stand-up comic on his last stand. And the man's problem? He wants to be a boxing promoter. But he must climb over human hindrances to do so: like suavely cackling capo Alan King, jealous bar-owner Cliff Gorman and his De Niro-smitten wife Jessica Lange. Our hero promises to procure a liquor licence for Miss L so she can quit her spouse and open her own business. But the promises are mounting up and a man can keep only so many. Harry Fabian - that is his name - is deep in debt and deeper in danger. This all worked 40 years ago with Widmark and director Jules Dassin. But then everything about the story shouts late 1940s-early-'50s: from the speak-your-weight dialogue to the fatal-allure sexuality to the post-demob disquiet (transmuted to film noir) of a generation in job crisis. De Niro, springy and grinning, acts like a man possessed. But then he is possessed - by his own art-and-money obligations. For this a De Niro production of a De Niro project for De Niro's new film company Tribeca. What ever happened to the days when actors just acted? Man Bites Dog, a Belgian film about a mass murderer, is the week's third thriller in which characters put their lives into overdrive and then find their hands slipping off the steering wheel. The three co-directors - Remy Belvaux, Andre Bonzel, Benoit Poelvoorde - also co-star. Poelvoorde is the prattling, preening show-off who likes to kill people. Belvaux and Bonzel are his dopy cronies, documentary director and cameraman respectively, who film BP's murders as they happen. Shot in grainy handheld black-and-white, just like the film whose making it portrays, Man Bites Dog is shocking less for its full-frontal murders - though these include stranglings, smotherings and stabbings - than for its own refusal to be shocked. Killing here has become part of the junk culture like TV or video games: for couch potatoes read crime potatoes. And however much he begins by kicking against the violence, the moviegoer is soon mischievously drawn into the catatonic reflexes: 'Who next?', 'Where?', 'How?' For this black comedy about brutalisation is also about the voyeur implications of film-watching. Before an invited audience - ourselves - our dandyish hero-host demonstrates the techniques and satisfactions of motiveless killing. Like the torturer-hoodlum in Reservoir Dogs, who wanted no information from the cop he was maltreating, Man Bites Dog raises the spectre of cruelty for kicks. We all know it exists; the cinema seldom dares to confront it head-on; and the British censor almost never lets the result through when it does. A loud plaudit, then, for the courage and imagination of current incumbent James Ferman. The Hungarian Revolution is the subject of Istvan Szabo's Sweet Emma, Dear Bobe. Not the famed 1956 event, when man bit dogma and dogma bit back; but the recent pussy-cat revolution when the Soviet empire rolled over and Eastern Bloc countries tickled its tummy. The tummy-tickling is now over, says Szabo. Fresh from Meeting Venus, in which he allegorised the New Europe as an opera troupe that could not get its act together, the director presents the New Hungary as an atonal chorus of fury, anguish and disenchantment. Schoolteacher Emma (Johanna Ter Steege) bleats the futility of teaching Russian to a world going Western. Her buxom friend Boebe sleeps with many men before finding the fastest way from a high window to a street. And large dialectical boxing matches - God versus materialism, love versus sex, art versus barbarism - go on, and on, and on. It is, we fear, a lecture with dramatic pretensions. As lines of dialogue clang like a ringside bell - 'Do you think because freedom's here everything is allowed?', 'Are you the God of emptiness?' (Emma in church) - the audience bobs and weaves before the pugilistic overemphasis. Nothing surpasses the simple, oblique dream-magic of the opening shot. A nude girl slides down a darkling hill of sand clutching at passing plants. We guess, marvel, are teased and intrigued: things that never happen to us again in the 80-minute film. Schtonk] is the small, foolish title of a long, foolish film. Helmut Dietl wrote and directed this spoof history of the Hitler Diaries scam. But there was probably more laughter 48 years ago in the Berlin bunker, as Adolf and Eva swapped shaggy-Alsatian stories while the bombs rained.</p>

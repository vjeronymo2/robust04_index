			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHINING AND WINNING: DOES IT REALLY MATTER?  </P> <P> I don't know Bret Johnson. I do know quarterbacks and kids.  </P> <P> Sure, Johnson may have made a bum call in walking out on UCLA after he got  demoted from the starting QB job. But what is the kid -- 19?  </P> <P> This isn't Saddam Hussein invading Kuwait. Or Nixon justifying Watergate. This  isn't even a big-bucks pro quarterback who presumably has some maturity and  accountability.  </P> <P> Is this reason enough for Mike Downey to vilify the young man?  </P> <P> Wonder why L.A. is the quarterback controversy capital of the Western world?  </P> <P> SALLY CAPPON  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

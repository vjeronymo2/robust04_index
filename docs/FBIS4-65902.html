			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Phillip Johnston: "Poll is a Chance to Stop </F> Shift to Left, Say Tories"]    [Text] As befits a party that, to say the least, has found  agreement on Europe difficult, the Conservative manifesto for  the June 9 election charts a delicate course through the  minefield of conflicting opinion.    Unlike the last campaign in 1989 -- which reflected Mrs  Thatcher's deep ambivalence to the whole European concept -- the  manifesto seeks to balance Mr Major's commitment to place  Britain at the heart of Europe with a pledge to hold back the  centralising tendencies that have become more apparent in the  intervening five years.    Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary -- who was in Russia  yesterday and missed the formal launch -- believes the 56-page  manifesto. A strong Britain in a Strong Europe, sits  comfortably with the views of 90 per cent of the parliamentary  party.    It emphasises:    a. Prosperity, with jobs a priority;    b. Decentralisation, with less interference from Brussels;    c. Open trading, based on free markets and least  bureaucracy;    d. Competitiveness, to confront the Asian challenge;    e. Expansion, to include former Eastern bloc countries;    f. Keeping a veto to protect Britain's vital national  interests.    The manifesto reflects the Government's determination to  focus the Conservative campaign on Europe and away from domestic  issues. Mr Major said the elections were not "a trivial opinion  poll" about Government popularity but an important opportunity  for the country to send representatives to the European  parliament who would halt the lurch to the Left and the  development of what he called a "stagnant socialist swamp".    In the foreword, Mr Major urges voters: "You will not be  voting for Europe: Right or Wrong? You will be voting Europe:  Right or Left? To the Right more jobs, more prosperity in a  wider union of free nations. To the Left, more petty  restrictions and longer dole queues."    The document makes no mention of a referendum, though Mr  Major said there would not be one on whether Britain should  remain in Europe and he would be "astonished" if one would be  needed after the inter-governmental conference in 1996 on the  future shape of Europe.    Among the specific issues addressed by the manifesto are:  <H5>  SOCIAL CHAPTER </H5>   A reminder that the opt-out secured by Mr Major at  Maastricht  relieved British businesses of policies that would have harmed  job prospects.    These included a minimum wage, compulsory works councils,  new  union powers, a 35-hour week and higher corporate taxes.  <H5>  SINGLE MARKET </H5>   The assertion that Conservatives in Europe have fought for  the free movement of capital, freedom and choice in air and road  transport, opening up public contracts and achieving common  standards for professional qualifications.  <H5>  BUREAUCRACY </H5>   The manifesto says the Tories will press for more  deregulation in Europe by simplifying or scrapping about one  quarter of all EC legislation.    The Government would press the Commission to set up its own  deregulation unit.  <H5>  PARLIAMENT </H5>   The European parliament is more powerful as a result of the  Maastricht treaty.    It can veto single market, consumer protection and research  and development legislation and block the choice of the next  President of the Commission when M Jacques Delors steps down  later this year. The Tories say a vote for the centre-Right  would mean a majority against another Socialist president.  <H5>  AGRICULTURE </H5>   Further reforms of the Common Agriculture Policy are seen as  a priority. It must be "simplified, made more responsive to the  market, less bureaucratic, its costs controlled and fraud  curbed".  <H5>  ENVIRONMENT </H5>   Anti-pollution directives from Brussels in recent years have  cost billions of pounds which have or will be passed on to  consumers in the form of higher water charges and energy costs.    The manifesto says that while many environmental issues  cross  national boundaries, others should be for individual states to  decide. The Tories would also press for a revision of existing  water directives to allow improvements "at a pace people can  afford."  <H5>  IMMIGRATION </H5>   One of the big issues. The Tories say that while minimum  checks should be required for movement within the EC, citizens  of other countries should be subject to full immigration  controls.    Britain also seeks a common definition of asylum.  <H5>  DEFENCE </H5>   NATO would remain the cornerstone of Europe's defence and  collective security, under-pinned by a continuing American  presence in Europe.  <H5>  THE FUTURE </H5>   The manifesto proposes policies for a decentralised and open  Europe that is more accessible to its 350 million people.</p>

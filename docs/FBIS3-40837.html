Narasimha Rao, today warned against attempts to deny  certain technologies to India even in the post-GATT (General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) period marked by liberalisation  of trade in goods and services.    "It is a kind of protectionism built into liberalisation...  An attempt will be there to withhold a technology from a country  like India due to apprehensions that it would become powerful  and progressive," Mr Rao said inaugurating the 81st session of  the Indian Science Congress.    Expressing confidence that the country would come out of  such  a situation, he foresaw a rapid expansion in the research and  development field. He appealed to science and technology  personnel to help the country in exploiting the vast export  opportunities offered by the post-GATT period.    The Prime Minister said India, with its vast reservoir of  science and technology personnel and comparatively lower  manpower costs, was fully capable of meeting the export  challenges thrown open in the post--GATT liberalised environment.    GATT ensured further opening up of national economies and  Indian science and technology personnel and industry leaders  would have an enlarged arena to play their part in this new  situation, he said.    Allaying fears expressed by some scientists and certain  sectors of trade that indigenous research and development might  be jeopardised by the recently concluded GATT negotiations, Mr  Rao said India could, in fact, clearly delineate areas of  significant opportunities in textiles and clothing, agriculture,  trade related intellectual property rights, and services.    Science and technology and research and development would be  of paramount importance in the post-GATT liberalised  environment, he said. In the new scenario, there was a large  scope for cross-border investments and the spread of research  and development across the national boundaries, he said.    India must be prepared to profit from this situation as  research and development costs in India vary greatly from the  costs abroad, he noted.    The Prime Minister said India could launch joint research  and  development projects with other countries. It could do so  because of high science and technology calibre in a wide  spectrum of fields, substantial research and development  infrastructure, extensive test facilities of world standard,  language skills and worldwide presence of Indian scientists, he  added.    Earlier, the Prime Minister presented the Asutosh Mukherjee  Memorial Award for 1993 to Dr A.S. Paintal, C.V. Raman Birth  Centenary Award to Dr M.S. Narasimha, Srinivasa Ramanujan Birth  Centenary Award to Prof. B.P. Bambah, M.N. Saha Birth Centenary  Award to Dr Hari Narain, P.V. Mahanalobis Birth Centenary Award  to Prof. P.V. Sukhatme, J.C. Bose Memorial Award to Prof. A.K.  Sharma, P.C. Ray Memorial Award to Prof. C.N.R. Rao and Prof.  Hira Lal Chakaravarty Award to Dr K.C. Bansal and Dr S.L.  Kothari.    Rajasthan Governor Bali Ram Bhagat released a souvenir and  Chief Minister Bhairon Singh Shekhawat released a book titled  `Indian Science-A Selected Bibliography' on the  occasion.</p>

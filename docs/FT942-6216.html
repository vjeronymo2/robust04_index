			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Boost for HK property Hong Kong's property market, under scrutiny by the government, has received a boost with the sale of the New Territories' San Miguel Brewery site for HKDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 300m), sharply above market expectations, writes Louise Lucas. The 494,700 sq ft site went to Diamond Hill Development, a vehicle in which Wheelock, Wharf Holdings and Hong Kong Realty and Trust have equal shares. Uncertainty has dogged the market since March, when Mr Chris Patten, the governor, announced his intention to look at ways to control prices amid concern that home ownership is beyond the reach of many families.</p>

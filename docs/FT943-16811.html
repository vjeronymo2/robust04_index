			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Railtrack tries to cut out union: Horton wants to tell staff 'real story' / Knapp says move is futile Railtrack yesterday launched a 'hearts and minds' campaign designed to bypass the RMT rail union and appeal directly to its signalling staff to accept the company's restructuring deal. But the company refused to give details of how it intends to compensate about a quarter of the signalling staff who face a Pounds 100-a-week pay cut. Relief signalmen stand to suffer a fall in their gross earnings to Pounds 382.78 a week from Pounds 489.51 after the productivity agreement comes into force. Staff working night shifts would have smaller cuts in earnings. Railtrack said those affected would receive lump-sum compensation payments to ensure no loss was suffered over the next 18 months. But details of those payments - which could be about Pounds 8,000 - have not been given to the RMT or the individuals. Mr Bob Horton, the company's chairman, said yesterday this was a 'non-issue that will work itself out'. Railtrack said its campaign aimed to tell 'the real story about the package on offer to every member of staff' and 'expose the misinformation that has been circulated by the RMT'. Railtrack added: 'With the real information in their hands staff will pressurise the RMT to come back to the negotiating table so the package can be implemented.' Telephone hotlines have been set up and letters sent to all signal staff. Mr Horton said: 'I hope our work over the next few days and weeks will enable signalmen to say to their union: 'Take another look at what is on offer, come back to the negotiating table and resolve this matter once and for all'.' He said signalmen and their families were ringing the company to ask how the dispute could be ended. He suggested that there had been a 'little trickle back' to work but refused to say how many signalling staff had defied the strike calls. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, described Railtrack's campaign as an 'exercise in futility'. He said: 'They should not be wasting their time trying to sell the unsaleable to individuals. The signalling staff are very solid in the strike and they are determined to get a just settlement for the contribution they have made over the past seven years.' The union executive will meet on Monday afternoon to decide whether to increase the action that has severely disrupted rail services for the past three Wednesdays. A further 24-hour stoppage is set for next Wednesday. Railtrack said many signalling staff could expect 'substantial' increases in earnings between now and October 1 through the first two parts of the three-stage deal, with an additional 2.5 per cent as the annual pay rise. Once RMT agreed to the whole productivity package further rises would be triggered. Railtrack estimates that those on early shifts would see an average rise to Pounds 372.47 from Pounds 306.08 for a 50-hour week and those on late shifts to Pounds 420.39 from Pounds 380.13 for a 56-hour week.</p>

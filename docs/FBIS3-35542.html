The statement emphasized that those  attempts were a natural outcome of the operations conducted by  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squads. In its statement, Hamas announced  that as long as the occupation, the settlers, and their weapons,  exist and as long as the prisoners remain in prison, Hamas and  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam will hold a dialogue with Rabin only  through the bullet. The statement noted that Hamas will  overcome all Israeli attempts to embarrass it, and that all the  political maneuvers and trial balloons floated by the Israeli  Government were doomed to failure.    The statement clarified the Hamas position on the agreement  that has canceled the issues of Jerusalem and the refugees,  negated Palestinian control, and allowed the Jews to build more  settlements. The statement said Hamas will do all in its power  to foil this plan by the permitted legitimate means, far from  the violence being practiced by Rabin's government.</p>

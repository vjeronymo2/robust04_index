			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan GrandMet's tub-thumping defence of brands yesterday came as a startling flash-back to the 1980s. But not even GrandMet appears wholly convinced by its revivalist rhetoric. Its Pounds 175m restructuring charge to cut its cost base certainly shows a healthier regard for the real competitive forces shaping its markets. Much of that provision relates to its US food businesses, which face a fierce fight defending premium prices. The bigger concern, though, is over its European food arm, which is generating operating profits of just Pounds 15m on sales of Pounds 735m, and appears trapped in a strategic cul-de-sac. Doubts about GrandMet's diversification into foods cannot obscure the underlying strength of IDV. The loss of the Absolut vodka distribution contract will knock profits this year. But IDV's geographic spread and product mix should enable it to maintain robust progress, particularly in developing markets. GrandMet's growth ambitions remain constrained by its Pounds 2.8bn borrowings. The disposal of Chef &amp; Brewer and its strongly improving cash flow will help ease the strain. But with GrandMet's continuing woes at IEL and Pearle - and its embarrassingly expensive legal dispute with Brent Walker - still clouding the picture, it is hard to see how its 23 per cent underperformance against the market over the past year will quickly be reversed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Rules on Bond Sales Toughened"] </F>   [Text] China has taken tough action to apply the brakes to  the short-selling of treasury bonds to ensure the market's  smooth development.    The China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Ministry of  Finance and the People's Bank of China jointly issued a circular  recently calling on parties to "resolutely stop" the short  selling of treasury bonds.    Local finance bureaus, branches of the central bank, and  securities exchanges and centres must take effective measures  against short-selling as of July 1.    The action was taken because some securities intermediaries  are selling more treasury bonds than they actually own by  issuing custody certificates to buyers.    This practice in effect expands the total amount of treasury  bonds, endangering the country's macroeconomic management and  investors' interests.    According to the circular, which will go into effect on July  1, the treasury bonds traded over the counter should be the  paper bonds issued by the State and not the custody certificates.    Institutions trading bonds through securities exchanges or  centres should put all their bonds, paper and paperless, under  the central custody centres of the exchanges and trading centres  .    Only after that will they be able to trade their bonds on  exchanges or State-approved electronic securities trading  systems.    If securities trading institutions issue custody  certificates, they should have an equal amount of note bonds.    If institutions have fewer paper bonds than the amount  registered in the certificates already issued, they should make  up the gap by June 20.    Holders can exchange their certificates for paper bonds any  time. No certificate issuer can refuse a request .    The circular requires the Shanghai and Shenzhen securities  exchanges and all local securities trading centres to draft  their own self-regulating rules. These regulations will be  reported to the Ministry of Finance.    Bond-trading institutions violating the circular's  stipulations will be suspended from doing business for three  months to a year.    Bond-trading institutions are responsible for arranging to  be  examined by the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China  and the China Securities Regulatory Commission.    Trading institutions should set up different accounts for  custody bonds and self-dealing bonds.</p>

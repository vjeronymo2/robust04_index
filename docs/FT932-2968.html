			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Dollar sector provides focus of attention BORROWERS scurried to the dollar sector of the Eurobond market yesterday, launching a total of more than Dollars 1.2bn in new bonds. Some issuers were wooed into the market by the release of favourable US inflation figures and dealers said the positive outlook was likely to encourage the launch of more Eurodollar deals in the immediate future, even though arbitrage opportunities were not seen as especially attractive. Canada's Province of Ontario yesterday announced plans to issue a minimum USDollars 1bn global bond issue in the near future. LKB Baden-Wurttemberg, a state agency, is also due to raise Dollars 500m with an unusual Eurobond issue to be listed in both Luxembourg and Singapore. Nomura, the lead manager for the triple-A rated deal, describes the issue as a 'hybrid dragon-Eurobond' given that it is targeted at Asian and European investors and will have an Asian co-management group. The bonds were being priced at the end of the Hong Kong business day. British Gas International Finance returned to the dollar market with a Dollars 250m, 10-year deal. The borrower has launched deals in the Eurosterling sector recently and has seen yield spreads narrow substantially. The bonds were priced to yield 34 basis points over the US Treasury, and traded at 32-33 basis points over later in the day. The bonds were swapped into fixed rate sterling. Outside the dollar sector, the main talking point of the market was a successful FFr1.5bn deal from Nestle Enterprises, the holding company for the French operations of Nestle. BNP, the lead manager, claimed the yield spread at launch of 7 basis points over the French treasury bond is the 'tightest spread done in the French franc sector' in recent memory. At one stage the spread narrowed to 3-4 basis points, reflecting the very strong institutional investor demand for the issue. Dealers pointed to the rarity value as the main reason for the tight pricing and good investor demand.</p>

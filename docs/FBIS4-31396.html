			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "What the Benes Decrees Actually </F> Are"]    [Text] Theo Waigel, federal finance minister and chairman  of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, demanded at the Sudeten  German Days, which were held last weekend, that the so-called  Benes Decrees be annulled. All Czech political representatives  have rejected this demand as unacceptable. Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec even declared that complying with such efforts  would mean "revising the outcome of World War II, with all of  the repercussions arising from it."    Of course, the "Benes Decrees," rejected by the Sudeten  Germans, in fact represent only part of the several dozen  legislative acts that altered the entire legal being of the  Czechoslovak establishment, acts that cannot simply be annulled  in toto if we do not want to risk legal chaos. The common  denominator of these decrees was President Benes, who issued  them from 1940 onwards--of course, only after listening to the  government in exile and the so-called State Council, which  supplemented legislative authority. The Council was abolished  after May 1945, and the decrees were issued on the  recommendation of the government and the Slovak National Council  [SNR]. Following the elections to the Interim National Assembly  in October 1945, legal order was guaranteed by normal laws.    Today, we bring you select sections of these decrees that  concern the actual issue of the evacuation of the Sudeten  Germans.  <H8>  Decree Issued by the President of the Republicon 25 </H8> October 1945 on Confiscating Enemy Propertyand on National  Revival Funds    On the recommendation of the government and after agreement  with the Slovak National Council, I decree the following:  <H8>  Part I </H8> <H8>  The Confiscation of Enemy Property </H8>   Article 1.

The German Reich, the Kingdom of Hungary, persons of  public law in accordance with German or Hungarian law, the  German Nazi Party, Hungarian political parties, and the other  associations, organizations, enterprises, facilities, personal  affiliations, funds, and endowments of these regimes or  associated with them, and also other German or Hungarian legal  persons, or    ii. Physical persons of German or Hungarian ethnicity, with  the exception of persons who prove that they remained loyal to  the Czechoslovak Republic and never committed an offense against  the Czech and Slovak peoples and either took an active part in  the struggle for their liberation or suffered under the Nazi or  fascist terror, or    iii. Physical persons who were involved in activity  oriented against the state's sovereignty, independence, and  integrity, the democratic-republican state structure, and the  security and defense of the Czechoslovak Republic, who aided and  abetted such activity or sought to corrupt other persons, who  deliberately supported in any way the German or Hungarian  occupiers, or who, during the period of heightened risk to the  Republic (Article 18 of the decree issued by the president of  the Republic on 19 June 1945 on punishing Nazi criminals,  traitors, and their supporters and on the extraordinary people's  courts), indulged in Germanization or Magyarization on the  territory of the Czechoslovak Republic or behaved inimically  toward the Czechoslovak Republic or the Czech or Slovak peoples,  and also persons who condoned such activity among the persons  administering their property or enterprise.

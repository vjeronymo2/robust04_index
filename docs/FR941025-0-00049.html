			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another comment asked FEMA how the boundaries of an area will be determined to classify it as a ``developed area''. The responsibility for designating and adopting an official map or legal description of those areas within Zones AR, AR/A1&hyph;30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/A, or AR/AO that are designated ``developed areas'' is established in the floodplain management criteria for flood-prone areas at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;60.3(f)(2) and the eligibility procedures at &sect;65.14. In accordance with these sections, it is the community's responsibility to submit, as part of the community's application for designation of flood control restoration zones, its proposed designation of ``developed areas'' in accordance with the definition at &sect;59.1 to FEMA for approval. FEMA must determine that the community designations are consistent with the definition of ``developed area'' at &sect;59.1. The community may use whatever method it deems appropriate to determine whether a particular parcel, tract, or lot, or subdivision is within a ``developed area'' as defined in &sect;59.1 or outside of a ``developed area''. However, FEMA encourages communities to coordinate with the FEMA Regional Offices on designation of ``developed areas'' before the community adopts an official map or legal description of ``developed areas'' within the designated flood control restoration zone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Five Year Maximum Restoration Period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of the letters received objected to the maximum five year restoration period contained in the proposed rule as being inadequate. The proposed rule limits the duration of a flood control restoration zone designation to a maximum five year period by providing that for a community to be eligible for and to maintain such a designation, the flood protection system must be fully restored or must have achieved ``adequate progress'' as defined in NFIP regulations at Section 61.12 within a period not to exceed five years. Comments specifically cited experience with the ongoing restoration of flood protection systems for both Los Angeles and Sacramento, California, which have already been in progress for more than five years without achieving ``adequate progress''. Most comments favored a ten-year restoration period for AR Zone designation as being a more reasonable time frame for restoring a flood protection system, particularly because the restoration involves Federal funding. Comments also cited that the statute's legislative history supported a ten year period for restoration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When establishing a time limit for the restoration of 100-year protection, FEMA recognizes the need to assess what would be necessary to provide a reasonable time frame for restoring a flood protection system involving Federal funds or for achieving ``adequate progress'' to satisfy the criteria in &sect;61.12. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted comments on the proposed rule that stated that a five-year time frame may not be adequate to ensure that satisfactory progress is made on the project restoration to meet the adequate progress requirements of &sect;61.12 of existing NFIP regulations. Those comments went on to indicate that ten years may be a more realistic expectation for projects that require Congressional authorization and appropriation of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations apply specifically to communities where the existing flood protection system is a Federal project and the restoration involves Federal funds. Because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is the Federal agency most frequently involved in design and construction of Federal flood protection systems, FEMA believes that it is appropriate to give considerable weight to the guidance they have provided with respect to establishing a limit on the restoration period. Therefore, the interim final rule provides a maximum ten-year restoration period, rather than the five years contained in the proposed regulations. This revision is cited at the appropriate locations in &sect;65.14 of the interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

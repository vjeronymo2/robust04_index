			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Technology: Life catches up with laptops - New disclosure requirements for insurers have placed greater importance on detail When the Treasury insisted that all UK life insurance sales agents and advisers should give customers more information about their policies, it also delivered a bonus for makers of laptop computers and mobile phones. Some life insurance companies were already emphasising technology when the Treasury made its move in July last year. But the new requirements to give more information to potential investors on the products, the costs of selling them, and the returns to the customer if long-term policies are surrendered in the first few years, have forced the whole sector to give the issue greater priority. The disclosure regime, which will be compulsory from the new year, has focused attention on the appropriate technology in two ways. First, having to reveal the cost of selling a policy has put even more importance on cutting costs for selling and for processing the sale. Second, having to provide customers with more information that is specific to their circumstances creates a need for more sophisticated systems. 'I think there will be no escaping technology from January,' says Nigel Smith, sales computing manager at Axa Equity and Law. The scale of the challenge facing the sector is underlined by the fact that even NatWest Life, which opened for business at the start of last year with computer systems costing Pounds 40m, is having to make some changes. NatWest Life had provided its sales force with Toshiba laptops linked to a Unisys mainframe, where the information keyed in by sales agents is automatically downloaded. Adam Walton, head of life and pensions, says the systems will be modified to take account of the disclosure requirements both when a policy is sold and when it is issued. The company, a subsidiary of the National Westminster Bank group, has had some benefit in making a late start, since it could set up a system from scratch and decide to sell only a limited and relatively straightforward range of products. For other life companies, with wider product ranges and more established systems, meeting the demands of disclosure requires a greater response. For example, Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's largest insurers, is upgrading the laptops it provides for its sales force, as will be Axa Equity &amp; Law, which will also provide printers for all its sales agents who use laptops, so that documents can be produced in the customer's home. Other insurers expect upgrading the process to take place over some months next year. Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest life insurer, is taking a different approach. Instead of buying laptops for the 7,000-strong sales force, Alan Smith, marketing director for its home service division, has placed the largest-ever single order in the UK for mobile phones. The phones will be programmed to Prudential's 'quoteline' where the 200 operators will key in to the computer what the sales agent says about a customer's circumstances and provide the detailed information. It is backed up by a freephone number for the areas of the UK where mobile phones do not work. Alan Smith believes that in the future laptops will be the answer - but says Prudential's decision for the current changes is based both on cost and the sales process. The company estimated that buying laptops would cost Pounds 25m initially, and then an annual cost of Pounds 11m. The mobile phone solution is estimated to cost Pounds 3m as a one-off expense and then Pounds 5m a year. Smith adds that trials on how the laptop fitted into the sales process showed it was an encumbrance. Simply by flipping the screen up, the sales agent created a barrier. 'If I'm a sales agent, when I concentrate on keying in information, I lose eye contact and the customer is back watching EastEnders.' For life companies with more diverse distribution than Prudential, using more technology can be a more complicated process. Axa Equity &amp; Law, for example, sells its products in three ways: through a direct sales force, through 'tied agents' - separate companies that agree to sell only the life insurer's financial services products - and through independent financial advisers. Nigel Smith says that laptops are not compulsory, and though nearly all tied agents use them, only about half the direct sales force does. These sales agents have a choice of machines they can rent: all are capable of connecting with Elvis, the company's main system, but the cheaper ones take longer. He thinks the company will probably review early next year its policy of allowing laptops to be voluntary. 'It is a cultural issue in many respects.' Independent advisers can also access the Elvis system, but there are regulatory limits to the support that individual life companies are allowed to give independent advisers. One way through this for life companies, and for advisers who want information about the companies' products, is the Exchange, owned by Origo and AT&amp;T. This project was launched in 1991, and is a way of giving independent advisers electronic access to information about life companies' products. Advisers pay Pounds 250 and an annual charge of Pounds 65 for the software, while life companies provide an annual subsidy of Pounds 4m. The system does not yet cover every life and pensions product, but within two years Paul Lindsey, its managing director, expects to have all products except group pension schemes available. As for the new regulatory requirements, Lindsey says: 'From January we will be giving independent advisers the ability to calculate specific commission at the point of sale, and to be able to print out client-specific illustrations'. He is in no doubt that the disclosure regime has acted as a catalyst in speeding up the use of technology.</p>

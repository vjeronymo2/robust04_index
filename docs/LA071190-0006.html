			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L. RON HUBBARD'S CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY  </P> <P> I would like to thank The Times for the free publicity for the Church of  Scientology. This advertisement must have cost several hundred thousand  dollars.  </P> <P> I am a mechanical engineer working in a Fortune 100 company, and have been a  Scientologist only a short while (just over two years). However, I have  improved so much in just these few months that I wish I had at least heard of  Scientology earlier in my life.  </P> <P> Some of my gains have been in the area of communication skills which is the  backbone of everything that we do, everyday. I have also become very innovative  and have filed several patents since that time. This is an ability that I did  not think I had. My affinity for others has gone up tremendously. I can also  see other people's point of view which makes me a very fair person indeed. I  have become such a role model at work that people with four times as much  experience as me come to me for advice, on not only work-related matters but  also personal issues. I can think very clearly without any sidetracks. I feel  great, and have never been happier in my life. I owe it all to Hubbard, his  discovery of Dianetics and Scientology, and the correct application of his  findings.  </P> <P> Your articles will have a positive impact by generating interest and curiosity  among readers. Eventually they will want to know more and will stop by a  Scientology organization and sign up for services.  </P> <P> JOSEPH ESKANDARI  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P></p>

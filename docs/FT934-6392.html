			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Arts: Menace aforethought - Cinema RUBY IN PARADISE (15) Victor Nunez HARD TARGET (18) John Woo AMONGST FRIENDS (18) Rob Weiss BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT (18) Jonathan Heap IP5 (15) Jean-Jacques Beineix Which part of America should you live in for maximum safety and comfort? In Long Island you risk falling foul of the Jewish Mafia (Amongst Friends). In Arizona (Benefit Of The Doubt) you might be stalked across baking deserts by barking Donald Sutherland (ex-convict, psychopath). And in the Deep South of Hard Target you could well get lost like Cajun drifter Jean-Claude Van Damme, harried through the Louisiana swamps by neo-Nazi manhunters. The best place, surely, must be Florida's gulf coast as depicted in Victor Nunez' travelogue-of-the-soul Ruby In Paradise. Here the only menace is invading tourists. Seasonally they clatter through the resort gift-shop in Panama City where the heroine works (Ashley Judd), a young girl hoping to find herself after fleeing unhappy adolescence in her native Tennessee. No better state in the US for self-discovery. Surrounded by hideous souvenirs - the figurines made from coloured shells, the dayglo T-shirts - Ruby must search deep in herself for truth and authenticity. 'I don't know what I'm doing here' she confides to her voice-over diary. But soon she is self-assured enough to find work, play and a sense of identity, and to juggle the two predators who want to get her into bed: raunchy employer's son Rick (Bentley Mitchum, grandson of Robert) and holier-than-thou environmentalist Mike (Todd Field). Writer-director Nunez, who five years ago finger-painted a fine debut movie about the South Gal Young Un, gives us a film in two halves. Put simply, the first half is good, the second half self-destructs. For the opening hour we are enthralled by newcomer Ashley Judd's performance, with its hints of a secret life behind the slanting eyes, baby cheeks and self-defensive Southern drawl. And we purr with pleasure at the workings of the film-maker's own built-in junk detector. This goes 'bleep' not just at the rows of rubbish in the gift-shops but at the dubious shelf life of the people Ruby meets: notably Rick (male chauvinism plus mother's-boy spinelessness) and Mike (fine until he reveals a weakness for God-slot television). Part one is kept alive by a sense of danger and by our suspicion that there are picturesquely disturbed corners in Ruby's own mind. Too much doodling in that diary, for a start. But part two starts in soon - too soon - on the process of doubt-allayment. Lost jobs are regained, treacherous boyfriends unmasked and stern employers revealed as gooey benefactors. The happy ending stomps towards us like a too-early dawn, dispersing all the interesting shadows. Hollywood has many mad science laboratories, but the maddest of all is the one with the signplate 'Cultural Crossbreeding'. Here men with white coats and smoking brains dream up projects such as Hard Target. What would happen (they muse) if we team a Belgian footboxing star with a Hong Kong action director and set them both down in French-American Louisiana? Jean-Claude Van Damme is our hero-hulk with the trailing curls and legs as lethal and many-angled as compasses. John Woo of The Killer and Hard Boiled is called in to produce further evidence that he is the world's most gymnastic action director. And as for the plot - anyone got a plot? Oh yes, how about the old one about racist psychopaths going manhunting in the Deep South. That will do: so long as we are insured against plagiarism suits from Betrayed and Southern Comfort. So the insane day begins; and the dreadful glory of a movie that is both delinquent and virtuosic. Shotgun in one hand, girl in the other (Yancy Butler, searching for a Dad we saw manhunted to death in scene one), Mr Van Damme serpentines through the bayous hunting - and being hunted by - Lance Henriksen's sneering villain and his pay-by-the-hour client army. Snakes; petrol bombs; exploding cars; grenades down the trousers; and Mr VD coming through it all like a mixture of Schwarzenegger and Nureyev. He dives swallow-like through the flames one moment, biffs the daylights out of the baddies the next. I was appalled by the amount of careless laughter issuing from my area of the cinema, until I realised that much of it was coming from me. But then how does one react to a movie that resembles a Jackson Pollock painting in which the coloured smears are real people? Giggles seem as appropriate as shocked gasps. For this film has nothing to do with real life or real violence (that tends to hurt): rather it is a near-abstract riot of dering-do in which visible injury is set firmly aside for visible ingenuity. For a truly numbskulled use of violence we must turn to Rob Weiss's Amongst Friends. Here the leisured classes of Long Island preside over a second generation of hoodlums-through-boredom. Andy, Billy and Trevor are scions of Kosher Nostra: Jewish dynasties surrounded by ill-gotten heirlooms and by only-begotten heirs who want all that and more. Do not be fooled by the yachts, the lace tablecloths and all that money spent on their education. These boys want out of Millionaire's Row and into Scorsese's mean streets. We, somehow, are supposed to care. Weiss has a funny idea of the things that might constitute a plausible, empathy-prone source for a life of crime. (Jaded youngsters turning silver spoons into revolvers is not one.) And he has a funnier idea of character and structure. We dribble on through ten years of crime and punishment, feud and counter-feud, with no signs of ageing, no sense of psychological development, and certainly no increase in either wisdom or excitement. But the week's Wooden Spoon for an American movie must be held back for Benefit Of The Doubt. This finds Donald Sutherland released from a 22-year jail sentence for wife-murder and going in search of daughter Amy Irving, who testified against him. 'Daddy won't forget this . . .' he had told her outside court. So soon we are thrown sizzling into the silliest plot of 1993. Murder, incest, boat chases and wild, wild Arizona scenery; plus a handful of good actors struggling to be more than plastic counters shoved around a giant high-speed board-game. Things are little better on this side of the Atlantic. A 'successful' European film used to be one that earned festival prizes and critical plaudits and then sent out ripples of innovation and aesthetic challenge to Hollywood. Today a successful European film is one so Hollywoodish already that America buys it up for a remake: Cousins, Three Men And A Baby, Nikita . . . Jean-Jacques Beineix's IP5 has all the schmaltzy plot gimmicks in place to bait the Tinseltown hook. Two semi-delinquent street boys on the run, one black, one white. (This should secure the cross-racial youth audience.) The wistful, dying old man they meet on the road and from whom they learn lessons in love, wisdom and the everyday-miraculous. (He is Yves Montand: add a few million older moviegoers who grew up with Z and L'Aveu.) And - for what is a high-concept film without a 'quest'? - an ensuing zigzag across France in pursuit of long-lost girlfriends (Montand), long-sought father figures (the boys) and other glib emotional pay-offs. Beineix, who made Diva and Betty Blue, specialises in a grandiloquent glossiness that masquerades as art. He begins the movie - almost promisingly  -as if it is a hip-hop musical. The black boy dances and sings along a midnight city street as his mate makes merry with the graffiti paint. The scene is so catchy, so surreal that we wish it had set the tone for the rest. 'Les Spraycans De Cherbourg' we could have taken, but not Beineix's ensuing attempt to pass off maudlin fable-spinning as Deep Thoughts about the homeless child in each of us. As for the UK print's transatlantic subtitles - 'Chill out', 'F*** me, what a babe]' - they add to the feeling that in Gallic movies today the trademark 'Made in France' is being slowly obliterated by 'Made for Hollywood.'</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Travel: A detour to drive you to distraction - Adrian Gardiner fears an island's unspoilt beauty might not last During the 1980s, central Italians living near Autostrada 14 had a sure way of recognising the autumn equinox. Each September, around the 21st, a small silver-grey car streaked south along the Adriatic coast. 'Eccola, il signor Honda Ballada ancora]' the natives would cry, pausing momentarily from the harvest. Yes, it was the Andrews expedition. We would be on the way to southern Italy from the Venice film festival and only two things stood between us and our destination. One was night, gathering fast as we reached the frontier between Abruzzo and Puglia. The other was the sinister, looming bulk of the Gargano peninsula. You have to stop over: but where? Do you turn right into the boring flatlands around Foggia? Or do you clutch the complete works of Mrs Radcliffe and head for the gothic Gargano: a dead cert for any film-maker seeking locations for The Mysteries Of Udolpho. The first time I took the Gargano route proved so memorable that I never gave it up. Picture a giant, rearing carbuncle half-way down Italy's coast. Turning off the autostrada, you go up a gentle rural incline for a few miles before the real roller-coaster starts. Twisting roads along beetling cliffs; pines yawing and writhing; unidentified animals baying at a Salvator Rosa moon; and ghost-eyed houses teetering on impossible slopes. This may be the most spectacular coastline in all Italy, including its better-known twin, the Amalfi peninsula on the western shore. I loved it so much on my first visit that I spent three nights there, seriously disrupting my hotel booking in Calabria. The order of towns I stayed in on the Gargano was Peschici, Vieste and Monte Sant' Angelo. The first is a visual knockout. Built as a 10th century anti-Saracen emplacement, its threadwork of streets and domed houses have their own semi-Arabic air, as if one has strayed into a transplanted casbah. Though the coast here is at its wildest, there are good bathing spots, plus caves and ruined watchtowers. Peschici is heaven. Vieste, moving south-east, is more humdrum but more habitable. The land dives to an accommodating flatness and you can sit at seafront cafes, sipping a Bellini (peach juice with sparkling white wine), as if you were in normal Italy. Good beaches, too. Even in Vieste there are a couple of treats. The ferry service to the Tremiti islands lets you explore these limpid land-dots 40kms off the coast. The second treat is the wooden trebucca in Vieste itself, which stands on the edge of the old town. A large contraption of unthinkable antiquity, this brainstorm of timbers, ropes and pulleys is still used by fisherfolk to catch mullet. Watch them do it; say a few encouraging words; then buy, cook and eat the fish. My last night was spent in Monte Sant' Angelo and here, I am afraid, all restraint must be thrown to the winds. The coldest night I have ever spent in Italy was also the most exhilarating. Though it sits atop a mountain, as its name suggests, MS'A is less spectacular than Peschici but more real. Where could one eat, please? Oh, in Signora So-and-So's dining room - she takes in friends and strangers. And there we were after knocking at an unsigned, unnumbered house and being led through the family sitting-room (kids watching TV, baby being fed, grandma doing what looked like the football pools) into the teeny dining-room, where we sat down to sip hot minestrone and quarter a flavoursome fish, surrounded by the cat, the dog and the local priest. And where could one sleep? Oh, in Signora Such-and-Such's place - she puts up waifs, strays and fugitives. So we froze through a slim-sheeted night in two beds on a stone-flagged floor with a view through the window of star-crowded sky and infinite, quilted, velvet-dark valley. Time moves on and McDonald's may move into Monte Sant' Angelo any time. Give the town a try before it does. Of archaeological interest are St Michael's sanctuary, where the saint is said to have made several personal appearances during the 15th century; and the splendid Norman castle with its views over the town and valley. It is not floodlit, so take a torch at night. In the middle of the Gargano peninsula is the vast and intermittently picturesque foresta Umbra. Go by car. 'Public transport is thin on the ground,' says one guidebook, putting things gently. But there are hundreds of roe deer to compensate. A quick camera-pan round the Gargano may give you a glimpse of other beauty or interest spots. Pugnochiuso (south of Vieste) has an eye-striking coast and good bathing plus a couple of the peninsula's rare resort hotels. Vico Del Gargano (south of Peschici) is a steep, ancient village. Rodi Garganico (west of Peschici) has fine sandy beaches. And San Giovanni Rotondo and San Marco in Lamis are two saints' towns further inland that stand sentinel between the foresta Umbra and the autostrada. Much of Gargano, it must be said, is ill-equipped for mass visitation, and some of the cheaper out-of-town hotels are built in the hope-and-prayer style of much southern Italian development. But when love is semi-blind even handicaps become part of the beloved's charm. We have not mentioned the people of the Gargano. These have undergone even less touristic development than their towns. They still look at you, as you drive through their streets or along their suicidal coast roads, as if you are mad. Do not attempt to get out of the car and reassure them. Think, rather, that they are probably right. A degree of madness is a help when making that fateful motorway decision to leave dull flatness and head for these frightening heights. I found that the people, once a natural rapport develops, are of the best rough-diamond quality. Yes, they will have you into their homes; yes, you will pay the proper price. But you still feel part of the family, even of the landscape, as their rooms and hearts and wines (try the red Castel Del Monte) and earthy cooking secrets open up before you.</p>

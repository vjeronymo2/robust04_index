			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: SIA set to make bonus issue SINGAPORE Airlines (SIA), the flag carrier, proposed a one-for-one bonus issue at its annual meeting on Saturday, Reuter reports from Singapore. The airline hopes the move will help its shares climb out of the narrow range of SDollars 12 to SDollars 13 each, which they have traded at since the end of the Gulf war in February 1991. SIA's shareholding structure restricts trading: about 100 shareholders control 91.6 per cent of the airline. Local analysts said a bonus issue would make SIA shares more liquid. With more shares available for trading, prices could be expected to rise. pany. SIA is among the world's most profitable airlines.</p>

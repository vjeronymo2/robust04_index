			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 51.2925 and 51.2926 are proposed to be revised to remove cuts and skin breaks as free from defects (and change them to free from damage and serious damage defects, respectively). According to the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee, the ``Washington Apricot industry has had difficulty in meeting the U.S. Grade Standards for Apricots with regard to `skin breaks.' This has caused a great deal of hardship as the industry attempts to make sales into Canada. Over the past year members of the Washington Apricot Marketing Committee have been expressing a desire to gain some sort of relief from the strict interpretation of the `free from' portion of the grade standards. The real problem, as our industry sees it, is that there is no definition of what constitutes `damage' and `serious damage' relative to `skin breaks' and/or `punctures.' Consequently, all of these types of defects are scored no matter how small or insignificant they might be.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that &sect;&sect;51.2925 and 51.2926 be revised to include bruises as a specified defect. Bruising is a prevalent defect on apricots that should have specific areas designated which constitute damage and serious damage. Presently, this defect is scored based on the general definitions for damage and serious damage. It is proposed that any bruise causing discoloration exceeding the area of a circle three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter or one-eighth inch (3.1 mm) in depth (damage) or five-eighths inch (15.9 mm) in diameter or three-sixteenths inch (4.8 mm) in depth (serious damage), or an aggregate of lesser bruises detracting from the appearance, edible or shipping quality of the apricot as much as the depth or area requirements previously mentioned be scored against the grade.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 51.2926a Unclassified is being removed. Unclassified is not a grade in itself but was simply a designation for apricots that do not meet any grade requirement. However, it is often mistaken as an actual grade. Since the designation is rarely used and may create some confusion in the market place it should be discontinued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that paragraph (c) Description of Pack of &sect;51.2927 be removed. This paragraph provides for pack designations in 4-basket crates. Apricots are seldom, if ever, packed in these types of containers for today's markets. Therefore, this paragraph is no longer needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d) Tolerance would also be removed. This paragraph allows a tolerance for offsize specimens. The proposed rule would make referencing of these tolerances easier and bring the format into conformity with more recent standards by establishing a separate ``Tolerances'' section. This new section, 51.2928 would respecify not only the size tolerances which are being removed from paragraph (d), but would also apply tolerances to packages marked according to count, and defect tolerances as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 51.2928 Mature is revised so that the definition of mature does not contain the word as part of the definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously mentioned a new section which would now be designated &sect;51.2928 Tolerances, would list all applicable tolerances for the grades. Other than the provision for packages marked according to count, there are no new tolerances proposed in this section. Rather than scatter the tolerances under different sections throughout the standard, they have been grouped together under one section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new section, 51.2929 Application of Tolerances, is being proposed. This section will designate a limit on excessively high defect percentages for an individual sample which, if exceeded, would cause the lot to fail to grade even though the average of these defects may be within the lot tolerances provided. It is proposed that for lot tolerances of ten percent or more, individual samples may not contain more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified, and for tolerances of less than 10 percent, individual samples may contain not more than double the tolerance specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The general definition for damage would be revised to reflect that which is currently used in most other standards. It also specifies that the dimensions provided for defect limits are based on an apricot one and seven-eighths inches (4.8 cm) in diameter, and correspondingly lesser or greater dimensions are allowed for smaller or larger sized apricots.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the new section (51.2932) proposed for damage, each defect is listed as a separate paragraph. New definitions under this section include dirt, scab, scale hail, skin breaks, stem pulls, and bruises. All specifications except for bruises, skin breaks, and stem pulls are taken from the inspection handbook on scoring these defects under the general definitions of damage and serious damage. The scoring for skin breaks and stem pulls was recommended by WAMC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that scale occurring as scale insects, scale marks, or similar marks which are heavily concentrated or are scattered and aggregating more than one-fourth inch (6.3 mm) in diameter (damage) or one-half inch (12.7 mm) in diameter (serious damage); scab spot when cracked or aggregating more than three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter in the aggregate (damage) or when the skin has been broken or when more than three-sixteenths of an inch (4.8 mm) deep or more than one-half inch (12.7 mm) in diameter in the aggregate (serious damage); and bruises when any bruise causes discoloration exceeding the area of a circle three-eighths inch (9.5 mm) in diameter or one-eighth inch (3.1 mm) in depth (damage) or when any bruise causes discoloration exceeding the area of a circle five-eighths inch (15.9 mm) in diameter or three-sixteenths (4.8 mm) in depth; skin breaks in the form of cuts and punctures which exceed individually or in the aggregate, an area equivalent to a circle three-sixteenths inch (4.8 mm) in diameter (damage) or three-eighths inch (9.6 mm) in diameter (serious damage); stem pulls which exceed an area equivalent to a circle three-eighths inch (9.6 mm) in diameter (damage) or one-half inch (12.7 mm) in diameter (serious damage); be specified as definitions under the appropriate sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 51  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Agricultural commodities, Food grades and standards, Fruits, Nuts, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Vegetables. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

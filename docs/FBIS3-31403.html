He said he did not intend to leave the political life since  he felt he shared responsibility for the appearance of the  independent Slovakia. "I wanted Slovakia to become independent  and contributed to this goal. I therefore cannot leave the  political scene until a political structure capable of  guaranteeing stability and prosperity for Slovakia is created,"  Moravcik said.    He said he expected new groupings to appear on the Slovak  political scene in the near future and mainly a strong bloc of  center-oriented parties. Moravcik said the HZDS had deflected  from the central line and has been lately oriented towards  radicalism. He said he was for central policy but declined to  say which political party he would prefer.    Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar did not specify at any of  government meetings his allegations that "the opposition is  connected with financial circles," which were raised by him in  the media, Moravcik said. On the contrary, a quick decision by  the government on Tuesday [15 February] to put fifteen  state-owned enterprises to direct sale testifies to Meciar's  "genuine intention" to proceed with privatization in a honest  way, Moravcik added ironically.    Commenting on his "voluntary walk-out" from a government  session on Tuesday, Moravcik said that he and Deputy Premier  Roman Kovac were called upon by Meciar to leave the second part  of the meeting, "if they are honest people," since it was  dedicated to internal political situation.</p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / German growth rate beaten Britain's manufacturing productivity growth was 'superior' to that of Germany during 1979-1989, claims a study of productivity in the two countries over the past 30 years, Robert Taylor writes. The report, published yesterday by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, was based on 30 industrial sectors. It says that 'at the level of individual manufacturing industries, Germany does not so clearly dominate Britain, except in the period from 1973 to 1979'. It adds: 'Almost half the industries showed a superior British productivity growth performance over the entire three decades to 1989.' Britain still lags in the number of manufacturing workers with skills; in the volume of resources devoted to research and development; and in investment in new plant and machinery.</p>

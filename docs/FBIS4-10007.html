			<p>BFN     [Text] Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange will not  resign as a result of the first ruling on the case of the three  slain communist leaders. Stange personally informed reporters  of his decision at Government House after meeting with President  Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle.    The following is a report by Jose Miguel Alfaro:    [Begin recording] [Alfaro] President Eduardo Frei and the  Carabineros director general held a 90-minute meeting amid an  atmosphere of unusual security measures around the La Moneda  Palace and great expectation among journalists and the crowd  that gathered at the door on Constitution Plaza.    General Stange arrived at La Moneda a little after 0930 and  entered La Moneda through the door on Agustinas Street. After  the 90-minute meeting with the president, Stange went to the  Government House News Room where Government House correspondents  were waiting for him. He made the following statement:    [Stange] We held an extensive meeting during which he had  the  courtesy to listen to me. Therefore, I am not leaving.    Judge Juica's ruling suggests that the military courts  should  investigate to establish whether or not justice was obstructed.    I want to make it perfectly clear that I personally was not  involved, nor was my name ever mentioned, in the kidnapping or  killing of the three communist leaders. I want to make this  perfectly clear.    The much-discussed recording does exist. It was recorded  secretly. I urge people to read the full transcription of this  tape and not just parts of it. The full transcription of the  tape clearly shows that the person who made the recording  reasserts to me he is completely innocent of the charges of  which he has now been formally charged. Therefore, I urge you  to read the full transcription of the tape and not just portions  of it, because this only distorts a perfectly clear situation.    Judge Juica investigated this case for many years. If he  recommends the military courts to investigate who is  responsible, I will comply with his decision.    We are living in a democracy, and anyone can request  whatever  he wishes under the law. But it is a completely different  matter for me to be held responsible for other people's guilt.    I have kept quiet precisely to see who wants me to retire. I  am now responding to some of these extravagant expressions. I  am not leaving.    [Several journalists ask questions simultaneously]    [Stange] Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Focus on yen after trade talks fail - Currency Markets In a week which sees a flood of UK economic data released and a Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday, attention in foreign exchange markets will initially focus on the aftermath of the failed trade talks between the US and Japan. President Clinton and Mr Hosokawa could not reach agreement at their Friday meeting about how to cut Japan's trade surplus and improve US access to specific market sectors. The general expectation is that the yen will strengthen as this is one means by which the US can close the gap. The market was already moving this way last week. The yen closed on Friday in New York at Y107.1 to the dollar, its highest close since mid-November. Any appreciation of the yen is likely to be a short-term phenomenon. It does not serve Japan's interests as it will hamper much-needed economic recovery. Arguably, it could also cause the trade surplus to increase if it inhibits growth in consumer demand. In the longer term, economic fundamentals favour a stronger dollar as the US economy is enjoying solid growth while Japan remains mired in recession. President Clinton said on Saturday that the US will this week review its options on how to approach the trade question. Reports in the US media yesterday quoted senior US officials saying the administration had already decided to try to increase its bargaining power by imposing sanctions on some Japanese imports. In the UK the focus will be on the release on Wednesday of retail sales figures and the retail prices index for January. With the UK economy enjoying solid growth, the outlook for sterling remains positive. Following last week's poorly received rate cut, however, observers believe there may be a delay before it recovers investor support. In Europe attention will once more focus on Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council. Although analysts have long been forecasting an easing of policy, most believe the central bank will wait for January's money supply figures before making any changes.</p>

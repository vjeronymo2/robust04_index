			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME AWAY FROM HOME;  </P> <P> LATE-NIGHT REVERIE  </P> <P> For Parisian-born costume and fabric designer Rolande Guizart, the holiday  season calls up memories of bustling streets, crowded cafes and fairy-like  window displays offering the delectable ingredients of the traditional French  midnight dinner, the reveillon, served on Christmas and New Year's Eve.  </P> <P> To capture that ambience in Los Angeles, Guizart drops in at Santa Monica's  Boulangerie, a big French Basque cafe, restaurant and deli.  </P> <P> Tucked away from freeways and palm trees, the cafe is planted with greenery,  offers a tempting mix of wine and food and buzzes with morning conversations.  "It's a little piece of France," says Guizart, who likes to watch the comings  and goings of families, the nods and smiles of couples and the frowns of  intellectuals behind their newspapers.  </P> <P> "Nobody hurries you on your way," says Guizart, who lingers over a morning's  cappuccino and croissant, prolonging a relaxing moment between business  appointments.  </P> <P> The deli combines a number of French food shops and their specialties -- the  boulangerie for bread, the patisserie for sweets, the charcuterie for pates and  catered hors d'oeuvres. Through an archway Guizart eyes the delicacies of a  typical French reveillon.  </P> <P> "In France, the holidays mean the reveillon," says Guizart, who points out that  whether rich or poor, her compatriots will spend their money on that feast.  Oysters, foie gras and turkey stuffed with chestnut dressing are served in  successive courses, accompanied by champagne and topped with the traditional  cake, the buche de Noel. Made in the form of a Yule log, the buche is decorated  with tiny figures of a woodsman, forest elves and mushroom sprouts.  </P> <P> For Guizart, buying a buche in Los Angeles is rediscovering a symbol of the  season's magic. "When I was in Paris, I could stand in front of the food shop  windows for hours at Christmas. They were so fabulous, they made you want to  eat even when you weren't hungry."

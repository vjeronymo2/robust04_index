			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vaisanen: "Ministry Finds More Areas To Be </F> Subsidized Under EU's Category Six"]    [Excerpts] The Interior Ministry has found a lot of areas  in Finland that meet the population density criterion for  subsidies offered by the EU's [European Union] so-called [area  category] six. [passage omitted] The additional areas are  primarily regional communities that meet the criteria for both  EU one and six subsidies.    The Ministry would still like Etela-Pohjanmaa to be a  subsidized area. The province's population density is over the  required limit, or more than eight inhabitants per square  kilometer. On the other hand, the national product per  inhabitant is under 75 percent of the average EU figure and the  second-lowest in Finland.    The Ministry has also listed a couple of districts that are  large in terms of number of people, which just barely exceed the  eight-inhabitant limit: the Nivala (43,000 inhabitants) and  Iisalmi (72,000) areas. Their gross naitonal product is under  the 75-percent limit.    The districts of Pyhanta, Ii, Viitasaari, Kaustinen,  Saarijarvi, Virrat, Nilsia, Sysma, Hankasalmi, Savitaipale,  Liminka, Suonenjoki, and Keuruu are also new areas. If category  six subsidies could be gotten for the entire area the Ministry  plans to include, the subsidized area would cover 24.4 percent  of the population.    At the beginning of the week the EU offered Finland a  "category six subsidy," which is about 10-percent smaller,  instead of the highest area subsidy. The subsidized area would  be the same as the category one subsidy planned earlier, that  is, Lapland, Kuusamo, Kainuu, Pohjois-Karjala, and Etela-Savo.</p>

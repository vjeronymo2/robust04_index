			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Holders of QMH debentures set up steering group Holders of Queens Moat Houses' two debenture stocks yesterday formed a steering committee to negotiate with the hotel company over terms of its refinancing. At a meeting there was a unanimous vote in favour of the move, which was described as helpful by the company, its advisers and the trustee to the stocks. QMH is in talks with its bankers and other lenders over a Pounds 1.3bn refinancing. The debenture stocks are secured on assets but last November holders agreed to waive their right to enforce their security. The value of the security has fallen to below the nominal value of the two stocks, which total Pounds 215m. Yesterday, holders representing 81.77 per cent of the two stocks voted either at the meeting or by proxy. The committee includes Legal &amp; General, Sun Life Assurance, Standard Life, Norwich Union, Equitable Life and Eagle Star Life. These six investors hold 53 per cent of the two stocks.</p>

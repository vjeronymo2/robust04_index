			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: European Council must not reinterpret Maastricht Sir, Sir Leon Brittan's article, 'Time to retune for Emu harmony' (October 27), makes a powerful case - even if he may not realise it - for the renegotiation of Maastricht and for a return to Title II of the Single European Act which kept the words 'Economic and Monetary Union' in brackets. We do not need the European Council to commission (yet another) outline economic strategy. 'One Money, One Market' was hopelessly wrong - why should anyone be taken in again? We must not be. We live in hope that the government will make this clear at today's EC summit. Sir Leon and others at the summit should heed the implications of the recent German court ruling and not attempt to interpret and implement Maastricht as they please; it is not their right so to do. But even if they do try they will find that no amount of realignment, co-ordination and reinterpretation can paper over the fundamental inadequacies of Maastricht's economic and monetary provisions.

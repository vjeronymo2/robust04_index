			<p>BFN     [Text] European representation at security talks remains an  open question with three positions now on the table, according  to Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan.    Mr Surin, who was in Paris last week, said France held that  the European Union should be represented by a so-called troika  of former, current and pending presidents at the ASEAN Regional  Forum (ARF) which Thailand will host on July 25.    Mr Surin met permanent secretary for foreign affairs  Bertrand  Dufoureq in what was the highest level Thai-French exchange in  recent years.    The EU Commission on Asian Affairs, however, favoured  representation by Germany and an official of the EU Commission,  Mr Surin said.    Germany, which would by then have taken up the rotating  presidency of the EU, wanted to be the community's  representative, with backing by senior officials from Germany  and Greece, he said.    "There is no conclusion on the issue. They can discuss this  and inform us later," Mr Surin said, shortly after returning  from a fleeting visit to Malaysia.    Senior officials preparing for the forum let it be known  last  month that Germany, which takes up the six-month presidency of  the EU on July 1, was a likely candidate for EU representative.  France would be represented at the forum if ASEAN accepts the  Troika formula which normally has been the case for the annual  post-ministerial conference featuring ASEAN foreign ministers  and their dialogue partners.    The presidency of the EU turns in alphabetical order. France  precedes Germany and Greece would follow.    France was interested in having a role in Southeast Asia and  Indochina -- in terms of culture as well as business -- and knew  cooperation with ASEAN was necessary to achieve this, Mr Surin  said.    "All European countries, in fact, have their own policy on  this region," he said.    The EU Union will be one of a total of 18 entities  participating in the forum. The EU will do so as one of ASEAN's  seven dialogue partners.    Six other dialogue partners also to attend are Australia,  Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States.    Eleven other entities participating in the informal meeting  at foreign minister level are the six ASEAN member states,  Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,  Thailand; their consultative partners China and Russia; and  three "observer" states, Laos, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam.</p>

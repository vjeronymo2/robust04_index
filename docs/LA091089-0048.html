			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIP OF THE WEEK: RUSTIC LODGING AMID THE TOWERING REDWOODS  </P> <P> If you want to sleep out in the woods but don't have a tent, consider spending  a night or two at Big Basin Redwoods State Park.  </P> <P> That's where 36 tent cabins were erected earlier this year, the first such  accommodations offered in any California state park. If the rustic lodgings  prove to be popular, tent cabins may be built in other state recreation areas.  </P> <P> It would be difficult to select a more appealing site for this pilot project.  The campsites are in the midst of a primeval forest of awe-inspiring trees:  coast redwoods that soar higher than 30-story buildings.  </P> <P> At the turn of the century, citizens got together to save the age-old trees  from covetous lumbermen and help establish California's first state park.  Members of the Sempervirens Club campaigned for funds and a legislative bill  that created California Redwood Park in 1902.  </P> <P> Since then, the 3,800-acre preserve has been expanded to more than four times  its original size to protect some of the most pristine stands of redwoods on  earth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 80 Miles of Trails  </P> <P> The park is a haven for nature lovers, who can explore by foot, horseback and  bicycle. After entering the hilly park via a winding, paved road, visitors can  roam along 80 miles of scenic trails.  </P> <P> Near the park headquarters is the popular Redwood Trail that circles past some  of the largest and most interesting coast redwoods in the Big Basin area. Pay  25 cents for a self-guiding brochure to this flat, half-mile loop trail that  has numbered sign posts for 11 points of interest.  </P> <P> At No. 6, step inside the Chimney Tree, a living redwood with a burned-out  center that opens to the sky. Also stop at No. 9 to gaze up at the 329-foot  Mother of the Forest, the Big Basin's tallest redwood. A neighboring tree,  Father of the Forest, is estimated to be at least 2,000 years old.  </P> <P> During this short walk in the woods you can listen and look for the noisy  Steller's jay, acorn woodpecker, Oregon junco and other birds. Also keep your  eyes open for black-tailed deer and chipmunks. Raccoons often are seen between  dusk and dawn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flora and Fauna  </P> <P> Camp out for a night or two to enjoy more of the park's flora and fauna. Try  one of the new canvas tent cabins equipped with two double beds and foam-rubber  mattresses. A lantern and wood-burning stove for heat also are provided. The  cozy 12x14-foot tents have screen windows with flaps that can be closed privacy  or on cool nights.  </P> <P> Each campsite includes a picnic table and barbecue grill. Piped-in drinking  water, hot showers and flush toilets are close by. Tent cabins rent for $29 a  night.  </P> <P> Bring your own sleeping bags or bed linens, or rent a linen package ($9) that  has two sets of sheets, pillows, pillow cases and blankets. Deposits are  required for rental linen and the tent lantern.  </P> <P> Reserve accommodations by calling Mistix toll-free at (800) 444-7275. Tent  cabins will be available daily until the rainy season begins in mid or late  October, then on weekends only until March or April.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No RV Hookups  </P> <P> Call the same number for reservations at the park's four campgrounds, where 145  family camping spots are available all year. The nightly fee is $10; no RV  hookups. Hikers can bed down in primitive trail camps for $2 per person a  night.  </P> <P> The day-use fee for picnicking or parking in Big Basin Redwoods State Park is  $3 per vehicle.  </P> <P> Rangers and docents lead walks in the woods almost daily in summer and on  special occasions during the rest of the year. Inquire at park headquarters for  tour times.  </P> <P> At the eastern edge of the park you can mount up at Western Explorations' Big  Basin Stables for a trail ride through the redwoods. The 2 1/2-hour horseback  excursions leave the corral at 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. every day except Monday,  through October. They resume again in May.  </P> <P> The relaxing outing costs $35 per person. Novice to advanced riders are  welcome; minimum age is 10 years. Call (408) 438-4226 for reservations. Groups  of eight or more can arrange dinner or Sunday brunch rides or overnight trail  trips.  </P> <P> A mountain bike touring company called Dusty Roads also offers guided rides  through the park. The last tours of the season were on Labor Day, but they will  begin again next May. Call (408) 973-9299 for a brochure of biking itineraries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nature Lodge Museum  </P> <P> Near park headquarters, be sure to visit the Nature Lodge, a museum featuring  natural history exhibits. One display explains why redwoods are so resistant to  fire and disease. You'll also see mounted examples of the birds and animals  found in the 17,000-acre park.  </P> <P> Adjacent to the museum is a general store with picnic supplies and a gift shop  with redwood bowls, coasters and other souvenir items. Guests staying in the  tent cabins register at the gift shop. After closing hours, guests register  with the host at Huckleberry Campground.  </P> <P> For more information about Big Basin Redwoods State Park, call (408) 338-6132.  </P> <P> Get to the park from Los Angeles by driving north on U.S. 101 to San Jose and  exit onto California 17 south. Exit west onto California 9, an official State  Scenic Highway that goes through Saratoga to join California 236.  </P> <P> This is a beautiful but narrow and curvy road that heads southwest into the  park. (Not recommended for long RVs and vehicles with trailers.)  </P> <P> An alternative route is to exit U.S. 101 and pick up California 1 to Santa  Cruz, then take California 9 north to Boulder Creek to join California 236,  which is wider and less winding when it enters the park from the east.  </P> <P> Round trip from Los Angeles to Big Basin Redwoods State Park via the latter  route is 784 miles.  </P></p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Management: TNT time for quality - A look at an award which aims to create TQM role models Large lorries trundled down the ramp at Wapping, Rupert Murdoch's east London printing site and cradle of a Fleet Street revolution nine years ago. Cameras whirred, pickets shouted night after night. For many people in Britain the image of TNT Express (UK) - the Australian-owned group which operated those vehicles - is still defined by those events. This week, however, the logistics and supply-chain management company earned a new and less controversial reputation as a paragon of British quality. Along with Rover Group, TNT was announced joint winner on Wednesday night of the UK's first Quality Award, launched earlier this year to recognise outstanding business performance through the application of Total Quality Management principles. Avis Rent A Car, BT Northern Ireland and ICL's Customer Service division were also shortlisted. The prize's objective is identical to the European Quality Awards and the US Baldridge Awards which have both sought in recent years to create TQM role models. The UK competition, and the more than 800 business people who packed a central London hotel for the award ceremony, bear witness to the continuing appeal of TQM more than 40 years after its 'invention' by two American lecturers working in Japan. TQM may be less fashionable than business process re-engineering but it is still widely considered to have high potential to transform organisations by putting the spotlight on customer and employee satisfaction. Over the next few months TNT chief executive Alan Jones and John Towers, his opposite number at Rover, will find themselves at Quality conferences and seminars up and down the country explaining why their programmes have produced results, thus inspiring others who have been less successful. TNT, which delivers 60 per cent of Britain's national newspaper tonnage from a standing start in 1985, began its Total Quality initiative in 1989. 'Our whole philosophy is that we want to help our customers sell more of their products: in doing that so we sell more of our freight,' explains Jones. He cites as an example TNT's suggestion that newspapers discontinue the age-old practice of individually labelling each newsagent's package - a change which helped cut transit times by one hour. Rover believes it has demonstrated the value of TQ in the way it has bucked the recession in the European motor industry. Product quality improvements, for instance, have substantially reduced warranty costs while external surveys have tracked an improving trend in customer satisfaction. Towers says TQM is 'not like a package of pills you pull off the shelf, and take with a glass of water three times a week'. He cites the importance of top-level leadership, the establishment of a vision which individuals can identify with across the company, and the creation of what he calls a 'compelling need'. He suggests British companies are good at 'pulling themselves back from the brink' but less inspired when times are good. Rover's answer in 1990 was to paint a picture of what the car industry might look like by 1995 - based on research of events in North America: 'It was not so much a Sword of Damocles as simply saying to people this is what is likely to change, you might as well get on and make sure that's what we do rather than take the risk that we are overpowered by rivals'. Towers talks about 'getting the drum going' but not changing the beat. Changing the metaphor, he adds: 'One of the things about the Japanese is that they don't have to have a new flag every year, even if its colour may alter a bit'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [EC Information Memo No 93/59: "Launching the European </F> Environment Agency--European Commission--DG XI, EEA Task Force"]    [Text]  <H5>  The Decision </H5>   The 29th October 1993 brought the long awaited decision on  the location of the seat of the European Environment Agency  (hereafter EEA). It shall be established in Denmark in the  Copenhagen area. The [European] Council regulation (Footnote 1)  (Council regulation 90/1210/EEC of 7 May 1990 on the  establishment of the European Environment Agency and the  European Environment Information and Observation Network. OJ No  L 120, 11.5.1990, p. 1.) is now in force which means that steps  can be taken to ensure the EEA is up and running in the shortest  time possible.  <H5>  Immediate Steps Being Taken To Establish the EEA </H5>   To make the EEA operational it is first necessary to convene  the management board. This will consist of one representative of  each member state, two representatives of the Commission  (Footnote 2) (Laurens-Jan Brinkhorst (director-general DG  [Directorate General] XI) and Jean-Pierre Contzen  (director-general JRC [Joint Research Center]), and  respectively, as alternatives, Thomas Garvey (deputy  director-general DG XI) and Yves Franchet (director-general  Eurostat).) and two designated by the European Parliament. The  first meeting of the board will take place on Friday 17 December  1993. The meeting will tackle the immediate business needed to  bring about a speedy start to the EEA's work, including: the  procedure and schedule for appointing the executive director;  interim arrangements to start the EEA's operation; provisional  budget matters; and, appointment of the nine member scientific  committee. The preparations made towards a draft work programme  will also be tabled at the meeting, together with a report on  the activities of the EEA task force between 1990 and 1993.    The appointment of the executive director by the management  board is of prime importance. The Council regulation requires  the Commission to submit a proposal of candidature to the  management board which will be done in consultation with them.    Pending the entry into service of the first executive  director, it is vital that the scientific and technical aspects  of the work be actively pursued. Interim arrangements will  therefore be adopted at the first management board meeting to  ensure the smooth transfer of knowledge and expertise and the  continuity of ongoing projects. These arrangements will include,  in particular: the appointment of a 'mandataire' to act as  executive officer until the executive director begins work; the  steps to be taken to prepare the multiannual work programme;  and, appropriate measures concerning an interim team and its  tasks for the transition period. The Commission will provide the  necessary assistance for financial and administrative matters  (in particular, preparation of staff recruitment, staff status  and budget).  <H5>  Background and Mandate </H5>   The creation of the EEA should be seen against the  background  of the aims of environmental protection laid down in the Treaty  of Rome as amended by the Single European Act, by successive  Community action programmes on the environment, and now by the  Maastricht Treaty. UNCED [UN Conference on Environment and  Development], and in particular Agenda 21, now provide the  international framework for fostering cooperation on the  environment.    The EEA, and the `European Environment Information and  Observation Network', which it will coordinate, are intended to  provide the Community and the member states with objective,  reliable and comparable information at the European level to  enable them to take the measures necessary to protect the  environment, as well as to be able to assess the results of  these measures. Equally important is the aim to ensure that the  public is properly informed about the state of the environment.  For all these purposes the EEA will also provide the necessary  scientific and technical support.    The management board will decide how the EEA is to be  organised. However, it is clear from the Council regulation that  the EEA will be the hub of a decentralised, distributed, network  making the maximum use of resources already existing in member  states.  <H5>  Building Blocks </H5>   A number of major building blocks are required to enable the  tasks of the EEA to be carried out:  <H5>  Information and Observation Network </H5>   The European Environment Information and Observation Network  will consist of:    - component parts of the existing national information  networks;    - a national focal point nominated by each member state;    - institutions contracted by the EEA to work on specific  subjects of particular interest, often referred to as `topic  centres' or `thematic centres.'    Within 6 months of the entry into force of the Council  regulation, member states have to inform the EEA of the main  components of their national networks, including, if desired,  national focal points, as well as candidates for topic centres.  <H5>  Multiannual Work Programme </H5>   Within 9 months of the Council regulation coming into force  the first multiannual work programme must be adopted by the  management board.  <H5>  Topic Centres </H5>    In approving the multiannual work programme the management  board will have to decide specific tasks of topic centres. The  Council regulation does not explicitly specify a deadline for  the actual designation of the topic centres nor their thematic  or geographic orientations.  <H5>  Work Areas </H5>   The principal activities will cover all those areas of work  necessary to enable the EEA to describe the present and  foreseeable state of the environment from the point of view of:    - the quality of the environment;    - the pressures on the environment;    - the sensitivity of the environment.    Priorities in supplying environmental information which may  be used directly in the implementation of Community environment  policy, the EEA in its first years will give priority to the  following areas:    - air quality and atmospheric emissions;    - water quality, pollutants and water resources;    - the state of the soil, of the fauna and flora, and of  biotopes;    - land use and natural resources;    - waste management;    - noise emissions;    - chemical substances which are hazardous for the  environment;    - coastal protection.    Special consideration will be given to transfrontier,  plurinational and global phenomena, and the socioeconomic  dimension shall also be taken into account.    Possible future tasks within two years of the EEA coming  into  operation, the Council shall decide on further tasks for the  EEA, in particular, in the following areas:    - Associating in the monitoring of the implementation of  Community environmental legislation; - Preparing environmental  labels and criteria for their award to environmentally friendly  products, technologies and services etc; - Promoting  environmentally friendly technologies and processes; and, -  Establishing criteria for assessing the impact on the  environment.  <H5>  Cooperation With Other Bodies </H5>   Community bodies the EEA shall actively seek the cooperation  of other Community bodies and programmes, and notably the Joint  Research Centre (JRC), the statistical office (Eurostat) and the  Community's environmental research and development programmes.    The JRC will have an essential role in research and such  areas as:    - harmonization of environmental measurement methods;    - intercalibration of instruments;    - standardization of data formats;    - development of new environmental measurement methods and  instruments;    - other tasks as agreed between the executive director of  the  EEA and the director-general of the JRC.    On request of the EEA, the JRC will be able to provide  scientific support in specific fields of competence and  technical support in areas such as informatics and networking.    Coordination with Eurostat is expected to lead to the supply  of data on human activities (necessary to assess pressures on  the environment), on economy-environment relations, and on basic  territorial characteristics (topography).  <H3>  Participation of Non-Community Countries and International  Organisations </H3>   In parallel with its cooperation with external bodies,  participation of third countries in the work of the EEA is  clearly important since environmental problems and challenges  are not confined by national frontiers. This has been envisaged  from the outset, and provisions for their involvement is covered  in Article 19 of the Council regulation. Considerable interest  has already been shown by EFTA (European Free Trade Association)  member states, as well as by countries of Eastern and Central  Europe.    Participation of international organisations the EEA will  also develop working relations with relevant international  organisations, with bodies such as the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Council of Europe and  the European Space Agency, and those of the United Nations  family, particularly the United Nations Environment Programme  (UNEP), the World MeteorologicaL Organization and the  International Atomic Energy Agency. The participation of  non-governmental organisations is equally important.  <H5>  The Inheritance </H5>   The EEA is the logical successor, in particular, of the  Corine programme. Corine was an experimental project (1985-1990)  to determine the need and practice for collecting, coordinating  and ensuring the consistency of information on the state of the  environment and natural resources within the Community. Its  pilot projects concentrated on land cover, biotopes, and  emissions to the atmosphere (see below).    The Corine programme led to three types of complementary  results: (i) relevant data bases for several priority  environmental concerns; (ii) methods and nomenclatures adopted  at Community level and internationally; and, (iii) networks of  experts from all member states used to pooling their knowledge  for environmental objectives.    The techniques, data bases and networks established under  the  Corine programme will provide a significant contribution to the  work of the EEA.    The conclusions of the Dublin, Dobris and Luzern Ministerial  Conferences, (June 1990, June 1991 and April 1993 respectively)  emphasised the importance of integrating environmental  information systems throughout Europe. Many non-EC countries  have already expressed a keen interest to take part fully in the  EEA's programme and to integrate into the network. In  particular, the EFTA countries have stressed the importance of  the role of the EEA as an instrument of cooperation on a  European scale. Since that time, many non-EC countries have  undertaken work in this respect.    Beginning in January 1990, the EEA task force has worked to  maintain and utilise the data and expertise built-up during the  Corine programme, and to handle the many and diverse initiatives  arising out of the decision to establish the EEA. In order to  limit the damage caused by the absence of a decision on the seat  of the EEA, this has increasingly meant becoming involved in new  activities on behalf of the EEA, without compromising future  decisions of the management board. The main areas of the task  force's activities, in the period 1990 to 1993, are outlined  below.  <H5>  Preparatory Activities for the EEA </H5>   Work programme - in the light of many discussions between  the  Commission and a high-level group of member state national  experts, the EEA task force has prepared a first draft  multi-annual work programme. A systematic analysis of the data  needed to implement the programme has been started, based in the  first place on the objectives of the 5th Community Action  Programme on the environment, 'towards sustainability'. The  information needed to support the reporting requirements  established in the UNCED Agenda 21 have also to be considered.  <H5>  Network </H5>   Work is underway to develop a network architecture for the  EEA to ensure inter-operability of the various elements of the  'European Environment Information and Observation Network'. This  is taking into account issues of security, secrecy and legality,  in line with common rules developed through the DG III  programme, IDA (Interchange of Data between Administrations),  whose aim is to encourage and stimulate such data exchange. The  approach focusses on the requirements for communication and the  exchange and access to data and information systems.  <H5>  Data Bases </H5>   A `data-model' is being prepared to serve the needs of  current and expected future data holdings, including, in  particular, those arising out of European environmental  legislation. Development of a strategy for coding data, and  standards needed to improve and facilitate data exchange, are  included.  <H5>  Catalogue of Data Sources </H5>   A report has been completed on the needs and possible  solutions for a 'meta-database' for the EEA. This is a system  that records details of data holdings, data sources,  institutions, activities and other environmental related  information needed for the EEA's work. The main characteristics  of the system have now been defined and a standard 'data-model'  is being developed. Plans are also being laid for the  preparation of a multi-lingual thesaurus of environmental terms  to use in connection with the catalogue.  <H5>  Updating and Completing Corine Data Bases </H5>   Land cover - the cartography of land cover on the scale of  1:100 000 has been completed for almost half of the territory of  the European Community. This is continuing with the support of  Community regional policy, with a view to completion of the  inventory in 1994- 95. In addition, the application of Community  methodology has begun in the PHARE (Footnote 3) (countries of  Central and Eastern Europe in receipt of EC economic aid  according to the terms of Council regulation 89/3906/EEC)  countries, as well as in several EFTA member states and in  countries in the southern part of the Mediterranean basin with  LIFE (Footnote 10) (Council regulation 92/1973/EEC of 21 May  1992 establishing a financial instrument for the environment  (LIFE). OJ No L 206, 22.7.92, p. 1.)/MEDSPA (Footnote 11)  (Council regulation 91/563/EEC of 4 March 1991 on action by the  Community for the protection of the environment in the  mediterranean region (MEDSPA). OJ No L 63, 9.3.1991. p. 1.)  support.  <H5>  Biotopes </H5>   The data base has been updated and supplemented to serve the  needs of Community nature conservation policy, and in particular  the application of the `habitats' directive. The PHARE countries  and certain EFTA member states are carrying out the inventory  according to the Community methodology. Work continues in  collaboration with the Council of Europe and the principal  international nature conservancy organisations.  <H5>  Corinair 1990 </H5>   An inventory of pollutant emissions is being carried out for  1990 as an update of the 1985 inventory. The work is being  performed in cooperation with the United Nations' Economic  Commission for Europe (UNECE), all of whose European member  states currently apply the Community methodology `Corinair.' The  inventory includes greenhouse gases, and the results will  provide the European contribution to the OECD-IPCC  (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) programme in this  field. The inventory also meets the needs for the supply of data  connected with the Council directive on large combustion plants.  A feasibility study has been completed which confirms that the  Corinair methodology should be extendible to other environmental  media to build an integrated multi-media inventory of emissions.  <H5>  Preparation of the Report Europe's Environment Conference </H5>   At the European Environment Ministers' Conference at Dobris  Castle in the former Czechoslovakia (21-23 June 1991), the  Commission received a mandate to prepare the first report on the  state of the environment for the whole of Europe (including EC,  EFTA and Central and Eastern European countries). The report  will facilitate the development of an 'environmental programme  for Europe' in the lead-up to the next Ministerial Conference to  be held in Sofia in 1995. It will be equally useful as a tool to  inform the public and raise awareness about environmental  problems.    The report is being prepared by the EEA task force in  collaboration with the UNECE and other international bodies  (Council of Europe, IUCN, OECD, UNEP, WHO). The report is an  assessment of the state of the whole European environment and of  the pressures caused by human activities, and provides an  analysis of prominent environmental problems of concern for  Europe. Publication is scheduled for early 1994. The report will  be accompanied by a joint data compendium, being prepared with  Eurostat, OECD, UNECE and WHO. Other products are also envisaged  including, for example, an environmental atlas and a popular  version.    The preparation of the report has proved a unique  opportunity  to explore the possibilities for cooperation with non-EC  countries and other bodies--international organisations and  non-governmental organisations. The work has contributed to  building a framework for environmental monitoring and assessment  at a pan-European scale. Lessons learnt during the course of  this project will be useful for preparing the tasks of the EEA.  Particularly valuable has been the experience of collecting,  processing and interpreting data under conditions where much  relevant data is missing and with problems of accessibility and  comparability for the data which does exist. The constitution  and use of expert networks has been especially important for  helping to resolve these problems. Furthermore, the exercise has  contributed to bringing together the statistical activities of  Eurostat, OECD, UNECE and WHO. The need for regular reporting on  the environment at the pan-European level is confirmed by the  results of this work.

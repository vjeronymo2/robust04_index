			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Zhide (2612 3112 1795)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 21 Apr (XINHUA)--In the wake of last  year's frequent exchanges, the trend of development of  cross-strait academic and cultural exchanges was good in the  first quarter of this year. Both sides quickened the pace of  exchange, expanded the number of areas of cooperation, and  diversified the forms of exchange and cooperation.    So far, over 30 activities involving cross-strait academic  and cultural exchange have been reported by newspapers and, more  often than not, a variety of activities were conducted at the  same time. Early this year, the China Beijing Opera Theater was  invited to stage performances in Taiwan and a delegation of the  Taiwan Cross-Strait Business Development Foundation visited  Shanghai; the two events took place on both sides of the Taiwan  Strait at the same time. In mid-January, mainland, Taiwan, and  Hong Kong writers met in Taibei [Taipei] for a "symposium on  Chinese novels"; meanwhile, mainland aeronautics and  astronautics scholars arrived in Taiwan to attend a  "cross-strait aeronautics and astronautics symposium." After  that, a delegation of persons in charge of the central  authorities' news units, a delegation of mainland writers, and a  delegation of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY visited Taiwan at the same  time. Such a situation--"good plays are successively staged one  after another"--emerging from among cross-strait exchange  activities reflects the ardent desire of the peoples on both  sides of the Taiwan Strait for contact with each other and for  mutual understanding.    As a result, the spheres of cross-strait academic and  cultural exchanges have expanded. They involve scores of fields  of endeavor, including the film and TV industry, publication,  painting, sports, folk art, public health, environmental  protection, and other sectors. A number of "first" exchange  program activities appeared; a cross-strait aeronautics and  astronautics symposium, a cross- strait insurance symposium, a  cross-strait environmental protection symposium, a cross-strait  operation and management symposium, and a cross-strait symposium  on archives management and microphotography were held for the  first time. In mid-February, famous mainland and Taiwan actors  and actresses of Henan opera gave a performance on the same  stage for the first time and, at the end of March, a Taiwan  delegation of machine tool manufacturers arrived in the mainland  for an exhibition for the first time.    As the spheres of cross-strait exchanges expanded, the forms  of exchange gradually diversified. Mainland and Taiwan folk  artists gave performances on the same stage; the mainland and  Taiwan cooperated with each other in producing special albums  for vocalists and in selling them concurrently in both places;  the Taiwan Television Enterprise invited mainland actors and  actresses to cooperate in shooting films; mainland publications  were on display in Taiwan; and mainland and Taiwan Red Cross  societies jointly organized winter camping activities for  youngsters. Symposiums and exhibitions accounted for most of  the various forms of activities because both sides could learn  from each other by exchanging views, use each other's  experiences for reference, learn from the others' strong points  to offset one's weaknesses, and jointly make improvements  through these forms of exchange.    Two-way exchanges in a number of spheres between the  mainland  and Taiwan also enjoyed new developments. Despite the fact that  the mainland and Taiwan have conducted exchanges of news for  several years, the visit to Taiwan by a delegation of persons in  charge of the central authorities' press units signified a  breakthrough. It is a consensus among scientists and  technologists on the mainland and in Taiwan to strengthen  cross-strait scientific and technological exchanges and  cooperation. The visit to Taiwan made by Zhou Guangzhao,  president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Ouyang  Zhongmou, president of the China National Electronics Import and  Export Corporation, this year promoted cross-strait scientific  and technological exchanges and cooperation to a new level.    However, the Taiwan authorities are still setting up  obstacles to cross-strait exchange. Recently, the Taiwan  authorities attempted to use the "Qiandao Lake Incident" as an  excuse to suspend cross-strait cultural exchanges and to boycott  tourists' travel to the mainland and economic exchanges. This  entirely runs counter to the interests and desire of the peoples  on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. It is hoped that the Taiwan  authorities will lift unreasonable restrictions and promote more  rapid development of cross-strait academic and cultural  exchanges.</p>

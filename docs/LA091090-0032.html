			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: DICKERSON FUELS ALL SORTS OF NEWS IN BATTLE OF THE  OPENING DAY SHOWS  </P> <P> ESPN "SportsCenter" anchor Robin Roberts no doubt was overstating things when,  at 8:59 a.m. Sunday, she said, "And now the moment you've all been waiting for  -- the premier of 'NFL GameDay.' "  </P> <P> But on the day ESPN went head-to-head with NBC and CBS in the battle of NFL  pregame shows, ESPN came out the winner, and not just because it had Brent  Musburger.  </P> <P> ESPN's one-hour show is twice as long as the other two shows, and while not  really twice as good, it was the best on the opening day of the NFL season.  </P> <P> NBC, vastly improved, was a close second, and CBS, despite an impressive new  set and an all-new cast, was a disappointing third.  </P> <P> "GameDay" came on at 9 a.m., a half-hour later than in its five previous  seasons, with a dynamite opening -- the lurking ghost of Musburger saying,  "Now, you are looking live at 'GameDay's' war room!"  </P> <P> Host Chris Berman said: "I think Rod Serling has entered the building."  </P> <P> Berman, maybe realizing the Helsinki summit had knocked CNN's new 8:30 a.m. NFL  pregame show off the air, said: "Here, up until kickoff, it's football that  matters."  </P> <P> Nothing like getting your priorities in order.  </P> <P> Terry O'Neil, NBC Sports executive producer, said the other day that his  network's half-hour show would be faster-paced than ESPN's, but nobody can  accuse Berman of being slow. If anything, he talks too fast.  </P> <P> The thing is, "GameDay," with its one-hour format, is just more complete than  the half-hour 9:30 a.m. shows.  </P> <P> Joe Theismann's interview with Joe Montana on "GameDay" went in depth, as  Montana talked about his insecurities. He told Theismann that his fear of  losing his job makes him work so hard.  </P> <P> On CBS, Jim Gray had an interesting and revealing interview with Eric  Dickerson, but it was cut too short. The viewers were left wanting more.  </P> <P> Speaking of Dickerson, who is this Fred ("My Sources Tell Me") Edelstein on  ESPN? Apparently, he edits some sort of newsletter nobody has heard of.  </P> <P> Edelstein, who rarely attributes his reports to named sources, is the guy who  said the Raiders would be playing the Denver Broncos in Oakland Sunday. So that  tells you something about his credibility.  </P> <P> Anyway, Edelstein said Dickerson refused to take a second physical with  Indianapolis to force a trade to Atlanta, mentioning three Falcons the Colts  wanted -- John Settle, Shawn Collins and Chris Hinton. Fine, but how does he  know?  </P> <P> On CBS, Dickerson told Gray that he passed his first physical, and for the  Colts to say otherwise is a joke.  </P> <P> Dickerson also told Gray he has apologized to teammates for some of his  critical remarks and that, while he is no angel in this whole thing, he simply  becomes frustrated and angry about losing.  </P> <P> All three shows reported that Dickerson will meet with Commissioner Paul  Tagliabue on Sept. 17 to sort out the whole mess.  </P> <P> The main reason the NBC show, "NFL Live," is so improved is the addition of  Will McDonough, who spent the past four seasons at CBS. Also, NBC has given  McDonough a more expanded role than he had at CBS.  </P> <P> McDonough was able to address several important issues. He said four big-name  coaches -- Mike Ditka, Bill Parcells, Joe Gibbs and Buddy Ryan -- are probably  in their final seasons.  </P> <P> McDonough also dealt with the scrambling issue -- the one regarding TV signals,  not quarterbacks -- in a concise and clear manner. He said there will be no  scrambling this season, and when there is next season, games will be made  available to home satellite dish owners and sports bars for a fee.  </P> <P> McDonough was one several good things about NBC's show. O.J. Simpson's feature  on Ditka was excellent, and Simpson overall appeared more relaxed and  comfortable than a year ago. And Bob Costas was his usual masterful self.  </P> <P> He offered a concise and clear report on the Raider situation. He said a  decision on the team's move would be made Tuesday or, at the latest, Wednesday.  </P> <P> "If Al Davis is unable to reach an agreement with Oakland or Los Angeles, he  will simply play out his lease with the Coliseum, meaning the Raiders will be  the L.A. Raiders for two more years," Costas said.  </P> <P> Costas told viewers he had just talked with Davis on the phone.  </P> <P> Viewers are left wondering who ESPN's Edelstein talks to. He's the weak link in  an otherwise fine show.  </P> <P> As for CBS' "NFL Today," it was too predictable and too bland.  </P> <P> Pat O'Brien's report on the Minnesota Vikings' retreat was good, but Lesley  Visser's report on new rules to shorten games was unnecessary. They've been  well publicized.  </P> <P> The biggest improvement is Terry Bradshaw -- instead of Dick Butkus and Irv  Cross -- as the resident ex-jock. He's animated and funny, which can't be said  about new host Greg Gumbel.  </P> <P> Greg is no Bryant, at least not yet, although his general likability plays in  his favor.  </P> <P> CBS, it appears, misses Musburger. Where's Brent when you need him? Oh, that's  right, over at ESPN, saying such things as "I'm just here to serve."  </P> <P> Maybe he's not such a bad guy after all.  </P></p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Bulgaria closer to debt reduction pact: EU backing has cleared the way for more reform funds Bulgaria is moving closer to finalising a debt reduction agreement with western creditors following last week's decision by the European Union to grant the country Dollars 175m (Pounds 120m) in balance of payments support. This has given the government a chance to push ahead both with economic reform and settlement of its Dollars 9.3bn foreign debt. The EU loan agreement means that Bulgaria now has the financial backing needed to meet a June 30 deadline for rescheduling its debt to 300 London Club commercial banks. Other Group of 24 countries are expected to agree a further Dollars 150m in aid at a meeting in Brussels this week. This will enable the International Monetary Fund to go ahead with a much-delayed Dollars 400m loan package. An IMF standby agreement will, in turn, unlock Dollars 200m in linked World Bank and Japanese funding. The IMF and World Bank are also considering further loans of Dollars 225m if the debt rescheduling deal goes through. With central bank reserves down to around Dollars 600m, foreign financing is essential if Bulgaria is to make an initial payment of Dollars 850m on its debt to the London Club. This was promised in the framework agreement reached last November when the banks, chaired by Deutsche Bank, agreed to halve the Dollars 9.3bn debt racked up by Bulgaria's former communist regime in the 1980s. Final terms are to be agreed by June. As with Poland, which reached a London Club agreement earlier this month, settlement of the debt is vital if Bulgaria is to complete its transition to a market economy and take full advantage of the EU association agreement signed last year. Since March 1990, when Bulgaria unilaterally declared a debt moratorium, the country has been cut off from western commercial financing. Foreign investment totalled only Dollars 220m by the end of 1993, a fraction of that in other former Soviet bloc states. As a result the government in Sofia has been dependent on international institutions, such as the IMF, World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The onus is now on Sofia to follow through with its pledges to the IMF and World Bank to speed up reform and keep the debt negotiations on track. Parliament has already passed a tough budget which limits the 1994 deficit to 6.7 per cent of gross domestic product. However, to reach this deficit target the government needs to improve tax collection and successfully implement a new 18 per cent value added tax which is being introduced on April 1. A shortfall in tax revenues contributed to a budget deficit of 11 per cent of GDP last year. The government has also taken steps to refinance Dollars 2.4bn of bad loans to state enterprises made by banks before 1991. Earlier this month, it issued its first bonds to convert enterprise debt into government debt. The aim is to make companies easier to privatise and strengthen the banking system. But IMF and World Bank officials in Sofia say greater political will is needed to move ahead with reform and speed up the pace of privatisation and restructuring. The country is still without a bankruptcy law and only a few, mainly small companies, have been closed down. Officials fear that unless financial discipline in the enterprise sector is tightened, state companies will continue to run up debts to banks and to each other. Privatisation has been equally slow. Two years after the passing of a privatisation law which envisaged the sale of more than 3,000 companies, the agency responsible for selling medium-sized and large companies has completed less than 20 transactions and ministries have sold only 200 small businesses. A mass privatisation scheme, conceived 10 months ago to relaunch the process and widen the population's participation in privatisation, has not got past a second reading in parliament. Western advisers say there is still no consensus over technical details of the scheme within the government which is a weak, non-partisan coalition backed by the Bulgarian Socialist party, the former communist party and the small ethnic Turk party. The lack of consensus is in part due to conflicts over reform between conservatives and economic liberals in the government and in the BSP. It is also widely believed that powerful members of the former communist nomenklatura are blocking privatisation while they strip state companies of their valuable assets and position themselves to benefit personally from privatisation. The government's political weakness has been exacerbated by the poor health of Mr Lyuben Berov, the prime minister and architect of the mass privatisation scheme. Mr Berov, 68, underwent emergency heart surgery two weeks ago and is unlikely to return to work for several weeks, if at all. The fear is that his illness will cause a political crisis and trigger early elections which would further delay economic reform.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BULGARIA: MAJOR ECONOMIC INDICATORS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1989    1990    1991   1992         1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real economic growth (%)      -1.9   -9.1   -11.7   -7.7    **** -5.0 Industrial production * **   -1.1   -17.5   -27.8  -16.1    **** -9.0 Consumer prices *             6.4    26.3   334.0   85.0   (Aug) 71.0 Unemployment rate (%) ***     0.0     1.6    10.5   15.2   (Oct) 15.9  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * % change over previous year.   ** Excluding private sector.  *** At end of period. **** Estimate  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

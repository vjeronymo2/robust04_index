			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Swedish notes tap confidence in French franc EUROPEAN currencies dominated the international bond market yesterday, with Sweden and Finland, as expected, tapping the markets in French francs and D-Marks respectively. Investor confidence in the franc has been improved by its survival of the recent trial by speculators. Sweden issued a slightly larger than expected FFr6bn five-year Eurobond bearing a coupon of 8 1/2 per cent and priced at 99.61 to yield 46 basis points over comparable French government OAT. Traders described the pricing as generous but noted that Sweden needs to keep investor interest alive if it is to meet its heavy borrowing programme. Finland's DM1bn five-year issue, arranged by Dresdner Bank and Morgan Stanley, will be priced today to yield 62 to 66 basis points over German government bonds. In contrast to Sweden, Finland is coming under criticism for failing to price its deals sufficiently generously. Although the paper is supposed to be aimed at international institutional investors, local traders feel the maturity and pricing will make it just as attractive to smaller domestic buyers. The issue adds to a recent string of fixed-price offerings in the D-Mark sector as its international importance grows. British Gas launched its first deal since it was downgraded by the debt rating agencies in August, a Pounds 200m five-year issue. Lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston said that the speed with which the issue sold out and was freed to trade shows that UK and continental European investors still view British Gas as a top-quality credit and that sterling interest rates are expected to fall further. The launch spread of 44 basis points over the five-year gilt tightened to 40 basis points by the close of trading, reflecting strong demand for the paper. The African Development Bank returned to the Euroyen market for the first time since early 1987, with a Y40bn five-year issued priced at 42 basis points over the comparable Japanese government bond. Deputy treasurer Mrs N'Diaye said the triple-A rated bank wanted its name and credit to be better known to a wider investor base and to establish a benchmark for future borrowings in the sector. The issue brings its total borrowings so far this year to nearly Dollars 1bn. The Asian Development Bank announced its second so-called dragon bond, a Dollars 300m five-year issue, managed out of Hong Kong, aimed at building up Asian capital markets. With a launch spread of 44 basis points Nordic Investment Bank's Dollars 200m three-year bond was thought to be aggressively priced for an unusual name. A Dollars 150m five-year Eurobond for Empresas la Moderna, the Mexican cigarette distributor, emerged with a coupon of 10 1/4 per cent and was priced at 99.70 to yield a higher than expected 450 basis points over Treasuries. Moody's has placed Canada's triple-A rated foreign currency debt under review for possible downgrade, reflecting the political and economic uncertainty created by the rejection of the latest constitutional reform package earlier this week. Canada lost its triple-A rating from Standard &amp; Poor's two week's ago.</p>

			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS STILL NEED WORK, BUT DODGERS LOOK SHARP;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: FINLEY STARTS OUT STRONG, BUT L.A. COMES FROM BEHIND TO WIN FREEWAY  SERIES OPENER, 5-4.  </P> <P> In one of their final tuneups before the start of the season, the Angels looked  like they needed a tuneup, while the Dodgers handled the curves -- and  fastballs -- skillfully enough to prevail in the opener of the Freeway Series.  </P> <P> Hubie Brooks' RBI-single capped a three-run seventh inning against Mike  Smithson Friday night as the Dodgers won, 5-4, before a crowd of 47,555 at  Anaheim Stadium. The Dodgers are 6-4 in exhibition games, including four  victories in their last five games. The Angels have lost five in a row and are  6-8 this spring.  </P> <P> The Angels maintained a 31-29-1 lead in the series, which continues tonight and  Sunday at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Dodger starter Fernando Valenzuela pitched six creditable innings in his  longest outing of the spring. In throwing 104 pitches, he allowed four runs and  seven hits, walked three and struck out two. Angel starter Chuck Finley, who  had been scheduled to go six innings, lasted only five. He allowed two runs and  four hits and threw 71 pitches.  </P> <P> Angel first baseman Wally Joyner remained hot at the plate, going 3 for 5 and  driving in two runs.  </P> <P> Finley cruised through the first three innings, retiring every batter he faced.  Five of those outs were recorded on ground balls, an unusually high number for  Finley and a signal that his forkball was effective.  </P> <P> Four of the ground outs were hit to third baseman Donnie Hill, and the other  was hit to second baseman Johnny Ray. Finley also struck out two.  </P> <P> The Angels supported the left-hander with two runs in the third. Mark McLemore  drew a leadoff walk and went to second on Devon White's sinking liner to right,  which was played on a short hop by Hubie Brooks. After Ray flied out to left,  Joyner singled to center, scoring McLemore and moving White to third. White  scored on Chili Davis' sacrifice fly to center.  </P> <P> Finley got himself into a jam in the fourth, but resolutely got himself out  without damage. He retired the first batter, Juan Samuel, but then walked  Willie Randolph and Brooks. However, he got Eddie Murray to strike out swinging  and induced Mickey Hatcher to ground out to short.  </P> <P> Dante Bichette extended the Angels' lead to 3-0 in the fourth, when he lined  Valenzuela's 1-1 pitch into the left-field bullpen. It was the outfielder's  third home run of the spring.  </P> <P> The Dodgers got to Finley for two runs in the fifth. Kal Daniels led off with a  hopper to short that McLemore couldn't handle, which was ruled a hit. After  Jeff Hamilton flied out to right, Mike Scioscia singled to right, which sent  Daniels to third. Alfredo Griffin then hit a grounder that caromed off the  mound and was picked up by Finley, who trapped Daniels in a rundown between  third and home. McLemore eventually tagged Daniels, but Griffin was at first  with Scioscia advancing to third.  </P> <P> Samuel followed with a liner that bounced under Hill's glove, scoring Scioscia  and moving Griffin to second. Griffin scored on Willie Randolph's liner over  the third-base bag. Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann went to the mound to  confer with Finley, and Lachemann's advice must have been sound, because Finley  got Brooks to fly to right to end the inning.  </P> <P> The Angels re-established a two-run lead in the fifth. White led off with a  double to left and stole third. He scored on Joyner's single to left, Joyner's  third consecutive hit and his ninth in his last 13 at-bats. The rally might  have continued when Lance Parrish singled to right with two out, but Parrish  took too big a turn rounding first and was thrown out by Samuel.  </P> <P> Willie Fraser replaced Finley in the sixth and pitched a perfect inning. Not so  for Mike Smithson, who hit the first batter he faced -- Hamilton -- with his  first pitch. Hamilton advanced to third on Griffin's double and scored on  Samuel's roller up the middle. Randolph then bunted toward the right side, and  Ray slipped while fielding the ball, leaving himself unable to make a play.  Griffin scored to tie the game.  </P> <P> The Dodgers took a 5-4 lead when Brooks hit a fly ball to right that hung in  the air and landed just fair after appearing to be headed into foul territory.  That allowed Samuel to score and brought Greg Minton in from the bullpen.  Minton ended the rally by getting Murray to ground into a double play.  </P> <P> Freeway Series Notes  </P> <P> Angel pitcher Bob McClure was diagnosed as having an inflamed left elbow and  was told to rest for several days. McClure was examined bu Dr. Ron Glousman of  the Kerlan-Jobe Clinic and will be re-examined Monday by Dr. Lewis Yocum, if  necessary. McClure was forced to leave Thursday's exhibition game against the  San Diego Padres in Palm Springs after complaining of tightness and pain in the  elbow. He is being treated with anti-inflammatory medication.. . . Neither  McClure nor third baseman Jack Howell (sprained left ankle) has been placed on  the disabled list. "That's one of the blessings of the 27-man roster," Manager  Doug Rader said. "There's protection and built-in insurance."  </P> <P> The initial report on Howell, who injured his ankle Wednesday, was that he  would be out seven to 10 days. However, he is hoping to play in Monday's season  opener. "I don't want to start if there's a chance of injuring it worse," said  Howell, who has stopped using crutches.  </P></p>

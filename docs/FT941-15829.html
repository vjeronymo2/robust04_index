			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Rise in average earnings stays at 3% The underlying annual increase in average earnings remained at 3 per cent in the year to November for the third successive month. But most analysts believe pay awards have bottomed out and will start rising gradually in 1994. The rates of earnings increase between manufacturing and services continued to diverge in November, with manufacturing increases falling slightly to 4 per cent from 4.25 per cent in October, and the service-sector rise at 2.25 per cent. Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, said the divergence was explained by the effects of the government-imposed squeeze on public-sector pay, but also by the fact that most new jobs in the private sector are low-paid and part-time. The earnings figure, although more than twice the level of inflation, gives no indication of an imminent increase in pay pressure, and the actual increase in average earnings at 2.8 per cent was below the underlying rate. However Mr David Walton, senior UK economist at Goldman Sachs, said: 'We are approaching the trough in average earnings growth. It is typical, as unemployment starts to fall, to get some upward pressure on pay.' The latest pay settlement report from the Industrial Relations Services pay databank also predicts some upturn. The report said: 'As profit margins become more buoyant during the upturn and employees find their disposable income severely squeezed by higher taxes, significant pressure is likely to be exerted to keep pay rises ahead of inflation.' The IRS report found that the average settlement level in November was 2 per cent for the fourth consecutive month. A quarter of pay deals in the three months to November were worth less than 1.5 per cent. However, some of the most recent pay deals do indicate a slight upward shift. In the southern and south-eastern regions of the Road Haulage Association, a pay award of about 3 per cent has been agreed from January after a pay freeze the previous year. Sony Manufacturing has also increased pay by 3 per cent. The quite large discrepancy between the increase in average earnings at 3 per cent and the rise in average settlements at 2 per cent is explained partly by overtime and bonuses. But pay analysts say the biggest factor is the continuing decline in relatively low paid employment in manufacturing, which pushes up the average level of earnings in most companies.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate worries hit more bourses BOURSES which returned from the Whit Monday holiday were mainly lower yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. In southern Europe, open on Monday, Madrid reacted to the higher interest rates which had depressed Milan a day earlier. PARIS was upset by a weak bond market as well as lingering concerns over Maastricht. The financial sector featured Societe Generale, down FFr12.00 to FFr524.00 and Suez, FFr2.50 lower at FFr318.40. The CAC-40 closed down 19.35 at 1,962.23. However, there was plenty of corporate news to keep traders interested. An analysts' meeting with Schneider had a profound effect on its stock and that of its subsidiaries. The group gave negative comments on prospects and its shares tumbled FFr54.00 or some 7 per cent to FFr708.00. This followed through into Merlin, down FFr49.00 to FFr546.00 and Spie, off FFr26.00 at FFr329.00. Meanwhile, SPEP shed FFr33.00 to Fr330.00. Pechiney's investment certificates were suspended at FFr360.00 pending an announcement, after the close, that it was to sell its nuclear assets for some FFr2bn. Pechiney International was FFr2.30 weaker at FFr201.10. Elsewhere dealing in Casino was suspended prior to the announcement that the private group, Rallye, is selling its food business to Casino, thereby creating the country's second largest food retailer. Disappointing figures from Club Mediterranee and rumours of a rights issue sent the Club's shares down Fr20.00, or 3.8 per cent to FFr495.00. FRANKFURT saw its main price changes in secondary stocks, the DAX index falling by only 2.81 to 1,786.26 after a 0.67 decline to 713.60 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume fell from DM5.6bn to only DM3.8m. Among the second liners Continental, the tyremaker, traded in DM33m as the shares rose DM4 to DM276 with some dealers blaming Pirelli SpA, the Italian company which began its pursuit of Conti nearly two years ago. Pirelli, however, is not believed to have the resources to put its merger plans into practice. Definite merger terms were behind the rise in Hoesch, the steel company, which leapt another DM8.20 yesterday to a new 1992 high of DM290. But the terms, involving Krupp AG shares and a minimal amount of cash, are of limited value since the Krupp AG shares are not yet quoted. Mr Michael Geiger of County NatWest said yesterday that speculators may be trading on an independent auditors' report which has said that Hoesch alone would be worth DM5.3bn, or DM745 a share. However, this is based on arbitrary criteria, says Mr Geiger, who adds the the steel industry environment is still difficult and that the speculators could be on the wrong track. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency Index finished 0.2 lower at 130.4 in turnover of some Fl 439m. Fokker advanced 20 cents to Fl 34.20 following news that agreement had been reached with DASA whereby the Dutch manufacturer will be the lead company in production of short-haul regional aircraft. Philips was 50 cents stronger at Fl 38.60 in spite of announcing that it had placed 1.5m new shares while Heineken lost 50 cents to Fl 167.00 on news that rationalisation costs at its Spanish brewer El Aguila could reach Fl 100m. Grolsch was also lower, Fl 2.50 at Fl 213.50, following an analysts meeting. MILAN saw a late wave of support-buying and short-covering focused on Olivetti and Fiat, and a 1.04 fall to 480.04 in the Comit index at the close was replaced by a marginal gain in continuous trading. Olivetti rose L38 to L3,018 and Fiat, after a L66 fall to L5,164 on the official day, recovered to L5,200 on the kerb. A selective, and limited recovery in bank shares saw Credito Italiano up L20 at L1,670 and Mediobanca L120 higher at L13,220. MADRID's general index closed down 2.93 at 250.7 in high turnover of some Pta13bn. Stocks with US exposure were affected by the weakness of the dollar while some general profit-taking was noted. Telefonica slipped Pta25 to Pta1,095. STOCKHOLM extended its losing streak to five consecutive sessions, the Affarsvarlden General index closing 11.0 lower at 963.5. SE Banken C shares led the decline at SKr31, down from SKr35 last Friday, when it revealed a SKr600m first quarter operating loss, and down 24 per cent from SKr41 ten days ago. Ahead of its interim next Tuesday, Svenska Handelsbanken B fell SKr4 to SKr55. COPENHAGEN's all-share index fell 1.89 to 329.58 in very thin trade, writes Hilary Barnes, with turnover at only DKr131m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 9                           Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open      10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm    2 pm     3 pm     close 1176.16  1176.40  1176.19  1175.51  1175.32  1175.00  1174.98  1174.96               Day's High  1177.11    Day's Low  1173.85          Jun 8***     Jun 5     Jun 4       Jun 3     Jun 2          1177.48     1181.18   1184.92**  1186.81    1200.27  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90). *** Partial  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

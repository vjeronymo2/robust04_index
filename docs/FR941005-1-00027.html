The new port of entry would be designated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rockford, Illinois and would include Greater Rockford Airport,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is currently operated as a user-fee airport.

The new port would be designated as Rockford, Illinois and would include Greater Rockford Airport.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The criteria used by Customs in determining whether to establish a port of entry are found in T. D. 82&hyph;37 (47 FR 10137), as revised by T. D. 86&hyph;14 (51 FR 4559) and T. D. 87&hyph;65 (52 FR 16328). Under these criteria, a community requesting a port of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry designation must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Demonstrate that the benefits to be derived justify the Federal Government expense involved;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Be serviced by at least two major modes of transportation (rail, air, water or highway);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Have a minimum population of 300,000 within the immediate service area (approximately a 70 mile radius); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Make a commitment to make optimal use of electronic data transfer capabilities to permit integration with Customs Automated Commercial System (ACS), which provides a means for electronic processing of entries of imported merchandise. Further, the actual or potential Customs workload (minimum number of transactions per year) at the proposed port of entry must meet one of several alternative minimum requirements, one of which is the condition that no more than half of the required 2,500 consumption entries can be attributable to one private party. Lastly, facilities at the proposed port of entry must include cargo and passenger facilities, warehousing space for the secure storage of imported cargo pending final Customs inspection and release, and administrative office space, inspection areas, storage areas and other space necessary for regulatory Customs operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal set forth in this document originated as a request from the Rockford Airport Authority that Rockford,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Illinois be designated as a port of entry. With regard to the above criteria, the Rockford Airport Authority has stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal Government would benefit from the port of entry designation because Rockford, Illinois would thus be available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to share the workload presently handled at the port of entry at Chicago, Illinois.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to a memorandum from the Regional Commissioner, North Central Region, in addition to the airport, Rockford has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two other transportation modes, rail and highway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Rockford Chamber of Commerce, the 1990 census figures indicate that the population of the city of Rockford is 139,426 and that of the Rockford metropolitan area is stated to be 283,719. A 70 mile radius would include several Illinois and Wisconsin cities and several northwestern suburbs of Chicago. Counting the communities within a 70 mile radius would bring the area population to well over 300,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of formal Customs entries in fiscal year 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was 3539, with a representation that no more than 8.4% were attributable to one private party. Regarding electronic data transfer capability, the Greater Rockford Airport Authority is committed to making optimal use of electronic data transfer capability to permit integration with ACS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, according to the Regional Commissioner's office, since Greater Rockford Airport is currently a Customs user-fee airport, it already has a workload. It is likely that Rockford will continue to grow.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The District Director at Chicago has verified that Rockford's entries for the year 1992 exceeded 2,500 formal entries, and the Regional Commissioner for the North Central Region has advised that Rockford appears to meet the criteria for port of entry status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, Customs believes that there is sufficient justification for the establishment of the requested port of entry. Rockford, Illinois meets an appropriate combination of the workload criteria specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Description of Port Entry Limits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The geographical limits of the proposed Port of Rockford, Illinois, which would include the Greater Rockford Airport, would be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Criminal justice study opens in Crown Court THE ROYAL Commission on Criminal Justice, set up after the release of the Birmingham Six last year, is to carry out a study of criminal cases in the Crown Court, including the first official research into juries, Robert Rice writes. The study starts today with a one-week pilot scheme at three courts: Snaresbrook, east London; Kingston, Surrey; and Reading, Berkshire. It will involve detailed questioning of all the main participants, including the judge, the accused and the jury on a range of issues. The full study will cover 90 Crown Court centres in England and Wales over two weeks next month. The issues to be researched include how often the prosecution case relies on confessions or admissions made to the police that have not been tape-recorded and how often the right of silence is exercised.</p>

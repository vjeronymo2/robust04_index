			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Dollar bloc shows signs of return to favour after being oversold VARIETY was the theme of the day in the international bond market yesterday, with a series of issues in different currencies for credits at the extremes of the risk-reward spectrum. The dollar bloc, where traders argue the fundamentals are still strong for further cuts in interest rates, showed signs of coming back into favour after being oversold. General Electric Capital Corporation reopened the Canadian dollar sector, issuing a CDollars 200m 7 3/8 per cent bond with a maturity of just over five years and a spread of 52 basis points over comparable Canadian government bonds. The amount was increased from CDollars 150m, reflecting strong demand, said Morgan Stanley International, joint lead manager with Swiss Bank Corp. While the result of Canada's referendum on constitutional reform was not the one the market wanted, the removal of the surrounding uncertainty could help bring about a rally. Trinidad and Tobago's Dollars 100m five-year bond was priced to reflect the unusual risk, with a spread of 565 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. The coupon of 11 1/2 per cent and issue price of 99.00 translate into an effective annual yield of 11 3/4 per cent. Lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston acknowledges the issue needs much explanation. Pricing of the Pounds 100m 8 3/8 per cent five-year bond from Forte, the UK hotel group at 101.29 was described as realistic in the current climate. While the 111 basis points spread over comparable gilts looks generous, hotels are not an attractive sector in a recession and Forte's debt has recently been downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Forte's bonds are being compared unfavourably with Hanson paper trading at similar levels in the secondary market. Lead manager Goldman Sachs reported that demand came from banks looking to convert the bond into a synthetic floating rate instrument as part of an asset package as well as from traditional bond investors. Credit Lyonnais took the FFr1bn 7-year 8.8 per cent bond it led for BSN, the French food group, to the international market, selling it to funds in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Finland's DM1bn five-year 7 3/4 per cent bond fell back in line with the market after being priced at the tighter end of the expected range to yield 63 basis points over German government bonds. The recent volume of supply has taken some of the steam out of the D-Mark sector, say traders. The run of issues by multilateral banks continued with a SFr300m 10-year issue from Inter-American Development Bank, carrying a coupon of 6 1/4 per cent and priced at 101 3/4 . Den Danske Bank will make two bond issues on November 12 and 14, each of DKr500m, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The loans will be tier II capital and they will replace ordinary subordinated loans, which no longer meet the Basle definitions for supplementary capital. One will be a fixed rate loan maturing in January 1996 with a coupon of 1.25 percentage points over the equivalent Treasury bond. The second, maturing at the same time, will be a variable rate loan. Danske last went to the bond market in December last year, when it raised DKr1.2bn.</p>

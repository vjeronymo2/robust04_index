			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech delivered by Jiang Zemin at the National Conference </F> on the Work To Assist the Poor in Development on 3 March 94:  "Work To Assist the Poor in Development Should Be Carried Out  Unswervingly and Persistently for a Long Period"]    [Text] I have visited quite a few impoverished areas in  recent years. Generally speaking, as relatively close attention  has been paid to the work of assisting the poor and developing  the poverty-stricken areas, the work has been performed very  well. Thanks to the intensified leadership of party committees  and governments at all levels, the enthusiastic support of  various departments and people from all walks of life, and the  assiduous work of the vast numbers of cadres and masses, the  population of poor people living in rural areas across the  country who have not totally and steadily settled the problem of  having adequate food and clothing has been reduced to 80 million  at present. This is a tremendous, historic achievement.    In attaining this achievement, we have gained rich  experiences, the most important of which, in my opinion, is that  we have defined a new working principle under which the original  pattern of assisting the poor by providing relief has been  changed to giving assistance by way of development. Practice  has proved that as the new principle is oriented to market  demands and aimed at developing and utilizing local resources to  boost commodity production through the application of scientific  and technological advances, it will not only resolve the problem  of providing people with adequate food and clothing, but enable  people to get rid of poverty and become prosperous. In this  way, very good results have been achieved in the production and  development of the impoverished areas by integrating the  assistance and support of the state with the self-reliance and  hard work of the cadres and masses in light of actual local  conditions. Just as many comrades have said: "The practice of  assisting the poor by way of development has made people  diligent, and the more diligent they are, the richer they  become." I have been to Yanan Prefecture in Northern Shaanxi.  People there built terraced fields to grow grain and resolved  the problem of having enough food to eat. They also developed  four major backbone industries -- tobacco, fruit, sheep, and  potatoes, and resolved the problem of having money to spend.  The apples produced there are very nice and have reached the  export level. The principle of assisting the poor by way of  development is a fundamental change as well as a momentous  creation in this work, so it must be upheld for a long time to  come.    The tasks faced by the work to assist the poor are still  very  arduous because 80 million people is not a small figure.  Moreover, the areas which have extricated themselves from  poverty over the past few years are those which have relatively  less difficulty, and the remaining areas are some hard nuts to  crack, as you have put it. In order to resolve the problem of  having adequate food and clothing for these 80 million people in  the next seven years, the State Council has formulated a "State  Plan for Storming the Fortified Positions During the Eighth  Five-Year Plan." This is a good and encouraging plan, but the  key to its success lies in whether or not we have the spirit of  assaulting fortifications. When we resolve the problem of  having adequate food and clothing for the 80 million people by  the end of this century, the right to subsistence -- the biggest  and most fundamental issue of human rights -- of the Chinese  people, who account for one-fourth of the world population, will  be resolved once and for all from then on. This is not only a  great event in the history of the Chinese nation, but a  magnificent feat in the history of human development.    Taken as a whole, the work to assist the poor has reaped  remarkable results, but we are still facing very arduous tasks.  Therefore, we must continue with the work conscientiously,  unswervingly, and perseveringly for a long period of time.  <H5>  1. We Must Further Our Understanding of the Arduousness and </H5> Importance of the Work To Assist the Poor by Way of Development  in Order To Continue It for a Long Time    The arduousness of the work to assist the poor by way of  development can be understood from the following two aspects:  1) It is very difficult to fulfill the tasks set in the plan of  storming the fortified positions during the Eighth Five-Year  Plan, so great efforts are necessary; and 2) even if we fulfill  the tasks set in the above-mentioned plan, we will only resolve  the problem of absolute poverty, so we must continue to resolve  the problem of relative poverty. As our burden is heavy and the  road is long, we have to work hard for a long time. Today,  although the average income in some developed countries is very  high, some people still receive low pay and their problem of  being relatively poor has not been resolved. Ours is a  socialist country, and our goal is to achieve common prosperity  for the entire people. Hence, our work to assist the poor is  not an expedient measure but must be continued in for a long  time.    Eliminating poverty and achieving common prosperity are the  intrinsic requirements of socialism, which also reflects the  superiority of the socialist system. Our party has been leading  the people to make revolution and build socialism for the  purpose of liberating and developing the productive forces and  enabling people to become prosperous. Since reform and opening  up, we have allowed and encouraged some people and localities to  get rich first in the hope that they will contribute to helping  other people and localities become rich too. In this way, we  can more effectively reach the goal of achieving common  prosperity. In developing the socialist market economic  structure, we should pursue the goal of allocating resources  efficiently, and at the same time give consideration to the  principle of fairness. We should adopt feasible policies to  foster development in the impoverished areas.    Eliminating poverty and achieving common prosperity are the  requirements of reform and development as well as the essential  conditions for maintaining stability. Development in various  localities is uneven. It is quicker in some localities and  relatively slower in others. This is inevitable. In this  process, however, constant attention should be paid to the  economic development in the impoverished areas. If these areas  are always in a state of poverty, they will affect not only the  realization of the objectives of our socialist modernization,  but also the stability of the entire country. If people in some  places are very rich and in other places are very poor for a  long time, there will be latent unstable factors. At present, a  considerable number of impoverished areas in China are mainly in  the border regions and the regions where minority nationalities  live in compact communities. Helping these areas rid themselves  of poverty as quickly as possible and achieve common development  is an economic issue as well as a major political issue that has  a bearing on national unity, unification of the motherland, and  consolidation of frontier defense. Moreover, some old liberated  areas are still poverty-stricken. The people in the old  liberated areas made tremendous contributions to the Chinese  revolution in the war years, so it is our bounden duty to do a  good job of assisting the poor in these areas in order to  gradually improve the people's lives there. In short, the  development of the old liberated areas, ethnic minority areas,  border areas, impoverished areas, and western areas is an  important issue that has an impact on the maintenance of a  lasting good order in the country.  <H5>  2. To Continue the Work for a Long Time, the Key Lies in </H5> the Intensification of Party and Government Leadership at All  Levels    The work to assist the poor is not purely economic work, but  work engaged in by the masses with distinct political content  covering the building of material and spiritual civilizations.  Party committees and governments at all levels should, as  always, make further efforts to intensify leadership in this  work.    The principal leaders of party committees and governments at  all levels must concern themselves with the work to assist the  poor, take up the matter personally, and regard it as a major  activity to show concern for the sufferings of the masses and  cement close ties with them. Meanwhile, they must rely on the  masses, consider everything in their interests, and work  sincerely for their well-being. This is the fundamental aim of  our party. In the areas where the economy has developed  relatively slowly and the masses' lives have been relatively  difficult, it is all the more necessary for party committees and  governments at all levels to show special concern for them.  Whether or not a party committee or government in a region has  been divorced from the masses, and stability and unity have been  maintained there, will primarily be judged by whether or not it  has properly performed the work for the masses whose lives and  production are comparatively difficult. The principal leaders  of party committees and governments at all levels must take  account of the overall situation, focus their work on the weak  links, and go often to the impoverished areas and ethnic  minority regions to have heart-to-heart talks with the masses,  conduct investigation and study, and personally help the cadres  and masses resolve practical problems. Recently, the idea has  occurred to me that, since people in large and medium-sized  cities and economically developed regions have comparatively  ampler clothes and quilts, while those in impoverished areas are  short of clothing and covering to ward off the cold, can we not  mobilize government functionaries and urban residents, in the  spirit of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance, to donate  their surplus clothes and quilts to the masses in the  impoverished areas before the arrival of the coming winter?    We should persist in selecting and sending cadres to work in  the impoverished areas by stages and in groups. Our experience  in practice has fully proved that this is an indispensable  organizational measure to strengthen leadership in the work to  assist the poor by way of development, because the more  impoverished an area is, the greater its necessity for obtaining  assistance and guidance from its higher authority. Therefore,  we should transfer a number of cadres from provincial,  prefectural, and county organs to stay in poverty-hit townships  and villages and conduct propaganda on party policies in a bid  to help them set up powerful leading bodies, discover a correct  path for shaking off poverty to become prosperous, import talent  and technology, and enlist the masses in their production and  development. If competent cadres cannot be found in some poor  villages for the moment, we may try to transfer some cadres from  the county organs to work there. The practice of constantly  sending cadres to stay and work in poor villages is also of  great benefit to tempering cadres, training talented personnel,  and changing the work style in the leading bodies of party  organizations and governments. We should take the achievements  in changing the backward appearance of poverty-hit townships and  villages as a major aspect in the appraisal and promotion of  leading cadres at township and county levels.    Party committees and governments at all levels should be  adept in mobilizing and enlisting forces from various quarters  to initiate a new situation of assisting the poor and succoring  the distressed in the entire society, which is also an important  substance of intensifying leadership in the work. The Chinese  nation always has a traditional virtue of assisting the poor and  succoring the distressed. Today, in establishing a socialist  market economy, it is particularly necessary to develop this  traditional virtue. All units, including government organs, the  People's Liberation Army, democratic parties, mass  organizations, enterprises, and institutions, where conditions  exist, should exert themselves to the utmost to give positive  support to and participate in the work to assist the poor as  they have done before. A certain financial input is necessary  for the work, so financial, banking, and other departments  should extend their support by providing funds and preferential  treatment for this endeavor. We should also encourage the more  economically developed areas to give assistance to the backward  areas and, through mutually beneficial and reciprocal support,  achieve common development and prosperity. I hope that the  three municipalities, comprising Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai,  as well as various coastal provinces will put in a bit more  effort in this. The central authorities are of the opinion that  the relatively developed coastal provinces and cities should  assist the impoverished areas in their localities with their own  money, while funds for this purpose in the hands of the central  authorities should chiefly be used in helping the central and  western regions, which are in greater financial difficulty. In  the meantime, we call on you to help support the impoverished  areas in the central and western regions through such forms as  economic cooperation, technological transfers, cadre exchange,  and so on. Local party committees at all levels should  positively launch activities in their own localities, through  which rich counties offer help to poor counties, rich townships  help poor townships, rich villages help poor villages, and rich  households help poor households, so that they are formed into  pairs for mutual assistance.    3. It Is Necessary for the Cadres and Masses in the  Impoverished Areas To Fully Develop the Spirit of Self-Reliance  and Hard Struggle for Pioneering a Cause In Order To Persist in  the Work for a Long Time    It is absolutely necessary for the state to give certain  assistance to the impoverished areas and for the people from all  walks of life in society to conduct activities of assisting the  poor and succoring the distressed. However, settling the  problem of having adequate food and clothing in impoverished  areas and proceeding to shake off poverty and become prosperous  should, after all, depend on their own efforts. This calls for  the vast numbers of cadres and masses in the impoverished areas  to develop the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle to  combat nature and boost economy. With this spirit of working  hard to pioneer a cause, it will be easier to surmount any  difficulty. This is a fine tradition of our party as well as  the basic experience of our endeavor to shake off poverty and  become prosperous. I went to inspect work in Shanxi Province  during the Spring Festival last year. In Qiaoli Village, Linfen  City, the people there have changed the appearance of a poor  village precisely on the strength of pioneering a cause with  hard work. Although the villagers have become wealthy now, the  party branch still stands together with the masses through storm  and stress, and shares weal and woe with them. I hope that all  the people in impoverished areas will emulate and develop this  spirit.    To persist in self-reliance and hard struggle, we must bring  forth new ideas of assisting the poor through development. We  must extricate ourselves from the shackles of traditional  concepts and force of habit so that we will carry out reform,  open to the outside world, and invigorate the economy in a  practical manner, for which the crux lies in emancipating the  mind and discovering a correct path. Quite a few impoverished  areas are at a disadvantage because they failed to emancipate  their minds, so that their path of economic development was too  narrow. On the one hand, the barren hills and slopes were left  uncultivated and the deserted shoals and water resources lay  waste and, on the other, large numbers of the labor force  remained idle. We must regard the labor force as our wealth  rather than our burden. In many localities, the labor force was  enlisted to reclaim land, build fields, construct bridges and  roads, develop small irrigation works, and plant trees all the  year round, so that remarkable results have been scored.  Likewise, satisfactory results have also been reaped over the  past few years in carrying out the policy of providing relief  with grain and manufactured goods in exchange for the work of  creating land and building roads, which has proved to be  successful and should continue persistently. As farmland is  limited but barren hills are numerous in the impoverished areas,  forestry, animal husbandry, fruit, and cash crops should be  developed in line with local conditions. "With animal husbandry  developed here and forestry boosted there, the labor force was  well utilized and economic results were instantly produced."  This is also experience gained in the impoverished areas. The  export of labor is, in essence, personnel training and  intellectual development, because laborers will broaden their  horizons and increase their knowledge after a few years of work  in other places, and they will become talented people when they  return. The current issue regarding the export of labor is: In  face of the increasingly larger scale of "waves of migrant  workers," we must intensify leadership and management of them to  reduce the spontaneous blind flow as quickly as possible, while  vigorously encouraging the export of labor in an organized and  planned fashion. Party committees and governments at all  levels, particularly those in the impoverished areas, should pay  serious attention to this and sum up experience conscientiously.  Otherwise, it will adversely affect the export of labor and  bring about serious social consequences as well.    The key to persisting in self-reliance and hard struggle  rests with the proper training of qualified personnel. To  transform the pioneering spirit into a material force, we must  ultimately depend on the intelligence and wisdom of the  laborers. Therefore, we must place the work of assisting the  poor through the development of science, education, and  intellect in a primary position. The Eighth Five-Year Plan  stresses the need to make elementary education universal,  positively eliminate illiteracy, conduct vocational and  technical education among young and middle-aged people, prevent  and cure endemic diseases, and take firm control of family  planning work. All this is very good, so I am all for it. In  impoverished areas, we should stabilize the existing qualified  personnel on the one hand, and bring up new talents on the  other. Practice in many places shows that by using an excellent  talent, a number of people will be motivated, and this locality  will prosper. We should extend assistance to the rural party  organizations politically, show concern for them, and unite and  encourage them to lead the masses in changing the appearance of  their hometowns and shaking off poverty to become rich.    Whether or not the spirit of self-reliance, hard struggle,  and pioneering a cause will be brought into full play depends,  to a considerable extent, on whether or not the leading bodies  in the impoverished areas are really up to the mark and the  grass-roots organizations are staunch. There are two focal  points here: 1) We should enhance the work in impoverished  counties and, in light of the requirement for assisting the poor  by way of development, select and assign competent leading  cadres at county level. In particular, we should select fine  cadres who are capable in work, able to bear hardships and stand  hard work, and have close ties with the masses to take up the  posts of county party committee secretaries and county chiefs,  and to remain in these positions for relatively long periods.  2) We should reinforce the building of party branches in  impoverished villages. "We give money and things to them all  for the purpose of building up good party branches," which is  another good experience we have gained in the work to assist the  poor. In order to build good leading bodies in party branches,  we must select fine party members who are active, capable,  honest, fair, and able to cement close ties with the masses to  take up the leading posts.    In short, with the necessary support from the state and the  help from various sectors in society, so long as our leading  cadres at all levels always have the impoverished areas in mind,  share joys and sorrows with the masses, stick to Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, base themselves in  reality, persist in the struggle, and stress actual results in  their endeavor to assist the poor by way of development, the  backward appearance of the impoverished areas will certainly be  changed before the turn of this century.</p>

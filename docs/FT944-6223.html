			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Red Book Details): Health and growth return to economy The economy is now recovering strongly, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level since the 1960s. The Budget is designed to ensure that the improvements in the public finances announced in 1993 are delivered, and to introduce further structural reforms to make the economy work better. This will help to ensure sustainable growth in the medium term, supported by permanently low inflation. The public finances: The tax and spending measures in the two 1993 Budgets were intended to ensure that the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) returns towards balance in the medium term, and the projections published last November showed it close to balance by 1998-99. The deficit on the government's current account was projected to disappear by 1997-98. But the economy has grown faster than envisaged a year ago, with GDP now expected to be up 4 per cent in 1994. And inflation has turned out lower, taking it well into the lower half of the Government's target range. Faster growth will tend to bring the PSBR down more rapidly. But lower prices reduce revenues, which tends to raise public borrowing. So the government has made substantial cash reductions in its spending plans, which are also slightly lower in real terms than a year ago. This should enable the PSBR to return to balance by the end of the decade, as intended in last year's Budget, with the public sector current account deficit eliminated by 1997-98. Most of the reductions in general government expenditure are accounted for by reductions in the Control Total, though cyclical social security is also lower because of lower unemployment, lower prices and the measures in the Budget. Privatisation proceeds are also increased from 1995-96 to 1997-98. The changes in receipts are mainly accounted for by changes in the path of the economy; the medium-term effect of the Budget measures is comparatively small, though transitional relief for business rates reduces revenue in the short term. The Budget is intended to be broadly neutral in its effects on the public finances, given the changed paths of output and inflation since last November. Higher output is reflected in a lower PSBR than in the November 1993 Budget, particularly in the next three years. Employment boost To help people back to work, family credit will be increased for those in full time work; payments of housing benefit and family credit will be accelerated for people taking jobs; and, in a pilot study, family credit will be paid to people without children. To help the unemployed back into work, Community Action will be extended; there will be more Work Trial opportunities; three existing pilot schemes, Jobfinder's Grant, Workwise, and 1-2-1, will become available nationally; and two other pilot schemes, Workstart and Jobmatch, will be further developed. To make it cheaper to take on new staff, employer national insurance contributions will be cut by 0.6 per cent for employees earning less than Pounds 205 a week; and they will no longer have to be paid for the first year of employment when taking on someone who has been unemployed for two years. To reform training, the Training for Work programme will be refocused to increase the number of trainees who get jobs. Around Pounds 325m will also be spent over the next three years on the training measures announced in the Competitiveness White Paper. To improve the working of the housing market, housing benefit will be reformed so that, whether or not rents are met through housing benefit, landlords and tenants take price as well as size and quality into account in agreeing tenancies. Scaling back income support for mortgage interest from October 1995 will transfer more of the cost of mortgage default to lenders and borrowers where it properly belongs, and also reduce the work disincentives which current arrangements create. To help exporters, ECGD average medium- and long-term premiums will be reduced by around 10 per cent. The limit on cover for important developing country markets is rolled forward and increased by Pounds 300m in 1997-98. To promote investment, the private finance initiative is gathering speed. Contracts involving around Pounds 5bn of capital investment are expected to be let in 1995. To encourage more investment in small businesses, there are a number of proposals flowing from the Industrial Finance Initiative. A new Venture Capital Trust scheme will be introduced. This scheme will provide income tax relief at 20 per cent, and CGT reinvestment relief, on investments up to Pounds 100,000 a year in the shares of trusts which invest mainly in unquoted trading companies. Income and gains on these shares will be tax free. Improvements will be made to the Enterprise Investment Scheme introduced earlier this year. To cut the regulatory burden on small firms, the threshold for quarterly payments of PAYE and NICs will be raised to Pounds 600 a month. The VAT registration threshold will be indexed. There will be consultation on annual VAT accounting and a simplified VAT scheme for small traders. To encourage personal saving, holders of Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts will be able to deposit up to Pounds 9,000 capital from a mature account in a new account. Personal Equity Plans will be extended to cover corporate bonds and preference shares. Moves to curb public spending The Control Total is reduced by Pounds 6.9bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 8.3bn and Pounds 8.9bn the following two years. This is achieved by: Savings on most programmes to reflect the lower level of prices; A concerted drive to improve efficiency and reduce waste in Government: cash running costs of civil departments are planned to be the same in 1997-98 as in 1993-94; provision for the rest of the public sector assumes pay increases will be offset by efficiency gains and other economies; Measures to restrain the growth of social security including a reform of housing benefit. A drive against fraud and reform of income support for mortgage interest will also restrain social security spending which falls outside the Control Total; Reductions in the housing and roads programmes. At the same time, priority has been given to health, where spending will grow in real terms each year. The government's achievements on education and law and order are protected; and there are extra funds for science and overseas aid. Additional resources are provided for home insulation and cold weather payments on top of last year's Pounds 1.25bn package of extra help to pensioners and those on income related benefits to meet the cost of VAT on domestic fuel and power. Tax changes The tax measures in the Budget are designed to: Increase the main personal allowance and income tax thresholds in line with prices. The annual exempt amount for CGT and the threshold for inheritance tax are also indexed. The lower rate tax band is increased by Pounds 200 to Pounds 3,200; Help pensioners by increasing personal allowances for those aged 65 and over by Pounds 430; Support environmental and health objectives by raising road fuel duties by 5 per cent in real terms and tobacco duties by 3 per cent in real terms, in line with the commitments given in last November's Budget. Duty on diesel is aligned with unleaded petrol. Vehicle excise duty for cars rises by Pounds 5. A tax on landfilled waste will be introduced in 1996 after consultation, with costs on business offset by lower employer national insurance contributions; Ease the transition for those businesses facing higher rates bills in 1995-96 and beyond following the revaluation of properties. Increases in real terms will be limited to 10 per cent a year for large premises and 7 1/2 per cent for smaller premises. Support will be funded partly by the Exchequer and partly by limiting real gains for those with lower valuations to 5 per cent a year for large premises and 10 per cent for smaller premises; Stop a number of artificial schemes to avoid tax.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE PUBLIC FINANCES IN 1994-95 AND 1995-96*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Pounds billion                                              1994-95      1995-96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RECEIPTS Income tax                                      64.2         70.1 Corporation tax                                 20.1         26.4 Value added tax                                 43.3         49.0 Excise duties**                                 26.3         28.0 Other taxes***                                  39.7         43.0 Social security receipts                        42.5         44.5 Other receipts                                  16.3         17.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General government receipts                    252.5        278.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EXPENDITURE Control Total                                  249.6        255.7 Cyclical social security                        14.1         14.1 Central government debt interest                22.1         24.5 Accounting adjustments                           9.5         10.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General government expenditure excluding   privatisation proceeds                       295.2        305.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Privatisation proceeds                          -6.3         -3.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General government expenditure                 288.9        302.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Expenditure, receipts and borrowing General government expenditure                 288.9        302.0 General government receipts                    252.5        278.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- General government borrowing requirement        36.5         23.1 Public corporations' market and   overseas borrowing                            -2.0         -1.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Public sector borrowing requirement             34.4         21.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   * On a cash basis.  ** Fuel, alcohol and tobacco duties. *** Includes council tax as well as other central government taxes.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE BUDGET TAX AND NATIONAL INSURANCE MEASURES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Pds million yield (+)/cost (-) of measure                  -------------------------------------------------------                    Changes from Changes from                   a non-indexed   an indexed                            base         base                  -------------------------------------------------------                         1995-96      1995-96      1996-97      1997-98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Income tax  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- main personal allowance   and thresholds indexed   -555            0            0            0 personal allowances for   65s and over up by   Pounds 430               -200         -150         -210         -210 lower rate band increased   by Pounds 200            -170          -80         -100          -10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Savings  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TESSAs -

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava June 28 (CTK) -- During a heated debate  in parliament today, Jozef Prokes, a deputy for the opposition  Slovak National Party (SNS) and former deputy premier, proposed  to dismiss his former party colleague and current rival Ludovit  Cernak (now National Democratic Party, NDS) from his post.    Although the government coalition deputies refused to  include  the issue in the agenda of the current session, it is compulsory  to convene extraordinary session if a motion is supported by  more than 30 deputies.    The opposition has already put the motion of no-confidence  to  Privatisation Minister Milan Janicina (NDS) on the agenda of the  session.    The Slovak Parliament dismissed today Ivan Luptak (HZDS,  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) from the Slovak delegation  to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.    At the past parliamentary session Luptak expressed his  discontent with the work of Cernak, parliament deputy chairman,  by using the Nazi salute.    Luptak had been reprimanded for his behaviour by his own  HZDS  Deputies' Club as well as the parliamentary Mandate Committee.  He had apologised to the parliament and assured it that he was  an opponent of totalitarian rule. He said, however, that he  preferred to be dismissed than appointed by the present  government.    The importance of his dismissal is rather symbolical because  Slovak deputies will not go to Strasbourg before the  parliamentary elections scheduled for September 30-October 1,  Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic said.</p>

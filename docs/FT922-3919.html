			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / BAA year-end profits tumble 22% SLUGGISH air travel growth coupled with large property provisions and restructuring costs sent pre-tax profits at BAA, the UK airport operator, tumbling by 22 per cent to Pounds 192m for the financial year ending March. But the performance was generally well received by the City: BAA shares yesterday closed 14p up at 679p in a weak market. The pre-tax profits and an 11.5 per cent dividend rise were at the top end of City expectations. The company announced a final dividend of 8.75p making a total for the year of 14.5p compared with 13p last year. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, said the dividend increase reflected the company's growth expectations in the next two years. Excluding property and restructuring provisions, pre-tax profits were slightly lower at Pounds 283m compared with Pounds 284m the year before. Earnings per share were 19 per cent lower at 30.6p but excluding provisions they were up 5 per cent at 46.3p. The company made Pounds 55m provisions to cover the downturn in the property market and a further Pounds 36m for voluntary staff redundancies which led to the reduction of 2,000 jobs during the financial year. The company's Lynton property subsidiary made a net loss of Pounds 53.5m and its hotel activities also made a net loss of Pounds 22.9m. BAA's core airport operations performed better than expected in a difficult market hit by recession and the impact of the Gulf conflict on air travel last year. Sir John said traffic was showing signs of recovery. BAA expected annual growth of between 5 per cent and 8 per cent this year over last year's depressed levels settling down to around 4 per cent in the longer term. Total revenues rose 9 per cent to Pounds 909m. The number of passengers using BAA airports was unchanged at 72m. Heathrow, the company's flagship, saw a 2 per cent traffic increase with 42m passengers, reflecting liberalisation of London's air traffic rules. In contrast, the liberalisation depressed activity at Gatwick, which suffered a 7.6 per cent fall in passengers to 18.9m. Stansted, opened last year and BAA's only unprofitable airport, saw a 70 per cent traffic increase to 1.9m passengers. Sir John confirmed plans to hold down the cost of building a fifth terminal at Heathrow to less than Pounds 900m instead of earlier estimates of around Pounds 1.6bn.

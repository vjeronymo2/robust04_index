			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Spate of TV mergers attacked The Independent Television Commission's chief executive last night attacked the recent spate of takeovers in ITV and suggested that they were driven more by ambition than commercial considerations. Mr David Glencross said in a hard-hitting speech to the Royal Television Society that the advantages of size were not as clear-cut as often claimed. He was speaking as MAI's bid for Anglia Television went unconditional and after Carlton Communications's takeover of Central and Granada's successful hostile bid for London Weekend Television. Some time and expense would be saved by simplifying decision-taking in ITV but, he said, takeovers were driven by three factors. 'In order of priority they are ambition, ambition and ambition.' He added that already nearly Pounds 50m had been spent in servicing the deals. Even the newly enlarged ITV companies were small by international standards and it was a misconception to think size by itself would create a thriving programme export business. Mr Glencross said: 'There is nothing to stop a consortium of the ITV companies, and the BBC too, if it wishes, getting together to produce for the export market without any change in the ownership rules.' The government decision to allow larger ITV companies to be taken over by each other had 'added to, rather than resolved the uncertainty about the future of ITV'. Smaller companies could be left dangerously exposed. Mr Glencross criticised the 1990 Broadcasting Act for making the ITV companies the most taxed television companies in the world. Last year Pounds 360m, a quarter of ITV's advertising and sponsorship revenue, went to the Treasury, almost as much as the total revenue of Channel 4. He added: 'So in effect the cost of an entire national television channel is being handed to the Treasury in addition to the normal corporation tax paid by the Channel 3 companies.' The ITC chief executive also said that: Newspaper stakes in ITV should be able to rise from 20 per cent to 30 per cent but that limit should be applied by stages to satellite groups such as British Sky Broadcasting, half-owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. A new Channel 5 could start within two years without inhibiting the launch of digital services.</p>

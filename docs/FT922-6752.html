			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: French rural workforce holds the key FRANCE, by far the largest farm power in the European Community, holds the key to the reform of the CAP. The process will not be easy for its diminishing, but vocal, farm population. As elsewhere in Europe, the economic importance of agriculture has weakened in France over the past decade, yet the country remains the EC's largest producer of maize (about half the total), wheat, beef and fine wine. It grows twice as much cereal as it eats and has more farmland than Spain. The political influence of traditionally right-wing farmers' unions has also declined. Yet the farmers' organisations, led by the Federation Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants Agricoles (FNSEA), still have the capacity to wreak mayhem. Only last autumn, 150,000 farmers descended on Paris to protest against CAP reforms, in response to which the government promptly dished out FFr1.27bn (Pounds 120m) in emergency support. However, Mr Louis Mermaz, agriculture minister, and French farming unions have always seen eye to eye on one point: that incomes must be at least mainly linked to prices, rather than derive from social handouts. In reality, social subsidies are gaining fast. Some kinds of farming, notably beef and sheep, have already become so poor that various EC subsidies represent more than half of farmers' income. In that respect, the deal taking shape in Brussels can be presented to French farmers as a reasonable compromise. France, formerly one of the staunchest defenders of EC agriculture policy, signalled its willingness to compromise on reform last October, just a week after Germany, another former CAP conservative, gave its support for the European Commission's plans. This turning point in French agriculture policy reflected a growing realisation by farming leaders that some kind of social help was needed to enable an ageing farming population with few successors to retire peacefully. Every year, 30,000 farms close and only 10,000 new farmers start business, according to the FNSEA. The decline of France's rural workforce is sadly evident to any visitor to near-deserted villages in the rural centre and south. Over the past 20 years, farmers have fallen from just over 13 per cent of France's total workforce to 6 per cent. This did nothing to help the surplus, since productivity rose by an average of 1 per cent per year over the same period, and volumes of some cereal crops even rose. The surplus was shipped partly to EC neighbours, and also to the third world and the Soviet Union. As more farmers have gone out of business, more farms have merged, so that the average size of a holding rose from 19 hectares in 1970 to 28 hectares by 1988, making France the EC's fourth most intensive farming country. On the surface, this makes it a prime candidate for the EC proposals that all but the smallest farmers should take 15 per cent of their land out of production. However, the biggest farms are concentrated on the fertile basin plains north of the river Loire. The deal appears to offer less help for the smaller farmers, producing wine, fruit and vegetables, in the poorer rural depths of southern France.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Sterling fails to shed intrinsic weakness STERLING'S fall yesterday to a historic low against its trade-weighted index has again raised concerns about the currency's weakness on the foreign exchanges. The pound hit a low during the day of 76.2 against the index, which measures sterling against a basket of other currencies and which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has said he monitors closely. It closed at 76.6, compared with 77.2 on Monday night. The fall means in effect that the pound is worth 76.6 per cent of its value in 1985. The currency's return near to the historic low of DM2.3480 was a further sign of weakness. Mr Mark Brett, a currency economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said he was particularly concerned by the way the pound had fallen sharply in just two days. 'The pound has an incredibly small resilience,' he said. There are several reasons for this intrinsic weakness. First, UK interest rates are lower than those in most European countries. Three-month sterling interest rates were yesterday at about 6.25 per cent. By contrast, three-month French francs were at 11.75 per cent and D-Marks at 8.32 per cent. Investors are also concerned that growing inflation in the UK will erode the value of sterling assets. Yesterday's producer-price figures, showing a sharp rise in the cost of imports due to sterling's devaluation, indicated how quickly inflation is feeding into the economy now that the pound is nearly 16 per cent below its value on Black Wednesday - September 16 - last year. Second, dealers remain uncertain about the direction of the government's economic policy. The most pessimistic view in the market is that the government has no clear plan for economic management, and that recent cuts in interest rates were the product of panic rather than policy. The most charitable view is that the government is going for economic growth, and will bring interest rates down further. Mr Brett says: 'The government has three issues to worry about now: growth, the fiscal deficit and inflation - and it is worrying about them in that order.' That view may explain why dealers were unwilling to set much store by the government's claim that it would rein in public spending to help reduce a growing public-sector borrowing requirement. Mr Mark Austin, Treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said: 'The view is that it is very easy to make plans to cut expenditure and far more difficult to carry them out.' Finally, sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism has made it the most volatile currency in Europe, offering good returns to investors willing to play it. 'People have probably won and lost more on the pound than on any other currency this year so far,' says Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank Corporation. Forecasts as to where the pound is heading in the short term vary sharply. Mr O'Neill believes the pound will soon recover on new signs of UK economic growth. He believes next week's retail sales figures for January may show a sharp rise. 'The pound could bottom out at DM2.30, but we should see DM2.50 this year,' he says. Mr Brett is more pessimistic: 'Dealers are being paid a big premium to short the pound and buy one with a higher yield,' he said. In his view the pound will only be cheap enough to offset the low yield for investors when it has reached DM2.20.</p>

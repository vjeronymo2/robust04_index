			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 12, BNS -- Latvian President Guntis  Ulmanis sent his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin a letter  outlining a string of proposals for the formation of bilateral  relations.    Ulmanis handed the letter over to Russian Ambassador  Alexander Rannikh who visited him Thursday [12 May] to discuss  Latvian- Russian relations.    Rannikh voiced his concern over "insufficient Latvian  activities in the new block of the Skrunda radar facility," the  president's office told BNS.    The ambassador told Ulmanis that the last Russian warship  would leave the Liepaja seaport early in July, thus, marking the  complete withdrawal of Russian naval forces from Latvia.    The officials pointed out that Latvian and Russian executive  institutions should act more responsibly and energetically to  allow for Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin's visit to  Latvia later this month.    Ulmanis and Rannikh also assessed the recent Latvian joining  to the Western European Union [WEU] in the status of "associate  partner" as a major achievement of the Latvian diplomacy.    Rannikh claims that the event confirms the unanimous WEU and  European Union's backing to the signed package of  Latvian-Russian troop withdrawal treaty.</p>

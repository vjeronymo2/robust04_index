			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> AIRPORT GROUP ASKS FOR $5,200 DONATION  </P> <P> The City Council appears lukewarm over a funding request by an ad-hoc  organization that has come under fire from South Orange County officials and  landowners for considering the area as a possible site for a second regional  airport.  </P> <P> Clarence J. Turner, vice president of the Costa Mesa-based Airport Site  Coalition, said he has asked Mission Viejo officials to donate $5,200 to the  organization, which is experiencing fiscal problems.  </P> <P> The funding request will be considered at the council's Monday night meeting,  Mayor William S. Craycraft said on Friday.  </P> <P> But Craycraft, who has repeatedly criticized the coalition for various  proposals to build a regional airport in South County, said that he will  recommend rejection.  </P> <P> "If the coalition is bent on recommending a South Orange County site, I would  strongly oppose that our city participate in funding the coalition," Craycraft  said.  </P> <P> The Airport Site Coalition began 19 months ago to narrow a list of 31 proposed  airport sites. A second airport site is being sought as a way to relieve  traffic problems and airplane congestion at John Wayne Airport, Turner said.  </P></p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (10): Tower of Bubble totters - The official 'price-keeping operation' There is an office block in the centre of Tokyo's financial district they call the Tower of Bubble. With a vast and beautiful oval atrium which takes up half of the building's floorspace, it is a monument to the excesses of Japan in the late 1980s. It also tells the story of the rise and fall of the infamous bubble economy. The site used to house an NTT telephone exchange, but when computer miniaturisation meant that the building was no longer needed, the phone company redeveloped the site as a financial centre. It now houses securities companies such as Nomura, Salomon Brothers and BZW. Such was the hubris that even as land prices soared in space-hungry Japan the architects could afford the expense of the eye-catching but unproductive void. (Perhaps presciently, the builders fitted unusually high barriers on the areas overlooking the 20-storey hole, presumably to deter stockbrokers from making a traditional exit in the event of a crash.) That collapse was not long in coming. The Nikkei index sagged from 39,000 in late 1989 to 14,300 last August before the government stepped in with a Keynsian public works programme to prevent the real economy from sliding into depression, and an attempt to support the stock market with public pension funds and postal savings. Mr Noburu Fukuda of Nikko Securities wryly calls the share support scheme a Price-Keeping Operation, after the UN's various peace-keeping operations around the world; a joke shared by other Tokyo brokers. But while it may have helped prevent the widely-feared systemic collapse of Japan's banking and life assurance industry, the Price-Keeping Operation is slowly throttling Japan's securities houses. For the broking community, the problem is that trading volumes have all but dried up. The government seems determined to put a floor under share prices  -about 16,000 on the Nikkei index - to support the banks' and insurance companies' capital bases. But if the government has put a floor under prices, then almost everyone else has built the ceiling. Speculative Tokkin funds, individuals, companies with unrealised capital gains, banks and life insurance companies with a shortage of liquid assets would all like to sell shares above 18,000. A stalemate between the government and investors has left the stock market in a very narrow trading range. Few would like to guess when the market will break out - or even in which direction the move is likely to come. That leaves very little reason to trade, and as speculative activity has dwindled the brokers' income has fallen. Apart from executing the government's share purchases, practically the only trade is in index arbitrage - a business dominated by foreign brokers. Most Japanese securities houses think that the Tokyo Stock Exchange needs to turn over at least 400m shares a day for the large brokers to break even. While that is much lower than the peak volumes of 800m shares a day in 1988, current turnover is only 200m shares a day. Brokers large and small are haemorrhaging cash. Opinions vary about how easily the brokers can cope. Alicia Ogawa of Salomon Brothers thinks that there is plenty the securities houses can do. 'The big four houses, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi, have done a lot to get costs down,' she says. 'In September 1991 they needed a TSE turnover of 450m shares to break even; now that's down to 350m. They can chop bonuses, cut out new recruits, and have a higher natural wastage than many other Japanese businesses. 'About 25 per cent of their costs are in areas such as advertising and entertainment - which can clearly be cut back. Smaller overseas operations and even some domestic branches are being closed or merged.' But Noburu Fukuda at Nikko is not so sure. 'I am struggling with this problem and it is not easy. People often say that we shed labour naturally as women leave to get married. But fewer are leaving, perhaps because of the economic difficulties. We can try to cut our costs by sending staff to our affiliated companies, but then our affiliates have their own problems and want to send people to us. 'We need to ride this together and perhaps that means forgetting bonuses. Still, we must be careful that the pain is shared fairly. Top management will need to sacrifice more.' Nikko is budgeting on a long run market turnover of about 350m shares a day, but that looks optimistic. 'If things don't start to improve soon, we will have to think again,' Mr Fukuda concedes. Indeed, the securities industry has made a rod for its own back by responding so slowly. The stock market peaked over three years ago, yet it is only in the last 12 months that securities firms started to take significant action. That is especially true of the second tier securities houses which are arguably most at risk because they expanded most rapidly in the late 1980s, and now have cost structures a long way out of balance with any likely incomes. 'Firms like Sanyo Securities and New Japan must really be hurting,' thinks Ms Ogawa. 'They geared up the most during the 1980s, and still need turnover to exceed 600m shares." If the medium sized firms are in the deepest trouble, that is only cold comfort to the large and small brokers. Small firms are heavily dependent on individual investors who have mostly quit the field. And while they operate out of cheaper offices, with much lower overheads, income has almost dried up. Selling investment trusts managed by the large brokers which paid high commission rates was an important source of above average commission. That business is fading fast. Many small brokers have relationships with large firms and look to them for salvation. They may look in vain. Large firms, fearful that they will set a general precedent, are reluctant to commit themselves to rescuing any but their closest allies. At least a proportion of the smaller brokerage firms will be allowed to go out of business. That network of relationships is a problem for the large firms. Not only do they have equity stakes and other ties to many small and embattled firms, but they also have financing subsidiaries which have suffered as badly as many banks in the property bubble. Once those subsidiaries are accounted for, the balance sheets of even very large firms may start to look stretched. If the most likely scenario for the Japanese broking community is for a rationalisation of small firms and the strengthening of the big four at the expense of the upstart pretenders, then that outcome is crucially dependent on the ability of the large firms to exploit the situation. The size of the black holes in their balance sheets will determine not only the ability of the large firms to capitalise on the exposed middle market, but also the number of their smaller brethren they can afford to rescue.</p>

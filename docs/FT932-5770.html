			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / New-ICI rebounds as Zeneca falls THE demerger of Imperial Chemical Industries was completed yesterday with the start of official trading in the shares of the two new companies. Shares in new-ICI, encompassing chemicals, paints, materials and explosives, got off to a better start than those of Zeneca, the bioscience business. New-ICI shares closed at 636p, up 28p from the previous 'grey market' price, with 5.5m shares traded. Demand for the shares, regarded as a cyclical recovery play, was reported from the US. The rise was also attributed to a rebound as the shares had been driven down ahead of the demerger. Zeneca shares, ex the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue, fell 2p to 630p while the nil-paid shares settled 3p down at 34p. Volume in Zeneca shares was 10m with another 2.6m dealt in the nil-paid. Zeneca's 5-for-16 rights issue, which closes on June 21, is priced at 600p. Mr John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, said he was 'not worried' about the nearness of the Zeneca price to the rights level. He said the syndicate formed to drum up demand from international investors for Zeneca, to be satisfied by purchases of the nil-paid shares in the market, had got off to 'a good steady start'. Mr Paul Woodhouse, pharmaceuticals analyst at Smith New Court, the stockbroker, said: 'Although Zeneca will do better than many companies in the sector during the coming years, it will be behind the best. The p/e for 1994 puts Zeneca at 12.5, with SmithKline Beecham at 12.7, Glaxo at 12.3 and Wellcome on 13.5.' Analysts expect that uncertainty about the coming healthcare reforms in the US will continue to unsettle the sector. Observer, Page 17 London Stock Exchange, Page 44</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOUR OF S.F. NO PUBLICITY STUNT -- QUAYLE  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, who visited earthquake-torn San Francisco without  talking to its mayor, today rejected the mayor's characterization of his tour  as a "publicity stunt."  </P> <P> During an appearance on NBC's "Today" show, Quayle was told San Francisco Mayor  Art Agnos said that if the vice president visited the city without talking to  him, "maybe it was a publicity stunt."  </P> <P> Quayle disagreed about the reason for his visit.  </P> <P> "I think that's very unfortunate to take that kind of a shot at a very  difficult time," Quayle said. "I was there to help people."  </P> <P> Agnos said Wednesday he was "ticked off" that Quayle "flies around in a  helicopter, makes a bunch of television spots" but did not meet with him. The  mayor had said before Quayle's visit that he planned to meet with Quayle to  urge immediate federal help.  </P> <P> The White House today accused Agnos of deciding "not to cooperate." Asked why  Quayle and Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner did not meet with Agnos,  Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Agnos was not only invited but refused an  offer of a helicopter to transport him.  </P></p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Bosnian Serbs ponder whether to declare war After 2 1/2 years of war, the self-styled Bosnian Serb parliament yesterday devoted a second day to the question of whether to make the conflict official. Despite waging a brutal conflict against Moslem and Croat enemies, and incurring Nato air strikes, the Bosnian Serb leadership has never formally declared war. But recent setbacks on the battlefields, coupled with the effects of a three-month political and economic blockade by neighbouring Serbia and Montenegro, have forced the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, to impose new discipline. Fearing a dilution of its authority, the makeshift parliament in Pale, above Sarajevo, has forced Mr Karadzic to limit the scope of a declaration to those areas most immediately at risk from the latest fighting. Political sources in Pale say the formal state of war will apply only to half the Serb-controlled territory. 'Of course, you can always expect resistance,' said a source close to the Pale leadership. 'People got scared by all this talk of declaring war. But we have to prove to the Moslems that they cannot win.' The parliamentary session was conducted in private. Journalists were kept at arms' length by order of Mr Sonja Karadzic, daughter of the Bosnian Serb leader. Mr Karadzic said before the debate continued yesterday that he would assume certain decision-making powers from parliament, but insisted there was no question of the assembly being dissolved. As the Serbs come under military pressure he needs to take care. The parliament has often been dismissed as a rubber stamp for the Bosnian Serb political and military leadership, but it does represent Mr Karadzic's link with the people, not all of whom are always behind him. He cannot afford to be seen to be ignoring their representatives. Officials admit that absenteeism and black marketeering, sometimes across enemy lines, have resulted in military weakness. While Serbs enjoyed overwhelming superiority in the field, and Moslems and Croats fought among themselves, the problems were not acute. But recent events have injected a note of urgency. The new measures will include more efficient mobilisation - this has already begun - restrictions on the movement of civilians and the introduction of martial law. Local government will be concentrated in the hands of small groups of officials, answerable to Mr Karadzic. Punishments for desertion and dereliction of duty are likely to be toughened. On Wednesday, Mr Karadzic said a number of brigade commanders responsible for losing territory near the north western enclave of Bihac had already been replaced for failing to obey orders. With the sound of artillery occasionally audible in the placid streets of this impoverished mountain resort, military uniforms seem more prevalent than ever. Local radio programmes carry upbeat stories of the fighting interspersed with detailed reports on the availability of food throughout the self-proclaimed Bosnian Serb republic. Since Serbia severed relations with the Bosnian Serbs in August, Mr Karadzic has conducted periodic purges of the army and police. It is clear that his personal feud with the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, has led him, rightly or wrongly, to suspect those around him.</p>

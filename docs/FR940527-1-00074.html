			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the fourth contract cycle, the PROs are no longer required to review these cases on a prepayment basis. Rather, the cases are flagged and the PRO conducts a 100 percent review after payment. Therefore, we are proposing to revise &sect;412.60(d)(2) to conform the regulations to current practice. At the same time, we would revise an incorrect cross-reference to the regulations that govern the PROs' review of these DRG reassignments. The correct cross-reference is &sect;466.71(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. National Average Standardized Amounts for FY 1995 (&sect;412.63)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act directs the Secretary to compute national average standardized amounts for use in determining payments for inpatient operating services, updated annually by the applicable percentage increase set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth under section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act. Under section 1886(d)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act, for FYs 1988 through 1994, the Secretary has computed separate national average standardized amounts for large urban, other urban and rural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. However, section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act requires that, for discharges occurring after October 1, 1994, the average standardized amounts for hospitals located in a rural area shall be equal to the average standardized amount for hospitals located in an other urban area. We note that hospitals located in a rural area will continue to be considered rural for all other payment purposes, such as the disproportionate share adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary has been applying updates to the average standardized amounts for each fiscal year as provided under section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act. For FY 1995, section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act directs the Secretary to update the rural national average standardized amount by the amount necessary to make it equal to the other urban national average standardized amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Current &sect;412.63(m) already reflects the requirement that, for discharges occurring after October 1, 1994, we will pay for inpatient hospital services based on national average standardized amounts for large urban and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas. Thus, there will no longer be separate national average standardized amounts for other urban and rural areas. However, we are proposing to make several technical changes to &sect;412.63(m) and (r), concerning computation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal rates, to eliminate now obsolete references to the rural and other urban standardized amounts and replace them with references to the standardized amounts for other areas. In the addendum to this proposed rule, we provide a description of the updates being proposed for FY 1995 under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements of sections 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) and 1886(d)(3)(A)(iv) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Outliers (&sect;&sect;412.80, 412.82 and 412.84)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act provides that, in addition to the basic prospective payment rates, payments must be made for discharges involving day outliers and may be made for cost outliers. Under section 1886(d)(3)(B) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act, the Secretary has been required to separately reduce the urban and rural national standardized amount by the proportion of estimated total DRG payments attributable to outliers in each respective area. Beginning with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1995, section 1886(d)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended by section 4002(c)(2)(B)(iii) of Public Law 101&hyph;508, requires the Secretary to reduce the large urban and other national standardized amounts by the same factor to account for the proportion of total DRG payments made to outlier cases. (As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explained in section IV.C. of this preamble, section 1886(d)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act specifies that beginning in FY 1995, the standardized amount for other urban and rural areas will be equal, with the result that there will be only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two standardized amounts, one for large urban areas and one for all other areas.) Section 1886(d)(9)(B)(iv) of the Act requires that the urban and other standardized amounts applicable to hospitals in Puerto Rico be reduced by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportion of estimated total DRG payments attributable to estimated outlier payments. Furthermore, section 1886(d)(5)(A)(iv) of the Act directs that outlier payments in any year may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 6 percent of total payments projected or estimated to be made based on the prospective payment rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13501(c) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103&hyph;66) amended section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act with respect to outliers beginning in FY 1995. With regard to cost outliers, section 13501(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 requires that the Secretary modify the methodology for determining the cost outlier threshold. Formerly, section 1886(d)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act specified that a hospital can receive payment for a cost outlier if the adjusted costs for a discharge exceed the greater of a fixed dollar amount or a fixed multiple the DRG payment for the case. As amended by section 13501(c)(2) of Public Law 103&hyph;66, section 1886(d)(5)(A)(ii) of the Act now specifies that, for discharges on or after October 1, 1994, a hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may receive payment for a cost outlier if adjusted costs exceed the DRG prospective payment rate plus a fixed dollar amount determined by the Secretary. We will refer to this revised cost outlier threshold as ``fixed loss.'' A further discussion of the methodology for determining the fixed loss  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is provided below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 13501(c) of Public Law 103&hyph;66 also amended section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act with respect to day outliers. Beginning with FY 1995, section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act requires the Secretary to reduce the proportion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total outlier payments paid under the day outlier methodology. Under the requirements of section 1886(d)(5)(A)(v) of the Act, the proportion of outlier  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments paid under the day outlier methodology, relative to the proportion of outlier payments in FY 1994, shall be 75 percent in FY 1995, 50 percent in FY 1996 and 25 percent in FY 1997. Under the provisions of section 1886(d)(5)(A)(i) of the Act, the Secretary will no longer pay for day outliers after September 30, 1997. As indicated in the table published in our September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46348), we estimated that 18 percent of FY 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlier payments would be for outliers meeting the day outlier threshold only, while 13 percent would meet the day and cost outlier thresholds and be paid under the day outlier methodology. Thus, a total of 31.3 percent of total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outlier payments in FY 1994 would be paid as day outlier cases. Pursuant to section 1886(d)(5)(A) of the Act, we propose setting the day outlier thresholds for FY 1995 through FY 1998 so that day outlier payments approximate the following proportion of total outlier payments:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;FY 1995_24 percent (75 percent of 31.3 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;FY 1996_16 percent (50 percent of 31.3 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;FY 1997_8 percent (25 percent of 31.3 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As payments to day outliers are reduced, there will be a corresponding increase in payments to cost outliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

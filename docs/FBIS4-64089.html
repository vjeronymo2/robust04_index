			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- "The Army must not be  subjected to any experiments. We must not save or make money on  the defenders of our homeland," Air Major-General Nikolay  Bezborodov, vice-chairman of the Duma Defence Committee, told  ITAR-TASS today. He noted that trips of MPs to garrisons of the  Far Eastern Military Area and to the Northern Fleet have  confirmed that minimum funds, sufficient only for every-day  needs, are being allocated to the military establishment. This  calls in question the proper organisation of military training  and the protection of Russia's interests and security.    The materials of the investigation, Bezborodov said, have  been submitted to the Defence Council of the State Duma, to the  government, and to the president of the Russian Federation. The  committee is sure that it is necessary to radically revise the  financing of the Armed Forces. The situation when servicemen  and the civilian personnel are not paid their salaries for 2-3  months running can by no means be regarded as normal. This  creates a tense situation in some garrisons, where the families  of servicemen live only on Army cash allowances.    Bezborodov said that the president's stand on the military  budget was clear. He wants minimum funds to be allocated, which  would keep the combat readiness of the Armed Forces at the  needed level, would ensure the survival of the military science  and purchases of the needed armaments. The president is sure  that this is the duty of the state.    "The privileges accorded to servicemen should neither be  expanded nor curtailed," the vice-chairman of the Duma Defence  Committee stressed. Reports have appeared that the Russian  Government was allegedly proposing to pay minimum compensation  for the present food rations. Defence Ministry experts have  made corresponding calculations, which showed that in this case  all the servicemen would prefer to get food rations instead of  money. This will be much more expensive to the state. "The  committee will approach these problems most seriously," the  general stated.</p>

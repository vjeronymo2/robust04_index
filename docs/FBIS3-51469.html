			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in  Zimbabwe today on a three-day visit. This visit is the third  stage of a tour he is making of five African countries.    Robaina was met at the airport by (Estanislus Chiwedere),  permanent secretary of the foreign ministry, who highlighted the  two nations' common interests. In his welcoming speech, this  high-ranking official said he was welcoming the representative  of a nation that has shown solidarity toward Zimbabwe ever since  Zimbabwe was struggling for independence, and with which (?it)  shares many positions.    Robaina, for his part, said his visit was in response to the  interest in explaining how his people live and work and in  exchanging mutually beneficial experiences.    Robaina had earlier been in Angola, where he had talks with  high-ranking Angolan officials. Those talks have been described  as very fruitful. Shortly before leaving Angola, the Cuban  foreign minister held a news conference. Here, from Luanda, is  journalist (Issac Nenei).    [(Nenei)] -- live] As we said, he left Luanda this morning  on  his way to Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, continuing his  diplomatic offensive through southern Africa. Namibia and Zambia  will be the last countries he visits. The objective of this  visit is, as we have already said, to explain what is happening  in Cuba and, at the same time, to find out what is happening in  this part of the world.    [Begin recording] [Robaina] I am really leaving with the  satisfaction of having been able to carry out, in a short time,  an intense program. But I am also leaving with the satisfaction  of now being highly informed, and brought up to date, about a  reality that my people follow very closely.    We Cubans follow very closely what happens in Angola; and,  truly, since we know that the Angolans also follow very closely  what happens in Cuba, we have tried to give them as much  information as possible.    [Unidentified journalist, speaking Portuguese] What does  Cuba  expect (?to obtain) from Angola and other African countries?    [Robaina] Cuba expects from Angola and other African  countries what we expect of the world. And although some may  think that what we expect from Angola and the world, or of any  country in particular, is the solution to our  problems....[rephrases] Please, the solution to Cuba's problems  depends first of all on the Cubans themselves, and on a  mechanism that Cuba maintains with many in the world. Cuba  expects, from Angola and from the world, what Cuba also  advocates for the world: understanding and respect. Simply that.    [Unidentified journalist, speaking Spanish] As regards the  crisis Angola is experiencing right now, Robaina, who is a  member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, said  that the Cuban people hope Angola will solve its problems [word  indistinct]. [end recording]    [(Nenei)] From Luanda, this is (Issac Nenei) for the  National  Radio Newscast in Cuba.    [In a similar item, Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish on 16 Jan  at  1300 GMT reports that Robaina said that Cuba wants to establish  stronger economic ties with various countries as part of its  policy to neutralize the effects of the U.S. blockade and the  collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe.    Robaina said Cuba is seeking mutually beneficial  cooperation,  a principle that is the basis for the country's opening to  foreign capital and the establishment of joint enterprises. In  statements to the media, Robaina rejected reports of a possible  barter of Cuban weapons for Angolan petroleum.    Robaina will head for Zambia and Namibia following his visit  to Zimbabwe].</p>

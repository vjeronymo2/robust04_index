			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> SALKELD SUPPLIES THE FAST TIMES AT SAUGUS  </P> <P> Introducing Roger Salkeld, the man with the golden arm -- soon to be pitching  in a major league ballpark near you. The memories are waiting -- or so it  assuredly seems.  </P> <P> For Salkeld, Saugus High's 18-year-old, 6-foot-5 senior right-hander, deciding  whether to attend college before signing a professional baseball contract,  seemingly, is his only pressing concern.  </P> <P> Who wouldn't give their right arm to have Salkeld's right arm? Life must be  tough, eh, Rog?  </P> <P> "What more can you ask for?," Salkeld says, sounding almost embarrassed. "I  feel really lucky. Before, I played baseball because I liked to play it and be  around my friends.  </P> <P> "But now, I feel like I have a chance to play as a career."  </P> <P> The list of teams keeping tabs on Salkeld reads like a list of some of  baseball's top organizations -- which it is. The Dodgers, Yankees, Athletics,  Royals, Reds, Padres, Phillies, Orioles, Mariners, Indians, White Sox -- all  have expressed interest in Salkeld.  </P> <P> He is 6-0 with 88 strikeouts and an 0.52 earned-run average in 50 1/3 innings  this season. His fastball has the velocity of a rocket, his changeup the speed  of a hot-air balloon. And the combination has earned Salkeld his wings as,  perhaps, the best high school pitcher in the state.  </P> <P> "He's the most dominating pitcher I have ever seen," Saugus Coach Doug Worley  said. "When he was a sophomore he would overpower seniors. He's so tough and he  will go after you. He's got that great fastball and everything sets up off of  that."  </P> <P> Baseball America magazine ranks Salkeld third nationwide among high school  prospects, and although he is considering attending USC or Arizona State,  Salkeld admits he is leaning toward pursuing a professional career in June.  </P> <P> "Nobody's said, 'Do this' or 'Do that' and that's the way I like it," he said.  "It's really my decision."  </P> <P> Packed grandstands greet Salkeld wherever he throws. Frequent viewers include a  group of straw-hatted gentleman toting black suitcases that bear major league  insignias. Rarely does a Salkeld fastball go undocumented.  </P> <P> On Friday, for instance, a firing squad of five scouts aimed their radar guns  at Salkeld as he warmed up for the Centurions' showdown with cross-town rival  Canyon. Salkeld's first fastball registered 88 m.p.h. Later in the game, some  pitches exceeded 90.  </P> <P> In the 100-degree heat, Salkeld maintained a minimum velocity of 85 m.p.h.  while posting a one-hit shutout with seven strikeouts -- his lowest total in a  start this season. Saugus (5-0) defeated Canyon, 5-0, to take a one-game lead  in the Golden League standings.  </P> <P> It was a busy week. Three days earlier, Salkeld struck out six in three innings  in relief to earn a victory against Quartz Hill.  </P> <P> The three-year letterman also topped the 300 career-strikeout mark (306) and  established school records for complete games (23) and wins (23). Salkeld's  career record is 23-7.  </P> <P> But what about developing a sore arm, the bane of young flame throwers? Many  pitchers' dreams have gone up in smoke because of a burned-out arm. And that's  one reason Bill Salkeld does not object to the thought of his son skipping  college.  </P> <P> "Colleges have a tendency to burn out a lot of young pitchers," he said. "Roger  would prefer to go pro, and, being his parents, if that's what he wants, OK."  </P> <P> But no decision about his future will be made too quickly.  </P> <P> "I won't decide until when and if I get drafted," Salkeld said."  </P></p>

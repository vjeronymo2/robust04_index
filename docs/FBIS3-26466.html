			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhao Renfang: "China Successfully Issues Global Bonds"] </F>   [Text] New York, February 3 (XINHUA) -- China has  successfully issued one billion U.S. dollar global bonds.    According to Jin Renqing, Chinese vice minister of finance,  the proceeds of this bond issue will be used to finance projects  in sectors of energy, transportation and communications in China.    The one billion U.S. dollar global bond was launched on  February 2 and broad distribution, one of the key objectives of  the Ministry of Finance, which represents China, has been  achieved, Jin noted.    "The success of the global debt offering is to set up a  bench-mark for other Chinese financial institutions to tap  international capital markets, in particular, the U.S. market in  the future," said Jin at a press conference held today at  Merrill Lynch's New York headquarters.    The Chinese Ministry of Finance has worked for nearly a year  in preparing for this global bond offering. Last year, U.S.  credit-rating agencies were invited to China to reassess the  sovereign credit rating on Chinese foreign debt. The U.S. firm  Moody's raised China's sovereign foreign debt credit-rating from  BAA1 to A3 while another agency Fitch assigned an A-rating for  China, whose economy continues to thrive.    Soon after, in the name of the People's Republic of China,  the Ministry of Finance successfully issued a euro-yen bond in  the eurobond markets and a U.S. dollar dragon bond in Asian  market.    Zhu Guangyao, division chief, World Bank Department of the  ministry, told XINHUA that the offering of this one billion  dollar global bond was the largest amount China has ever had.    Before the launching of China's first global bond offering,  a  delegation of the Finance Ministry has visited 12 major cities  in Asia, Europe and the United States for road show in the last  two weeks.    "International investors have given very strong response,"  Jin added, "through this offering, we have strongly felt that  international investors have expressed keen interest while  showing confidence in the future development of China."    A registration statement relating to these securities, which  has been filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,  became effective today.    According to Zhu, about 60 percent of the bonds were sold at  the United States, and the rest sold at other global markets.    Merrill Lynch and other international security firms have  cooperated to form a strong syndicate group for this offering.    Vice Minister Jin said that China will tap the international  capital markets on a regular basis in the future in accordance  with the funding requirements for China's economic construction  and conditions of the international marketplace.</p>

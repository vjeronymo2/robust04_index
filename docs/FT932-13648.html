			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / UK Company News: Etonbrook bid talks collapse TALKS AIMED at securing an agreed takeover bid for Etonbrook Properties collapsed yesterday amid claims that rebel shareholders had insufficient backing to make a cash offer for the former BES company. Mr Keith Moss, managing director of the property development group, said dissidents led by Mr Andrew Perloff, who controls 29.9 per cent of the share capital, had failed to show they could muster funds for a 79p offer, valuing the company at Pounds 3m. The shares closed yesterday unchanged at 79p. The rebels last night rejected the Etonbrook claims and said their bankers had given verbal confirmation that the necessary funds were available. Although Mr Perloff still hoped an agreed offer would be accepted, both sides are now resigned to the issue of con-trol going to an extra-ordinary meeting tomorrow at which the rebels are seeking the removal of the current board. The EGM marks the culmination of an increasingly acrimonious battle for control of the company which began last year when Mr Perloff first sought a seat on the board. Etonbrook has since blamed a sharp fall in interim pre-tax profits on costs incurred fighting the rebel action.</p>

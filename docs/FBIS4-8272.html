			<p>BFN     [Text] Plzen, April 8 (CTK) -- The Plzen district court  today sentenced former Federal and Security Information Service  (FBIS) employee Vaclav Wallis to 37 months' unconditional  imprisonment for selling secret information from the FBIS to  former Harvard Investment Funds director Viktor Kozeny.    The sentence is to be carried out in a prison with the  second  highest security level. The verdict has not yet taken effect,  and the accused and the state attorney are still able to appeal  against it.    Justifying the verdict, Judge Premysl Spicar said that by  betraying state secrets in 1992, Wallis committed two crimes --  that of threatening state secrets and abusing public office.    Despite the objections of the defense, the court said Wallis  was a public servant, although it did not uphold the claim of  the prosecution that by abuse of public office Wallis had caused  particularly serious consequences. Thus the court finally gave  a lower sentence than that asked for by the state attorney, who  in his closing speech had proposed that Wallis be imprisoned for  6.5 years.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Hanson angered by Dorrell query over 'too high' dividends Lord Hanson, the chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate, has accused Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, of 'sounding like a socialist' in questioning the wisdom of high dividends. In a letter to the minister, Lord Hanson, whose company donated Pounds 100,000 to the Conservative party during its last financial year to September, said the issue of dividends was a matter for shareholders and their company. 'It has nothing to do with the government,' he added. Mr Dorrell angered Lord Hanson by suggesting recently that UK dividend pay-outs, which have risen significantly over the past decade, may have become too high and inflexible. Mr Robin Cook, Labour trade and industry secretary, has also drawn attention to the high proportion of profit companies spend on dividends, prompting Lord Hanson to observe that Mr Dorrell 'sounds like a socialist'. Mr Dorrell said yesterday he 'wholeheartedly agreed' with Lord Hanson that the level of dividends was a matter for companies. However, he said the Treasury had decided to review savings and investment to see whether the rise in dividends had come about because of the tax structure set by the government. 'After 15 years of deregulation, there's no question of us regulating dividends,' Mr Dorrell said. 'What we are looking at is whether companies are paying high dividends because of what we are doing - in terms of the tax system - and whether companies would continue to pay out the same level of dividend if things changed under a more level playing field.' Lord Hanson made clear in his letter to Mr Dorrell that he believed the Treasury was wrong to be concerned about the growth of dividends through recession. He described high dividends as a 'good discipline' for companies, providing they did not strip them of cash and restrict corporate investment. He also argued it was not helpful for companies to be 'awash with cash'. Lord Hanson also referred to the government's desire for wider share ownership and asked Mr Dorrell how this policy sat with his comments about the rise in dividends. His criticisms underline growing concern that the Treasury may change dividend taxation in the next Budget. Dividends worry, Weekend V</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Bid speculation encourages late rally A LATE SURGE in London equities yesterday, at the end of a lacklustre day, was triggered by Wall Street's opening firmness and encouraged by a bout of speculation that a takeover bid was being prepared for a Footsie stock. For most of the session, however, shares traded quietly in a narrow range as investors and traders braced themselves for today's UK local elections. Modest overnight rises on Wall Street and in Tokyo meant that the FT-SE 100 index opened only just into positive territory. Early company news was not encouraging - there was a profits warning from food retailer Budgens - and the Footsie index soon drifted lower. A rights issue from the Bank of Scotland focused attention on the view that institutions were beginning to be stretched by cash calls. 'The fuel for the rally is used up,' said Mr Robin Aspinall at Schroders. Such concern was underlined by the latest survey of pension fund liquidity from Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps). It said provisionally that cash balances in the first quarter of the year had fallen from 8.2 per cent of investments to 5.3 per cent. The figures will be fin-alised within three weeks. However, Mr Roger Palmer at Kleinwort Benson argued that there was plenty of buying power left in the funds: 'The historic average is 4 per cent.' He acknowledged his bullishness was a minority view. Optimistic talk on the prospects for inflation from Mr John Major, the prime minister, served to ensure prices were off their worst by midsession. But it took reassuringly rapid cuts in prime lending rates by US banks, in response to the previous day's reduction in the Federal Reserve's discount rate, to give Wall Street a flying start and activate trading in London. Sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic was further improved by April's survey of US purchasing managers. Its index rose for the third month in succession, adding weight to the opinion that a US recovery was starting. The Footsie index rose quickly through the 2,500 mark to end just off the day's high at 2,508.4 for a net increase of 22.2. Turnover was 420m shares, the highest of the week so far but still far below the levels at which securities houses are confident of making money. Analysts, faced with short- term electoral uncertainties, concentrated on longer term prognoses. Mr Paul Walton at James Capel took an optimistic line. He said the market had not yet discounted the strength of the recovery in corporate earnings likely in 1992. An aggregation of analysts' forecasts calculated by Capel pointed to an almost 15 per cent earnings recovery next year. This would be only a slightly smaller turnround than that which occurred after the recession of the early 1980s. Mr Walton said that companies with high fixed costs and low variable costs would benefit most. The performance of the dollar, so influential at the start of the week, was all but ignored. It lost ground and some international stocks fell. Others were caught on the rising tide of bid talk. Speculation centred on Allied-Lyons, but spilled over into other brewing and food issues. Amid the excitement, cautious voices struggled to be heard. Chartists still argued that the Footsie index could fall to 2,425; all agreed that a heavy defeat by the Conservative party in today's polls would see such a figure once more in the market's sights.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Beneficial interest MY WIFE and I have joint building society deposits, as well as shares and other investments in our joint names. On the death of one party, does the entire beneficial interest go to the other? This is obviously relevant for succession planning and inheritance tax. Barry Stillerman, of accountant Stoy Hayward, replies: You are correct in stating that, in the case of joint building society accounts and other investments in joint names, the assets pass entirely to the survivor on the first death. For inheritance tax purposes, if you want to pass certain of the assets to parties other than your spouse - for example, your children - then it would be necessary to separate the investments so that they are held by each of you separately. This is similar to the situation regarding property where many houses are held under a joint tenancy so that, if you want to gift your half-share of the property, it would be necessary for the interest in the property to be held as tenants-in-common rather than under joint ownership. Thus, you can each deal with your half-share as you wish. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

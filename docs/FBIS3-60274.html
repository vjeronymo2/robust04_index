Congress has approved the law creating it. The law establishes  incentives for those who replant forests and severe penalties  for those who contribute toward contamination. High school  graduates who are serving in the military may do so in  environmental tasks. He who contaminates will pay. This is one  of the main purposes of the Environmental Law, which will guard  and conserve the country's natural resources from now on but  with full collaboration from the community.    [Begin Aduardo Uribe, National Department of Planning  Environmental director, recording] The bill creates several  ways for community participation. It allows the people who live  along rivers and in forests to speak up and participate in the  decisions that will affect their environment. [end recording]    Each municipality will design its own environmental  conservation plans. They will receive special support from the  police, and the attorney general will delegate environmental  matters.    [Begin Uribe recording] There are taxes, fines, and  penalties established for destroying our natural resources.  There are penalties that can be applied and executed by the  public forces, municipal and regional authorities, and the  Environment Ministry. According to the law, these entities now  have police functions. [end recording]    The project takes off using a $25-million IDB loan followed  by the government's contribution. A new aspect of the law is  that 20 percent of young enlisted men will be allowed to serve  in ecological tasks. There are also awards for those who  restore the environment by planting all types of plants and  introducing animal species. The government will absorb up to 75  percent of any restoration efforts.</p>

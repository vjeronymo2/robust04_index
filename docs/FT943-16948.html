			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Asda shows resilience despite write-downs Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, warned yesterday of continuing pressure on profit margins in UK food retailing, as he unveiled a resilient performance from his own company, with underlying profits up 43 per cent. Net property write-downs of Pounds 179m and a Pounds 130m write-off connected with the sale of the Allied Maples business meant that Asda reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 126m for the year to April 30. But disregarding these exceptional items, profits rose from Pounds 140.4m to Pounds 201.4m. 'We are still in what we call the watershed period,' said Mr Norman, who was the first leading industry figure to predict tougher times ahead for food retailers in 1992. 'If (food retailing) space is expanding by 8 to 10 per cent a year, but demand is relatively flat it doesn't take me to point out there is going to be pressure on margins.' He added that Asda was entering the final year of a three-year recovery programme based on 'meeting the needs of ordinary working people, who demand value' and designed to equip the company to deal with the new 'market realities'. Asda's shares closed up  3/4 p at 52 1/4 p, bolstered by a 10 per cent increase in the final dividend to 1.21p, taking the total to 1.76p (1.6p). Losses per share of 5.91p after exceptional items compared with earnings of 6.4p last year. Group turnover, excluding Allied Maples, increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 4.8bn (Pounds 4.41bn), and Asda said that with only one new store opened during the year, like-for-like sales increased by 8.9 per cent. That far outstripped like-for-like growth at competitors J Sainsbury, Tesco, and Argyll, owner of Safeway. Mr Norman admitted that Asda's figures were recovering from a weaker base, but he added that the performance had beaten his own expectations. Asda said the increasingly competitive market and moves to more conservative accounting by other grocery groups had persuaded it to make a Pounds 154m property write-down, reducing the value of older stores to their alternative use value. It was starting to depreciate other stores by between 2 and 5 per cent per year depending on age, resulting in a recurring additional charge of Pounds 18.4m. Asda also wrote down the value of its investment in Burwood House, a joint venture with British Aerospace, by Pounds 30m to Pounds 73m. See Lex</p>

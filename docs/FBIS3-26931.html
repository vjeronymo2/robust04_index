Encouraged by the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's southern  inspection tour addresses, Fujian township and town enterprises  further emancipated their minds, unified understanding, and  increased reform efforts and the pace of development. In 1993,  they achieved a total output value of 101.3 billion yuan; the  total value of delivered exports was 19 billion yuan; and total  profits and taxes reached 8 billion yuan; up 85 percent, 75  percent, and 45 percent respectively from the year before and  indicating simultaneous increases in the growth rate and  efficiency.    The characteristics of the rapid growth of Fujian's township  and town enterprises are:    --Increasing inputs and the continued expansion of the  development scale. Last year, the province's township and town  enterprises injected 15 billion yuan -- more than double the  amount in the previous year -- and there were 61,800 new firms  and 94 business conglomerates which developed some strong  industries and widely marketed products.    --The rapid growth of joint stock enterprises. An operating  mechanism is adopted in which financing, benefits, accumulation,  and risks are all shared. A joint stock cooperation system was  vigorously promoted in rural areas, through which a total of 10  billion yuan was raised from across the province. Nineteen  thousand enterprises participated in the rural joint stock  cooperation system, giving new vitality to township and town  enterprises and their rapid development.    --Active nongovernment-run scientific research activity and  notable scientific and technological progress. Township and  town enterprises throughout the province last year invested 2.3  billion yuan, launched 2,799 key technological transformation  projects, developed 23 new provincial- and prefectural-level  products, popularized approximately 400 new scientific and  technological products, and established 135 nongovernmental  scientific and technological organizations, greatly speeding up  the progress of township and town enterprises toward high and  new technologies.    --Mushrooming small industrial zones and continued expansion  in operating scale. Across the province, there are now 725  small industrial zones with a certain scale. Ten townships and  towns saw their output value top 1 billion yuan, while 69  villages and 40 enterprises saw their output value top 100  million yuan.    --Opening up on all fronts and breakthroughs in establishing  domestic lateral ties and in introducing foreign investment.  Last year, the province approved approximately 1,800 new  foreign-invested enterprises commanding $1.8 billion in foreign  capital, approximately 800 million of which -- about 40 percent  of the new investment by all township and town enterprises in  the same year -- has been committed. Thirty-one enterprises  located outside the province were established, and approximately  1,950 new domestic lateral projects were launched, which brought  with them 3.9 billion yuan in domestic funds.</p>

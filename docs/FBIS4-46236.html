			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Guatemalan guerrilla activities monitored through 1  June.    A bomb exploded yesterday at 1800 near Channel 7's  installations, hurling pamphlets of the Rebel Armed Forces with  slogans against the Army and calling for the creation of the  Truth Commission, an issue that is yet to be discussed at the  negotiations table. The explosion caused no property damage but  frightened people who were nearby. (Guatemala City SIGLO  VEINTIUNO in Spanish 28 May 94 p 12)    National Police agents captured two guerrilla suspects; one  near Maya neighborhood in Zone 18 and the other near the Guarda  market in Zone 11. In the first case, the National Police's  Public Relations office noted, the suspect was captured when  several policemen were attacked by three individuals riding a  blue Mitsubishi vehicle near the bus station in Maya  neighborhood. The second suspect attracted the attention of the  police because of his suspicious attitude. He was carrying a  briefcase that contained three grenades.

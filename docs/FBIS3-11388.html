Emisoras Caracol Network reported as a last-minute scoop  that  the leader of the Cuban Revolution telephoned Colombian Foreign  Minister Noemi Sanin with a message for President Cesar Gaviria.    According to the source, Fidel Castro told the Colombian  minister that "neither Alfonso Cano, Ivan Marquez, nor (Bishop)  Nel Beltran participated in the Fourth Meeting of Solidarity  held in Havana on 27 and 28 January of this year, contrary to  what the newspaper EL TIEMPO has mistakenly reported."    According to the radio network, the Cuban leader reported  that he personally carried out investigations and checked one by  one all the names of the people who participated in that forum,  and he can totally and absolutely guarantee, with his word of  honor at stake, that the subversion leaders in Colombia were not  in Cuba on the reported dates and did not participated in any  guerrilla summit.    According to Caracol, an annoyed Fidel Castro said  categorically: There was no guerrilla summit and neither these  persons nor any other subversive leaders of Latin America took  part in any such summit.    According to the radio report, he added: In a timely manner  we passed to Cuba's ambassador to Colombia, Jesus Martinez, the  information we had, and that information tells the truth and  nothing but the truth.    The Cuban chief of state said that there was a prelate at  the  Fourth Meeting of Solidarity, a Protestant prelate who lives in  Medellin, but not the bishop of Sincelejo, Monsignor Nel Beltran.    Fidel Castro stated that all this has been part of a setup  aimed at preventing the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba and at  marring the two country's bilateral ties. He said that there  are extraneous and shadowy sources that want to break these  bilateral ties.    The radio network said that the telephone communication will  be followed by written communication that is already on its way  and that will be delivered to President Gaviria through the  Foreign Ministry probably tomorrow or, at the latest, Sunday.</p>

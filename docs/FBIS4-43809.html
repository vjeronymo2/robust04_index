			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Press Sees Win for Kohl in Partisan Process </H5>   Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]  candidate Roman Herzog's win in Germany's 23 May presidential  election was widely interpreted in that country's press as at  least a short-term victory for CDU Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Most  writers hesitated, however, to draw firm conclusions about the  impact of the vote on the remainder of the 1994 political  calendar, including the 16 October Bundestag election. Many  commentators saw Free Democratic Party [FDP] Chairman Klaus  Kinkel's decision to back Herzog rather than Social Democratic  Party [SPD] candidate Johannes Rau in the election runoff as a  crucial choice--one which, for better or worse, inextricably  tied the FDP's political fate to that of its CDU/CSU coalition  partners. Press examinations of the SPD's reaction to its loss  focused on the public dissatisfaction of party Chairman Rudolf  Scharping and other SPD leaders with the indirect electoral  process, which allowed Herzog to become president despite an  apparent popular preference for Rau. Commentators typically  criticized the SPD's disgruntlement as politically ill-advised  and stylistically distasteful. Those who also examined the  merits of the SPD's arguments in favor of direct presidential  elections generally opposed such a system as counter to the  intent of the Basic Law, or constitution. Some, however, still  worried that partisan politics had played too great a role in  Herzog's election.  <H5>  Kohl Seen Gaining in Short Term </H5>   Reflecting mainstream press opinion on the election results,  commentator Udo Bergdoll wrote in the 25 May SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG that Helmut Kohl "is the big winner of 23 May."  Bergdoll's conclusion was based on the fact that the election  kept the (officially suprapartisan) presidency in CDU hands and  gave Kohl a victory in Germany's last electoral contest before  12 June -- the date for local votes in several laender and a  nationwide poll for the European Parliament. Even commentaries  critical of the electoral process and its outcome, like Werner  A. Perger's front-page essay in the 27 May DIE ZEIT, conceded  that Kohl had won the election because he had succeeded in  defining it as a cold-blooded contest between "a change of power  and retention of power." At least one writer went a step  further, seeing Herzog's victory as an omen for future contests.  Martin S. Lambeck, writing in the 24 May edition of DIE WELT,  suggested that Herzog's election was the strongest sign yet of  increasing popular support for the CDU. The victory, Lambeck  argued, was a "political signal of important weight," and "an  encouraging sign for a continuation of the [CDU/CSU-FDP]  coalition beyond election day in October." Most writers,  however, hesitated to draw many conclusions about the remainder  of the political year from the results of the presidential race,  and some actively disputed any such connection. Perger's DIE  ZEIT commentary, for example, cautioned that the 12 June  contests "follow other laws" and refused to accept Herzog's  victory as a "preliminary decision for the Bundestag election."  Bergdoll, too, warned in his 25 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG  analysis that Kohl's short-term win could turn into a "Pyrrhic  victory" if the FDP's strategy of loyalty to the coalition  caused Kinkel's party to lose support in the fall, threatening  the government's Bundestag majority.  <H5>  FDP's Future Seen at Stake </H5>   The wisdom of the FDP's decision to support its CDU/CSU  coalition partners was the focus of much commentary, with most  writers seeing it as a crucial choice which could make or break  the party's future. In the 25 May edition of DIE WELT,  Hans-Peter Schwarz described the decision of most FDP delegates  to follow Kinkel and vote for Herzog over Rau as a "landmark  decision on the course of [the party's] coalition policy." The  FDP, which had traditionally drawn its voters from both the CDU  and SPD camps, had now "defined itself by a strong majority as a  party of the nonsocialist center, and thus against the SPD."  While the FDP, for pragmatic reasons, might still decide on a  coalition with the SPD after the Bundestag vote, the fate of  Kinkel's party in the fall now depended on its ability to  attract as much support as possible "from the reservoir of  potential CDU/CSU voters." Bergdoll's commentary in the 25 May  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG went further, suggesting that the FDP had  effectively abandoned its traditional position as holder of the  balance of power between the two large parties. While this  might seem like "liberation" in the short run, "the hangover  will come later," Bergdoll warned, because some voters would  interpret the party's choice as surrendering its separate  identity to the CDU for the sake of a continued role in the  government. Perger, in the 27 May DIE ZEIT, provided a hint of  the potential backlash, denouncing the FDP as "obsessed with  power" and available "to the highest bidder" and sarcastically  praising Kinkel as a diligent student of Kohl's "brazenness."  Claus Leggewie, writing in the 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG, struck a  similar tone, arguing that the FDP had "once again proven its  dispensability and opportunism" and even calling on those  dissatisfied with the party's behavior to see to it that the  "special-interest party FDP shrinks down to its puny stock of  regular customers."  <H5>  SPD Viewed as "Bad Loser" </H5>   Most commentators who examined the SPD's public reaction to  Herzog's win echoed Chancellor Kohl's description of the Social  Democrats as "bad losers" for their postelection complaints.  These writers typically pointed out that such behavior was poor  form and bad--even dangerous--politics. Rudolf Augstein, in a  30 May DER SPIEGEL commentary, called the SPD's attacks on the  FDP for backing Herzog "useless and unjustified" and recalled  that the CDU accepted a similar 1974 presidential loss more  gracefully. Similarly, Peter Gillies, writing in DIE WELT of 25  May, described the SPD's "gripes" as being "of depressing  mediocrity," and Eckhard Fuhr, in the 26 May FRANKFURTER  ALLGEMEINE, compared the party to a child who, having lost at a  game, blames the rules. Pointing out that such conduct also has  political consequences, Leggewie, in his 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG  commentary, noted that Scharping "has yet again lost a few  points" because of his "huffed" reaction to Herzog's win. In  DIE WELT of 26 May, Ulrich Rosenbaum remarked that Scharping's  attacks on the FDP, if overdone, could effectively eliminate any  coalition options involving both parties. Since Scharping had  already virtually ruled out a grand coalition with the CDU,  Rosenbaum argued, the SPD leader would be forcing himself into  a--politically very risky--coalition with the Greens. Looking  beyond the immediate consequences for party politics, several  writers warned that the SPD was undermining the legitimacy of  the presidency and the Federal Republic itself by criticizing  the result of a constitutional process as somehow undemocratic.  Eckhard Fuhr's commentary in the 26 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE,  for example, accused the SPD of trying to make "political  capital" at the expense of the Basic Law and federal  institutions by implying that Rau had been cheated out of the  presidency and by calling on voters to exact revenge in the 12  June European Parliament vote. Several other writers also  complained about this campaign strategy, which included a poster  with the line, "You Will Decide This  Election." Juergen Busche summed up press opinion on the SPD's  tactics in the 24 May SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG when he wrote that  "this is the way one stirs up public mistrust of the  institutions of a democratic state."  <H5>  Direct Election Rejected </H5>   Most commentators also rejected SPD suggestions on their  merits that direct election of the president might be preferable  to the existing system, which entrusts the vote to a Federal  Assembly reflecting the distribution of power in the Bundestag.  Some writers simply expressed a desire to leave well enough  alone and a fear of tinkering with tested institutions.  Augstein, for example, wrote in his 30 May DER SPIEGEL  commentary that the Basic Law "does not want a president who  depends on the will of the people," and that the document "has  proven its worth." Gillies, in his 25 May DIE WELT column,  similarly maintained that "the fathers of the Basic Law based  the election of the federal president on the principles of  democracy, rather than those of public opinion polling, for good  reason," though he failed to explain what the reason might be.  Other commentators--including Busche in the 24 May SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG, Fuhr in the 26 May FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, and Rainer  Nahrendorf in the 25 May HANDELSBLATT--expressed concern that  direct election would destroy the suprapolitical, unifying role  of the president by making him beholden to particular interests,  or lead inevitably to an undesirable expansion of the office's  powers. Leggewie's 25 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG commentary, for  example, worried that such a presidency would be too vulnerable  to waves of extremist popular opinion and too powerful if an  ideologue ever reached office.  <H5>  Role of Parties Criticized </H5>   Despite this general rejection of a constitutional shift to  direct presidential elections, press commentary reflected  widespread dissatisfaction with the dominant role of party  politics in Herzog's election. FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU  commentator Astrid Hoelscher, for example, described the vote in  that paper's 24 May issue as "remote from the people"  [volksfern] and maintained that Herzog had been elected due only  to "the strength of his party, and not his persuasive power as  an individual." A 24 May DIE TAGESZEITUNG commentary criticized  the "automatism" of assembly delegates who voted with their  party rather than their conscience, and Perger, in the 27 May  DIE ZEIT, complained that "the presidential election was  turned...into a kind of chancellorship election," where  delegates were really voting for Scharping or Kohl as party  leaders, rather than for Rau or Herzog as individuals. Perhaps  the best summation of the lingering dissatisfaction with the  election came from Busche's commentary in the 24 May  SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, which argued that the delegates'  party-line voting was a violation, not only of the spirit of the  Basic Law, but also of the public trust. "There is no reason,"  Busche concluded, "for the parties now to turn in satisfaction  to their agenda of the day. Even if the demand for direct  elections was ill-considered, the criticism of the parties is  not."</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Erich Honecker: hardline keeper of the Berlin Wall Erich Honecker, who personified the intransigence of communism during the 1980s, died yesterday of cancer in the Chilean capital, Santiago, his home since January 1993. He was 81. The former East German leader, who started life as a roofer and spent years in prison as an opponent of Nazi Germany, left for exile after the collapse of his trial in which he was charged with responsibility for the death of 13 East Germans on the border with West Germany. His orders for border guards to shoot at escapees, which resulted in 190 deaths, had led to a warrant for his arrest in November 1990 after German unification. German television brought almost hourly updates during the court case and even boarded the aircraft that took him to Santiago after judges in Berlin ruled he was too ill with liver cancer to stand trial. By then pale and wizened, fascination with the man, seen by many as the East German Politburo member responsible for the building of the Berlin Wall, only faded after he had retired to his daughter's house halfway around the globe. He was born a miner's son in the Saarland, Germany's southwestern state. Both his parents were members of the Communist party and the young Honecker distributed party pamphlets at the age of eight and joined the Young Spartacus Union, a children's communist organisation, aged 10. He went on to join the Communist party in 1929, studied in Moscow, and worked under various aliases to expand the party in Germany. In 1935 he was arrested by the Gestapo charged with high treason and sentenced to 10 years in prison. It was Walter Ulbricht, East Germany's first Communist party leader, who brought Honecker into the central committee after the second world war. He earned Ulbricht's trust as leader of the Free German Youth (FDJ), the party's youth wing, during a campaign led by Honecker to destroy all television aerials which were being used to receive West German television. Long Ulbricht's 'crown prince,' he was given responsibility in the ruling politburo for military and state security. The top job fell to him in May 1971 after Ulbricht resisted Moscow's efforts to reach an accord with West Germany. Few East Germans expected much from the stern-faced Honecker who had a reputation for orthodoxy and was a notoriously bad speaker. However the early Honecker years, until about 1975, were seen in retrospect by many East Germans as the country's most prosperous. With prompting from Moscow, relations between the two Germanies were allowed to improve as Willy Brandt, West Germany's Social Democratic chancellor, sought to improve ties between Bonn and Berlin. In this respect Honecker played a crucial role. Western politicians and businessmen beat a path to his door. A Sunday afternoon meeting in 1973 over cakes and coffee with the late Herbert Wehner, Social Democratic whip in the Bonn parliament, led to a series of high-level meetings with West German leaders. This two-track policy of strict domestic delimitation from West Germany while courting the West German political and financial elite was crowned by the visit to East Germany in December 1981 by Mr Helmut Schmidt, then West German Chancellor. But Honecker was pulled between the West German need for detente and the Soviet need for legitimising a separate East German national state. Honecker's desperately poor childhood coloured his outlook on life. On inspection tours of cramped new East German housing estates he would remark that workers under the Kaiser could never have dreamed of such superb living conditions. He failed to realise that East German workers did not compare their lot with that of their grandfathers but instead with West German workers whose flats were larger and equipped with more modern appliances. Throughout the mid-1980s Honecker had longed to crown his political career with a visit to Bonn. Yet, in 1983 and 1984, as Moscow moved from one geriatric Communist party leader to another, he was prevented from visiting West Germany and it was only under the then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he was at last allowed to do so. However, Honecker, increasingly divorced from the reforms which were taking place in the former Soviet Union and Mr Gorbachev's refusal to intervene to protect the Communist parties of Eastern Europe against popular uprisings, in the end found himself up against the very Wall which was supposed to protect East Germany. Towards the end of 1989 the people of Leipzig and of East Berlin themselves demonstrated against the Wall and eventually breached it on the night of November 8. Honecker had failed to sense the shifting nature of power in Moscow and in the West. Moscow had dropped him.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Further, the Department finds itself involved in longstanding litigation for which equitable resolution frequently requires the delivery of housing assistance in order to achieve fair, reasonable settlement. Expanding the ranging of the Headquarters Reserve will facilitate handling these unpredictable pressures for disaster relief and litigation settlements, as well as for emergencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Precisely because the incidence of these types of housing assistance funding are unpredictable, the availability of readier resources through an increased Reserve is one which HUD will only call upon as needed. That is, although a greater amount of budget authority will be made available under this interim rule than is the case under the current regulation, this does not mean that HUD will use the full statutory maximum in this year or any year. The draw upon the Reserve will be carefully tempered to exigencies and real, immediate need.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD notes that the basis upon which the five percent can be calculated does not include the section 202 program of supportive housing for the elderly. Section 801(b) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) removed the section 202 program from coverage under section 213(d). However, NAHA did not repeal a previous amendment to section 213(d)(1)(A)(i) made by section 101 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989. This amendment requires that section 202 assistance be allocated in a manner that ensures that awards of that assistance are made for projects of sufficient size to accommodate facilities with supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail elderly residents. Moreover, the Department has elected to continue the fair sharing of section 202 housing assistance in order to promote fair and balanced geographic diversity. (The fair sharing formula for section 202 assistance is specifically tailored at &sect;791.402(c)(1) to reflect relevant characteristics of the elderly population.) Notwithstanding this retention of section 202 allocations in part 791, the statutory range for calculation of the five percent Headquarters Reserve is now effectively limited to programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937 which are covered by section 213(d). Therefore, the revision to &sect;791.407 under this interim rule limits_for calculation purposes_the Reserve to five percent under those 1937 Act programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Other Matters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed and approved this interim rule, and in so doing certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The interim rule revises existing procedures for the allocation of housing assistance funds and for local government and HUD review of applications for housing assistance, but will make no change in the economic impact of these procedures on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(k) of the HUD regulations, the policies and procedures contained in this interim rule relate only to internal administrative procedures whose content does not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of project areas or building sites, and therefore, are categorically excluded from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

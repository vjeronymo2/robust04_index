			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Split capital restructuring at Jos JOS HOLDINGS, which is managed by Kleinwort Benson Investment Management, is proposing to restructure into a split capital investment trust. The ordinary shares will be replaced by equal proportions of three classes of shares - zero dividend, income and capital. Shareholders will be entitled to one of each class for every 250p of net assets attributable to their ordinary shares. The trust will last until January 31 2003. At that point the zero dividend shares will rank before the others, and have a final capital entitlement of 249p. They will have no right to income. Kleinwort Benson calculates the gross redemption yield at 9.3 per cent. Income shares will be entitled to all the income from the trust, but qualify for a capital entitlement of only 1p per share. Maiden gross dividend will be 15.3 per cent, assuming an initial market value of 100p. Kleinwort Benson does not intend to change the investment philosophy of the underlying portfolio, which is to aim for income through investing in international equities, with a bias towards the UK. However, managers hope to achieve a slightly higher yield, of about 1.2 times that on the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. Mr Simon White, managing director of Kleinwort Benson Investment Management said: 'It fills a gap in our range. Income shares and zeros have enjoyed great popularity with both private and institutional investors, and Kleinwort Benson does not have a traditional split-capital trust with three share classes to satisfy this demand.' It is also hoped that demand for the new shares will reduce the discount to net asset value.</p>

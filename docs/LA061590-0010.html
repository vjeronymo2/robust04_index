			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FIELDER GETS ANOTHER GOOD PITCH TO DRIVE  </P> <P> Good hitters usually hit good pitches and Detroit's Cecil Fielder is proving to  be one of the best hitters in the majors.  </P> <P> Fielder continued to produce against Cleveland pitching as he hit a  tiebreaking, two-run homer in the fifth inning that gave the Tigers a 7-3  victory over the Indians at Detroit.  </P> <P> The homer, on a 1-1 count, came on a forkball from Sergio Valdez that broke  down and probably out of the strike zone.  </P> <P> "He hit a very good pitch," Cleveland Manager John McNamara said. "You talk to  other people for advice and we try to pitch him with a lot of care. But he's  hitting other people, too. That pitch might have been out of the strike zone.  He just goes down and gets it."  </P> <P> Fielder, who is 12 for 23 against Cleveland, broke a 3-3 tie with his major  league-leading 24th homer with two out and Tony Phillips on first with a walk.  He also leads the majors with 59 RBIs.  </P> <P> Fielder has five home runs -- three in one game -- and 11 RBIs in six games  against Cleveland.  </P> <P> Chicago 3, Oakland 2 -- The White Sox climbed to within a game of the  first-place Athletics in the West by beating Dave Stewart at Chicago.  </P> <P> The game was the first of the season between the teams with the best records in  the league. The Athletics are 39-20; the White Sox 37-20.  </P> <P> The White Sox have won six of their last seven and 14 of 19.  </P> <P> New York 3, Boston 1 -- Chuck Cary, who yielded six runs in two-thirds of an  inning Saturday, held the Red Sox to four hits and a run in seven innings at  New York.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 1-1, Jesse Barfield led of the seventh with a double, took  third on Mel Hall's groundout and scored on a wild pitch. The Yankees scored  another run on a single by Jim Leyritz and Bob Geren's double.  </P> <P> Toronto 7, Minnesota 1 -- Pat Borders hit a tiebreaking three-run homer in the  sixth inning at Minneapolis to help Dave Stieb win his fourth game in a row.  </P> <P> It was the Twins' seventh consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Stieb (9-2) yielded only five hits in seven innings.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 8, Baltimore 5 -- The Brewers blew a four-run lead, then defeated the  Orioles on Robin Yount's tiebreaking sacrifice fly in the seventh inning and a  ninth-inning single by Gary Sheffield, who also stole home.  </P> <P> Seattle 5, Texas 4 -- Jeffrey Leonard's two-out single capped a three-run ninth  inning as the Mariners rallied at Seattle.  </P></p>

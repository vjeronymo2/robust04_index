			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBC TESTS HIGH-DEFINITION SIGNAL  </P> <P> In a predawn test coinciding with the 50th anniversary of TV's debut at the New  York World's Fair, NBC on Thursday transmitted what it called the first  commercial broadcast of a high-definition TV signal in the United States.  </P> <P> Mike J. Sherlock, president of NBC Operations and Technical Services, said the  broadcast "is to television what Kitty Hawk was to flight." But it made no  difference in the picture that television viewers saw here.  </P> <P> That's because TV sets capable of receiving what NBC called the Advanced  Compatible Television Signal, which has double the 525 lines of conventional TV  sets, are several years away from production. Existing TV sets can receive the  high-tech signal but only display a standard picture.  </P> <P> The test transmissions were conducted by the David Sarnoff Research Center in  Princeton, N.J., which has been working on ways of improving TV-picture quality  for six years. The research has been funded with $60 million by a consortium  that includes NBC.  </P> <P> Sherlock said other developments in the ACTV system will be demonstrated on  April 29 at the National Assn. of Broadcasters' convention in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> High-definition television already is a reality in Japan, although only on a  limited basis, with the higher-quality HDTV signal beamed via satellite to a  relatively small number of homes equipped with special receivers.  </P> <P> Regular HDTV broadcasts are to begin in Japan next year, Sherlock said.

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE ;  </P> <P> A VOICE FROM CHILE'S PAST PLAYS KEY ROLE IN ITS FUTURE;  </P> <P> EDGARDO BOENINGER WAS ONE OF MANY EJECTED FROM NATIONAL LIFE WHEN SALVADOR  ALLENDE WAS OUSTED AND KILLED. NOW, HE HAS BRIDGED THE GAP OF TIME AND MILITARY  RULE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COUNTRY'S NEW DEMOCRACY.  </P> <P> The tall, slim man in the comfortable corner office on the ground floor of La  Moneda, Chile's historical government house, has materialized there like a time  traveler from long ago. His name, Edgardo Boeninger, has a familiar ring,  echoing the faded urgency of bygone newscasts, resounding with the drama of  past struggles for power.  </P> <P> Seventeen years have passed since a military coup interrupted Chilean  democracy, ejecting Boeninger and others from the nucleus of national life.  Now, many have returned to the thick of things; their names reign once more in  the headlines as they wield the trappings of office.  </P> <P> Foremost among them, of course, is Patricio Aylwin, chairman of the Christian  Democratic Party at the time of the 1973 coup and now Chile's elected civilian  president. Then there are former congressmen, former ministers, longtime party  leaders and other figures from the past who are among the people Aylwin relies  on to help run the revived democracy.  </P> <P> By most accounts, the president relies on no one more than Boeninger, 65, whose  official title is "minister secretary general of the presidency." A kind of  right-hand man to Aylwin, he is a prime example of the political veteran who  has bridged the gap of time and military rule to assume a key position in the  new democratic order.  </P> <P> In fact, Boeninger played a major role in formulating the political strategy  that carried the country through a remarkably smooth transition from military  to civilian rule. In his ministerial position, he is a combination chief of  staff, strategist, trouble-shooter and mediator whose intellectual prowess is  sometimes said to make him indispensable to the president.  </P> <P> "There is no doubt in my mind that he is the closest adviser and the one the  president pays most attention to," said an opposition politician.  </P> <P> "Aylwin would not be viable without Boeninger," commented another politician  who has known both men for many years.  </P> <P> Chileans recall other, more turbulent times when Boeninger's formidable  political skills were in play. In 1973, before the coup, the chants of marching  youths and clouds of tear gas often rose over Santiago streets as rival  political parties contended for power at the University of Chile. Boeninger was  at the center of the fray as the university's elected rector.  </P> <P> With the support of conservative parties and center-straddling Christian  Democrats, he had won university elections three times in the previous four  years, defeating leftist forces that supported Chilean President Salvador  Allende, a socialist.  </P> <P> Asked in a recent interview if he was against the coup on Sept. 11, 1973,  Boeninger said he "shared the feeling that the situation had come to a point of  crisis beyond return" but favored another solution. "We were working on the  proposal that both the president and Parliament resign, to have elections all  over again, to start from scratch."  </P> <P> Although Boeninger was deeply involved in the political process at the time, he  did not belong to a party. After the coup, he joined the Christian Democrats,  just as the military junta, led by army Gen. Augusto Pinochet, banned all  parties.  </P> <P> "I was the last man to be admitted into a political party," Boeninger recalled.  "I requested the president of the party at the time, which precisely was  Patricio Aylwin, to admit me into the party. . . . It was my way of protesting  the shutting down of the political system by the military."  </P> <P> When the new regime intervened in the university administration, Boeninger  resigned his post as rector, abruptly ending that phase of his career in public  service.  </P> <P> Like a number of prominent Chileans, Boeninger comes from German stock. His  father, a white-collar worker, immigrated to Chile from Germany after World War  I, and his mother was also of German descent.  </P> <P> Boeninger attended some of Santiago's best secondary schools, then earned a  degree in civil engineering at the Catholic University of Chile. He taught  calculus and analytical geometry at the Catholic University School of  Engineering for two years before serving for a decade as Santiago's first  traffic engineer.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he completed a degree in business and economics at the University of  Chile, where he became dean of economics in 1959. Under President Eduardo Frei,  from 1964 to 1969, Boeninger was the national budget director. He was elected  rector of the University of Chile in 1969.  </P> <P> After the 1973 coup, he worked as a consultant to international organizations  such as the United Nations and the World Bank. In 1975, he spent half a year at  UCLA teaching a seminar and studying political science.  </P> <P> He continued to study social sciences at private Chilean research institutions,  "trying to sort of bring together economic thinking and political thinking," he  said. "And that got me gradually involved in, first of all, bridging the gap of  people who had been on different sides of the fence in the previous political  conflicts."  </P> <P> As a Christian Democrat, Boeninger formed a close association with Patricio  Aylwin and became a party vice president in 1987. Boeninger is often credited  with devising the formula for an intricate alliance between the Christian  Democrats and other parties, including the socialists, that won the elections  last October.  </P> <P> Using a favorite engineering metaphor, he told The Times that his earlier work  in think tanks with both leftists and conservatives had helped prepare him for  his political role.  </P> <P> "I had helped build the initial bridges, so it was easy for me to make a  contribution in doing this same bridge-building thing now in the political  field," he said.  </P> <P> Genaro Arriagada, a vice president of the Christian Democratic Party, said it  was also Boeninger's strategy that won struggles within the party and within  the electoral alliance to give Aylwin the nomination.  </P> <P> "The mastermind of that was Boeninger," said Arriagada. As a result, he said,  Boeninger took his pick of posts in the administration that began March 11.  </P> <P> "He is perhaps the only Aylwin minister who could choose for himself where he  would be," Arriagada said.  </P> <P> He called Boeninger "profoundly analytical, rational" and "morally impeccable,"  capable of resisting pressure but bent on avoiding conflicts that could  jeopardize the democratic process.  </P> <P> Miguel Otero, a vice president of the conservative National Renovation Party,  described Boeninger as "muy simpatico," but calculatedly so.  </P> <P> "Boeninger never loses his calm, never," Otero said. "He knows exactly where he  is going and how, and he uses all of the charm in his power to get there."  </P> <P> Boeninger said an important part of his job is to mediate between parties and  the government, between the Congress and the government and between ministries  within the government. On a bookshelf, within his reach as he spoke in his La  Moneda office, was a book entitled "The Resolution of Conflict."  </P> <P> Boeninger is a voluminous reader. "I read all sorts of novels," he said. Once  he favored authors of Latin America's literary "boom" generation of the 1960s,  such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but lately he has been exploring Japanese and  Egyptian literature, he said.  </P> <P> He also relaxes with jogging and Ping-Pong. "I'm fond of the theater, I'm fond  of the movies, I like to dance," he added. "I've never been bored in my life.  Too many things interest me."  </P> <P> He and his wife, Marta, have been married 22 years. He has two grown children  from a previous marriage and she has four.  </P> <P> Boeninger makes a distinction between his political and private lives. "His  house is not the politician's house where everyone comes," said Christian  Democrat Arriagada. "His friends come, and that's it."  </P> <P> What Boeninger does most, however, is work, according to those who know him. He  is capable, according to the newsmagazine Hoy, "of working until 2 in the  morning and returning to work at 8 a.m. with a memo ready containing a proposal  for solving the problem under discussion."  </P> <P> A major problem faced by the administration Boeninger serves is what to do  about human rights violations that took place under Pinochet's military  government. Many Chileans want punishment for violators, but others, including  Pinochet, oppose it.  </P> <P> "The issue of human rights is the only one in which you cannot expect to reach  a consensus," Boeninger said. "What you can do is ride a narrow path to finally  get to what I call the grudging acceptance of all the parties involved.  </P> <P> "What does that really mean? That the expectations of punishment for violators  of human rights will be limited. . . ."  </P> <P> He said Chileans will have to accept a small number of human rights trials for  crimes that took place after 1978. Violations before that are pardoned by an  amnesty, decreed under Pinochet's regime.  </P> <P> "We will not try to change the amnesty law," Boeninger said. "We think that  would produce a conflict hardly manageable."  </P> <P> Boeninger predicted that the armed forces will not interfere with the  government's overriding goal of consolidating democracy.  </P> <P> "I don't think that the authoritarian temptation is any risk now in this  country," he said. "I don't think that anyone believes that there could be a  regression to any kind of authoritarian regime."  </P> <P> When the current four-year term is over, Boeninger will end his public service  career and do some writing, he said. "I plan to try to write my vision of the  events of Chile from 1973 to 1993."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Biography  </P> <P> Name: Edgardo Boeninger  </P> <P> Title: Minister secretary general of the presidency.

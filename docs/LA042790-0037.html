			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Steichen Heirs vs. Museum: The heirs of photography pioneer Edward Steichen,  longtime benefactors to New York's Museum of Modern Art, are battling the  museum over an $800,000 Henri Matisse painting that was bequeathed to the  photographer's 6-year-old great-granddaughter.  </P> <P> The painting was loaned to the museum in 1973 by Steichen's youngest daughter,  Kate. But although she left it in her will to her grandniece, museum officials  are refusing to give it back, saying it was meant as a permanent gift. The  painting has been in the photography pioneer's family since Matisse gave it to  him in 1908. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

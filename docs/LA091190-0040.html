			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: OF WOMEN AND ONE-LINERS -- A TREACHEROUS MIXTURE  </P> <P> It is hard for a man, especially one of my generation, to say anything about  women, however generous of intent, without being accused of sexism.  </P> <P> For my recent selection of excerpts from "An Uncommon Scold," a collection of  witticisms by women, which I prefaced by saying that I considered women wittier  than men and preferred their conversation, I am scolded by Chris Marchese, 19,  of Northridge.  </P> <P> She says she was "particularly irritated" by my implication that women's minds  "are on one thing only -- their existence in relationship to men. I have no  doubt that, if you had been quoting 'witty' remarks made by males, you would  have included such topics as sports, politics, art, religion, etc. Females,  however, seem to be confined to the trivial realms of gossip, housekeeping,  'love,' marriage and their husbands' fidelity. . . . None of these topics are  of supreme relevance to my life. . . ."  </P> <P> Perhaps women are funnier when they are lashing out at subjects related to men  and other oppressive aspects of their lives. I thumbed back through the book,  which was compiled by Abby Adams, a New York writer, to see what they had to  say on other subjects.  </P> <P> On America: "In the United States there is more space where nobody is than  where anybody is. That is what makes America what it is." -- Gertrude Stein.  "Europeans used to say Americans were puritanical. Then they discovered that we  were not puritans. So now they say we are obsessed with sex." -- Mary McCarthy.  (Hard to get away from sex.)  </P> <P> Art: "If Michelangelo painted in Caesars Palace, would that make it any less  art?" -- Cher. "Why should I paint dead fish, onions and beer glasses? Girls  are so much prettier." -- Marie Lurencin.  </P> <P> Beauty? No, that's suspect. Children? Too close to home. Conception? No, no.  Culture? All right. "One old lady who wants her head lifted wouldn't be so bad,  but you multiply her 250,000 times and what you get is a book club." --  Flannery O'Connor. "Culture is an instrument wielded by professors to  manufacture professors, who when their turn comes, will manufacture  professors." -- Simone Weil.  </P> <P> Dependence? Nope. Divorce? No way. What about Education? "A good education is  usually harmful to a dancer. A good calf is better than a good head." -- Agnes  De Mille. "Lack of education is an extraordinary handicap when one is being  offensive." -- Josephine Tey.  </P> <P> The Family? No. Fashion? No. Let's try History. "Real solemn history, I cannot  be interested in. . . . The quarrels of Popes and kings, with wars or  pestilence in every page, the men all so good for nothing, and hardly any women  at all." -- Jane Austen.  </P> <P> Housework? Out-of-bounds. Husbands? Same. Infatuation? No. Infidelity? Heavens  no. Injustice? "When one has been threatened with a great injustice, one  accepts a smaller as a favour." -- Jane Carlyle.  </P> <P> Literature: "Some say life is the thing, but I prefer reading." -- Ruth  Rendell. "The one thing I regret is that I will never have time to read all the  books I want to read." -- Francoise Sagan. "I am reading Henry James . . . and  feel myself as one entombed in a block of smooth amber." -- Virginia Woolf.  "Henry James chews more than he bites off." -- Mrs. Henry Adams. (OK. Those  last two are witty.)  </P> <P> Love? Out of-bounds. Marriage? Taboo. Men? Not this trip. Men and Women? Same  objection. What about Music? "Nobody really sings in an opera. They just make  loud noises." -- Amelita Galli-Curci. "I can hold a note as long as the Chase  National Bank." -- Ethel Merman.  </P> <P> The Penis? Perish the thought! Philosophy? Let's try it: "I believe that people  would be alive today if there were a death penalty." -- Nancy Reagan. "You can  never be too rich or too thin." -- The Duchess of Windsor.  </P> <P> Now, politics: "There's never been a good government." -- Emma Goldman. "It is  far easier to act under conditions of tyranny than to think." -- Hannah Arendt.  "Nonviolence is a flop. The only bigger flop is violence." -- Joan Baez.  "Congress -- these, for the most part, illiterate hacks whose fancy vests are  spotted with gravy and whose speeches, hypocritical, unctuous, and slovenly,  are spotted along with the gravy of political patronage." -- Mary McCarthy.  "One of the things that politics has taught me is that men are not a reasoned  or reasonable sex." -- Margaret Thatcher.  </P> <P> And Religion: "I read the book of Job last night -- I don't think God comes  well out of it." -- Virginia Woolf. "The Bible and the church have been the  greatest stumbling blocks in the way of women's emancipation." -- Elizabeth  Cady Stanton. "I always find that statistics are hard to swallow and impossible  to digest. The only one I can ever remember is that if all the people who go to  sleep in church were laid end to end they would be a lot more comfortable." --  Mrs. Robert A. Taft.  </P> <P> But I have no doubt that in culling these quotations I have somehow exposed yet  a deeper sexism.  </P></p>

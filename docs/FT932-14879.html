			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Engineering an efficient car With increasing environmental pressures on the motor car, engine makers are trying to improve the efficiency of the internal combustion engine while reducing emissions. Ricardo Consulting Engineers, the engine and transmission specialist, has developed a combustion system for engines which, it claims, reduces fuel consumption by up to 12 per cent while radically reducing the levels of waste oxides of nitrogen. The CCVS (combustion control by vortex stratification) system recycles inert exhaust gases back into the system. Previously, exhaust gas recirculation resulted in an increase of emitted hydrocarbons and high fuel consumption. CCVS keeps the waste gases separate from the fuel and air mix, which means the air and fuel burn cleanly. Ricardo: UK, 0273 455611.</p>

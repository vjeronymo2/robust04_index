			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Tom Carr, a young artist based in Barcelona, Spain, engineers large and small  architectural forms with blocks and strips of wood painted with lazy dribbles  of bluish-white or blue-black paint. Some of the works in Carr's first American  solo show are variations on a stairway theme. "Monument at Night," made (for  some inexplicable reason) of partially splintered and gouged wood, is a chunky  spiral of steps in which each tread diminishes in size and height as the  stairway descends. "Shell" has a relentless flight of tiny stairs curling  around an 11-foot-tall wooden matrix.  </P> <P> Other pieces, made during the artist's recent stay in Los Angeles, are open  forms -- like the floor piece, "Upside-Down Arch" and a nearly-12-foot-tall  walk-in construction called "Wall with Passageway," defined by a pair of lanky  arches and walls airily sketched in with two diamond-shaped arrangements of  wood strips. The most recalcitrant work, "Dream I," is a half-hearted arc that  pokes out from the wall, with little step-like notches dwindling into a skimpy,  ragged promontory. Mixed-media drawings of spirals extend Carr's vocabulary  into an ultra-purified, ultimately rather nebulous realm.  </P> <P> As far as the three-dimensional pieces are concerned, any specific romantic  association the viewer might want to make with monuments or moonlight or the  stuff of dreams is counteracted by the repetitive coloristic and painterly  treatment of the surfaces. And yet the studiously careless way the paint is  applied gives the pieces a curiously wistful quality. The idea is, perhaps,  that -- much as we want to do so -- it is no longer possible to believe  seriously in the fancifully metaphoric side of architectural form. (Jan Baum  Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., to March 31.)CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

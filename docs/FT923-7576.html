			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Taiwan's foreign reserves at record TAIWAN'S foreign currency reserves, the largest in the world, surged to a record Dollars 86.6bn (Pounds 45.3bn) at the end of June, Reuter reports from Taipei. The reserves rose from their previous record of Dollars 84.6bn in May and Dollars 72.2bn in June 1991, the central bank reported. It attributed the rise mainly to recent appreciation of the D-Mark and yen against the dollar, which inflates the value of the reserves when expressed in dollars. Taiwan holds about 55 per cent of the reserves in the form of securities issued by foreign governments and institutions, and the rest as bank deposits. It was the biggest Asian buyer of US government securities in the first quarter of 1992. The reserves have drawn fire from the US, which runs a trade deficit with Taiwan.</p>

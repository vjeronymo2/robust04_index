			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: And finally to Scotland . . . Sir, I realise that your omission of Scottish schools from your Top 1,000 schools ('Britain's (sic) state schools have been gaining ground academically . . .', October 30/31) was probably because many of them offer Highers rather than A-levels, though fortunately most British universities seem able to calculate equivalencies. But not to mention that you had excluded 10 per cent of the population from your survey looks very like the 'And finally to Scotland . . .' syndrome - the felicitous phrase that can be heard nearly every morning on the Radio 4 weather forecasts. I am, however, grateful for your omission. We moved from Oxford last year. Had you included Scottish data I would have wasted part of my weekend trying to work out how much of any difference in score between Bearsden Academy, Glasgow, and the Cherwell School, Oxford, was due to the schools themselves or to some difference in, for example, the ability of the academics' children in the respective cities. Might I ask when you propose to publish a similar ranking of the Top 1,000 UK companies based on a single output measure? Profits per employee would do nicely. This would provide a strong incentive for firms to liquidate all non-capital-intensive activities. Never mind that this would distort industrial output and diminish our national economic welfare. At least we would all think we knew which were our best companies. Arthur Francis, 20 Queensborough Gardens, Glasgow G12 9PP</p>

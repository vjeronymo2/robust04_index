			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: The U.S. Administration's decision to  keep Syria on the list of countries accused of not combating  drugs leads us to question the purpose behind this decision in  terms of the peace process and the United States' role in it.  We are not worried about aid that could be withheld because of  such a decision or by the drug list itself or any other similar  lists. What is important is who and what is behind this  decision.    The U.S. press a few days ago explained who is behind the  decision when it revealed that certain named elements rejected a  recommendation by a competent body within the U.S. Department of  State to lift Syria's name from the drug list and insisted on  keeping it. These elements are well known for their loyalties  and bias toward the other non-Arab party in the Arab-Zionist  conflict. Their stands have often obstructed the peace process  to serve the Israeli party.    The fact that these elements are behind this decision,  indicates that the issue is not an issue of drugs or Syrian  efforts to put an end to the production and distribution of such  a blight. Indeed, it is a means to exert pressure on Syria to  influence its stands. But Syria's stand cannot be bargained  over in terms of a comprehensive and just peace in the region or  the legitimate bases on which this peace should be founded. If  the concern of those elements was really to combat the blight of  drugs, then this concern would have been compatible with Syria's  concern. Moreover, fairness would have prompted them to admit  the fact sensed by every citizen in Syria and Lebanon, and even  by every honest observer, that Syria has exerted serious efforts  and enacted deterrent legislations aimed at uprooting this  blight -- in terms of production, distribution, and addiction.    However, was real the motive of those who have insisted on  keeping Syria on their list to expose Syria's stand on combating  drugs or to undermine Syria's stands on the issue of a just and  comprehensive peace? The answer is clear by defining who is and  what is behind that decision. We, in Syria, did not and will  not pay heed to this list or other similar lists. We will  persevere in our efforts and sustain our stands toward uprooting  the blight of aggression and occupation from our occupied  territories just as much as we are seeking to uproot the blight  of drugs. This is in order to have security, stability, peace,  and tranquility prevail in this region and to provide all  necessary conditions conducive to unleashing the potential of  the sons of this Arab region.    As for the U.S. Administration, which has, on the issue of  this list, adopted the stand of those elements well known for  obstructing the Middle East peace process, we deem it our right  to ask: If unfairness on such an obvious issue as combating  drugs has reached this point, then how can one trust that this  administration will be a fair, unbiased, and honest partner on  issues that deal with the fate of the region as faced in the  peace process?</p>

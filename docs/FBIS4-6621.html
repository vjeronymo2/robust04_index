			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Replacements for the posts  of foreign minister and chief cabinet secretary, to be vacated  by Tsutomu Hata and Masayoshi Takemura, will be the focal point  of the new cabinet which will emerge after Hata is formally  elected prime minister on Monday [25 April], coalition sources  said Friday.    The coalition parties began negotiations over formation of a  new cabinet Friday after the seven coalition blocs endorsed  Hata, head of the alliance's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal  Party), as their joint candidate for the upcoming Diet election  to select a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, who declared his resignation on April 8.    Hata is expected to be elected prime minister with the  coalition majority's backing in vote-taking plenary sessions of  the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors.    Only minor changes, however, will be made in the  20-portfolio  lineup, chiefly focusing on the posts of foreign minister and  chief cabinet secretary, because of the need to move on the  overdue fiscal 1994 state budget drawn up by the present  government which is still pending enactment in the Diet, the  sources said.    Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive and lower house  lawmaker, has emerged as a likely choice to succeed Takemura,  along with Kozo Watanabe, Shinseito's deputy secretary general,  the sources said.    Hata hopes to pick the cabinet secretary, who serves as his  chief spokesman and chief of staff, from among his own party  members who know him well, they said.    As for the foreign ministerial post, Michihiko Kano, a lower  house legislator who recently defected from the primary  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to form a new party  called New Party Mirai (Future), and Motoo Shiina, an  independent international-minded House of Councillors member,  are being considered as possible replacements to Hata, the  sources said.    There are some within the coalition that expect Tomiichi  Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of  Japan -- SDPJ], the largest group in the coalition, to assume  the post of deputy premier currently held by Hata.    Murayama, however, is reacting with reluctance toward the  idea, while placing the priority on party business, the sources  said.    The SDP is the only coalition party whose chief does not  hold  a ministerial post in the present seven-party coalition.</p>

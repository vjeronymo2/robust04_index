Speaking to newsmen prior to his departure for Rome, Ciampi  said that in his conversation with Clinton, who will be going to  Moscow in a few days, the focus was on the Group of Seven summit  to be held this July in Naples where the world's leading  industrial countries will discuss Western economic aid to Russia  and the continuing dialogue with Moscow.    In this context, Ciampi confirmed that, in accordance with  precedent, although Russia is not a part of the G-7 club, its  head of state has been invited to the Naples gathering for a  joint meeting with the summit participants.    Asked by a journalist if he expected to still be the Italian  head of government in July, Ciampi said that the Naples summit  would be organized by whoever was the premier at the time. He  noted that it was he, as governor of the Bank of Italy, [who  was] to organize the celebrations marking the institution's  100th birthday, but that he had already left for the premier's  office by the time the anniversary rolled around. Continuity  was the watchword in such cases, he said. Institutions last  longer than the people who keep them running.    As to the NATO summit which wound up this morning, Ciampi  described it as having been "extremely positive." He said he  would not go so far as to use the word "historic," as that would  be up to historians to decide in some 30 or 40 years' time, but  that it was important in that it confirmed that NATO was an  instrument in evolution, and not tied to a particular moment  which, once passed, relegated it to the dustbin. Other seasons  lay before the alliance now that the era of the Cold War is over.    Furthermore, the summit of the sixteen alliance partners has  confirmed Europe's growing weight within NATO, the American  committment toward Europe and NATO's opening to the nations to  the east, he underscored with satisfaction.    Particularly gratifying to Italy was the fact that the NATO  partners outspokenly recognized for the first time, the ever  growing importance of the Mediterranean region with regard to  North-South relations, Ciampi said.    The Group of Seven could associate the Russia of Boris  Yeltsin with its politicial decisions, while retaining the  validity of the G-7-plus-one formula for the group's analysis of  economic matters. The was the upshot of some of the thinking  that Ciampi and Clinton did together today, according to  diplomatic sources here. There was also talk of issuing  additional special drawing rights to bolster Russian reforms,  the sources said.    Italy currently holds the G-7 duty presidency and  preparations for the July summit in Naples were brought up  during the consultations which, besides Ciampi and Clinton, also  included Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta and U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Both sides were found to  be deeply in sync on strategic matters.    Ciampi and Clinton reconfirmed the political value of the  current G-7 format which, since 1991, includes talks with the  top Kremlin leader right after the final summit session, but  they now envisage the possibility of opening up the political  discussions to include Russia.    As if to underscore the cordiality of the American-Italian  encounter today, it was noted that Clinton will report back to  Ciampi telephonically as soon as he has concluded his trips to  Prague, Kiev, Moscow, Minsk and Geneva. The call will be placed  on January 17 and the briefing will also serve to prepare for  the G-7 summit this summer, the sources said.</p>

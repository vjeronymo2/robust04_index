			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Privatization Program (PND) Executive  Committee yesterday set a new date for the Embraer [Brazilian  Aeronautics Company] privatization auction: 20 May. As the  final adjustments before the sale were only approved by the  government last week, the PND Executive Committee only managed  to establish the method and the minimum price for the state-run  company during yesterday's meeting. The auction had initially  been scheduled for 24 March. The PND Executive Committee thus  hopes to have enough time to release the privatization's  resolution.    The auction will be held at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange  (Bovespa), where 60 percent of Embraer's capital will be  auctioned for about $200 million. The privatization will be  completed if 85 percent of the stock offered, involving 51  percent of the company's capital, is sold. The Federal  Government (Aeronautics Ministry) will retain 20 percent of the  stock, employees will be entitled to 10 percent, and the rest  will be sold to the public. The recommendation of the PND  Executive Committee, which must be approved by President Itamar  Franco, does not require payment in currency and does not  exclude the participation of foreign capital.    The PND Executive Committee's proposal contemplates for the  first time in the privatization program the pre-selection of  bidders by the Aeronautics Ministry, which will also be entitled  to golden shares [preceding two words in English] (special  stock) that carry the right to veto issues described as  strategic -- like corporate changes, changes in and the drawing  up of military programs, and transfers in the control of  majority stock. PND Executive Committee Chairman Andre Franco  Montoro Filho said these rules have been established because  Embraer is a strategic aviation company.    Montoro Filho reported that the value of the company is  estimated at $510.3 million, plus $215 million in debts that  must be accepted by the future majority stock holders. Thus,  the state-run company's minimum price has dropped to $295.3  million. Montoro Filho added that the capital will be increased  by $30 million, but the federal government will not underwrite  the stock. Buyers will also have to commit themselves to  purchase this stock because the auction will take place during  the stock subscription period.</p>

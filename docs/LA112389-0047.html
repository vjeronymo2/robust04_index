			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> NO ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY REQUIRED FOR MOBIL PROJECT  </P> <P> Mobil Oil Corp. will be allowed to build a new, high-tech control room for its  Torrance refinery without completing an environmental impact report, Torrance  City Council members decided Tuesday.  </P> <P> City planners had recommended that Mobil be required to conduct the  environmental study to give the city a broader overview of the company's plans  to modernize and refurbish the refinery.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously to reject the staff recommendation, noting that  planners failed to provide any legal justification for forcing Mobil to  complete the report.  </P> <P> Council members, however, warned Mobil that they plan to keep a close eye on  future developments at the refinery.  </P> <P> "I share with you very publicly my frustration . . . that we don't have the  broad picture," Councilwoman Dee Hardison said, expressing concern that a  series of planned improvements could increase the refinery's capacity.  </P> <P> Mobil plans to break ground on the 21,000-square-foot control room and a  2,800-square-foot remote instrument enclosure early next month, refinery  Manager Wyman Robb said in an interview.  </P> <P> The new buildings and modern computer facilities will replace the refinery's  existing 19,000-square-foot control room, which was built in 1967 and has been  partially refurbished.  </P> <P> Much of the refinery's existing controls are analog gauges, which require  operators to constantly make fine adjustments in the refinery's processes. The  new digital control devices will let computers make such adjustments  automatically, allowing operators to maintain broader control of the refinery.  </P> <P> "This will not increase the capacity of the refinery one iota," said attorney  Dale Neal, who acted as Mobil's spokesman before the council. "It will take a  system that is outdated, quite frankly, and replace it with the state of the  art."  </P></p>

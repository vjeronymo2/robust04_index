			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris edges up but fails to regain 1,900 Activity on the continent was generally patchy yesterday. PARIS failed to regain the 1,900 level, lost on Wednesday, with the CAC-40 index finishing at 1,899.37, up 2.19, and a gain on the session low of 1,891. Turnover was FFr3.8bn. In spite of the modest recovery brokers remained unsettled and did not rule out a decline today, with chart analysts suggesting that the index could strike 1,850. Pinault-Printemps, down FFr33 at FFr906, was left trailing on news that it intended to sell a 6 per cent share stake to part-finance its purchase of a stake in FNAC, the book and record group. The price will be set on September 26, with the sale taking place between September 27 and September 29. Credit Lyonnais CI's, which are thinly traded, dipped FFr24 to FFr401 as the state controlled bank postponed the publication of first half results. Some reports suggested that the postponment was due to a disagreement with the government over details. Air Liquide went in the other direction with a gain of FFr6 to FFr718 as investors took positions ahead of the release of first half results which came after the close and showed a gain in profits of 8 per cent. FRANKFURT was generally quieter with turnover also falling back. In the official session the Dax index slipped 6.47 to 2,073.03. In Ibis afternoon trade the index settled at 2,072.81. Turnover was DM6bn. Merrill Lynch, in a technical analysis of the market, reported that the index now had 'more than a normal risk of a downside correction'. A preliminary decline to retest support at 1,960 was possible, it added, with implications for a further fall to the 1,750 level. MILAN was unnerved by the failure of the government and trades unions to reach an accord of pension reform at their first meeting yesterday, and the Comit index fell 7.21 or 1.1 per cent to 671.13. Mr Nicolo Braendli at Akros Sim in Milan said that the market had been expecting an agreement from the meeting. However, the government's failure to secure one raised worries that any subsequent accommodation would not lead to the necessary structural reform of public finances. Fiat fell L51 to L6,643 and Olivetti was L14 lower at L2,013 ahead of first-half results after the market closed. Generali fell L221 to L39,663 and Toro was L499 lower at L27,021, ahead of six month figures late in the day. SAI was down L165 at L21,425 following news of improved interim figures. Mediobanca was L225 lower at L13,759, while BCI, which is expected to report lower first half figures next week, fell L51 to L3,969. Benetton dropped L999 or 4.5 per cent to L21,414 after the chairman was quoted as saying that while sales volumes had grown over 1993, turnover was little changed by value. ZURICH edged higher, supported by firmer bond futures and gains in selected blue chips. The SMI index rose 8.9 to 2,602.9, but was unable to hold up at the day's peak of 2,614.1. Gains in Roche's certificates, up SFr45 to SFr6,045, and UBS, SFr7 ahead at SFr1,197, helped to pull the market higher. Nestle gained SFr4 to SFr1,200. Swiss Re registered shares, strong gainers earlier this week, fell SFr3 to SFr563 on profit-taking as some investors switched into Winterthur, SFr11 higher at SFr645. AMSTERDAM held the 400 support level in a quiet session. The AEX index closed the day down 0.73 at 400.36. Unilever, off 20 cents at Fl 193.80, announced that it was to expand its operations in China. COPENHAGEN was in a holding pattern as investors took stock of the outcome of the general election. The KFX index was off 0.19 at 96.26. Turnover was concentrated in banks, which slid back from early highs to close mixed. Danske Bank put on DKr1 to DKr325. MADRID finished mixed with losses seen in high volume shares and the general index eased 0.33 to 294.46 in turnover of Pta23.6bn. Repsol lost 2.4 per cent to Pta3,740 with the losses attributed to speculation about the next public share offering in the state-owned oil company. ISTANBUL rose another 2.5 per cent after some late buying, triggered by portfolio switching towards companies with good nine month profit expectations. The composite index rose 853.69 to 25,196.20, for a three day rise of 10.6 per cent.

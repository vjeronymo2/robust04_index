			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / HK negotiations ruined by reform move, says China China said yesterday that the decision by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to proceed unilaterally with electoral reforms had ruined prospects for negotiations. Mr Patten told Hong Kong's Legislative Council that he could no longer wait for agreement after 17 rounds of talks in Beijing on his reform proposals and that he would put 'less contentious' parts of his plans to Legco on December 15. However, he said he had not broken off talks with Beijing. 'We're prepared to go on talking and our team will never be the one that walks away from the negotiating table, never,' he said. British officials said Beijing had not replied to a request for a round of talks on December 17 and 18. Mr Lu Ping, China's top official on Hong Kong, told reporters in Beijing that if Mr Patten tabled a reform bill, talks on the colony's future would be broken off. He said: 'If Britain puts its package to Legco, no matter if it is a complete package or a partial package, this will mean that Britain has unilaterally broken the talks.' This was the most specific warning yet from a senior Chinese official of the consequences of Mr Patten going ahead with reforms aimed at broadening the franchise for elections due in 1994 and 1995. Mr Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, informed his British counterpart, Mr Douglas Hurd, this week that Beijing would end the discussions if Mr Patten proceeded with his reforms in defiance of Beijing's strong objections. China will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. Mr Patten said there could be no further delay because the government had to begin drawing up electoral rolls and defining constituency boundaries. However, he insisted he remained open to negotiations. 'Any proposals we receive from the Chinese side we'd have to consider very carefully,' he said. The bill to be introduced on December 15 would reduce the voting age to 18 from 21, abolish government-appointed local councillors and introduce single-member legislative constituencies. More controversial elements of the governor's plans, including broadening the franchise for some seats in Legco in elections in 1995, would be set aside until next year. Mr Wu Jianmin, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, warned the collapse of the talks could affect business relations. His remarks mirrored similar observations earlier in the year by Chinese leaders, including Premier Li Peng. 'Economic relations are part of Sino-British relations,' Mr Wu said. 'They are affected because of the Hong Kong question.' China has previously retaliated economically against countries which displease it. The most recent example was a freeze placed on business with France last year after the French announced they were selling advanced Mirage fighter bombers to Taiwan. China last month squeezed Britain's GEC out of an underground railway deal in Guangzhou, the southern Chinese city. Beijing's intervention ensured the main contract went to Siemens of Germany, in spite of reports that local officials favoured GEC-Alsthom. Since the 17th round of Sino-British talks ended in stalemate in Beijing on Saturday, each side has blamed the other. China has accused Britain of being responsible for the 'failure', while British officials insist that China used the protracted talks in Beijing as a smokescreen for inaction. China has denounced Mr Patten's proposed reforms and has threatened to disregard elections held under the Patten formula. It says the reforms run counter to agreements reached in previous negotiations. However, Britain insists they do not violate either the 1984 Joint Declaration or the Basic Law, China's post-1997 constitution for Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosa Paz: "Gonzalez Calls on Socialists for Calm </F> in Face of Tension"]    [Text] Madrid -- Felipe Gonzalez acknowledged yesterday  that the Socialists are experiencing "a low, extremely  difficult, point," and tried to encourage the Spanish Socialist  Workers Party leaders and members to redouble their mobilization  effort for the 12 June European elections. He also asked them  to avoid increasing the social tension, which he said is being  "fueled by the Right." Gonzalez made these remarks at the  presentation of the Socialist list of candidates in the European  elections. The meeting was attended by a thousand officials of  his party, including the main leaders, but not Alfonso Guerra.  The organizers did not fill the Conference Center auditorium.    "We are experiencing an extremely difficult time, a very  delicate moment," Felipe Gonzalez asserted, "with considerable  social tension, fueled by the Right. And we must make an  enormous effort to mobilize all our members in order to explain  what the 12 June elections mean, and do so without creating  social tension; without falling into the dynamic of tension in  the face of tension."  <H5>  Stay in Touch </H5>   The prime minister therefore added that despite the  "personal  harassment" to which the Right is subjecting him, "we must not  become infected and must continue to convey calm and tolerant  conduct" despite "the anguish and embarrassment" the Socialists  feel at "some slippery conduct" and at having "placed trust in  some people who have abused it."    He emphasized that "calm is important" at this difficult  time, and announced: "I will stay calm and in touch with the  situation. I am sometimes tempted to respond angrily to many of  the things that are said, and could respond very toughly."  "Therefore," he added, "I prefer to maintain a clear commitment  to pursue the corruption cases -- those which exist and those  which may emerge -- and to try to implement economic recovery,  in order to continue the path of solidarity on which we have  embarked, so there will be no turning back in this historic  process which some people wish to stop."    He reiterated, as he did in Seville a week ago, that the  Socialists are prepared to transform Spain and to restore  international dignity to this country, "but we are not prepared  to endure scoundrels in our ranks. We could not imagine it."  And, on the other hand, he praised "the upright and honest  conduct" of thousands of Socialist officials who have made  possible Spain's transformation, which can be observed "by  noting our country's image."    Given this political and social situation--which he  acknowledged on several times--he warned the Socialists that  they have ahead of them "a great challenge, which will not be  easy, because we are experiencing a political situation of great  difficulty and an economic crisis which is beginning to be  overcome," although this is not yet perceived by the public. In  order to encourage them, he asserted that they have "the best  list for the European Parliament," considerable political  experience, both domestically and in helping to develop European  unity, and also a considerable responsibility to millions of  citizens who have trusted the Socialists and "made this party  the party which champions the values of freedom, equality, and  solidarity." These arguments led him to assert that "if the  electoral confrontation takes place on level ground, our success  is assured." Nevertheless, he expressed his fear that the  People's Party does not have that intention and is not  interested in a debate on European issues, because "it has very  little to offer, because they represent the negative tradition  of turning our backs on Europe."    These were not his only criticisms of the Right. For  instance, he also said that the Right "still has the same  attitude of alarmism" and of refusing to see achievement, and he  asserted that "they even refuse to acknowledge" the figures  showing the beginning of economic recovery. He also hinted that  the People's Party, which he at no point named, will try to  conduct a dirty campaign. He also pointed out that 12 June is  the ninth anniversary of the signing of Spain's treaty of  accession to the EC, and asserted: "If we acted like others,"  referring to the Right, "we would spend our time recalling who  accomplished this."</p>

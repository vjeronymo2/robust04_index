			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Bolivian dailies La Paz PRESENCIA and  Santa Cruz EL MUNDO of 29 January report that on 28 January  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Vice President Victor  Hugo Cardenas traveled to Camiri, in Santa Cruz Department, to  commemorate the 102d anniversary of the defeat of the Guarani  nation at the Battle of Kuruyuki. During the celebrations they  met with 4,000 Guaranis and responded to their demands for  education and territorial recognition.    The president, according to 29 January EL MUNDO, traveled  to Camiri with other high officials to launch his nationwide  Educational Reform Program and, by establishing the first  Guarani Educational Council, he legally recognized the Guarani  bilingual education program. Launched in 1992, this program  involves 30 schools and offers bilingual instruction to children  as well as adult literacy classes. It operates under the  auspices of UNICEF and other nongovernmental organizations such  as the Peasant Research and Promotion Center (CIPCA) and the  Social Investment Fund (FIS). It is estimated that over 5,000  people have taken advantage of the program so far. [La Paz  PRESENCIA "Reportajes" Section 23 Jan]    La Paz daily PRESENCIA of 29 February reports that during  the visit, Vice President Cardenas, Bolivia's first indigenous  vice president and a prominent advocate for indigenous rights,  declared that "the existence of slavery in the Bolivian Chaco is  a disgrace to all Bolivians," referring to the estimated 10,000  Guaranis living in indentured servitude on large estates in  Chuquisaca and Tarija Departments. There are also "free" Guarani  communities in Santa Cruz Department that maintain a tenuous  hold on their communal lands, as spotlighted in a 16 January  PRESENCIA special investigative report (LATIN AMERICA DAILY  REPORT 18 Feb).    Santa Cruz daily EL MUND0 of 29 January reports that in one  of the first steps to combat this situation, President Sanchez  de Losada officially announced a resolution that would make  bilingual education in what the press describes as "captive  areas" compulsory. Large landholders of Tarija and Chuquisaca  would be obligated to build schools on their estates for their  workers. The schools would come under the supervision of the  Secretariat of Education. The FIS, for its part, would give  special attention to the improvement and creation of educational  infrastructure for the Guaranis. Finally, the Guarani Higher  Institute for Bilingual Intercultural Education would be  established. According to the 22 January issue of PRESENCIA,  Maria Calvo, under secretary for ethnic affairs, said that the  extension and consolidation of bilingual education into  "captive" areas is one of the most important steps taken to  mobilize those Indian groups who remain in illegal servitude.  She acknowledged that this task will not be easy because of  opposition by landlords who have accused "literacy campaign  workers" of preparing "an armed revolution" and of "fomenting a  workers uprising," as reported by PRESENCIA "Reportajes" section  of 23 January.    Other reactions to PRESENCIA'S report on slavery in the  Chaco came from Human Rights Commission officials in the Chamber  of Deputies who resolved to take concerted action with  government and nongovernmental organizations to end these human  rights abuses, according to 22 January PRESENCIA. A few days  before the 28 January presidential visit to Camiri, Guarani  People's Assembly (APG) spokesman, Guido Chumiray, was reported  by the 24 January issue of PRESENCIA to have met with the  Secretary for Ethnic Affairs Ramiro Molina to review a list of  demands to be submitted to the president at that time. First on  his list, the paper said, was the "legal recognition of Guarani  territory" to halt the tide of confiscations, remedy unequal  land distribution, eliminate illegal servitude, and stem  migration to the cities. The list also called for the creation  of a Guarani Development Fund for the implementation of  agricultural projects in the Chaco among the "free" communities.  Projects would include irrigation systems, agricultural research  centers, credit for the purchase of machinery, the  rehabilitation of arable land, the purchase of livestock, and  marketing promotion. The secretary observed, according to the  daily, that the situation of slavery for thousands of Guaranis  in the Chaco is a decades-old problem and acknowledged their  "subhuman" living and working conditions as well as the  extermination and extinction of other Indian groups. He agreed  that current land legislation needed to be modified, but that it  should be done in coordination with other secretariats and  representatives of Indian groups. Following President Sanchez de  Lozada's visit to Camiri, PRESENCIA 29 January reported that  "with the official establishment of the [Guarani] Council, the  government partially acceded to APG demands on the subject of  education but maintained a discreet silence with respect to the  other demands submitted in La Paz."</p>

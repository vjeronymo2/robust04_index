As  a result, the assembly's plenary session opened one hour later  than scheduled.    Chairman of the assembly's council Vladimir Shumeyko  reported  that the delegations "could not achieve a consensus concerning  one of the items in the agenda," noting that he "would not want  to spread any information about the reasons for the  disagreement."    The representatives of the delegations from Armenia and  Azerbaijan had entirely opposite opinions concerning the  proposal. Therefore, the participants of the plenary meeting  decided to ask the delegation heads to converse with their  colleagues during the break and decide if it is worthwhile to  leave the blockade issue in the agenda for the assembly's  current session.    Shumeyko expressed his opinion that everybody understands  how  difficult it is to resolve such questions. He said the assembly  members had agreed to continue work on the blockade proposal and  introduce it during the assembly's next meeting.</p>

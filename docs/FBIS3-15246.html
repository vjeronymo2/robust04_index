The statement on the situation in the  Near East, which was distributed today by Russia's Foreign  Ministry, will probably also arouse various emotions. The tense  situation on the occupied Palestinian territories connected with  the crime in Hebron is prompting Russia to take active steps  towards a peaceful process. Mikhail Timurin, a staff member of  the Press and Information Department of the Russian Foreign  Ministry, read us the text of the statement over the telephone:    [Timurin] A tense situation persists on the occupied  Palestinian territories. The Foreign Minister of the Russian  Federation is keeping in constant touch with the Palestinian and  Israeli leadership.    On the personal instruction of the president of the Russian  Federation, First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivanov has been sent  to the Near East to meet with Chairman 'Arafat of the  Palestinian Liberation Organization and also with the leaders of  Israel. Russia believes it necessary for the UN Security  Council to adopt an effective resolution with a view to ensuring  security on the occupied territories. The idea of international  protection for the civilian population on the occupied  territories deserves most serious attention.    The stalling -- for the umpteenth time now -- of the Near  East talks shows that a new international impetus is needed for  the cause of the reconciliation between Arabs and Israelis to  proceed further. A second plenary meeting of the Madrid  conference on the Near East at the level of foreign ministers  could be this impetus.</p>

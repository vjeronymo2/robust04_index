			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 17 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk and  Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini have agreed that a working group  be formed to urgently address ways in which the Zulu monarchy  and kwaZulu Kingdom could be recognised and assured. After  three hours of talks in Pretoria, they said in a joint  communique the possibilities for this included constitutional  options and multiparty agreements. Other issues of a more  general nature would be discussed at multiparty negotiations  that have been arranged for this week, Mr De Klerk said.    The communique said the king had expressed his concern at  the  lack of recognition for the position of the Zulu monarchy and  kwaZulu in the transitional constitution. Mr De Klerk had  assured the king of his high consideration for the king, the  Zulu monarchy and the Kingdom of kwaZulu, and pointed out that  adequate provision could be made for the entrenchment of these  institutions in the envisaged provincial constitution. "He (Mr  De Klerk) committed himself to support these institutions as  strongly as he could," the joint statement said.    Mr De Klerk said he regretted the incidents of violence  which  surrounded the Zulu supporters' trek to Pretoria on Monday. He  sincerely hoped the guilty would be brought to book. Political  differences should be resolved democratically and not through  force, he said.    Police estimated 35,000 Zulu supporters went to the Union  Buildings in support of their king.    Mr De Klerk said he and his ministers had also consulted the  Zulu delegation, which included Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, on the framework for ending East  Rand violence. Mr Buthelezi would reply to the proposals on  Tuesday.    Mr Buthelezi said he also regretted the incidents of  violence  but the gathering at the Union Buildings had been voluntary and  the IFP had had nothing to do with the event. The IFP opposed  stayaways and it was not its policy to intimidate people.    On the participation of the Zulu people in the elections,  King Zwelithini said that depended on how the issues discussed  on Monday were handled. Mr Buthelezi added that the stance of  his party was reflected by the Freedom Alliance's position.    Mr De Klerk said the government was not totally opposed to  the double-ballot system, a major concern of the Zulu  delegation. The issue would be discussed at multiparty talks  this week.    The bilateral discussions with the Zulu kingdom would  necessarily have to be broadened to multilateral discussions if  they were to be fruitful, but that would not necessarily affect  the January 24 Freedom Alliance talks deadline, said Mr De  Klerk. However, the position of kwaZulu and the king had to be  addressed with a great sense of urgency and well before the  election.    Negotiations on outstanding points had become crucial and  the  government would approach them with a sense of urgency.  Government was committed to "try to really find solutions on a  multiparty basis which can ensure the inclusion of all  significant parties in the electoral process", Mr De Klerk said.</p>

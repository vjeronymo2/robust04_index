			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DESERT RACE AND TORTOISES  </P> <P> In your brief report on this year's Barstow-Las Vegas motorcycle race (Nov.  26), you quote a Bureau of Land Management spokesperson saying that BLM  officials went over the course before and after the race and found no desert  tortoises. The implications that no tortoises were harmed by the race is  completely misleading.  </P> <P> To begin with, tortoises are now hibernating in their burrows and a surface  sighting is very unlikely. Looking for tortoises crushed by off-road vehicles  would make sense at other times, but not now. The danger is that off-road  traffic has crushed burrow entrances, burying the endangered tortoises alive  and suffocating them.  </P> <P> Depending upon racing bikers to identify and avoid tortoise burrows in their  path, whether in a race or free play, is an absurd policy, or rather an absence  of policy.  </P> <P> CURTIS HORTON  </P> <P> Director, Desert Tortoise  </P> <P> Preserve Committee  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

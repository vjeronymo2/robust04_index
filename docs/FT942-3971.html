			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Right makes strong gains on Continent Conservative parties in Germany, Italy and Spain swept to victory in yesterday's European parliament elections, although the rightwing government's score in France was badly dented by strong support for anti-Maastricht dissidents. Across the 12 European Union nations that voted in the elections for the 567-member assembly yesterday and on June 9, rightwing gains on the Continent were offset by Labour's landslide win in the UK. As a result, the relative strengths of the parties in the enlarged Strasbourg assembly appear likely to be little changed compared with the old 518-seat parliament. In the eight countries that voted for the parliament yesterday, Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, emerged as the main victor, according to computer projections. These indicated an unexpected triumph for Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and a considerable setback for the opposition Social Democratic party, in what was virtually a dress rehearsal of Germany's general election in October. Computer projections on Germany's two main public television channels showed the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, gaining support in the European poll to almost 40 per cent, compared with 37.7 per cent in the previous poll five years ago. In contrast, the SPD, which was ahead in opinion polls until only weeks ago, looked set to suffer its worst result since the first direct elections to the European parliament in 1979. General solid support for Christian Democrat parties on the Continent hit socialist hopes of sweeping gains in the parliament in Strasbourg. According to projections early this morning, based on provisional results from all 12 EU nations, the Socialist group and likely allies at Strasbourg assembly will have 213 seats compared with 197 in the outgoing parliament. The Christian Democratic group and its allies will have 178 seats against the previous 162. Far-right parties did well in Italy and Belgium, while political fragmentation was evident above all in France, where both left and rightwing parties suffered from a sharp swing to two maverick groupings. France's anti-Maastricht Another Europe list, led by renegade conservative Mr Philippe de Villiers and Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French tycoon, won more than 12 per cent of the vote, according to Interior Ministry figures. The Radical Energy group led by Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial football boss, also took about 12 per cent, drawing away support from the opposition Socialist party, which saw its share fall to 15 per cent from 23.6 per cent in 1989. In Italy, computer projections indicated sharp gains for prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, projected to score more than 30 per cent, up 9 percentage points from the March general election. Italy's neo-fascist MSI-National Alliance achieved about 12.5 per cent, compared with 13.5 per cent in the March general election. Governing Christian Democrat parties achieved stronger than expected scores in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The party's resilient showing in those countries and in Germany may strengthen support for European integration among EU 'core' members. On the other hand, support for parties that oppose or are sceptical about Maastricht in France and Italy, two traditional supporters of European unity, underlined the confusion about the future of European co-operation. In Ireland, the Greens won their first European parliament seat and were poised to snatch a second, although the main victor was prime minister Albert Reynolds's Fianna Fail. The left suffered a drubbing in Spain, where the Socialist party of prime minister Felipe Gonzalez lost ground heavily to the opposition conservative Popular party. The Spanish Socialists' vote fell to its lowest point since they came to power in 1982. The governing centre-right PDS party of prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva was dealt a setback in Portugal, while Greece's governing Socialist Panhellenic Socialist Movement looked set to win that country's vote. In Belgium, the party of prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene looked set to remain the leading political group. Early results in Luxembourg's general election, which was also held yesterday, pointed to prime minister Jacques Santer's Social Christian party remaining the biggest in parliament.

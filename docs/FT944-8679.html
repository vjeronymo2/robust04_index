			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Disposal losses and poor UK trading leave ACT at Pounds 1m Poor trading in the UK together with a loss of Pounds 8.8m on the disposal of discontinued activities left ACT Group's interim pre-tax profits at Pounds 1m, compared with Pounds 11.5m. The City had, however, anticipated the decline after a profits warning in June. Strong underlying growth, principally in revenues and profits outside the UK, helped push the share price of the Birmingham-based computing services company up 5p to 103p. Operating profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 9.89m (Pounds 11.5m), including losses of Pounds 497,000 (Pounds 1.99m profits) from discontinued activities. Sales were Pounds 106.3m (Pounds 107.6m) of which Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 43.1m) related to discontinued businesses. After tax of Pounds 3.55m (Pounds 2.88m) losses per share were 1.41p, compared with earnings of 5.24p. Adjusting for the exceptional items earnings came out at 4.05p (4.41p). An unchanged interim dividend of 1.75p a share will be paid. The group had net cash of Pounds 8.87m at the end of the period, only slightly down on the Pounds 9.05m of 12 months previously. It intends to use some of these resources to buy back up to 10 per cent of its stock at prices which will enhance earnings. ACT has been increasingly focusing on its chosen role as a supplier of financial services software. Some 62 per cent of sales are now made abroad. In the first half, overseas profits rose to Pounds 10.3m from Pounds 5.95m, while UK profits fell to Pounds 960,000 (Pounds 4.6m). Mr Michael Hart, managing director, said the UK fall was the result of an extra Pounds 1.5m spent on research and development, a sharp decline in the market for several of the group's products including the Quasar portfolio management system and slow equities markets which had hit revenues at NMW, the stock processing bureau. Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said the group had shown resilience. He added that trading had improved and he anticipated a sound second half.</p>

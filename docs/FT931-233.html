			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / The sales campaign that remained a flight of fantasy: Philip Rawstorne on how Hoover's air travel promotion went horribly wrong HOOVER yesterday finally admitted that a sales promotion which offered free air travel was a complete disaster. The company's offer last year of two free return flights to the US and other holiday destinations for customers who spent Pounds 100 on its household appliances set off a commercial chain reaction. Thousands of shoppers bought washing machines, refrigerators, tumble dryers, but mostly vacuum cleaners to qualify for free trips across the Atlantic. Other businesses tried to cash in too. One enterprising carpet company offered customers spending Pounds 999 in its stores a free Hoover (plus the two free flights). Shops throughout the country quickly ran out of Hoover products. The company's Cambuslang factory was put on seven-day working in an attempt to cope with the demand. But newspaper small-ad columns began to fill with offers of unused, low-priced Hoover appliances which people had bought merely for the free flights offer. By the end of the year, Travel Weekly, the trade newspaper, estimated that buyers of more than 100,000 Hoover appliances were queueing up for free flights. Some within the travel industry had by then begun to doubt openly whether the promotion made commercial sense. On the evidence, they suggested, it was difficult to see how Hoover could avoid making anything but a heavy loss. Meanwhile, customers started encountering problems with the offer. Mr Alex Mills, a Glaswegian, and four relatives who had bought Hoover vacuum cleaners to get free flights to the Canary Islands, made their applications in September and had not received any reply three months later. Mr Reginald Goold of Cornwall got no reply to his application for flights to Philadelphia until a national newspaper took up his case. Complaints started to reach the Consumers' Association, the BBC's consumer programme Watchdog, and many newspapers. Increasing numbers of Hoover customers reported that the company was not responding to inquiries about their travel plans. There were allegations that Hoover was using the small print of its offer to rid itself of applicants. People who had gained the impression that they could travel when they liked between certain dates learned that flights were 'subject to availability' and, in the last resort, Hoover was legally able to specify the date, time and destination of the trips. The Consumers' Association said that people had been enticed by a clever marketing ploy and were not getting what they expected. Trading standards officers protested that the provision of information to the public by Hoover was 'terrible'. Hoover constantly refused to disclose how many people had applied for its offer or how many appliances had been sold. But as the public relations goodwill the promotion was designed to generate rapidly began to turn sour, Hoover set up a telephone helpline to cope with customers' inquiries. JSI Travel, the travel company appointed by Hoover for the promotion, admitted in December that there had been 'some chaos' but only 'because the offer has been far more popular than any of us anticipated'. It said: 'We have received 100,000 applications and expected no more than half that number.' By December, when Hoover had taken on two more travel companies to deal with the growing volume of applications, JSI said that only 900 applicants for European flights had made their trips. Hoover was reported last month to have bought almost 20,000 air tickets in an attempt to satisfy customers and defuse the controversy. According to Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, there is still a queue of 30,000 Hoover customers waiting for free flights. 'Thousands have already been disappointed and given up on the offer,' he said. A task force headed by Robert L. Chaplin, vice-president and controller of Maytag Corporation, and Richard Rankin, Hoover Europe's vice-president of marketing, will try to clear up the fiasco. The company estimates its additional costs for ending the once-promising but flawed promotional scheme will be Dollars 30m (Pounds 21.1m) or 28 cents a share - but it may have to pay a heavier price yet for the loss of goodwill.</p>

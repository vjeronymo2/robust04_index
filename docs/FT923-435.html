			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Figures lose their shape: Germany's economic powerhouse looks fragile at home When Germany went on holiday this summer, light was still flickering at the end of the economic tunnel. Now, after the European currency turmoil of the past month, the light seems to have gone out. Hopes built on a recovery in exports have been doused by the sharp appreciation of the D-Mark against the currencies of leading trading partners. With the fading of these hopes, the mood in industry has darkened, the green shoots of the 'blooming landscape' promised in the east have died, and the indecisive manoeuvring of the political leadership in Bonn has become overlaid by a mood akin to desperation. Buoyed by the tidal wave sweeping through currency markets, the D-Mark stands more than 4 per cent higher against a trade-weighted basket of European currencies than at the start of the year. It is 10 per cent up against sterling, 11 per cent higher against the lira. According to German economists, this shift has pushed Germany to the verge of recession - even though, according to the stern message of the Bundesbank, 'there can be no talk of recessionary trends'. Real gross domestic product, the independent central bank points out in its September report, was 'only'  1/2 per cent lower than in the relatively strong first quarter. However, it concedes: 'Uncertainty about the further course of business activity has undoubtedly increased.' This uncertainty was magnified in yesterday's report from the respected Ifo economics institute in Munich, which described a slump in west German industry's hopes for the coming six months, and amplified further in the stock markets. The report was a prime factor behind yesterday's 2.53 per cent drop in the Frankfurt DAX index. The broad range of manufacturers, distributors and building companies sampled monthly by Ifo said incoming orders had fallen again in August, inventories were building up and orders in hand were shrinking despite production cuts. 'Production plans for the coming months are tending increasingly towards reduction,' Ifo said. Instead of a second-half economic upswing, universally expected six months ago, west Germany now faces a period of further decline. Most of this year's overall growth, now expected to be less than 1 per cent, seems likely to stem from the freak surge recorded in the first quarter  - mainly attributable to unseasonably fine weather - which boosted the construction industry. All leading economic indicators have turned resolutely downwards since that false spring, when year-on-year GDP growth was 3.2 per cent. By the end of the second quarter the advance was down to 0.6 per cent. In the three months to the end of June, capital investment was 4 per cent lower than a year earlier. When the Ifo report of a fall in August's industrial order intake is officially confirmed, that will mark the sixth consecutive month of decline in west Germany. At the half-year mark, new foreign orders were more than 7 per cent lower than in 1991, and industrial output was down 3 per cent. Production in the capital goods industry, which accounts for about 50 per cent of all west German industrial sales, had fallen 4 per cent. The consequences for the labour market have included stagnating employment and a 10 per cent rise in the number of jobless. Bonn and Frankfurt are still digesting the impact of recent international monetary turbulence - and are waiting to see whether it will be followed by fresh upheavals. The D-Mark's parity against the French franc now looks reasonably secure after last week's strong and successful defence by the Bundesbank and Bank of France. But, in the wake of the Anglo-Italian decisions to suspend participation in the ERM, a further round of 'competitive devaluations' by other weaker currency economies would deal a fresh blow to Germany's export-dependent economy. Bonn is pondering the advantages and drawbacks of a move, always implicit in the Maastricht treaty, towards a 'fast-track' monetary union with a few other EC partners. If, as a result of hold-ups in Maastricht ratification elsewhere, such a procedure were agreed with France and the Benelux countries, the economic benefits would be only limited. The Bundesbank would probably remain in charge of the process - but a 'two-speed' march towards European union would provide fixed exchange rates for Germany's trade flows to countries at present purchasing only about 29 per cent of total German exports - a much smaller part of overall trade than the EC, which accounts for 54 per cent of exports. As the Bonn government considers the future path of European integration, the Bundesbank sits at its shoulder, nagging it about a still more pressing matter. The economic deadweight of the former East Germany is a far more serious constraint on economic policy than was imagined when unity was forged two years ago. As the bank's September report says: 'For a fairly long time to come western Germany will have to accustom itself to a high level of transfer payments to eastern Germany. Due regard has not been paid to this in a large proportion of the public sector budgets and in negotiated pay settlements.' Transfers this year will reach DM170bn, up DM20bn from last year, according to new estimates from Deutsche Bank, the biggest private sector bank. 'A fairly long time' in Bundesbank language is translated into '10 years and more' by some independent economists. The thrust of the central bank's report, which focuses, as usual, relentlessly on domestic policy, is that none of the conditions which it requires before interest rates can be reduced has yet been met. Although inflation has fallen since the March peak of 4.8 per cent and is now holding at about 3.5 per cent, most of the decline is accounted for by the 'base line' effect of indirect taxation increases dropping out of the calculation in July and the moderating influence of falling import prices due to the strength of the D-Mark. 'In other words the progress made in combating inflation has not yet been consolidated,' the report adds. Nor has there been any significant progress in combating wage inflation, notably in the east. The bank is especially concerned about this year's agreement to raise public sector pay in the former GDR to 80 per cent of western levels by July next year. The Bundesbank's anti-inflation struggle has been considerably complicated by its difficulties in meeting this year's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target for growth in the broad M3 money supply. Already in August, M3 was growing at an annualised 9 per cent. The unprecedentedly large intervention during the past month by the Bundesbank and other European central banks to hold down the rise of the D-Mark against partner currencies has led to large flows of liquidity on to the Frankfurt money market. Although the Bundesbank is doing its best to neutralise these inflows through money market operations, the rush of speculative funds into the D-Mark will push year-on-year growth in M3 still higher this autumn. This degree of overshooting - unparalleled in the 18 years since it started monetary targeting in 1974 - poses an enormous challenge for its credibility. Bonn, too, needs to maintain public confidence. It has promised an about-turn in its spending policies. But, as is clear from recent Bundesbank statements, Frankfurt's scepticism has yet to be overcome. The 1993 budget tabled recently by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, allows for a nominal increase of only 2.5 per cent in federal spending ' a distinctly non-inflationary tack in a year when price inflation is expected to average 3.75 per cent. In the next three years, the average target increase will be even lower at 2.3 per cent. The implication is an absolute limit on spending increases until 1996 of almost DM11bn a year. According to Mr Helmut Kaiser, an economist at Deutsche Bank, Mr Waigel's words are 'welcome . . . but not entirely credible', if only because the minister has not yet said how he intends to make the necessary cuts. Room for cuts elswehere is slender indeed: about 11 per cent of federal spending is currently consumed by interest payments; another 10 per cent of the Bonn budget ' the sums are fixed by legislation ' is consumed by allocations to regional and local authorities. The only areas where significant cuts might be made are in the subsidies paid to industries such as coal and agriculture, which account for almost 40 per cent of Bonn's annual spending. 'Experience shows, however, that attempts to (dismantle subsidies) generally fail,' notes Mr Kaiser. By adopting Mr Waigel's thinly-detailed proposals the government has put itself on a hook, and the Bundesbank is unlikely to let it wriggle off easily. Earlier this month when it snipped a  1/4 point off its Lombard rate and  1/2 a point off the discount rate, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, said it was contributing to easing exchange rate tensions. The move, he added, could also be seen as a shift in line with the needs of a weakening economy. In that case, if the German economy descends into recession, he and his colleagues may be prepared to take a more radical approach to interest rate cuts. If the Bundesbank holds its current rigid line, keeps rates high and thereby smothers economic resurgence in its main European export markets, the evidence so far suggests there is no chance of an export-led recovery in the near future. The only apparent alternative appears to be a significant easing of rates over the next 12 months, leaving the markets to realign the D-Mark with its battered neighbours, and the postponing of the Bundesbank's dream of 2 per cent inflation to some uncertain point in the future.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GERMAN PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT (DMbn)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            1990   1991   1992   1993   1994   1995  1996  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Federal government          542    586    619    658    740    773   804 Lander and local   authorities*              453    490    532    575    727    808   895 German Unity Fund            20     51     75     90     95     95    95 Total central, regional   and local authorities   1,053  1,170  1,342  1,453  1,603  1,722 1,889 Treuhandanstalt              14     49    135    195    250    250   250 Ex-GDR housing control       38     42     46     50      -      -     - Total government debt     1,225  1,387  1,670  1,871  2,054  2,196 2,386 As % of GDP**              45.7   49.9   56.3   57.7   59.0   63.0  68.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *1990 excludes east Germany **From 1991 total German GNP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bundesbank; Federal Ministry of Finance; Deutsche Bank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

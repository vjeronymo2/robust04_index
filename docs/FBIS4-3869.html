			<p>BFN     [Text] Toronto, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- When Roy MacLaren,  Canadian International Trade Minister, held talks with Zou  Jiahua, visiting Chinese State Council Vice Premier, in Toronto  on 22 April, he said that he had just returned from a visit to  China and that China's rapid economic development had left a  deep impression on him. He said he was convinced Canada and  China could become very good cooperative partners.    MacLaren also reaffirmed support for the restoration of  China's status as a signatory state of GATT and for China's  becoming a founding member of the World Trade Organization.    Zou Jiahua said he had personally experienced the strong  desire of the Canadian Government and personalities of Canada's  various circles to strengthen cooperation with China in the past  few days of his Canada visit. He said he thought the two  countries already had the conditions for accelerating the  development of their bilateral relations and that the  opportunity is also very favorable.    MacLaren and Zou Jiahua jointly explored the prospects for  Sino- Canadian trade and cooperation in science and technology.  Both sides believed that, though Sino-Canadian trade and  economic relations have enjoyed comparatively great development  in recent years, much remains to be desired when compared with  the actual needs and existing potentials of the two countries.  The potentials for the two countries to expand cooperation in  energy, transportation, hydroelectric power, communications, and  other infrastructure fields are still very tremendous. Both  sides discussed relevant specific issues and reached a consensus  on a wide range of topics.    After their talks ended, MacLaren hosted a banquet in honor  of Zou Jiahua and his party in the evening.</p>

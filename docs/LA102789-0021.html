			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRESPI STAYS IN HUNT, 10-7, AS SOPHOMORE PACES VICTORY  </P> <P> Crespi High had two new prospects to deal with at Pierce College on Thursday  night, one palatable and the other less than appetizing.  </P> <P> First, the unsavory. With a loss to St. John Bosco, the Celts would have been  mathematically eliminated from the Southern Section playoffs for the first time  since 1985.  </P> <P> Next, the promising. Crespi made a quarterback change to sophomore Cody Smith,  a junior varsity starter who became eligible to play varsity when he turned 15  two weeks ago.  </P> <P> With Smith's help, the new-look Crespi team was able to stave off postseason  extinction -- at least for a week -- by beating St. John Bosco, 10-7.  </P> <P> It didn't come easily.  </P> <P> The Braves (4-4 overall, 1-1 in league play) had a chance to even the score  with 15 seconds to play. Trailing, 10-7, St. John Bosco mounted a 13-play,  56-yard drive to the Crespi two-yard line. The drive was kept alive when  quarterback Gary Manley followed three consecutive incomplete passes with a  17-yard completion to Doug Petzer at midfield on fourth down.  </P> <P> The Braves worked the ball downfield and had a first down at the nine but were  unable to punch the ball in. On fourth and goal from the two, Sergio Diaz took  a handoff, was met head on by Jerry Thompson and was stopped for no gain.  </P> <P> The Celts ran out the clock on the next play.  </P> <P> "We rose to the occasion," Thompson said of the defense. "It was like a  square-on hit. Me on him."  </P> <P> Said Crespi Coach Tim Lins: "It was a helluva goal-line stand. My heart is  gone."  </P> <P> Some had questioned the heart of the Celts (5-3, 1-2) after they had lost close  games to Loyola and Alemany and dropped to 0-2 in league play.  </P> <P> Judging by its 36-yard performance in the first half, after which St. John  Bosco led, 7-3, it appeared as if Crespi again would stumble.  </P> <P> Then the defense came alive. Late in the third quarter, the ball was batted out  of Manley's hand and recovered by Crespi's Frank Romano at the Braves' 27.  </P> <P> Four plays later, Smith lofted a 17-yard pass toward the right corner of the  end zone where Zach Rayner made a sliding catch.  </P> <P> "I really didn't see the ball at first," said Rayner, who was covered closely  by Jim Frausto. "It was in the lights. When it came out I picked it up and just  reached out and got it."  </P> <P> The reception and Bill Canalez's conversion kick gave Crespi a 10-7 advantage.  </P> <P> There were few outstanding catches in the game. Smith completed eight of 17  passes for 80 yards but four passes were dropped.  </P> <P> "That's just part of the game," Smith said. "They're going to come back and  catch many more for me."  </P> <P> Leonice Brown, Crespi's leading rusher who sat out the first half because of  sore ribs, gained 28 yards in six carries. Lucas Freeman led the Celts with 33  yards.  </P> <P> In all, Crespi was held to an uncharacteristically low 127 total yards.  </P> <P> St. John Bosco took a 7-3 lead with 4:23 to play in the first half. Brent Bell  took a pitch, cut inside and scored from 11 yards.  </P> <P> Crespi took a 3-0 lead with 4:44 to play in the first quarter when Canalez  booted a 31-yard field goal.  </P></p>

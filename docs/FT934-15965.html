			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: Philips to sell US video chain PHILIPS of the Netherlands is to sell all its 430 video and music retail stores in the US to Blockbuster, the US video rental and retail group, for Dollars 150m. The Dutch electronics group, which owns about 7.5 per cent of Blockbuster's share capital, said that its shareholding could rise to about 10.5 per cent if Blockbuster decided to pay for the stores with its own shares. However, Blockbuster, the world's biggest video retailer, may choose to pay cash, or in both cash and shares. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of next month. Philips said the disposal reflected the dominance of the US market by a handful of large companies such as Blockbuster, which operates more than 3,250 video rental shops, most of them in the US. Philips said the US stores would be better off in the long term under Blockbuster's ownership. The 430 stores being sold belong to Philips' Super Club subsidiary, and they account for about three quarters of Super Club's annual turnover of Fl 850m (Dollars 465m). After the sale, Super Club will consist of 320 video rental shops in the Netherlands and Belgium. The US stores are profitable, but those in the Benelux are loss-making. The European market is more fragmented than that of the US, and Philips said it had no plans to sell off the stores in the Netherlands and Belgium, where Super Club is the market leader.</p>

			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Redwood puts Thatcherite zeal on hold MR JOHN REDWOOD, the rightwing Welsh secretary, made clear at the weekend his opposition to income-tax increases and excessive public-spending cuts as he tried to reassure the principality that nothing would be put in the way of economic recovery. At the Welsh Conservative party conference in Llangollen he signalled in his first speech as Welsh secretary that his Thatcherite economics and privatisation zeal have been put on hold. His comments highlighted the reservations in the government about the large public-spending cuts urged by some Tory MPs. It lined Mr Redwood up as a cabinet ally of Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who has set economic recovery as his 'first aim'. Mr Redwood said that under his leadership the Welsh Office would be committed to 'putting the search for work and investment at the top of the agenda'. The Welsh secretary, a member of the Thatcherite No Turning Back Group, made only one reference to privatisation - a boast that as a junior trade and industry minister he had not sold Cardiff-based Companies House. He told Welsh Tories: 'Recovery is the best way of stopping the deficit. We should never put tackling the deficit above the needs of the elderly, the disabled, the disadvantaged, who cannot compete in the marketplace.' He said the Tory 1992 election manifesto had opposed income-tax increases. 'It was right then. It's right today.' On the government's public spending review, he said: 'Some urge us to make deep cuts in public spending now. They fear otherwise markets will have their way and lose confidence. Yet markets will take confidence if recovery continues and strengthens.' Mr Redwood, under attack from political opponents and under suspicion from some Welsh Tories for his firmly English roots, said there 'has always been a welcome in the hillsides for Englishman in love with the Welsh rhythms and landscape'. He would be supporting Wales in football and Glamorgan at cricket. He even made an enthusiastic stab at singing the Welsh national anthem. Speaking to journalists, Mr Redwood said Mr John Major and Mr Clarke were right to review all parts of public spending, but he said he had set out 'the strategy'. He hinted that he saw public-spending savings coming more from controlling pay.</p>

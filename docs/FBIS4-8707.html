			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- The sanctions of the  international community against the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia have become an obstacle to the restoration of peace  and stability in the Balkans, FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias concluded  at their talks in Athens today.    At a joint news conference following the official talks,  Jovanovic said it had been agreed in the talks that sanctions  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had been made  redundant a long time ago by the huge and important changes that  had taken place in Bosnia itself and on the territory of former  Yugoslavia.    The two ministers pointed to the negative consequences of  the  NATO air strikes against Serb positions in Bosnia and NATO  siding with the Muslims. This action dealt a heavy blow to the  peace process and the political process in the region, Jovanovic  said, adding that now much more time and effort would be  necessary to put the peace process back on track.    The sanctions have been inflicting damage even on those who  designed and imposed them, Jovanovic said. He stressed there  was no longer anyone who would be ready to take part in this,  nor support the anachronism that was created in Bosnia and on  the territory of former Yugoslavia.    Greek Minister Karolos Papoulias, having expressed pleasure  over meeting Jovanovic again, pointed to the need for firmer  cooperation between the Balkan countries in resolving the issue  of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.    Speaking about sanctions, Papoulias said there was "scope  for  actions within the European Union." However, he spoke more  about cooperation between the Balkan countries in that sphere,  which, as he said, should take joint action.    "In a series of meetings with Bulgarian and Romanian  colleagues, we agreed we would work together on the problem of  sanctions," Papoulias said, convinced Hungary and Ukraine would  join such an action. He said at today's talks they also  discussed the idea of organizing an inter-Balkan conference on  cooperation between the states in the Balkan region that would  take place when peace was reached on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia. "We have agreed with Minister Jovanovic to work in  this direction with the ministers of other Balkan states,"  Papoulias said, listing Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary as first  partners in connection with the idea.    Minister Jovanovic expressed his gratitude to Greece and to  the Greek nation for the aid given to the Serb people. "This aid  comes from the very soul, and that makes it even more precious,"  he said, stressing that the Serb and Greek nations were linked  by ties of friendship that could not be severed. Jovanovic  particularly expressed his gratitude in connection with an  action currently taking place in Greece for gathering millions  of signatures for a petition to suspend sanctions against the  FRY, which would be sent to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.    The Yugoslav minister said the policy of peace, dialogue,  and  agreement was a permanent orientation of the FRY. That is why  we are asking the international community to treat us on an  equal footing. Everything that has been imposed on the Serb  nation as a form of punishment must be removed to enable  negotiations on an equal basis. "Talks cannot take place under  the threat of bombing or under political and economic pressure,"  Jovanovic said.    It is expected that Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou  will receive the Yugoslav foreign minister tomorrow morning.</p>

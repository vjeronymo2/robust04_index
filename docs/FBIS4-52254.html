			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Yang Sung-hyon entitled "Thirty North </F> Korean Agricultural Technicians Refuse To Return Home--Hope to  Defect to the ROK While Staying in Russia]    [Text] It has been confirmed that not only the North  Korean workers who escaped from the Siberian logging site but 30  agricultural technicians North Korea has sent to Russia refused  to respond to the summons of the North Korean authorities. They  hope either to settle in Russia or defect to the ROK.    It has been learned that these North Korean agricultural  technicians are living scattered in such areas as Moscow,  Siberia, Sakhalin, and Uzbekistan.    Some of them have already visited the ROK Embassy in Russia,  Korean Russians, or ROK businesses to express their desire to  defect, a diplomatic source in Seoul said on 7 May.    The source said, "They are all specialized technicians who  have been dispatched to Russia after meticulous screening by  North Korean authorities. Therefore, they enjoy a better life  economically and are treated better in Russia than the escaping  North Korean Siberian loggers. For this reason, they pose a  less urgent problem than the escaping loggers in our effort to  resolve the problem for them."    In fact, many more of them than the loggers who are in the  similar situation have married Russian women and hope to settle  in Russia.    A considerable number of them are working at a Russian  agricultural institute or research institute. Therefore, they  will pose a far less problem than the loggers in respect of  their settlement in Russia or defection to the ROK.    The source, however, said, "In view of their moves, living  conditions, and relations with Russia, it is too early for the  ROK Government to deal with the problem of assisting their  defection and settlement in Russia." Therefore, the problem of  these agricultural technicians may well be dealt with after the  settlement of the problem of the escaping loggers. North Korea  began dispatching the agricultural technicians to Russia in the  latter half of 1980's to learn agricultural technology in order  to improve North Korean agriculture and increase its food  production.    However, some of these technicians made moves for defecting  to the ROK and settling in Russia after the establishment of  diplomatic relations between the ROK and the Soviet Union.  Therefore, North Korea began to summon them against their  wishes.    The North Korean agricultural technicians dispatched to  Russia are estimated to number about 150.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Tougher rules on insurance solvency urged The government plans to urge the introduction of tougher European Union solvency rules for insurance companies exposed to the greatest uncertainty about potential liabilities from the cover they provide. Proposals being drawn up by the Department of Trade and Industry would require European companies to hold a higher proportion of assets to premium income if faced with exposure to US asbestosis or professional liability claims. Most insurance companies comfortably exceed solvency requirements. But pressure from financial markets is likely to mean that a change in official solvency rules would lead to companies increasing, by a corresponding amount, the assets they hold over and above the minimum solvency margin. Mr Ian Clark, insurance partner at accountants Binder Hamlyn, said: 'Any change of that far-reaching nature would undoubtably affect a lot of companies in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.' The move reflects Whitehall concern that UK solvency rules, based on EU directives, do not distinguish companies according to the type of business they underwrite. Insurance company failures are often the result of losses incurred on 'long-tail' policies, such as liability insurance, where claims can take many years to arise and are difficult to forecast. The insurance subsidiaries of the London United Investment financial conglomerate, which collapsed four years ago, underwrote relatively high-risk liability business, specialising in the insurance of North American companies and professionals against legal awards. EU directives setting rules on the solvency for insurance companies are due for review in 1997. National insurance regulators are expected to start discussions on possible changes early next year. Since July European insurance companies have been able to operate across the EU on the basis of regulations set in their home country so the DTI has an incentive to ensure solvency requirements are strengthened across the EU. The UK's proposals, which have yet to be worked out in detail, reflect a trend across the international insurance industry, particularly in the US, towards 'risk-based' capital. A move towards 'risk-based' solvency rules would further complicate existing DTI regulations which set a minimum amount of assets, as a proportion of premium income or likely claims, that a company has to hold over and above its outstanding liabilities.</p>

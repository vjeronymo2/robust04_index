			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Arts: New York Philharmonic 150th anniversary season - Concert Under their new(-ish) music director Kurt Masur, the NYP played the Royal Festival Hall on both Monday and Tuesday. Monday's was the solider programme ' Mozart, Strauss's Till Eulenspiegel and the Second Symphony of Brahms. On Tuesday, besides Samuel Barber's familiar Adagio we got only Dvorak's 'New World' Symphony (probably a bigger draw in the New World than in London now), and a wholly unfamiliar work by a Sino-American composer: plenty of room left for encores, and many seats going spare at Pounds 40. In distinguished form for its 150th anniversary season, the NYP was a continual pleasure to hear. And not only in the departments where all the best American orchestras excel - brilliantly reliable brass, strong, thrusting cellos, ultra-precise rhythms all round; for in Masur the orchestra has found, after some post-Bernstein ups and downs, just the echt-European musician they needed and deserved ('at this point in time', as they might say). Most of those other orchestras are happiest when loud and dazzling, and a few of them cultivate a dramatic pianissimo too. Masur, however, seems to have made the NYP sensibly, graciously at home with all the gradations in between. Even in their Strauss it wasn't the extremes that counted most, but the main argument - steady, temperate, scrupulously shaded, with each orchestral section contributing a unanimous voice. They seemed two or three times as well-rehearsed as our London orchestras do at home (but so do ours, often, when they're abroad). The glory of these two concerts was beyond doubt the NYP's Brahms no. 2. It is not a personal favourite: many a music lover may think, as I usually do, that Brahms's towering academic ingenuity here was disproportionate to a fairly tame range of feeling, and would for choice hear his 1st or 3rd or 4th symphonies instead. While Masur's performance lasted, one couldn't have thought that. From top to bottom the polyphony sounded vital, fluent and pointed, at once densely expressive and sunnily transparent. To jaded ears it came as a tonic and a hugely professional revelation; it flowed cogently, glowed and convinced. Strauss's Till was more 'interesting' than persuasive. Masur's natural sympathies do not run to unbuttoned fun. We had to be content with a vivid (but always coolly contrived) pounce-and-splash here and there, amidst the deliberate workings-out. There was an ace first horn, and for the violin solos the NYP leader's bright, sweet, fast-vibrato tone was just right. Less so in Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, where he sounded tight and over-pretty  -probably because his young co-soloist Cynthia Phelps, the NYP's new(ish) first viola, is a model of lovely, straight-speaking musicianship. On Tuesday Dvorak's 'New World' seemed to aspire beyond its homely deserts ' ethnic cosiness is not Masur's forte ' toward a slightly fictitious grandeur, despite Thomas Stacy's dewy cor anglais solo in the Largo. 'Bright' Sheng's H'un (his American forename translates his Chinese 'Liang', and the title means something like 'wounds') proved to be a bitter epitaph for the Cultural Revolution, through which he lived in his teens before he fled to America in 1982. From a standpoint of Political Correctness his 20-minute piece is faultlessly sincere: first, variously shrill evocations of horror (with Chinese bass drum), and then numb, grievous reflections. On first hearing, nonetheless, H'un struck me as short-breathed and under-composed. Further acquaintance might discover deeper patterns; or perhaps its patterns respond too closely to the folk-music of Qinghai Province on the Tibetan border, where Sheng spent his formative years, for Western ears to cotton on to them easily. While the passing sounds were pungent, the musical sense remained opaque, bitty and generalised.</p>

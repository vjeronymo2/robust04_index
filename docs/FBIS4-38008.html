			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "In Statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, </F> Palestinian Authority Minister Attacks `Erroneous Practices' in  Gaza and Jericho"]    [Excerpts] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A Palestinian  Authority minister has attacked the Palestinian leadership's  working methods and the manner in which it deals with the  self-rule areas. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi (from the Fida party)  criticized the policy of domination and monopolization pursued  in the entire political, security, economic, and administrative  structure being set up. He warned against transferring the  deformities afflicting the PLO and its experiment in exile to  Palestinian territory, because that would lead to its failure.    Dr. al-Shu'aybi, sports and youths minister, said in a  statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that "we in the Palestinian  Democratic Union `Fida' decided to participate in the authority  in order to serve our people in this stage. From the outset we  have called for abandoning old working methods and the policy of  domination, not politicizing the institutions, and reducing  reliance on individuals in favor of institutional action based  on competence and the real need. Despite our knowledge of the  chronic ailments in Palestinian action outside the homeland, we  wagered and continue to wager on the role of popular control  over the institutions to be moved to the homeland. Because the  Palestinian people, who have waited all these years and  succeeded in returning their leadership from abroad, will not  allow incompetent structures to be imposed on them from abroad."  [passage omitted]    Al-Shu'aybi pointed to the danger of militarizing the  institutions and to the militias' control of citizens' life and  food. He said that "the most dangerous thing facing us is the  lack of clear powers and the separation between security and and  police services operating in Gaza and Jericho. Our people have  begun to openly express their indignation at the spread of  security services and the way in which the preventive security  service operates. And numerous field commanders still have not  comprehended the fact that the authority does not belong to  Fatah and that Gaza and Jericho are not another Lebanon."    He added, "we are a responsible and constructive opposition  using the weapon of criticism, which expresses the people's  feelings and their discontent at methods which are alien to  their struggle traditions through which they confronted the  occupation over the past years. While we criticize erroneous  practices and participate in the Palestinian Authority, we raise  our voice to avert mistakes and correct the march immediately.  We expressed this in front of Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat, whose impartiality we respect and appreciate."  [passage omitted]</p>

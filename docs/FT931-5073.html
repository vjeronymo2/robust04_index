			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Estate agents When, like Gadarene swine, financial services companies rushed into estate agency businesses in the late 1980s, the widely held view ran: nice theory, shame about the timing. Urged on by the demons of deregulation, insurance companies and mortgage lenders alike viewed estate agencies as useful distribution channels for related financial services products. But the theory remained unproven as the recession wrecked the experiment. However, the incipient recovery in the housing market is reviving the argument. Hambro Countrywide and Royal Insurance continue to believe in estate agencies as effective distribution vehicles. Having survived the worst, such businesses should now reap the rewards. Estate agencies should return to profit as housing transactions pick up. A 10 per cent rise in volume would transform their economics. Some optimists even suggest a 25 per cent increase this year. Any recovery in house prices would be an added bonus. On this basis Abbey National would have done better to wait before putting its chain on the market. But there would be no guarantee of a higher price down the road. The industry's barriers to entry remain low. Any revival in the housing business will see the competition multiply in a way that may hurt the big chains. Successful estate agencies tend to be entrepreneurial free-wheeling enterprises. That fits badly with the centralised mentality of financial service organisations. The Prudential concluded that the contradictions were too great and abandoned the whole attempt. Its early retreat was certainly expensive. It may end up looking prudent.</p>

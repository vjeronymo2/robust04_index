			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Clinton climbs back in poll ratings President Bill Clinton's exposition of the Whitewater affair at last Thursday's press conference has produced an immediate rise in public support, according to two polls released yesterday. The same surveys also showed a public increasingly believing that the media is paying too much attention to the first family's financial dealings in Arkansas when he was governor and to the allegations that senior administration officials have sought to frustrate investigations into them. The recent poll trend has seen Mr Clinton's approval rating slipping into the mid-40s. However, the Washington Post-ABC survey, conducted last weekend, had it back up to 57 per cent, a 10-point rise compared to last week. The CNN-Gallup-USA Today poll recorded a more modest two-point rise to 52 per cent. The first poll found 54 per cent approving of the way the president was handling Whitewater, up from 32 per cent just three weeks before. Some 60 per cent thought he was 'mainly telling the truth' while 55 per cent thought he had done nothing illegal and 51 per cent thought the same of Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton. The second poll, with slightly different questions, still detected a high level of public concern. Only 36 per cent answered he had done 'nothing wrong,' but this was up five points in three weeks. The Post-ABC poll found 71 per cent believing the media was paying too much attention to Whitewater, while the second survey put that level at 55 per cent. It also found 54 per cent persuaded that the Republicans were 'overreacting' to Whitewater. Some news organisations have found themselves in controversy over specific aspects of their coverage of the affair. Newsweek magazine seemed yesterday close to an apology to Professor Marvin Chirelstein of Columbia University for possibly misrepresenting his views on the Clintons' tax returns, released last week. He said he was 'simply outraged and humiliated' by a 'biased' article in which he is quoted as saying Mrs Clinton must have benefited from a 'sweetheart deal' in her commodities trading in the late 1970s. Mr Robert Fiske, the independent Whitewater counsel, said he was 'very upset and disturbed' by a cover story in Time magazine, which quoted sources on his team in its article on the role of Mr George Stephanopoulos, senior presidential aide, in the Whitewater affair. Such contacts, he said, had not taken place, but Time said it did not make up any quotes. The magazine was also criticised for its cover picture on the grounds it was taken in November, before Whitewater was a major story. Mr Stephanopoulos has admitted his anger on discovering that federal regulators had hired Mr Jay Stephens, a Republican former US attorney frequently critical of Mr Clinton, to investigate the failed Arkansas savings and loan institution implicated in Whitewater. But his reaction has been defended by many in Washington. Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House, sarcastically suggested those who found anything wrong with it had invented a new standard of public behaviour - 'the appearance of the appearance of impropriety.'</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Make lottery a charity, says peer A FINAL attempt will be made in the House of Lords next week to try to transform the government's planned National Lottery into a charitable foundation. Lord Birkett will propose a series of amendments similar to those put forward by Sir Ivan Lawrence, the Conservative MP, in the House of Commons but not debated. Lord Birkett is a director of Lottery Promotion Company, a non-profit making body which has been campaigning for charitable status for the lottery. The company believes charitable status would not only increase the money going to good causes such as sport and the arts but would help to prevent political interference in the allocation of the money. It would also reduce the danger of lottery funds being substituted for existing Exchequer spending. Mr Denis Vaughan, executive director of the company, said yesterday it was obvious that a national lottery should be at arm's length from government. 'Every other country has had difficulty with this. We must learn from them,' Mr Vaughan said. The company believes it has all-party support for the amendments in the Lords and that government plans would 'hand an unnecessary amount of profit to the private sector'. The company said if the amendment was carried arts, sport and heritage could each hope to receive Pounds 285m a year from a Pounds 3bn lottery turnover. The government hopes that the lottery - which could be the world's biggest - will be launched next year. It is intended to raise money for the arts, heritage, sports, charities and a new fund to celebrate the year 2000. Independent estimates suggest the lottery could generate sales of more than Pounds 4bn a year.</p>

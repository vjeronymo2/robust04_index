			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Rebel's lost cause brings about his predictable exit NO ONE was surprised by Mr Bryan Gould's decision yesterday to quit the shadow cabinet. More of his colleagues than will admit it publicly will lament his departure from the opposition front bench. After his defeat by Mr John Smith in July's leadership election Mr Gould was offered the health or education portfolios - two of the most important for Labour in opposition. Instead he opted to shadow the unfortunate Mr David Mellor at National Heritage. His friends judged, rightly, that Mr Gould had decided that his career in the new Labour team would be short. Throughout the leadership contest it was obvious that his views on Europe, on the exchange rate mechanism, and on economic management could not for long be contained within the orthodoxy of Mr John Smith's shadow cabinet. In the wake of sterling's retreat from the ERM and the Yes vote in the French referendum on Maastricht, his criticism of Labour's support for the ERM and the treaty had become increasingly strident. He was briefly silent after the shadow cabinet last week agreed a common position. But by then he had decided to resign, delaying the decision only to avoid overshadowing Mr Smith's parliamentary debut against Mr John Major. His clash with the leadership was not new. After a starring role in Mr Neil Kinnock's election campaign in 1987, he found that antipathy towards European federalism and his espousal of reflationary policies clashed with the party's desperate quest for respectability. The rise of Mr Gordon Brown and Mr Tony Blair in Labour's embrace of the market and Europe saw Mr Gould shifted outside Mr Kinnock's kitchen cabinet. He opposed the decision to back ERM membership at what he termed a 'ludicrous' rate and in effect to support the government over Maastricht. Free yesterday of the constraints of collective responsibility, Mr Gould displayed the depths of that antagonism. He was scathing about Maastricht as a 'breathtaking and audacious attempt' to ensure that bankers rather than politicians gained permanent hold over Europe's economies. The ERM had been revealed 'for what it aways was - just another means to try to defy economic reality'. Many in his party regard such views as eccentric. Mr Roy Hattersley, the former deputy leader and another of Labour's serious political thinkers, urged him yesterday morning to give up his 'championship of lost causes'. Others, possessed still with the search for respectability, regard him as damaging and dangerous. If his resignation is followed today by defeat in the annual elections to the national executive, the 53-year-old MP for Dagenham will face a long spell in the political wilderness. But still others will agree with the judgment offered by Mr Hattersley before yesterday's events: 'Mr Gould is by intellect, temperament and training the shadow cabinet member most qualified to argue Labour's ideological case.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy, edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] "A Russian military base by no means can be set up  on the territory of Moldova. Such allegations are a  falsification by mass media," President Mircea Snegur said at a  meeting with the U.S. deputy state secretary, chief coordinator  of the State Department for the CIS James Collins in Kishinev  [Chisinau].    Snegur acknowledged that the synchronization of the  withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army from Moldova with giving the  Transdniestria a special legal status "is yet a subject for  discussions with the Russian side." At the same time, Snegur  pointed out that he categorically objects to such an approach.    Collins praised "the fact of common vision by the Moldovan  leadership of the ways to settle the problems of Transdniestria  and villages populated by Gagauzes."    As an official representative of the Gagauz administration  told INTERFAX, representatives of Gagauzes and the Moldovan  leadership are expected to sign a conciliatory protocol in  Komrat (the center of the self-proclaimed Gagauz republic) on  Saturday [14 May]. The same source said that if by that time  the existing differences are not eliminated, the sides will wait  for the conclusions of the European Council regarding the draft  law on the status of Gagauzia. During last week's visit by the  European Council delegation to Moldova the draft law was handed  by representatives of Gagauzes to this international  organization for studying and making a conclusion.  IF Note: On Thursday the Moldovan parliamentary commission on  defining the special legal status for regions populated by  Gagauzes met in Kishinev. A delegation of the Gagauz parliament  led by Vice- President of the non-recognized Gagauz republic  Petr Buzadzhi took part in its work. The Gagauz leaders stated  their readiness for certain compromises, but they continue to  insist that the law should determine the status of Gagauzia as a  national-territorial state unit with its own constitution.</p>

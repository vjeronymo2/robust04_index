			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> APARTMENT LIFE: LANDLORDS CAN'T COLLECT DOUBLE RENT ON LEASE  </P> <P> QUESTION: I am writing on behalf of a young couple who recently moved to this  country. Their English is limited and they are in a predicament. Here is the  situation.  </P> <P> They signed a one-year lease and moved into their Bellflower apartment, but  after living there for four months, they realized how unsafe the building's  location was and moved. They gave the rental office a 30-day notice of their  intent to move. A representative of the office gave them back a receipt saying  that they left the apartment clean and undamaged.  </P> <P> Now, they have received an accounting from a collection agency saying that they  owe the apartment owners six months' rent, the amount of time left on the  lease. Their security deposit was deducted from the balance of the allegedly  owed rent.  </P> <P> The apartment has been re-rented to another party and it seems unfair that my  friends should have to pay rent for the balance of their lease too. Can  apartment owners collect double rent like this or is it illegal?  </P> <P> ANSWER: Apartment owners in California may not collect double rents. Your  friends only owe from the time they vacated the unit until it was re-rented.  They should inform the collection agency and rental office of this fact.  </P> <P> If you know, or can find out, when the unit was re-rented, your friends may be  entitled to a refund. If the unit was re-rented before the deposit was used up,  based upon the daily rental value of the premises, your friends are entitled to  a refund of the balance of the deposit.  </P> <P> Even if your friends are not entitled to a refund, they will want to clear this  matter up to avoid a blemish on their credit files.  </P> <P> Tenant Wants Owner to Repair Phone Jacks  </P> <P> Q: My Brentwood tenant wants three telephone jacks repaired by me. Apparently,  they were working when she moved in. GTE wants $85 an hour to fix them because  she doesn't have "wiring insurance." She says I should pay.  </P> <P> Phone jacks, she argues, are like electrical outlets. She claims that if it's  inside the owner's building, it's the owner's responsibility. She has a point,  but I'm not sure she's right. If I do have to fix the jacks, do I have to let  the phone company fix them or can I use someone else?  </P> <P> A: Most phone companies, since deregulation a few years ago, have offered  renters inside wiring insurance. The reason the phone companies offer the  insurance to renters is because renters are responsible for fixing it.  </P> <P> For your tenant's information, she is not required to use the phone company to  repair the phone jacks.  </P> <P> Evicted Renter Asks About Relocation Pay  </P> <P> Q: I was amazed to read in your Jan. 21 column about the $2,000 relocation fee  that is due to those relocated because of landlords' family members taking over  their apartment units.  </P> <P> I am wondering if this matter can be pursued after the fact. Last April I had  to move after my landlord gave me one month's notice to vacate my Van Nuys  garage apartment so his son could move in. He gave me notice on March 4 and I  was out by April 4.  </P> <P> Am I still eligible for the relocation fees, if any are due me? If I am  eligible, how do I go about collecting them?  </P> <P> A: If the rental unit is rent-controlled, you may be eligible for the fees. If  the garage unit is the only rental unit on the lot, and it is unattached to any  other housing unit, such as a house, it is probably exempted from the law and  ineligible for the fees. Similarly, the garage unit may be exempted if it is  new construction, as defined by the rent law.  </P> <P> Check with the city's Rent Stabilization Division (RSD) at (213) 624-RENT to  find out if the unit is rent-controlled. If it is, you can report the situation  to them.  </P> <P> According to RSD Director Barbara Zeidman, you should also sue the former owner  in Small Claims Court for the $2,000, which is the court's upper limit for  lawsuits. Time is a concern to file this small claims action since you must  file suit in the court within one year of the incident.  </P> <P> Can Rent Be Withheld for Lack of Cooling?  </P> <P> Q: I would greatly appreciate any information you can provide me with about my  Fullerton apartment dilemma. I have been living here for about five months. The  complex is large, 100 to 150 units, and I have no idea whether it is under rent  control.  </P> <P> Here is the problem. Since the day I moved in, the central air conditioning has  never worked. After about three months, I decided to deduct some money out of  my rent to compensate for the lack of air conditioning.  </P> <P> The manager told me she couldn't accept a partial payment for rent. She said  she would contact the central office to see what could be done. A month has  passed and I have heard nothing.  </P> <P> I don't feel it is fair to pay for something you do not get. Do I have any  recourse?  </P> <P> A: Under California law, you may withhold all or a portion of the monthly rent  in the event that there is a breach of the warranty of habitability. That  includes all of the basic living essentials, such as electrical, heating,  water, roofing, insulation and so forth. Also, you may deduct all or a portion  of the monthly rent and spend the money to repair a code violation defect.  </P> <P> If you withhold or spend rent, and a court finds that your action was  unwarranted, you may be evicted. If any amount you withheld or spent is found  to be justified, then you win.  </P> <P> Withholding for air conditioning is marginal. The issue then becomes: Would you  have rented the apartment without air conditioning? If the air conditioning  (which many apartments do not have at all) was a substantial inducement to you  to rent, then your withholding may be justified and the owner should fix it.  </P> <P> Postema is editor of Apartment Age Magazine, a publication of the Apartment  Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' service group.

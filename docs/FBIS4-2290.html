			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 7 (XINHUA) -- A "two rims"  strategy for economic development is paying off for north  China's Hebei Province, according to Provincial Governor Ye  Liansong.    The two rims -- one around Beijing and Tianjin, north  China's  two biggest cities, the other around Bohai Bay, with a coastline  of more than 400 kilometers -- are the backbone of the  provincial economy, the governor said.    About 32 cities and counties in the province, with a  population of 18 million, are located in the area of the Bohai  Bay Ring, including big and medium-sized cities such as  Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Changzhou and Shijiazhuang.    Nearly 300 state-owned enterprises of the province have been  set up in this area, accounting for 43 percent of its total.    This year is vital in putting into practice the program  drawn  up last year by the provincial government for further opening up  and development of the ring area, the official said.    In contrast, the governor said that the great influence of  the booming urban economic development was felt by most of the  province's counties and towns around the Beijing-Tianjin rim.    With the help of the two big cities, rural residents nearby  are likely to become better off much faster than those in other  areas, he predicted.    He said that the province had 52 villages whose total  production output of industry and agriculture topped 100 million  yuan, and the majority of them are situated around the ring.    He added that the production growth rate of the areas around  the two rims is also two to three percentage points higher than  the province's average.    Last year, the provincial gross domestic production value  was  increased by 16.5 percent, and that of the economic rims  accounted for 40 percent of the total.    The governor said that 1994 is witnessing a shift to an  export- oriented economy in the Bohai Bay rim, attracting more  foreign investment to quicken the pace of development zone  construction.    According to the official, the province has planned to set  aside tracts of land totalling 20 square kilometers for a new  development zone for overseas investors.    The planned area is rich in natural resources such as  minerals, and has a favorable climate.    Currently, the province has set up more than 1,000 joint  ventures, over 80 percent of which center around the rim area.    Also built in the area were one major farm and sideline  production center and a key base for aquatic products and sea  salt, both the biggest of their sort in north China.    In addition, the area is strong in development of steel,  coal, building materials and petrochemical industries, with its  rich natural resources. So far more than 40 minerals have been  found in the area.    More convenient and efficient traffic and transport networks  have also helped to boost the economic growth around the two  rims. Apart from a number of main railways, there are over  3,000 kilometers of highways and newly-built expressways.    Around Bohai Bay lie north China's three big ports: Tianjin,  Dalian (in Liaoning Province) and Qinhuangdao (in Hebei  Province). The annual cargo throughput of Qinhuangdao Port is  close to 100 million tons, next in volume to Shanghai Port.    According to the governor, this year will witness a rapid  expansion of the effects of the Bohai economic rim to a wider  area of over 39,000 square kilometers.    He concluded that the provincial government has decided to  build more joint ventures in this area. Local enterprises with  educated workforce and good economic returns will be chosen to  team up with foreign counterparts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Welcomes H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk's Visit </F> to Pyongyang" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries an editorial warmly welcoming His Majesty [H.M.] King  Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia due here today for an official  goodwill visit to Korea at the invitation of President Kim  Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    His visit will mark another important milestone in  developing  Korea-Cambodia friendship to a new, higher stage, the editorial  says, and goes on:    He began visiting Pyongyang from 1960s. And this visit  continues in the 90s through the 70s and the 80s.    His current visit reflects his deepest respect for the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and fully demonstrates the close  friendly and cooperation relations established between the  Korean and Cambodian peoples.    It is also another expression of solidarity with the Korean  people, who are defending and developing socialism, while  smashing the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK moves of the imperialists  and the international reactionaries.    The many positive changes which have taken place in the  political developments of Cambodia in recent years are  unthinkable apart from the experienced leadership and patriotic  spirit of H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk, an outstanding patriot  produced by the Khmer nation.    He is still making energetic efforts to build the Kingdom of  Cambodia, sovereign, independent, peaceful, permanently neutral  and non-aligned.    The editorial continues:    The Korean people are rejoiced as over their own over the  achievements made by the H.M. King Norodom Sihanouk, the royal  government and the people in the efforts to achieve the  stability of the country and the reconciliation and unity of the  nation and build an independent and prospering new Cambodia and  express full support and firm solidarity for their just cause.    To constantly consolidate and develop Korea-Cambodia  friendship is the unanimous desire of the two peoples.    The Korean people are pleased to have such true-hearted  friends as the Cambodian people and make strenuous efforts to  strengthen and develop the friendly and cooperation relations  with them.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Cumbria (5): Employment drains away - Small dividend from peace for Barrow COPING WITH unemployment in Barrow-in-Furness is rather like trying to fill a bath slowly with the plug out. Jobs are draining away at a faster rate than they can be replaced, and there is little prospect of getting the plug in for some time. It was the end of the Cold War that pulled the plug, two years ago. Barrow is the home of VSEL, Britain's nuclear submarine shipyard. The former Vickers company, privatised from British Shipbuilders in the mid-1980s, lived off the threat from the Soviet Bloc. Once this was removed, the switch in national defence policy from deterrence to maintenance wiped out much of the demand for VSEL's skills. Britain's planned fleet of 18 nuclear submarines and 12 powered by diesel-electric motors was cut to 12 and four respectively. Of the latter, one was already being built at Barrow, and the other three at Cammell Laird on Merseyside, a VSEL subsidiary, so these were the end of the diesel-electric order book. To complete the nuclear fleet, there remained a need for only four new vessels to carry Trident missiles - and these are all that is left for Barrow to build now. The effect has been devastating for the Furness area of Cumbria, where the local economy is dominated by VSEL. Scott, the tissue papermaker best known for Andrex toilet rolls, is the second largest private sector employer and has about 400 people. At peak, two years ago, VSEL employed 14,500. Even now, with the workforce set to fall to just under 8,000 at Christmas, VSEL remains a giant - and it still will be when the company has slimmed down to 5,000 within the next two years. However, HMS Vanguard, the first of the Trident boats, was rolled out earlier this year and is due to sail to Scotland for sea trials this month. The next two submarines - Victorious and Vigilant - are in production at roughly 18-month intervals behind Vanguard, while parts of the fourth boat, still unnamed, are in the pre-assembly stage. The total programme will therefore guarantee the 5,000 jobs only to the end of 1994. VSEL had hoped to bottom out at about 7,000 jobs. It hoped to diversify partly by making more land armaments - notably its self-propelled howitzer - and transferring skills into production of offshore components for the oil industry. To get a foothold, VSEL bought Seabord Lloyd, a well-head manufacturer. The recession, however, has, at best, deferred prospects of breaking into new markets in a big way. Furness Enterprise, the local regeneration agency, has had to accept the 5,000-job figure and plan accordingly. Mr Harry Knowles, the agency's chief executive, says: 'In the past two years alone we have had an increase of 117 per cent in people out of work. Our forecast is that 12,000 jobs will be lost in the community over five years. Unemployment was 4.6 per cent in 1990 and is 8.5 per cent now. It will be 15.4 per cent by the end of 1993 and will rise to 18 per cent in 1994.' VSEL's impact goes well beyond the immediate casualties. Its workers are highly paid, not least because 70 per cent of them have professional qualifications or levels of skill which took years to acquire. They have long provided Barrow with a strong tax base and exercised considerable local spending power. Moreover, every one job within the shipyard is thought to support at least two more outside. Furness Enterprise, which is sponsored by VSEL, Scott, the Rural Development Commission, English Estates, the Department of Trade and Industry, Cumbria Training and Enterprise Council and the district and county local authorities, has set itself an ambitious target - 5,000 job opportunities over 10 years. However, this will still leave the community at least 7,000 jobs short when compared with 1990. The key to achieving the target, or better, will be to find advanced industries looking for the highly skilled, adaptable labour on hand. Mr Knowles says: 'We need a focused approach to make sure skills for advanced industries are not lost. We will prevail - provided we get the right sort of partnership with central government. We don't see this as government intervening in the market economy, or giving us a crutch. But we do need full development area status so that we can compete equally with other areas.' He would also like to see some sort of agency to help the private sector shoulder some of the risks associated with diversification from defence markets - a similar principle to what has been done in docklands or inner cities through the various forms of the urban programme, or in coal and steel closure areas. There, reduction of risk for developers - through government paying for land assembly and reclamation - has proved a powerful lever of even larger resources from the private sector. Mr Knowles thinks something comparable should be done in a swords-to-ploughshares programme, as has been the case in the US. It would not just be for giants like VSEL; another local defence contractor is the family-owned Oxley Developments, an advanced electronic ceramics specialist employing 250 and turning over about Pounds 10m a year. Oxley's military technology - which has gone into things like infra-red night vision lights to stop blacked-out US and UK combat helicopters crashing into each other in the dark - is transferable to anything using microwaves, in such fields as telecommunications, satellites, mobile radios and fibre optics. Dr Geoff Edwards, the managing director, says the company can more than hold its own against Japanese competitors from a technical viewpoint, but needs to scale up its production resources to win a viable share as the world market develops for electronic ceramics. He needs further funding of Pounds 1m and does not want to increase borrowings or lose independence. There are also bigger ideas on the horizon for the shipyard. The DTI sponsors a maritime technology centre which is looking into using new materials to make cargo ships - learning from the anti-turbulence technology that makes submarines go faster - or developing giant submarine cargo vessels which could traverse the oceans on autopilot. But such things are years off. There are no quick solutions - only quick problems. The speed of collapse of the defence market could not be remotely envisaged in 1989. An evident abundance of goodwill, determination and community spirit means all sides are facing the problem squarely, but the hiatus between putting the plug back in the bath and opening the taps wider to fill it quicker is going to be very uncomfortable.</p>

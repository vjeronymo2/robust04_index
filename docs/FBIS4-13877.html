			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following review of the 19 April  issue of Cairo `AL-SHA'B summarizes articles that are Islamic in  nature.  <H5>  Contents: </H5>   1. Writer Assails Emergency Law, Campaign Against Islamists    2. Detainees Allegedly belonging To Muslim Brotherhood  Released    3. British Newspaper's Interview With Shaykh al-Ghazali  Cited    4. Muslim Brotherhood Official Notes 'Plots' Against Islam    5. Islamic Conference Warns Of Proselytization Danger    6. Islamist Notes Jews' Policy, Claims  <H5>  WRITER ASSAILS EMERGENCY LAW, CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISLAMISTS </H5>   AL-SHA'B carries on pages one and three of its 19 April  issue  a 2,800-word article by its chief editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn  strongly attacking the government's extension of the Emergency  Law and the long-running campaign of arrests and torture,  especially against Islamists and Labor Party members.    He says that, while the government claims no one has been  affected by the emergency law, Islamic preacher Shaykh Muhammad  al-Sharif is behind bars with no charges made or reason given  except that he contradicted the prime minister. In addition,  "our colleague" 'Abd-al-Sattar is in the military prison, Husayn  writes. He adds that everyone knows that arrest warrants  containing no charges have been issued against journalists in  past years, including against 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im, who was  subjected to severe torture. Husayn notes that President  Mubarak has not tried for even one day to rule without the  Emergency Law, although it would have been in his and the  country's interest to try to rule for at least one year without  the Emergency Law. Pointing out that over the past years the  government has turned toward the use of force instead of  persuasion, he says incidents of political violence were rare  before the 1952 revolution, but nowadays terrorist attacks are  almost daily events.    Reviewing the government's policy of "physical liquidation"  and the campaign against the Islamic Alliance which represents  "the forces of moderation in the Islamic arena," Husayn says  that 180 mosques were stormed by police in 1988 and that in  al-Minya, one mosque was stormed 166 times. He says: "While  questioning the prime minister and the interior minister at the  People's Assembly, I emphasized that the use of the iron-fist  policy against the Islamic resurgence will only aggravate the  situation; and regrettably this is what has actually happened."  He notes that the government's policy of force and arrests led  to the emergence of the Islamic movement al-Shawqiyun and  prompted al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah's shift toward armed struggle.  <H5>  DETAINEES ALLEGEDLY BELONGING TO MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD RELEASED </H5>   An 80-word front-page report in AL-SHA'B says the Higher  State Security Prosecution has decided to release local council  members in Dumyat belonging to the Labor Party after a two-month  detention. The paper adds that the authorities fabricated  charges against them of belonging to an illegal organization,  meaning the Muslim Brotherhood.  <H5>  BRITISH NEWSPAPER'S INTERVIEW WITH SHAYKH AL-GHAZALI CITED </H5>   In an approximately 800-word report on page 3, AL-SHA'B  cites  an article published by the British newspaper THE GUARDIAN on  the situation in Egypt, decline in tourism, and Egypt' fear of  Islamic resurgence. The newspaper's writer notes that  terrorists are not the greatest threat to Mubarak, because the  policy of shoot to kill and mass arrests have shaken them. But,  the writer adds, moderate Islamists are the ones who are  apparently pushing Egypt toward an Islamic state.    The article also includes an interview with Shaykh Muhammad  al-Ghazali. Asked by THE GUARDIAN about his stand on any  Egyptian Government that fails to fulfill its duty toward Islam,  al-Ghazali says: "If any government fails to do this, then I  have the right to call on the people to change that government;  and this can be done through the ballot boxes." When asked if  there are free elections in Egypt, he replies: "You should ask  those who go the polls." Replying to another question,  al-Ghazali says: "If you Europeans have forsaken your spiritual  leadership, am I supposed to do the same? My answer is no." He  adds: "I want my religion to be strong because I want my nation  to be strong and able to defend itself. We have been defeated  militarily. We are a defeated nation and the only way for us to  restore our strength and self-respect is through religion."   <H5>    MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL NOTES 'PLOTS' AGAINST ISLAM </H5>   AL-SHA'B carries on page 5 an approximately 1500-word  article  by Deputy Guide of the Muslim Brotherhood Mustafa Mashhur noting  "foreign plots" against Islam. He says that the conspiracy of  the "crusader and Zionist alliance against Islam has never been  stronger than it is today" and that the Islamic world has never  been weaker than it is today. He adds: "This diabolical  scheme--coordinated by the Zionists, crusaders, communists,  Hindus, and other enemies of Islam--might make the world seem  black in the eyes of Muslims and make them wonder if Islam has  any future on earth."    Mashhur says that some people demand a speedy solution  because the enemies will not wait but continue their attacks  every day. They say if we do not find a solution, the enemies  will destroy the Muslims before they can react. But we say that  afflictions are grace in the form of calamity, because the early  Muslims triumphed over their enemies even though they were a  minority and were surrounded by Jews, Persians, and Romans in  Mecca and Medina. For example, he says, the Bosnian people were  completely lost under communism and most of them forgot Islam  but after the tragedy they reverted to Islam, began to fight  under the banner of Islam, formed a combatant army, and became  more aware of Islam and clung to it so that now their plight has  aroused the feelings of millions of Muslims.    He points out: "The enemies' dream of the possibility of  destroying Islam and the Islamic awakening will not come true,  God willing. Their very tactics of war consolidate, expand, and  strengthen the Islamic resurgence." He says that the West has  shifted from a religion that opposed knowledge to a knowledge  that fights religion, from a religion without culture to a  culture without religion, from a religion that exalts the world  hereafter to a religion inclined toward materialism, and from a  religion that revered God and disparaged man to one that  glorifies man and disregards God. Mashhur then argues that  Islam alone is what rectifies this disorder because it is a  religion that does not fight knowledge and culture, but has  produced the enormous scientific progress from which Europe  learned in its renaissance. Islam is the religion that founded  the most perfect civilization in history.    Under the subhead "The Jews Are Behind Every Corruption and  Enmity," Mashhur then writes that the Jews are the killers of  prophets who have been behind "every weird, deviant principle."  He says they have been behind communism that persecuted and  killed millions of Muslims in Russia and behind the downfall of  the Ottoman caliphate and the transformation of Turkey into a  secular state. Then he notes: "But we see this Islamic  renaissance and Islamic voice rising again in the skies of  Turkey."    Continuing his criticism of the Jews, Mashhur says the al-  Ibrahimi Mosque massacre has revealed the Jews' intentions  toward the Muslims but that the "free and proud Palestinian  people will not surrender to them." He adds that the Muslims  will not leave the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem captive to the  Jews no matter how much material force they possess or how much  help they gain from hostile powers. "It is the duty of all  Muslims to liberate the whole of Palestine. A state that has  been established on oppression cannot be stable or survive", he  remarks.    Mashhur goes on: "When Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  carried out reprisals for the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, we  saw Rabin strongly criticizing the king of Jordan for allowing  Hamas to operate from Jordan, and we regret Jordan's compliance  with his request. It is strange that we should hear that a  Zionist delegation participated in a conference in Oman to  discuss water issues and in another conference in Qatar on  banning nuclear weapons." He adds that the Jews foment sedition  and disturbances in Islamic countries and that the Jewish lobby  influences the U.S. Congress and President because of their role  in his election. He goes on to say: "So the President began to  act according to their guidance, speak on their behalf, proclaim  Jerusalem the capital of the Zionist entity, provide them with  all types of weapons, and allow them to possess nuclear arms  which he denies to other countries. But the day will come when  the American people realize the danger and damage they incur  from supporting this Zionist enemy, which is concerned only in  its own interest."    Concluding his article, Mashhur urges all Muslims to be wary  and learn from these "predicaments" to distinguish between  honest people and liars and to follow in the steps of the  Prophet and his companions by having faith, unity, and cohesion.  He says they must have faith that "Islam is coming, God  willing."  <H5>  ISLAMIC CONFERENCE WARNS OF PROSELYTIZATION DANGER </H5>   In an approximately 250-word report on page 7, AL-SHA'B says  the international Islamic conference, held at al-Azhar  University under the sponsorship of al-Azhar's shaykh, has  warned of the danger of proselytization movements, especially  the American ones, in Egypt and other Arab countries. He  considers such movements to be one of the foreign impediments to  Islamic action. The report adds that the conference emphasized  that the "resurgence of Islamic and Arab countries from their  backwardness is contingent on the application of the Islamic  shari'ah, which is the basis of their progress and strength."  <H5>  ISLAMIST NOTES JEWS' POLICY, CLAIMS </H5> In an approximately 350-word article on page 12, Shaykh  Muhammad al-Ghazali writes that the Israelis aim to expand  "whenever they see the Arabs disregard Islam." He says that the  Jews claim Egypt as their land and say that the land on which  their ancestors lived must be returned. He then adds: I have  the right to ask where are the peace plans the Jews offer to the  Arabs?"</p>

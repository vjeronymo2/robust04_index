			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Finer balance of power: Michael Smith on a possible MMC referral and repercussions for the electricity sector When National Power, the UK's largest electricity generator, publishes its half-year results tomorrow, the numbers will be examined with more than the usual scrutiny by industry and Westminster. The results are the last before Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, decides whether to refer National Power and PowerGen, the other large generator in England and Wales, to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission over criticism that they have abused their market position. A referral would have widespread repercussions. One potential casualty would be government finances. Treasury estimates of raising Pounds 5.5bn from privatisation sales in 1994-95 would be more difficult to achieve. More than Pounds 3bn of the total is expected to come from the sale of the government's 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen. But a referral, and the ensuing lengthy inquiry, could postpone the sale until 1995-96. A referral would also cast another cloud over the government's privatising strategy: this year the commission has recommended widespread changes to the structure of British Gas, another privatised utility, and the gas market to which it is the main supplier. Within the electricity industry, many executives believe a referral would trigger a wider inquiry by the commission into the entire power market. This could include the regional electricity companies, which, like the generators, were privatised in 1990, and the National Grid, which transmits power in England and Wales. The prospect of a wider investigation is unsettling both for the industry and for the government. The industry will be looking today for some reassurance from National Power that it is doing all it can to avoid a referral; for example, by demonstrating a willingness to compromise with Prof Littlechild on issues such as prices. Prof Littlechild's public pledge to make a final decision on a referral by the end of this year, rather than by the 1995 deadline he had previously set, was prompted by rises in the spring of more than 10 per cent in the prices of electricity in the wholesale trading pool. The pool, set up before privatisation, sets a wholesale price for electricity for each half-hour of the day after matching expected demand with supply. The price is determined by the most expensive generating station needed to meet the expected demand. The generators acknowledge they are responsible for at least some of the price increase but deny that they are making excessive profits as a result. Most consumers have been unaffected by the spring rises because the price of their electricity is determined by inter-related fix-priced contracts, agreed in advance, between electricity companies. But the increases badly hit many industrial consumers whose electricity bills are determined directly by the pool. Companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries, which has seen its electricity bill rise by 70 per cent at some plants in the past two years, have demanded action from both the government and Prof Littlechild. Satisfying this chorus of complaints from industry is likely to be one of Prof Littlechild's most difficult tasks since he became regulator three years ago. He has grown increasingly suspicious of the generators and their pricing policies. When announcing his investigation into a possible referral in August he said the generators' ability to raise prices in the pool was a matter of widespread concern. Prof Littlechild is a strong believer in competition and, like many others, including ministers, believes the market is too dependent on National Power and PowerGen for supplies: at their peak two years ago the two generators accounted for about 80 per cent of the market, though their share has since slipped to less the 60 per cent. 'He (Prof Littlechild) is pathologically ill-disposed to the market structure, and will be until our share is well down,' says an executive of one generator. However, in three previous inquiries into pool prices in the past two years, Prof Littlechild has found no evidence to support claims that the generators have abused their market power to a significant extent. To critics, such as the big consumers, the generators' profits growth since privatisation is confirmation that their prices are excessive. National Power increased pre-tax profits by 13 per cent last year to Pounds 580m, and PowerGen by 18 per cent to Pounds 425m; both companies are expected to record significant growth this year. 'These are very high increases for companies that are providing an oversupplied market,' says an executive at a non-generator power company. 'The problem is that generators decide what profits they want to make, and can, because of the lack of competition, arrange their prices accordingly.' The generators say their profit rises are partly the result of improved efficiency and job cuts. They point out that their rate of return on capital is less than that for regional electricity companies on their distribution businesses, which are monopolies. 'The issue is not whether we exercise market power but how we do so,' according to National Power. 'To the extent that we do possess market power we exercise it in a transparent and principled way.' In determining whether he accepts this statement Prof Littlechild has been provided with confidential figures by the generators. Unless the figures reveal overwhelming price abuse, most City observers believe he will try to force change on the generators that falls short of a referral. A referral would set in motion a process over which the regulator would have limited control. The danger is that the commission could reject his recommendations, which could include splitting up the generators or limiting their powers in other ways. The two most obvious options for Prof Littlechild are the imposition of price controls, or asking the generators to sell some of their generating plant in an attempt to reduce their market power. Both are fraught with difficulty. National Power and PowerGen may baulk at price controls and forced sales of generating plant. They have said publicly that they are willing to discuss disposals but potential buyers have their doubts. In the circumstances, Prof Littlechild could be attracted to a third option: doing nothing. However, having conducted his review he has raised expectations, not least among heavy industrial users, that he is going to do something. 'Prof Littlechild has huffed and puffed so often now,' says one broker. 'Having teed it all up he is going to look a right Charlie if he does nothing.'</p>

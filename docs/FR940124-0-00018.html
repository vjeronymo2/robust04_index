			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ESA does not use the term ``fish and wildlife habitat'' in the definition of critical habitat. Instead, the ESA only refers to geographic areas with physical or biological features that are essential for the species. The ESA also defines the term ``species'' as including ``any subspecies of fish or wildlife or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> plants <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and any distinct population segment of any species or vertebrate fish or wildlife which interbreeds when mature'' (Emphasis added).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Wyoming definition of critical habitat appears to exclude plants. Also, Wyoming has not specified any State statutes or rules that identify State critical habitat or Threatened and Endangered Species as required by the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16. Additionally, OSM cannot determine whether the term ``fish and wildlife habitat'' in this definition means fish and wildlife habitat for ESA purposes or fish and wildlife habitat as a land use. Finally, Wyoming also recognizes critical habitat designated by the ``Secretary of Commerce.'' It is not clear if this requirement is in addition to the Secretary of the Interior's designation or is an option to use the ``Secretary of Commerce'' designation instead of the Secretary of Interior's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the proposed statutory definition at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxix) is not in accordance with and is less effective than the Federal program requirements and is not approving the proposed definition. Wyoming is required to either repeal this statutory definition or modify it to be in accordance with and no less effective than the Federal program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx): Definition of Important and Crucial Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35&hyph;11&hyph;103(e)(xxx) a definition as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (xxx) ``Important habitat'' or ``crucial habitat'' means that fish and wildlife habitat, exclusive of agricultural lands, which in limited availability, increases the species diversity of a localized area and fulfills one (1) or more of the essential living requirements of important wildlife species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations include a definition of important habitat or crucial habitat. However, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780/784.16(a)(2) requires permit applications to include site-specific resource information when the permit area or adjacent area is likely to include ``habitats of unusually high value for fish and wildlife such as streams, wetlands, riparian areas, cliffs supporting raptors, areas offering special shelter or protection, migration routes, or reproduction and wintering areas.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These habitats of unusually high value would appear to be comparable to the State proposed definition for important or crucial habitat. Additionally, the State regulations at LQD Rule Chapter II, Section 2(a)(i)(E)(II) require permit applications to include specific information ``if critical or important habitat or migration route disruption is likely.'' Wyoming's LQD Rule at Chapter II, Section 3(b)(iv)(B) is similar to the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 780.16(b)(3)(ii) in requiring protection and enhancement of ``important habitat for fish and wildlife, such as wetlands, riparian areas, rimrocks, areas offering special shelter or protection, reproduction and nursery areas, and wintering areas.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Federal permitting and performance standard regulations do not exclude any land uses from consideration in meeting the requirements for protection and enhancement. Wetlands, riparian areas, migration and wintering areas can potentially occur within any land use including grazingland, pastureland, forestry, etc. Wyoming's proposed definition would appear to exclude consideration of important habitat or crucial habitat from those land uses included in the categorical definition of ``agricultural lands.'' These would include the land uses of cropland, pastureland, hayland and grazingland.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

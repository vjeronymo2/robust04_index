			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Redland For a company which has been straining to sustain a hefty dividend to add to its long-term burden by issuing two scrip dividends may seem rather like trying to extinguish a fire by dousing it with petrol. Although Redland will save Pounds 36m of ACT and preserve cash in the short term, it will now have to service 7 1/2 per cent more shares over the longer run. This will prove costly given their yield of 5 1/2 per cent. It is not even as if the market has much of an appetite for Redland shares. Following a rights issue and the Steetley acquisition in 1991, Redland has issued paper in profusion. The 5 per cent fall in interim earnings despite a 22 per cent rise in pre-tax profits illustrates the dilutive effects. Nevertheless, such concerns will evaporate if the paper dividends buy Redland enough time to enable rebounding UK earnings to resolve its tax dilemma. So far, the news from the home front is encouraging if not conclusive. Volumes and prices are firming but remain well below historic peaks. Redland will have to drive its earnings forward fast to justify its calculated gamble. The worry would be if German demand deteriorated too sharply before UK earnings did their trick. The German housing market has remained astonishingly resilient thanks to the flood of immigrants in the west and the leaking roofs in the east. But the probable expiry of housing tax subsidies at the end of 1994 may well damp demand. Redland will be praying that the UK upturn will be speedy enough for it to squeak through.</p>

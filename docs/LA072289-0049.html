			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'PHANTOM' INSIGHT  </P> <P> Re Charles Champlin's July 11 column, "Catching Up With the 'Phantom': A Night  of Opera," in which a friend asks him what "The Phantom of the Opera" is all  about:  </P> <P>  May I make a suggestion to those planning to attend the stage musical? Before  seeing "Phantom" in New York, I read Gaston Leroux's original story (available  in paperback), and this made all the characters and stage interpretation clear  and recognizable.  </P> <P> To fully appreciate later what one has experienced, read the book "The Complete  Phantom of the Opera" by George Percy (available in stores and some libraries).  This book is magnificent in historical content, color photographs and  descriptions of costuming and staging. The libretto is included.  </P> <P> I plan to see "Phantom" again. It is not "canned soup," as Times critic Dan  Sullivan has said, but rather nectar of the gods.  </P> <P> M. ENYART  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

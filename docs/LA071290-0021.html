			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON A ONCE QUIET STREET VIOLENCE REACHES A COUPLE'S FRONT DOOR  </P> <P> Early Wednesday morning, a man who had been chased by an attacker through a  Sepulveda neighborhood and shot in the back desperately pounded on the door at  Bill and Ruth Smith's home and then collapsed on the front porch.  </P> <P> Bill Smith called police and then watched through closed windows until officers  and paramedics arrived. The retired couple has lived in the 8500 block of Orion  Avenue for 20 years. In recent years they have watched crime problems increase.  </P> <P> But the shots and screams and terror were far from anything that the Smiths  ever expected would happen so close. Likewise, residents on Orion expressed  shock over Wednesday's shooting, which left two sisters dead and a man in  critical condition.  </P> <P> Although Wednesday's shooting was motivated by an apparent domestic dispute,  which many neighbors said could happen anyplace, they said they were left  wondering if it was one more step in the decline of their neighborhood.  </P> <P> "The violence is getting closer all the time," Ruth Smith said. "We had been  wondering how far things could go. We have considered moving, but we haven't  made up our mind. This certainly makes you think again."  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said the shooting was rooted in domestic problems between  the gunman and two of the victims, who lived five houses from the Smiths.  </P> <P> Police said Dean Roger McGrath, 29, entered a duplex and fatally shot sisters  Marleene Evelyn Taylor, 32, and Kathleen Taylor Fien, 30. Anthony Deluca, 28,  ran from the house calling for help, but the gunman chased him down and shot  him in the back, police said. He collapsed on the Smiths' front porch and was  in critical condition at an undisclosed hospital. McGrath was arrested about 12  hours after the shooting.  </P> <P> The neighborhood of small, neatly kept houses and a few small businesses runs  alongside the San Diego Freeway and is just one block south of a neighborhood  where streets were barricaded by police this year in an effort to curtail drug  sales.  </P> <P> Most houses are surrounded by fences, and there are many "Beware of Dog" signs.  The noise of the freeway is tamed by a concrete sound barrier that rises behind  the homes. But some residents said little has stopped crime from creeping into  the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Two years ago, residents signed petitions and got the city to close a  pedestrian tunnel under the freeway because it was being used by drug dealers.  But residents such as Frances Beals said she still sees drugs and prostitution  making inroads on the street.  </P> <P> "I can look out my windows and see them doing their thing -- they're still  around," said Beals, who runs an auto towing business from her house.  </P> <P> Beals said she believes many of the problems might be the result of the  barricades across streets in the neighborhood to the north. Police acknowledge  that the roadblocks have displaced some of the crime, but officers said no  single neighborhood has borne the brunt of that migration.  </P> <P> Susan Ventrella has owned a nursery on the block for five years. During that  time, she has seen the neighborhood change gradually from a friendly place  where young families established their first homes to one where residents are  more and more on edge.  </P> <P> "It's scary," she said. Many families have moved away in the last few years  because crime on neighboring streets has crept closer, she said.  </P></p>

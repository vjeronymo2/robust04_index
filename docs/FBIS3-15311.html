Until recently, the constitutional process in Belarus has  been sluggish. The situation changed drastically when the  ruling circles began to realize that the only way out of the  existing situation was to introduce a presidential form of rule  via the adoption of a new constitution.    Up until now, the only obstacle was the disorganization  among  deputies representing the interests of the nomenklatura. When a  total of only 260 parliamentarians convened for the session, the  task of gathering the requisite 230 votes seemed difficult. To  resolve this problem, it was decided on the initiative of  Gennadiy Kozlov, coordinator of the "Belarus" faction, to hold a  staggered ballot on disputed aspects of the draft constitution  using personal voting slips. In this way, as many deputies as  possible would be given an opportunity to express their views  over several days. In addition, this type of ballot affords a  measure of control over parliamentarians whose loyalty is in  doubt. Previously, "unreliable" deputies, finding themselves in  the hall of sessions under the watch of colleagues upon whom  they often depend for their position, pressed the right buttons  as a rule. But as soon as the matter went as far as a secret  ballot through the polling booths, between 20 and 30  parliamentarians from the majority would rebel.    Now they have been deprived of this possibility: The voting  process is controlled entirely.    To simplify the task considerably, the deputies are adopting  the consitution in whole chapters, each comprising between 10  and 15 articles.    Meanwhile, former Supreme Soviet Speaker Stanislav  Shushkevich has completed his country vacation. A series of  meetings with voters, as well as participation in the  consultative conference of patriotic-democratic forces, prompt  the conclusion that Shushkevich does not intend to leave  politics. In the current situation, he will rely primarily on  the bloc of democratic parties which gravitate toward the  center. They in turn are keen to cooperate with Shushkevich  whom they consider a realistic contender for the post of  president at future elections.    As members of the Tellers' Commission told IZVESTIYA's  correspondent, as of 1000 hours 1 March, 245 deputies had  answered "yes" to the questions on the voting slip. And one  more thing. An unprecedented incident occured: During his  address to the session under the "Any Other Business" section,  Stanislav Shushkevich's microphone was cut off after he said:  "You only want seats here because your are simply not fit for  any other job."</p>

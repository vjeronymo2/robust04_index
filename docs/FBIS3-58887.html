The resolution was proposed by the  center-right and Greens and was passed with 109 in favor, 90  against and 13 abstentions.    The text of the resolution sharply criticised the "strategy  and lack of success for the part of the United Nations and  European Union negotiators, who constantly sought to divide  Bosnia-Herzegovina on an ethnic basis, despite the fact that it  was a member state of the United Nations".    The Socialist group, which holds the majority in the  Strasbourg Assembly, voted against the resolution which also  called for the re-opening of the Tuzla airport, in central  Bosnia, and for an `active' intervention for the part of  international forces to protect the `security zones' drawn up by  the United Nations and to end the strangle-hold on Sarajevo.    According to the backers of today's resolution, United  Nations peace-keeping forces (UNPROFOR) should be modified "into  a force capable of making peace, given that it has failed in its  effort to keep peace."    Owen yesterday voiced his pessimism over the latest EU-UN  plan for Bosnia, remarking how now even the Muslins were using  the peace talks as a tool to buy time and reconquer territory.</p>

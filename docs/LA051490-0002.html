			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> 2 CLASSROOMS DESTROYED IN $500,000 FIRE;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY: A FAULTY CLOCK AT PARK VIEW ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SPARKS THE BLAZE.  ABOUT 130 FIRST- AND SECOND-GRADERS WILL BE DISPLACED.  </P> <P> Fire destroyed two classrooms and heavily damaged two others at a Simi Valley  elementary school early Sunday, causing a loss estimated at $500,000,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Investigators determined that a malfunctioning clock caused the blaze at Park  View Elementary School, 1500 Alexander St., said Jackie Noel, a dispatcher for  the Ventura County Fire Department.  </P> <P> Noel said two firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the fire.  </P> <P> About 130 first- and second-grade pupils -- more than a fifth of the school's  approximately 620 students -- will be displaced because of the fire.  </P> <P> The students will be taught in the school's library, computer lab or in two  special-education classrooms during the five weeks remaining in the school  year, Principal Rob Hunter said.  </P> <P> "Services to the kids won't be interrupted in any way," Hunter said. "We'll  just change the way we deliver the services."  </P> <P> Park View was not scheduled to be used for summer classes.  </P> <P> The fire swept through one of five four-classroom wings at the school, one of  the largest of the Simi Valley Unified School District's 19 elementary schools,  Supt. John Duncan said.  </P> <P> "The fire was so hot, it even buckled the outside walls . . . we may have to do  a total demolition and build a new wing."  </P> <P> Hunter said the fire in the clock was a "freak thing" but that similar clocks  will be inspected.  </P> <P> "Evidently the clock had been smoldering for quite a while," Hunter said. "If  we had been in session we probably wouldn't have had . . . near the damage we  had."  </P> <P> Fire officials said seven engines, two trucks and 35 firefighters were needed  to put out the fire, which was reported by a neighbor at 2:15 a.m. and was  extinguished by 6:37 a.m.  </P></p>

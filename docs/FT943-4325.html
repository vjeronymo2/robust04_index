			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Speed differential in Europe is a fact Sir, As we move from discussing a two-speed Europe to a multi-speed and now a two-tier Europe, politicians manoeuvre and the prime minister, John Major, seems to have forgotten his triumph at Maastricht in 'winning the argument about Britain's right to opt out of parts of the treaty'. Of course, as everybody knows except the British (and the Italians?), a multi-speed Europe was a reality well before Major accepted paternity at Maastricht. Sadly, what seems to be missed by both the British and Italians in the debate about Europe is their relative isolation, a geographic fact linked to an associated cultural effect. In Tuesday's front-page article, your headline reads: 'Kohl plays down plan for multi-speed EU'. In most countries except the UK and Italy, what matters is not that such a thing is, or might be, planned: after all, it is actually happening before our very eyes. Apparently, the British are unable yet to bring themselves to realise, as the Dutch have done, that their prosperity and influence depend upon making the European Union work. Meanwhile, the speed differential between the UK and those countries in the fast lane will increase. Not because politicians in Germany or elsewhere may have decreed it, but simply because that is the way it is and has been for the past 40 years, even if most of the British press, in concert with the politicians - and circulation directors - has been unable or unwilling to see it. True independence is appreciating the reality of one's own capacity. The tragedy of Britain's position is its failure to see this, whatever John Major and his supporters may say.

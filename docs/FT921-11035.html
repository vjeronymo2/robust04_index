			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / S Africa's whites look to a future past: The country's rulers want an influential role in post-apartheid government AS South Africa's new parliamentary session gets under way, there is only one real issue at stake in the debate over the country's new constitution: the role of whites in a post-apartheid government. Will their share of political power be entrenched in the constitution, or purchased through electoral deals with black political parties? Will they exercise power because the law says they must, or because the black majority finds it impossible to govern without them? The recent constitutional proposals from the ruling National party - offering general elections for a multiracial interim parliament - have obscured these issues. The Nationalists are offering to scrap the current cabinet and parliament, and to elect a new government in national elections which would include every South African for the first time in history. What they are not offering is to step off the political stage they have dominated for the past 43 years. The Nationalists' proposals - which were unveiled last December at the multi-party negotiating forum known as the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) - are a clever attempt to steal the negotiating initiative from the African National Congress (ANC). On the face of it, they appear to meet two key ANC demands: for an interim government to replace the current apartheid-tainted administration and for an elected constituent assembly to draw up a permanent constitution. The two would eventually be merged, with the interim parliament drawing up the constitution. The ANC has so far rejected the Nationalists' proposals, though officials concede privately that they cannot refuse to discuss them without appearing to reject the right to vote - the issue on which the movement has based 80 years of struggle. The details of the government's offer remain unclear. Indeed, members of the committee charged with drawing up detailed proposals disagree fundamentally over their content. What is clear is that Pretoria is for the first time offering an elected interim government, rather than merely black appointments to cabinet and that the Nationalists are no longer insisting that such a government rule for five to 10 years before a permanent constitution takes effect. Equally clear is that Pretoria will insist on guarantees for the white minority in the proposed interim constitution. Mr Gerrit Viljoen, minister for constitutional development, has suggested a model based on National party proposals adopted at last year's party congresses, which provide for a presidency which revolves between three to five of the country's top political leaders, and a bicameral legislature, including an upper house where whites have an effective veto. Mr Viljoen hopes this interim model will eventually be adopted as a final constitution. According to his timetable, an interim constitution would first be negotiated at Codesa, where 19 political groups meet to plan South Africa's political future. That constitution would then be put to a referendum of all races, which the government hopes to hold by year-end. White votes would be counted separately and, unless whites did not approve, the constitution would be implemented. It would then be passed by parliament, elections would be held, and a new cabinet formed by the middle of next year. The interim parliament would draw up a permanent constitution. The best-laid plans of the Nationalists seem unlikely to survive the tussle ahead in Codesa, however. Any one of a range of options could emerge. At one end of the spectrum would be a limited form of interim government, where Pretoria would share power with other parties only to the point of jointly overseeing the run-up to elections. Alternatively, joint control might be established over the security services, the public media, the budget and electoral processes - viewed by the ANC as key areas. Or the Nationalists and the ANC might agree to an interim cabinet with full powers, leaving the current legislature in place. The shape of an interim parliament is likely to prove even more contentious. The model proposed by Mr Viljoen uses a complex formula to guarantee minority political parties - in practice, whites - a disproportionately large say. This could take years to negotiate. Other officials propose using the current parliament, which includes only whites, Indians and coloureds, as a house of minorities, with veto power over a lower house elected from all races. Despite the current excellent relations between government and the ANC - whose officials dine, drink and joke together at Codesa - there are many obstacles to agreement. The white referendum, giving whites an effective veto, is condemned by the ANC in public but seems likely to gain eventual acceptance. But with government insisting on excluding the South African Communist party, the ANC's closest ally, how can agreement be reached on an interim cabinet? How can the gap be bridged between the ANC's one man-one vote parliament and the Nationalists' model? In the end, the central issue will always be how black aspirations for majority rule can be reconciled with white demands for minority safeguards. The ANC knows that any deal which whites oppose is no deal at all: without white skills, capital and expertise it can run neither the government nor the economy effectively. The threat of white terrorism is also very real. But the ANC rejects the Nationalist model for consensus government as an attempt to retain white privilege. The Nationalists' argument - that every group must be given an equal say in government to reduce the risk of racial or tribal conflict - is anathema to the ANC with its ideal of non-racialism. The struggle for real power in South Africa has only just begun.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GROUP FILES PETITIONS TO RECALL COUNCILMAN  </P> <P> A group seeking to oust Pomona Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant from office has  filed recall petitions it says contain more than 11,000 signatures.  </P> <P> City Clerk Elizabeth Villarel said a recall election will be called if the  verification process shows that at least 8,304 registered voters signed the  petitions, filed Friday.  </P> <P> Members of the recall committee contend that Bryant uses his office "for  vicious personal attacks and character assassination." The petitions accuse  Bryant of failing to provide responsible representation, and chide him for  calling his opponents "idiots," "nobodies" and "liars."  </P> <P> Bryant, 69, who has served 11 years on the council, said that if there is a  recall election, he won't bother to campaign because his record is well known.  "I have faith in the people of Pomona, he said."  </P></p>

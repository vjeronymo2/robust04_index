			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Japan's trade surplus surges to Dollars 107.06bn JAPAN'S trade surplus surged 37.6 per cent last year to a record Dollars 107.06bn (Pounds 70.40bn), as demand for imports weakened and the politically-sensitive surpluses with the US and European Community each rose by 14 per cent. The Japanese government is concerned that the record surplus, far exceeding the previous high of Dollars 82.7bn in 1986, will attract criticism from the new US Administration, which has indicated that it will take a tougher line on trade. Officials at the Ministry of Finance said an emergency economic package introduced late last year should stimulate demand for imports, but the Bank of Japan conceded that the surplus is unlikely to decline in the near future. Customs-cleared exports rose over the year by 8 per cent to Dollars 339.76bn, while imports were 1.7 per cent lower at Dollars 232.70bn, the first decline since 1986 and a result of falling capital investment and a slowing of demand for imported luxury goods, particularly those from Europe. During December, the surplus rose 12 per cent from the same month last year to Dollars 11.23bn, following a 4.3 per cent increase in exports and a slim 0.3 per cent gain in imports. General machinery exports expanded by 11.9 per cent and those of chemical products were 11.4 per cent higher. Japanese officials said the expansion of the surplus reflected fluctuations in exchange rates and commodity prices, but the export increase came partly from the attempts of Japanese industry to utilise excess capacity created during the late 1980s, when investment in new plant rose sharply. Over the year, exports of cars and other transport machinery rose by 11.9 per cent and semiconductor equipment by 19.7 per cent, two of the most sensitive areas of trade with the US and Europe. Imports of EC cars fell 6.7 per cent and of art works by 64.1 per cent, a by-product of the collapsing 'financial bubble'. The 1992 trade statistics reflected Japan's increasing reliance on Asian markets, and the gathering momentum of the Chinese economy. Japan's exports to China jumped 39.2 per cent and imports from China were 19 per cent higher, while Japan's surplus with the newly-industrialised economies of Asia rose 17.6 per cent. However, Japan's trade with Russia fell sharply, with exports down 49 per cent and imports 27.7 per cent lower. Exports to the UK rose 11.3 per cent to Dollars 12.3bn, while imports from the UK were down 2.4 per cent to Dollars 4.9bn.</p>

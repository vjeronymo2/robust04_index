			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / The Irish Referendum: Maastricht wins a vital breathing space - The main problem for the treaty is that governments have moved ahead of their voters WHEN he heard that the Danes had voted No in their Maastricht referendum, a very senior Commission official summed up the situation with undiplomatic frankness: 'Nous sommes dans la merde]' The Yes vote in the Irish referendum goes a long way to restore morale and rectify the balance, as does yesterday's vote in the French National Assembly. But neither of these events, welcome as they are, can change the fundamental problem: that the treaty has been rejected by one of the signatory states. In this sense, we are still 'dans la merde'. Instant solutions on offer tend to fall into three categories: 1, Dump the treaty. 2, Dump Jacques Delors. 3, Dump the Danes. The Danish referendum is invoked to prove that the treaty is no good, and should be abandoned/weakened/strengthened. Alternatively, Mr Delors is a symbol of everything that is wrong with the Community, because he is too federalist/French/socialist/European/successful/foreign/Christian Democrat/pleased with himself; so, off with his head] Finally, the Danes have shown that they are unsatisfactory Europeans, so they should be bundled out of the new Europe. Unfortunately, none of these nostrums will quite do. The twelve may very well be driven to a renegotiation, if they want to salvage anything from Maastricht. But to pretend that this road offers a simple solution is just not serious; does anyone know exactly why the Danes voted No and what would make them vote Yes? The British government's campaign against Mr Delors borders on the contemptible. Last December Mr John Major described Maastricht as 'Game, set and match to Britain'; he surely cannot now insinuate that a treaty which was negotiated by 12 sovereign governments was in fact foisted on them by Mr Delors. Dumping the Danes runs up against a battery of objections: it would be illegal, unconstitutional, anti-democratic, uncivilised and un-European. But the most serious objection to this particular prescription is its underlying assumption that this is a problem confined to Denmark. In fact, there are at least three large member states where Maastricht is or could be in trouble. Six months ago British spokesmen were adopting a most condescending attitude towards the ratification problems facing other member states; Britain, they said, was the only properly functioning democracy, it had had its debate, and parliament was solidly on board. Today, it appears that the government simply could not command a majority to ratify the treaty. One might expect Maastricht to have a hard time in Britain, because the British government remains as sceptical about the Community as ever. But the French and German governments are the chief architects of the new Europe, and they too are going through rough water. Reports from Germany say that ratification should eventually come right. But in the meantime, the debate is stirring heavy passions, and giving rise to a serious constitutional power struggle between the centre and the Lander. In France the parliament is half way to the necessary revision of the constitution; but the ratification referendum planned for the autumn will be fiercely contested by nationalists across the board, and no one can be sure that it will not go wrong for the government. These passionate debates throw an instructive light on the Maastricht dilemma. The commonest criticism of the treaty is that it is a portmanteau of heterogeneous ingredients, which is as muddled as it is unreadable. People do not like it, because they do not understand it; therefore, the argument goes on, we should improve the treaty by simplifying it. The passion of the arguments between the pros and the antis suggests an entirely different diagnosis. Yes, the treaty is an amalgam of different ingredients, which makes it baffling to the casual reader. This is a serious disadvantage at this stage in the ratification process, because we cannot know precisely why the Danes voted No, nor whether some small detailed revisions would get them to change their minds. But it is clear from the debates in Britain, France and Germany that their political elites understand the thrust of the treaty very well indeed: some like it, and some hate it, but they all know that this is a treaty with colossal political implications. It is these political implications which set Maastricht in a different class from previous agreements in the development of the Community. The customs union and the single market could be regarded as predictable, pre-defined policy contracts, from which the economy of each member state could be expected to draw separate national advantages. But Maastricht is quite different, in the sense that the two central pillars - monetary union and foreign policy - will involve jointly negotiated policies for maximising collective advantages in the name of the common interest. This does not, of course, mean that the Community is about to become a federation. But it does mean that going along with Maastricht calls for a much greater depth of political commitment than seemed to be required by the Treaty of Rome. This is perhaps the heart of the problem. The key characteristic of Maastricht is that it includes far-reaching objectives for action in the future. The member governments clearly believed that a large leap forward in Community integration was both necessary really count on their electorates to follow them? If that kind of commitment is to be reliable, then surely the treaty must be supported by more than a bare majority of the electorate. It must have a breadth of popular support which could survive a change of government. Does anybody think that Denmark would be a dependable partner in the construction of a common foreign policy, if the referendum had gone the other way, but only by 50.7 per cent? And what about France? Opinion polls predict three things: a majority may vote for Maastricht in September; the Gaullists may lead a right-wing government after the next general elections in March; and Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, will be a front-runner in the presidential elections in 1995. Yet half the Gaullists are bitterly hostile to Maastricht, and the party is so divided on the issue that Mr Chirac dare not say anything about it. If the Irish had voted No, Maastricht would have been lost with all hands. The fact that they have voted Yes gives the Community a desperately needed breathing space. But Europe's governments need to use the space, starting with their Lisbon summit next week, to consider whether they, like the Danish elite, have moved too far ahead of their electorates, and if so, what they need to do to get back in touch.

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Cater Allen in Pounds 23m acquisition Cater Allen Holdings, the discount house and banking group, is raising Pounds 32.3m via a rights issue to finance expansion, including the Pounds 23m acquisition of the banking operations of Jupiter Tyndall, the asset management group. The group also announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 18.9m) for the year to April 30. Profits for the discount house fell to Pounds 5.8m (Pounds 10.7m) because of last year's windfall from falling interest rates. Mr James Barclay, chairman and managing director, emphasised that 'the dividend policy of steady but sustainable growth was still firmly in place' despite proposing an unchanged final dividend of 20p making a total of 28p (27p), payable from lower earnings per share of 49p (56p). The deal will increase Jupiter Tyndall's net assets by Pounds 9m and leave it with cash of Pounds 30m, with which Jupiter said it would 'aggressively pursue growth in our investment management business' as well as increasing shareholders funds. It may acquire Queen Anne's Gate Asset Management, the fund management company responsible for investing the Pounds 2bn in assets of the privatised water companies. The performance of Queen Anne's Gate, which has been on the market for several months, has been consistently above-average. However, it has few clients and manages a large sum for each, making it vulnerable to a sudden loss of business. Cater's 1-for-3 rights issue will be priced at 410p per share, an 18 per cent discount to the 518p at which the shares closed unchanged, less the final dividend. Jupiter's shares were also unchanged, at 255p. Mr Barclay said the Jupiter banks acquisition would double retail banking deposits to Pounds 690m and reinforce its status as a specialist deposit taker. The effective price was Pounds 15.5m because Cater would be able to free Pounds 7.5m of capital by combining its bank arm with Jupiter's. It would eliminate some separate capitalisation and cut regulatory capital needs. The consolidated pre-tax profits of the Jupiter banks fell to Pounds 2.76m in the year to December 31, against Pounds 3.36m, due to lower interest rates. The stated profit would have been some Pounds 168,000 lower under Cater's accounting policies. Mr Barclay said Cater would use a further part of the proceeds of the issue to buy a 'substantial' trust company in Jersey, with which it was in negotiations. It would also apply extra capital to its discount house and stock lending arms. COMMENT Unchanged shares indicated a logical deal for both parties, with Jupiter obtaining enough for a bank which it gained as part of an earlier acquisition, and Cater broadening further from its discount house roots. After rejigging the capital, Cater is paying a historic multiple of about 11.5. That is in line with similar deposit-takers. But the Jupiter banks are not growing fast, and will have to be galvanised by the new management to ensure that the price is worthwhile.</p>

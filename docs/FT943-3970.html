			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Crimean president suspends parliament Crimea's president, Mr Yuri Meshkov, yesterday added fuel to a raging internal political fight by suspending parliament and taking full control over the autonomous republic. Mr Meshkov's step follows weeks of rising tensions on the separatist Ukrainian peninsula which came to a head last Wednesday when the local parliament voted to strip the president of his powers. For now, the internal power struggle in Crimea does not threaten Ukrainian-Russian relations. It is primarily a domestic dispute over political style, policy and the pace of attempts to break with Kiev and reintegrate with Russia. But Crimea remains the sorest point in often tense relations between Kiev and Moscow. Speaking on Radio Crimea Mr Meshkov called parliament 'corrupt' and 'unworthy' and asserted control over local councils and the media. Police surrounded the parliament building, stopping MPs from entering. Mr Meshkov promised new elections by December and a referendum on a new constitution by April 9. At a special evening session, the parliament declared Mr Meshkov's decree unconstitutional and urged Russia, Ukraine and the UN to protest. In Kiev, the Ukrainian ministry of interior said Mr Meshkov had exceeded his authority, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma said the conflict 'threatened security' in Ukraine. Mr Kuchma, who won massive support from Crimean voters in Ukrainian presidential elections in July, met Mr Meshkov on Saturday, and Mr Meshkov's aides claimed their president had Mr Kuchma's support. Transferred from Russia to Ukraine in 1954, the pre-dominantly Russian region expressed its dissatisfaction with the disastrous economic policies of the Ukrainian government by endorsing Mr Meshkov's pro-Russian platform in Crimean presidential elections last January.</p>

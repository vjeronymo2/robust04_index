			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Jobs: Don't bar the tool, blame the trainer - Complaints that new technology encourages mental laziness are somewhat less than new YET again the Jobs column is appealing to readers to help to settle an argument. This time, though, the vehement reactions when the point first came up suggest that my view on the matter won't get anywhere near as much support as you gave me when I last made such an appeal 13 weeks ago. On that occasion the issue was whether a certain psychological test was right to regard disdain for the conversation of 'ordinary, habit-bound conventional people' as a mark of creative intelligence. A handsome 95 per cent of your responses agreed that, by and large, it wasn't. Today's issue is more directly practical. It arose at a gathering held at Nottingham University a few days ago by the central body serving the associations of former students of the United Kingdom's universities - the Conference of University Convocations and Graduate Associations. The initial session could well have been sub-titled 'From the sublime to the ridiculous'. The opening two speakers were both eminent academics. The first was Professor Gareth Williams of London University. The second was Dr Bill Newton-Smith of Oxford, now also taking a leading part in the creation of the new Central European University funded by George Soros. Both were largely optimistic about the future of higher educational institutions. Then came the Jobs column, which was less so. But the argument that needs to be settled didn't arise from what any of us said in our set-piece speeches. It boiled up in the discussion afterwards when, to a question on educational methods, I replied critically by citing the case of a colleague who, as well as strumming a keyboard part-time as a journalist, is taking a full-time degree course. On starting it, wishing to be sure her home computer's software was compatible with the college's system, she asked her tutor which word-processing program was in use. His response was to warn her against relying on a computer when producing her student essays. The reason, he said, was that in all her examinations she would have to work in long-hand. She would therefore be wise to keep her fist in for protracted stints of pen-pushing. Now that strikes me as a wasteful requirement. True, the development of handwriting skill is essential in education's earlier stages, and it remains the simplest means of framing shortish communications throughout life. But the practice of churning out thousands of words in long-hand over periods of hours is surely obsolescent. While there is no harm in folk doing it as a labour of love (as they might make wooden cart-wheels), to force it on students at university level is a different matter. Given their increasingly probable need to use a keyboard in the business of earning their living, they'd be better occupied in developing the requisite skills as part of their studies. So I upped and said as much to the conference. Whereupon nigh a hundred pairs of eyes turned evil and zeroed in on me. Besides being awed, I was startled. Such a re-action might have been expected if the audience had consisted entirely of academics, who can usually be relied on to leap to the defence of their institutional habits. But a good many of those present were business people. Mercifully, instead of leaving me to be savaged, Bill Newton-Smith promptly riposted that if he had his way, except in subjects where computers are now indispensable, students would be barred from using word-processors for their course-work. At which a large part of the mob broke into spontaneous applause. The reason he gave, which also drew approval, was that the toil of writing long-hand concentrates the mind on producing succinct and disciplined results. By contrast, computer technology tends to blind students to the need to apply hard and deep thought to a question, by making it easier for them just to smother it with large numbers of words. Despite being taken aback, I was disposed to argue in detail that it ain't necessarily so. In the event, given that the consensus of the meeting was against me and that people were impatient to move to other topics, I refrained - which might give my return to the argument from the safety of a newspaper office the mien of a double act of cowardice. Even so, on reflection, it seems worse just to let the issue drop. For I doubt that the long-hand lobbyists' case is as strong as their commitment to it is fierce. Take for instance Dr Newton-Smith's claim that word-processors encourage mental laziness. It is far from the first time that such charges have been made against an important technical advance. Even the first invention of lettering, enabling us to write things down instead of storing them in our heads, was criticised on similar grounds by Plato in the last part of the Phaedrus some 2,400 years ago. In it, he has the supposed inventor of letters go before his king, boasting that the result would be to make people 'wiser, and better able to remember'. To which the king replies: '. . . you, as being the father of letters, have ascribed to them now in your fondness exactly the reverse of their real effects. For this invention of yours will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn it, by causing them to neglect their memory inasmuch as, from their confidence in writing, they will recollect by the external aid of foreign symbols, and not by the internal use of their own faculties. Your discovery, therefore, is a medicine not for memory, but for recollection - for recalling to, not for keeping in mind. 'And you are providing for your disciples a show of wisdom without the reality. For, acquiring by your means much information unaided by instruction, they will appear to possess much knowledge, while in fact they will for the most part know nothing at all; and, moreover, be disagreeable people to deal with, as having become wise in their own conceit, instead of truly wise.' Oddly enough, I have not heard anyone recently urging that students be barred from taking notes and reading written texts. So perhaps the effects have turned out less bad than the long-hand lobby's ancient precursor feared. Nor do I see why the results need be worse where word-processors are concerned. Any tool can be used either wisely or foolishly, and there is nothing in the tool itself that decides which of the two will be the case. The decisive factor would seem to be whether the wise application is trained into the users by their educators. If people capable of giving such training are scarce in the universities, there's certainly no lack of them in certain places elsewhere. The printable name for them is 'editors'. The archetypal models react to an unacceptable piece of writing by waiting until the deadline is sickeningly close, then throwing it back at you with the command to re-write it because it is wrong. There's no use asking why it is wrong. Even if they'd time to tell you, they probably do not know. All they know is that it is wrong, and that's that. You have no choice but to find out why for yourself and set things right. As a learning method, that is surely more effective than not just writing the piece out long-hand, but carving it in stone.</p>

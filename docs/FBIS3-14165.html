[Kamal] I have received no instructions from the Palestinian  leadership about stopping negotiations today. I have received  no such information from Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the  negotiating delegation. As I understood from some sources, the  point is that [PLO Executive Committee member] Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh  said that last night's incidents in Hebron and their results  will influence the course of negotiations. I agree with what  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh says. The subject is not marginal. Anger  still rages and trouble is increasing. Our people are suffering  daily blows from everywhere. So, this will certainly have an  influence. But, negotiations are one thing and what happens in  Hebron is something else.    [Mu'addi] What is the present situation after the Tunis  talks  between the Israeli delegation and the Palestinian leadership?  What subjects are on the agenda of today's meeting in Cairo?    [Kamal] Based on my reports through last night, I think the  Israeli side has positive tendencies that will be demonstrated  today during the negotiations between Dr. Nabil Sha'th and Mr.  Amnon Shahaq on interpreting the question of protecting the  Palestinians in the occupied territories, starting with the dear  city of Hebron, its honorable people, and its heroic  steadfastness. Therefore, this question will be the test for  the arrangements that will be agreed on by the Cairo  negotiations.    [Mu'addi] PLO representative in Cairo Sa'id Kamal, thank you  very much.    [Kamal] Thank you.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Communist Renewal Secretary Fausto </F> Bertinotti by Carlo Fusi; place and date not given:  "Bertinotti: Never in a Government With Ciampi"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fusi] Bertinotti, why are you  not saying anything at his point in the election campaign? Will  the left win?    [Bertinotti] I really do not know. I do not want to give the  impression of being reticent, because I am not like this. I  think that when you make a commitment, when you fight, when you  battle, you must not be distracted by forecasts. Also because  forecasts are always either an exorcism or a desire. You must  be committed to win. That is all.    [Fusi] You have just returned from Bari....    [Bertinotti] Yes, from an election meeting where I saw a  great deal of the enthusiasm for the old PCI [Italian Communist  Party]. And a lot of young people are among our followers.    [Fusi] Let me finish. Why not go to London? [Achille]  Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS]  went, as did Roberto Maroni [Northern League lower house floor  leader]. What is holding you back?    [Bertinotti] I am not going because I do not speak English  well.    [Fusi] Or because you fear that when the city bankers see  you  they will run away terrorized?    [Bertinotti] I do not intend criticizing the others, but  since the Italians will be the ones to vote, the right thing to  do is to dedicate ourselves to them and to their sovereignty.  Once we used to go to the United States, then to London....  When talking about the elections, I prefer Italy.    [Fusi] Let us talk about elections then. I will draw a  picture. The left gains the absolute majority. What will  Communist Renewal do, ask for its own ministries?    [Bertinotti] The technical discussion over the composition  of  the government is entirely premature. If the progressives  really win, the government structure would have to be reexamined  in light of the objective of renewal and transformation.    [Fusi] Translated this means: less ministries?    [Bertinotti] Yes, and composed differently. The ministries  are currently divided according to the administrative concept of  politics. I will give you an example: If the central issue is  the battle against unemployment, how can it be handled without  considering labor, the environment, and the territory at the  same time?    [Fusi] Okay, but the communist ministers?    [Bertinotti] If the progressives win the absolute majority  they would have a moral obligation to govern alongside the same  aggregation with which they won.    [Fusi] And who should go to Palazzo Chigi [government seat]?    [Bertinotti] First I must say that we are against giving the  name of a premier because it distorts the sense of this  political battle which must be centered around programs, not  men. The characteristic of the left is that it is the  antagonist of the right and an alternative to the center.    [Fusi] Yes, but the programs are marching with the legs of  the men who embody them....    [Bertinotti] I am against speeding up the times for what I  consider to be a counterreform, the direct election of the head  of government. These elections are already suggesting to many  that those like us, who supported the validity of the  proportional system, were right. I do not want us to fall into  a worse situation now with even more summit meetings. Once the  polls close, we must see which of the various elements that gave  rise to the progressive alliance, which I rightly support, has  taken hold best. I am referring not only to votes, but also to  the topics and leaders during the election campaign.    [Fusi] Do not slink away, Bertinotti... [PDS Deputy  Secretary] d'Alema has reproposed the current prime minister.  What will you do? Ciampi yes, or Ciampi no?    [Bertinotti] We have already clearly expressed our firm  opposition to the nomination of Ciampi and will not change our  opinion. This is by no means a sign of disregard toward a  worthy person in the Italian political scene as far as his moral  profile is concerned. However, we will not fail to show our  dissent over the general lines that characterized his  government, and that the progressives must discontinue. In  particular, in a central issue: This government has not carried  out any political innovation in the fight against unemployment,  rather it has continued along the lines of the Amato government,  which was one of the causes of unemployment.    [Fusi] What about the institutional government?    [Bertinotti] Never, never. It would be a paradox. The  elections are being carried out in a context of bitter  opposition between the right and the progressives. Would we  have to follow with a new transformism, saying that we were  joking? No way.    [Fusi] Another topic, taxing treasury bills. Are you  surprised that even Berlusconi's economic expert Antonio Martino  is now demonstrating the possibilities?    [Bertinotti] First, this proposal comes precisely from the  economists of the left, starting with August Graziani. Then, it  is shared by people like Mario Monti, rector at the Bocconi  University, who stands at the center of Italian economic life.  What do I mean? That there is a certain amount of reason behind  this proposal. Since I think that there is still a great deal of  confusion over this, I would like to emphasize that I have  always talked about taxing anybody who has more than 200 million  lire in treasury bills. There is a great difference. The  proposal made by Forza Italia in fiscal matters is entirely  incompatible with mine. Berlusconi has the opposite idea: less  taxes for the rich and more taxes for the poor.    [Fusi] Let us draw another picture. The left wins but  without getting the absolute majority. At that point would you  accept the idea of an accord between the progressives and the  center?    [Bertinotti] No. We do not want to force anybody. However,  we interpret the mobilization of the progressives, their entry  into the field, including the declaration of intent that  represented their calling card, as being a political proposal  that is antagonistic to the right and an alternative to the  moderates. We are aiming at the victory of the progressives but  without any subordinate clauses. Rather, we think that any  subordinate clause, starting with an alliance with the  moderates, would seriously damage the left in this election  campaign, and would be an error after the elections.    [Fusi] What if the balance of power depends on the center?    [Bertinotti] We have no ideological prejudices but we want  to  change the country. The proposals made by the center are the  continuation of Amato and Ciampi. They are either  undecipherable or of a moderate nature. We want a break with  the past, they do not. There must be preventive consultations  and discussions among the progressives. Then each will make his  own choice.    [Fusi] Bertinotti, once and for all: Is it better to lose  alone or to win together with the others?    [Bertinotti] This question embodies the damnation of the  more radical forces that we identify ourselves with. Both  routes are catastrophic because they lead to a subordinate  position in one case and a ghetto in the other. We defeated  both routes at our congress by adhering to the progressive pole,  and bringing inside the pole the contents of the radical  petitions for change. [passage omitted]    [Fusi] Let us return to politics. You say that the left must  win. To do this, however, it must get at least part of the  moderates' votes. What do you offer them to convince them to  line up with the progressives?    [Bertinotti] One basic consideration. These elections will  decide between two different social models, between two  different types of civilization, as happened in Italy in 1948  and 1953 with the fraudulent law. I hope that the moderate  alignment understands that there is room for them and for their  requests in the model of civilization that the progressives are  proposing, because it is a highly pluralistic model that  respects everything and everybody. On the right instead there  is an authoritative model, which is strongly oppressive, with  the absolute prevalence of business and market interests over  those of society. This model can only generate polarization and  acute conflicts. For this reason I think that the moderates  must vote for the progressives: to avoid finding themselves in  front of a country divided in two. I add, and this time I refer  to the progressives, that politics is not geometry:  preestablished spaces and property to be occupied. Politics is  the movement of forces. The moderate side has moved to the  left, it was involved in the change when the forces of the left  were able to create a movement and were able to put a pervasive  culture on the field. And not when they simply followed the  moderates, thinking that they were occupying a space. [passage  omitted]</p>

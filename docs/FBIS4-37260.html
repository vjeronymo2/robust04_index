			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, June 18 (INA) -- The Yemen has utterly denied  the eruption of battles in the oil-rich Shabwah Province.    A Yemeni official source said that reports circulated by the  secessionists on the killing of 50 military men during the past  48 hours were groundless.    The source confirmed that Shabwah Province was now under  control of the legitimate forces.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Moscow cash crisis hits German exports BETWEEN 1954 and last year, Sachsische Kunststofftechnik Freital exported 12,000 plastic moulding machines from East Germany to the Soviet Union. This year, it has yet to export one. 'Demand for our products in this country is so huge that we could never produce enough,' said Mr Kurt Mitsch, the firm's representative in Moscow. 'But the Russian customers have no money.' For 40 years, Russia was the main customer for East German products. But last year's collapse of Comecon, the economic community of the Communist Bloc, led to a sharp drop in East German trade with Russia. The recent fall of the rouble, a rising D-Mark and severe cash shortages in Russian industry have slowed German trade with Russia to a trickle. In 1991, East German supplies to the former Soviet Union dropped 50 per cent to DM10bn (Dollars 6.2bn), and another steep drop is expected this year. Many exporters have cut working hours and staff, while the textile industry may have to lay off 90 per cent of its 450,000 employees. For Deutsche Wagonbau, maker of nearly all the coaches used on Russian railways, Russian demand is three times higher than its production capacity. But marketing director Mr Hans-Dieter Heinrich says Deutsche Wagonbau has yet to find a way to finance the DM1.5bn delivery of about 1,500 coaches and cargo wagons to Russia in 1993, a deal that covers 70 per cent of its annual production. If the Russian government can not find the money and the German government does not intervene, Deutsche Wagonbau will have to shut down much of its production line, Mr Heinrich said. He fears for 11,000 jobs at the factory itself, and for at least another 60,000 jobs in the supply industry. East German businessmen accuse the German and Russian government of dragging their feet on credits. Most exports from the former GDR to Russia should be paid through Hermes export guarantees, provided by the German government with preferential treatment for East German companies. So far, however, only half of the nearly DM5bn allocated for export credits has been used in Russia. The Russian and German governments had been expected to finalise the Hermes credits by May, but recently the deadline was moved to March 1993. According to Mitsch and other businessmen, the German government has delayed the process by demanding new guarantees from the Russian government, particularly on the malfunctioning bank of international trade, the Vnesheconombank. The Russian government has in the meantime changed its list of priority goods, requesting medical and consumer goods instead of machine parts, for which the Hermes credits were intended. Mr Mitsch fears that his business in Russia may not survive to see the credits approved. For the German government, previously the largest lender and investor in Russia, the bill for bailing out the East German economy has been bigger than expected, and there is simply no money to pay for Russia's bill as well.</p>

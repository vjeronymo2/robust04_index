			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fairfax exceeds prospectus forecast JOHN Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, yesterday unveiled pre-tax profits for the year to June which exceeded forecasts in its pre-flotation prospectus. Profits before interest and tax increased by 9.8 per cent to ADollars 129.8m (USDollars 93.3m), on turnover up 2.8 per cent to ADollars 729.1m. The group said in March that pre-tax profits would increase to ADollars 123m on turnover of ADollars 723m. Fairfax also said it was entitled to ADollars 650m in tax credits, up from ADollars 323m in the prospectus, which suggests the group is unlikely to pay income tax for at least five years. Sir Zelman Cowen, chairman, said the result was 'extremely good' in the light of 'a very difficult economic environment' caused by Australia's slow recovery from recession. Earnings since June had been 'broadly in line with projections, despite the continuing recession and uneven trends in advertising volumes.' Analysts said profitability had increased markedly since January, when Fairfax was acquired for ADollars 1.4bn by the Tourang consortium led by Mr Black's UK Daily Telegraph. The group said second-half earnings before tax and interest were 11 per cent higher at ADollars 60.1m, on revenue of ADollars 357.4m, up 1.6 per cent on the prospectus forecast. Operating costs fell 0.4 per cent to ADollars 285.8m. Net profit was 29 per cent higher than expected at ADollars 15.5m, after net interest expenses of ADollars 33.1m and income tax of ADollars 11.5m. However, the group said the tax bill would be offset against the tax credits. It did not declare a dividend, in line with its prospectus forecasts. Fairfax said circulation of all its main titles increased, but advertising volumes fell sharply. However, advertising revenue was unchanged at ADollars 534m, indicating a significant improvement in margins. More than 160 staff had left through early retirements and voluntary redundancies suggesting that costs are likely to fall further. Following a flotation in May, the Telegraph owns 15 per cent of Fairfax. Hellman and Friedman, the US investment bank, owns 5 per cent in the form of non-voting debentures, and Australian financial institutions own the rest.</p>

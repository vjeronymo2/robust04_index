			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irina Savvateyeva: "Scandal in the Duma: </F> `Decembrists' Slam the Door"]    [Text] On Wednesday [15 June] the leaders of the "12  December Liberal-Democratic Union" deputies' group said that its  members felt they could no longer participate in the Duma's  plenary sittings. They marched out of the hall. This action  was prompted by the cancellation of the decision to register the  group.    The cancellation of the decision to officially register the  group, made 14 April, was proposed by the State Duma Work  Organization Committee. The reason being that at the time of  voting, as it turns out, the group did not have the requisite 35  deputies' applications.    But Boris Fedorov, the group's leader, categorically denied  the charge. Fedorov claims that the "Decembrists" put in 38  applications for registration, and copies exist. But all  efforts by representatives of the group to find out from the  committee which applications are deemed to have been forged  failed.    The controversial question was submitted for the State Duma  council's consideration last Tuesday [14 June], but the  discussion was postponed for a week in order to establish all  the facts.    But Duma Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mityukov sanctioned the  circulation of the decision to disband the "Decembrists" among  the deputies without waiting for the facts, Boris Fedorov and  Irina Khakamada said at a press conference. The group's members  regard this decision as illegal and are refusing to participate  in the Duma's work until it is revoked.    In his assessment of what had happened, Boris Fedorov said  that it had been "the usual political provocation." He saw the  coalition of "Zhirinovskiyites" and "Russia's Choice" people,  who "have been gnawing away for six weeks now at the question of  the registration of the `Decembrists' deputies' group", as being  behind the "provocation."    The former have said more than once that they are unhappy  with the fact that the "Decembrists" now also call themselves  liberal democrats.    "Russia's Choice's" involvement is demonstrated, in  Fedorov's  view, by the fact that both Mr. Mityukov and Duma Work  Organization Committee Chief Vladimir Bauer are deputies of this  faction.    The fact that Fedorov is fighting with Zhirinovskiy over  more  than just the right to be involved with the liberal democratic  camp is nothing new, God knows. Some observers tend to see the  conflict in the democrats' camp as a consequence of the changes  that took place at the last "Russia's Choice" party congress.    This party, as is known, contains two nuclei -- the  "Russia's  Choice" movement and the "Democratic Russia" movement,  coexisting not without some friction. And whereas last October,  at the congress of the "Russia's Choice" electoral bloc,  representatives of the former movement emerged in the top roles  (and they included such figures as Fedorov, Burbulis,  Poltoranin, Yushenkov, Murashev, and Golovkov), at the latest  congress the "Democratic Russia" people (Zaslavskiy, Shneyder,  and others) prevailed. Now, according to observers, the victors  will endeavor to keep other representatives of the democratic  movement from becoming party leader.    In this connection it is suggested that the Gaydar-Fedorov  split could well have its roots in the confrontation between the  founders of the democratic movement and other representatives of  democrats.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, Jan. 1 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui  Saturday [1 January] called on Beijing authorities to ease  hostility toward Taiwan and work for nurturing mutual  understanding and trust in order to create a "win-win" situation  of mutual benefit and reciprocity.    "Only in this way can the reunification of China bring good  fortune, happiness and glory to the Chinese people," Li said in  his New Year's message delivered in a grand ceremony at the  presidential office marking the beginning of the 83rd year of  the Republic of China [ROC].    "We clearly understand that the greatest problem between the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait is the lack of genuine mutual  understanding. The two sides interact, but their is no mutual  trust," the president said.    "Therefore," Li said, "we sincerely call upon the Chinese  Communist authorities to attach great importance to the welfare  of the people on both sides of the strait, renounce their  hostile and confrontational attitude, cherish the brotherhood of  people on both sides, and work toward nurturing mutual  understanding and trust in the new year."    Li also called on people here to strive for greater  achievements in the new year so that the Chinese nation can be  really proud of itself in the 21st century.    "Even though this is a year most full of hope for us, it is  also a year in which we must struggle most," Li said.    He emphasized the importance of seeking a significant  breakthrough in economic development. "The strength nurtured by  our economic development has allowed us to improve the life of  our citizenry and stand firmly in the international community,"  the president noted.    Li said the government has introduced a set of stimulus  measures designed to resolve the problem of slackening economic  growth. The measures include increasing spending on public  works, encouraging private investment and promoting the building  of an operational center for the Asia-Pacific region.    Li also pledged to expand Taiwan's foreign relations,  saying,  "we will expand our participation in international activities,  fulfill our obligations to the international community, win  international goodwill and develop practical relations, all for  the purpose of building up the international status due us."    Li described 1994 as the year when people here must further  advance Chinese culture with new vigor. "At a time when the ROC  is achieving outstanding successes, both politically and  economically, we must make greater efforts to raise the quality  of our spiritual life and make progress in our cultural life."    On the third-phase constitutional reform, Li said, "it will  have to take into account the collective wisdom and the  consensus of the people, the fundamental framework of the  five-power Constitution, the present state of our constitutional  development and the future needs of national unification."    Li concluded by saying that the longer term welfare of the  public demands the joint concern of everyone, and a promising  future for our national demands the joint efforts of all to help  set in motion.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL OPENS OVER FATAL '88 MOBIL REFINERY BLAST  </P> <P> A fatal explosion at Mobil Oil's Torrance refinery two years ago was a "tragic,  unpredictable, unavoidable accident," not a crime, said an attorney for a  contract company whose officials went on trial in Municipal Court Thursday.  </P> <P> In opening arguments for a rare criminal trial on industrial safety violations,  attorney Warren L. Ettinger argued that no one should be blamed for the July  15, 1988, explosion of a tank at the refinery because no one knows exactly why  the tank blew up.  </P> <P> Prosecutors, however, say they know exactly what caused the explosion:  Supervisors and executives of Cal Cat Chemical Co., a Benecia-based contract  company, did not tell their workers about the dangers of the chemicals they  were using and allowed them to create an explosive mix inside the tank.  </P> <P> Cal Cat employee Winston Jones, 30, was standing on top of the tank when the  blast hit. He died instantly.  </P> <P> One of his co-workers, David Moustafi, suffered burns over three-quarters of  his body. Another co-worker, Jerry Lekberg, lost hearing completely in one ear  and still experiences frequent flashbacks.  </P> <P> A year after the blast, the city of Torrance filed misdemeanor charges against  Cal Cat Chemical; the company's president, Paul Taylor; its research director,  Frank Straw, and on-site supervisor James Hernandez. A Municipal Court judge in  October dismissed charges that also had been filed against Mobil and two of its  executives. Prosecutors are appealing that decision.  </P> <P> The trial, expected to take three to four weeks, will feature dozens of  technical witnesses on the chemical aspects of what the workers were doing,  their training, their injuries, as well as testimony from the two survivors.  Mobil officials may also be called.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony G. Patchett told jurors that the explosion took  place as Jones, Moustafi and Lekberg tried to treat sludge removed from the  bottom of a sour water storage tank.  </P> <P> Sour water, a waste product of refining gasoline, is contaminated with sulfur  compounds, most typically toxic hydrogen sulfide. The rotten egg-smelling  substance must be neutralized, and oily hydrocarbons, rust particles and other  contaminants must be removed from the sludge before it can be taken to a  landfill.  </P> <P> Cal Cat Chemical, which had been working under contract at Mobil for about two  years, had been hired to conduct that process.  </P> <P> An initial attempt, using chemicals called surfactants and a potassium  permanganate solution, failed. The explosion took place, Patchett said, because  defendants Taylor and Straw then decided to alter the process by using hydrogen  peroxide.  </P> <P> According to prosecutors, the workers were not told to dilute the new chemical  before adding it to the process. The concentrated hydrogen peroxide, Patchett  said, created an uncontrollable reaction with chemicals in the sludge, causing  the explosion.  </P> <P> Cal Cat officials, Patchett said, "failed to give any written safety  instructions to their employees, failed to explain the dangers of hydrogen  peroxide and failed to monitor temperatures in the tank which could have  provided some warning of a problem."  </P> <P> Defense attorneys, however, said Cal Cat officials hired Moustafi, who had been  trained as a chemical engineer, to prevent just such a problem.  </P> <P> Moustafi "had the responsibility of testing the (hydrogen peroxide) to see if  it would indeed work. He did so, and it did work," Ettinger said. "Mr. Moustafi  did what he believed was right."  </P> <P> The company, Ettinger argued, should not be responsible for training the  engineer it had hired as an expert.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Moustafi did not have enough training and experience to make  that judgment and should not have been given that responsibility.  </P> <P> The trial is being held at the Best Western Sunrise Hotel in Redondo Beach  because the cramped Torrance courthouse does not have enough courtrooms to  handle lengthy trials, said South Bay Municipal Court Judge Josh M. Fredricks.  </P></p>

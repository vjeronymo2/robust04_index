The document says that "with the sanction of several  officials of Riga's local government bodies and under their  direct participation, on January 10, 1994, illegal actions were  undertaken with respect to Russian Ambassador Aleksandr Rannikh  and Major Generals Nikolay Taylakov and Anatoliy Vodopyanov who  serve in the Northern-Western Group of Forces."    The generals were detained by the municipal police and,  accompanied by the guard, were sent in the direction of the  Russian-Latvian border to be deported from Latvia. The generals  were freed according to the private order of the president of  the Latvian Republic.    Latvia's Foreign Ministry offers its apologies for this  action.    The Foreign Ministry explains that a preliminary  investigation was conducted due to the above mentioned incident;  as a result, the Cabinet of Ministers passed a decision to  release chairman of the local government body in Riga's  Vidzemskiy region Andreis Rucs from his post; the Prosecutor's  Office of the Latvian Republic has launched proceedings due to  abuse of official authorities on the part of Rucs.    Given the fact that these actions were committed on the eve  of the inter-state talks, the Latvian party views this event as  an attempt by Latvian circles to hinder process of the  negotiations and to worsen Russian-Latvian relations.    The document says that the Government of the Latvian  Republic  will do its utmost to prevent identical acts of provocative  nature and notes that in the future all issues related to the  Russian forces' withdrawal will be solved by means of  negotiations.    Rita Aksenoka, aide to Latvia's Prosecutor General, told  Interfax that on Wednesday Andreis Rucs voluntarily came to the  prosecutor's office. At present he is being interrogated.    Speaking at a briefing in the Russian capital some time  earlier, spokesman of Russian Foreign Ministry Grigory Karasin  declared that Moscow "awaits an expanded official answer of the  Latvian party regarding our demarches."    "Taking into consideration that the January 10 events were  the most serious, though not the first one, provocation of  Latvia's extreme nationalist forces it is important that all  concrete organizers of this action will be punished and Latvian  authorities will undertake necessary measures to prevent similar  dangerous incidents in the future," emphasized Karasin.</p>

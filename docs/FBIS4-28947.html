			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in a  letter to the international environmental organization  Greenpeace supported its call for the total elimination of  nuclear weapons, the Seoul-based Radio Voice of National  Salvation reported.    Noting that the universal elimination of nuclear weapons  must  be realized at an early date for peace of mankind, the letter  said:    To this end, the United States, "a chief nuclear culprit"  which was the first in the world to develop and use nuclear  weapons and, at present, has the largest number of them, must  eliminate its nuclear weapons first and, for the present,  withdraw all its nuclear weapons from South Korea and Northeast  Asia.    The international reactionary forces including the United  States must give up their dirty nuclear intrigue against the  North, and the nuclear armament of South Korea and the Japanese  authorities being promoted with their tacit approval must be  stopped at once.    The letter said Hanminjon will always merge its voice of  justice with the Greenpeace in active response to its just  initiative and appeal and make all efforts to expand the  movement for their realization everywhere Hanminjon is present  and to all the governments, political parties and organizations  with which it has contact.</p>

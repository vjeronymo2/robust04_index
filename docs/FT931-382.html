			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Benetton beats trend with 12.1% advance BENETTON, Italy's best-known maker of casual clothes, raised net profits by 12.1 per cent to L184.7bn (Dollars 116.8m) last year in spite of the general slowdown in worldwide consumer spending. The company, which saw group sales climb by 9.1 per cent to L2,512bn, indicated its confidence in the future with a L50-a-share dividend increase to L350. Operating earnings jumped by 14.4 per cent to L356.6bn. Mr Luciano Benetton, managing director, has admitted that 1993 could be a more difficult year in view of recession in many markets. But he has expressed confidence that sales should continue to rise strongly, with exports likely to be boosted by the steep fall in the value of the lira. Among the few jarring points in the results was a L154bn surge in group net debts to L325bn. Benetton said the increase stemmed from the purchase last year of four local apparel-makers with which it worked closely and whose borrowings had now been consolidated. Adjusted for the acquisitions, group net debt would have remained unchanged, it said. In spite of the recession, Benetton managed to find particular pockets of growth in individual areas. For the third year running, the Sisley brand grew strongly, with a 24 per cent leap in sales, while SAB, Benetton's socks and accessories subsidiary, virtually doubled sales to L96.3bn from L51.8bn in 1991. Among other areas now being exploited are shoes and shirts. In recent months, Benetton has started to create a new chain of stores, named 'and', specialising in shirts. The goods sold are produced by Azimut, a newly-formed manufacturer created from the merger of two private companies in which Benetton has a 50 per cent stake. The 'and' chain now has about 50 shops in Italy and abroad.</p>

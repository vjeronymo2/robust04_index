With the fall of communism came the  end of the division of Europe between a democratic one and the  one subjugated to the Soviet empire. The cold war ended and the  world stopped suffering from the tension between the  Euro-American civilization, based on respect for human freedom,  and the imperialistic ambitions of Soviet communism -- a tension  that could have been fatal to the human race. An unnatural  European order, resting on an armed coexistence of its free and  non-free parts, has collapsed. We are now living in a time of  dramatic searching for a new order, in which no one would be  subjugated or endangered any longer, and which would enable all  European peoples and states to enjoy an atmosphere of peaceful  cooperation backed by a peaceful arrangement extending  throughout the entire northern hemisphere. Progress toward this  new order is a big -- I will even venture to say historic ---  task of our time and our generation.    I view our today's meeting as an important moment during  this  journey. The American president's visit to Prague, coming  immediately after the NATO summit in Brussels, is not just a  visit to the Czech Republic. It is also a visit to Central  Europe, and I see it as proof that the United States and NATO  are well aware of the great importance that stability, security  and peace in our region have for peace in all of Europe and for  the security of the United States. Truly, history is amply  teaching us that ignoring this area never paid off for anyone,  that instability here always inevitably grew into instability on  a pan-European scale, that our loss of freedom had pernicious  consequences for everyone, and that lack of interest in our fate  or policies sacrificing us for an illusory peace always led to  general catastrophes. I believe that the west realizes this and  that its effort to open its political and security structures to  Central European nations comes not just from respect for their  desires and interests, but from its own desires and interests as  well. For me, our meeting is proof of that.    Please allow me a few remarks now about the position of the  Czech Republic on the main themes of this meeting.    1. Our country feels it is a legitimate part of Western  Euro-American civilization, and shares all of its fundamental  values. It does not see itself as someone looking for a new  home. We have our home. For centuries, we have helped shape  its spiritual and political values. If today we are aspiring to  become a regular member of the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, we do so above all because we subscribe to the  same values of civilization which it protects, and because we  want to take part in protecting them. So the issue is not only  that we, as a small state in an exposed position, seek allies,  security ties and guarantees, but also that we are willing to  take our share of the joint responsibility for the fate of  freedom and democracy on our continent -- the responsibility on  which NATO was founded.    2. The Czech Republic welcomes the Partnership For Peace  proposal as a good point of departure in NATO's quest for a new  identity and new role in new conditions. We know that Western  civilization is an open society in principle, and for that  reason we consider it logical and right that the alliance is  actively opening itself up in this way to all European countries  and is thus assuming the role of a true stabilizing core of  European security. We also appreciate that Partnership For  Peace allows individual approaches to different countries. In  our opinion, everything depends on what specific forms and  contents the project will take in the various countries. The  Czech Republic wants to do everything it can to ensure that  within Partnership For Peace, the relationship between our  country and the alliance be as solid as possible, to enable us  to get closer to NATO fast, and to eventually result in full  membership. In other words, we do not see Partnership For Peace  as a substitute for full membership, or as the ultimate  achievement in our endeavor to work together with the alliance,  but as a beginning of our cooperation as a first step toward  joining NATO.    3. The Czech Republic is well aware that it is neither  possible nor desirable to isolate Russia, and that the  relationship between the Alliance and Russia, as a large,  Euro-Asian nuclear power, should be as good as possible. That  is in the interests of the whole world. For our part, we have  been systematically striving to have good relations with Russia,  Ukraine and other nations of the former Soviet Union, whether or  not they are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.  True, the journey of the Russian society to democracy and  market-based prosperity will be painful, complicated and long,  and the outside world has only limited possibilities to exert a  positive influence on the internal developments in Russia.  Therefore, the task now is to develop such a relationship  between NATO and Russia that will respect all the specific  circumstances of Russia's position as well as of possible future  developments. There, too, Partnership For Peace could be a  point of departure toward that kind of a special relationship  which, rather than obstruct NATO's expansion, should become a  natural background for the process. Expansion of NATO would not  mean bringing an enemy closer to Russia's borders. On the  contrary, it would mean bringing closer a partner and a zone of  stability and democracy, and that is in Russia's fundamental  interest as well. We therefore definitely reject those Russian  voices that would wish to prevent such expansion, interpret it  as endangerment, or even call for a renewal of a Russian sphere  of influence in Central Europe. We are an independent state, and  we decide ourselves about our affiliations and our policies.    4. Naturally, it is for each of our respective countries to  determine for itself how energetically and quickly it will move  to give Partnership For Peace a content meeting its interests  and possibilities. At the same time, however, we deem it  important to cultivate good relations among ourselves, work  together wherever it is advantageous to all and in their joint  interests, and thus maintain a good regional climate. Good  relations with neighbors are in the fundamental interest of each  of our countries as well as in the fundamental interest of  Europe as a whole.    As we agreed during conversations with the representatives  of  central European nations who are taking part in this meeting,  our countries have very similar views on the issues I just  talked about. That surely is a gratifying circumstance, and it  is to the benefit of us all.    The Czech Republic is prepared to accept the NATO offer  entitled Partnership for Peace and to immediately begin talks  about its specific content. We are fully prepared to negotiate  about the relevant protocols and to offer cooperation in all  areas in which the proposal envisages or proposes it.    In closing, please allow me to express my firm belief that  this Prague gathering will have been successful, that it will  become an important landmark on the road to a new democratic and  truly peaceful Europe sharing firm and natural ties with its  most natural civilization partner, the North American continent,  and that it will prove to have been a significant contribution  to the creation of a truly just political and security  arrangement in the entire northern hemisphere. At one time, the  city of Yalta went down in history as a symbol of the division  of Europe. I would be happy if today, the city of Prague could  emerge as a symbol of Europe standing in alliance.</p>

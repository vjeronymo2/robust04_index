			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> A seasoned and widely exhibited photographer of zany dioramas made from bizarre  common objects, Boyd Webb began as a conceptual artist making photos to  document his sculpture. Before long the photo became the art and Webb brought  the savvy, subversive imagination of a surrealist painter to large color  photos.  </P> <P> Current works mix a silly kind of grace and a faux Oriental sensibility to  comment on our waning ecosystem. Webb creates rippling water from clear  plastic. Out of this sprout thin green reeds whose tips erupt into clusters of  inflatable plastic tigers carefully staged to look like exotic, wilting  flowers. Two remarkable works feature a cross section of "water" in which  floats a jellyfish made from a plastic bag. Trapped inside the "sea creature"  is the cutest diaper-ad baby. The idea of our seas, our wild life and innocent,  hapless humankind suffocated by its own artifice and debris is discreetly  tucked into these luminous, overtly frolicking photos.  </P> <P> In contrast to Webb's caginess, Canadian conceptualist Dominique Blain uses a  sledgehammer. She makes a musty, tomb-like room with walls made from  sand-filled burlap bags used to fend off floods or to make bunkers in  battlefields. On one wall are ostentatiously framed 1917 photos of works of art  and architecture wrapped in similar sand bags to protect them from damage  during World War I. On the floor of the mute room is a large composite photo of  dead victims of political violence. For Blain, values, priorities, indeed  meaning itself are politically dictated: the dominant culture choses to define  church facades as precious protectables, while it defines human life as  expendable.

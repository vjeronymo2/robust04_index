			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia has not changed its point of view with  respect to sanctions against North Korea, calling them an  extreme and undesirable measure, declared Russia's Deputy  Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov. At a briefing in Moscow  Thursday he expressed his satisfaction that recently the tension  around the sanctions "has slightly waned."    Panov drew attention to Russia's proposal to convene an  international conference on the problems of the Korean  peninsula. In particular, he pointed out that "the bilateral  negotiations held between the United States and North Korea,  North Korea and IEAE, and North Korea and South Korea were  fruitless." "It would be more expedient for all interested  parties to meet at a conference," said Panov.    Moscow proposes that at this conference the agenda include  such problems as a guarantee of the Korean peninsula's  non-nuclear status, normalization of relations between North  Korea and the United States, North Korea and Japan, and North  Korea and South Korea, and implementation of confidence measures  between North Korea and South Korea.    Panov also underlined that Moscow proposes to convene an  international conference of foreign ministers in Geneva within  two weeks after adoption of a corresponding decision of the UN  Security Council. Panov believes that in the future the  conference may continue its work in Pyonyang and Seoul.    According to Panov, the United States has given its backing  to the idea of the conference, China and Japan have also  expressed a positive attitude towards this idea though they  believe that "major attention should be attached to bilateral  negotiations."    Responding to Interfax concerning the possibility of a  revision of Russia's position with respect to the sanctions in  the case that a conference prove fruitless, Panov said: "Let's  try such a form of negotiations and then we shall think want to  do next."</p>

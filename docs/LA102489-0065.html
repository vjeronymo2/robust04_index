			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARKER, PEREZ, FORUM WINNERS  </P> <P> A boxing tournament winner made more money than the winner of a world title  fight, and a clown from a Mexicali circus was a big hit in his Southern  California debut in a strange boxing show at the Forum Monday night.  </P> <P> In front of a crowd of 7,655, Edward Parker won a unanimous decision over Ken  Baysmore to win the Forum's super-featherweight tournament, earning $75,000  Monday night and raising his tournament total to $100,000.  </P> <P> Later, World Boxing Council bantamweight champion Raul Perez of Tijuana  defended his championship with a unanimous decision over rugged Diego Avila of  Mexico City.  </P> <P> Then they brought in the clown. Jorge Paez, who works as a clown and an acrobat  in his parents' Mexicali circus, is waging a campaign to bring pro boxing  closer to pro wrestling. He entered the ring with a "1" shaved onto the back of  his head, sweeping chevrons shaved on the sides of his head, and wearing a pony  tail.  </P> <P> Then he took his robe off, and if they'd turned out the lights you still could  have seen Paez -- a glimmering, sequin creation that radiated green, orange,  gold and red.  </P> <P> Paez scored an easy sixth-round TKO over Alan Makatoki of the Philippines. But  with Paez, winning isn't really his schtick. It's the show that counts, like  performing mock staggers when his opponent lands an inconsequential blow,  taunting, sticking out his chin . . .  </P> <P> The crowd seemed to like his act. So, he will probably be back. And he will  probably make more than the $20,000 he made Monday night.  </P> <P> Paez is the International Boxing Federation featherweight champion, but was  boxing, to use the term loosely, at 135 pounds against Makatoki.  </P> <P> Parker watched the Paez debut with some interest. With a Forum tournament  championship, he will lobby now for a Forum championship fight against Paez.  </P> <P> Parker seemed for a while to have been punched out after his all-out,  haymakers-from-everywhere, early-rounds assault on the taller, quicker Baysmore  failed to put him away. Baysmore (25-3-2) not only survived, but won most of  the middle rounds.  </P> <P> But Parker (19-3-2) turned the fight around in the eighth. With a minute left  in the third round, he caught Baysmore with a solid combination and rocked him.  He pounded Baysmore for the rest of the round but couldn't put him away.  </P> <P> After that, however, what sharpness Baysmore had was gone, as was the crispness  to his punches. And even when he was sharp, Baysmore never landed a solid right  to Parker's jaw, which was exposed throughout by his left hand, which he  carried waist-high. Parker, too, seemed nearly punched out again late in the  fight, but in the 12th round he somehow pulled up sufficient energy from an  unknown reservoir, and won the final round going away. When decision was  announced, Baysmore offered no protest.  </P> <P> Parker's margin was three points on two cards, four on the third.  </P> <P> "This is the greatest moment of my life," Parker said. "I worked hard and  believe I earned every penny."  </P> <P> Perez (45-1-1), defending his WBC bantamweight title for the third time, was  meeting an opponent he had barely beaten in 1986. This time, he won another  unanimous decision over Avila (35-19-3), but with some breathing room. The  scores were 119-111, 118-110, 115-113.  </P></p>

P. </F> Zapletin; UDC 629.195.3]    [Abstract] In earlier works, the researchers examined  optimal transfers between the lunar surface and lunar orbit for  a spacecraft with a rocket engine of high, but limited thrust,  with landing and liftoff sites not fixed. Those studies focused  on fastest transfer, as well as transfer with a minimum value  for the compromise functional of time-mass expenditure. The  transfers were set in a central Newtonian gravitation field in  the plane of orbit of an artificial lunar satellite, with thrust  vector controlled. This paper builds on the earlier work, but  involves the spatial characteristics of the transfer of the same  spacecraft in the same lunar context. The researchers discuss  the numerical solution of boundary value problems for 13th and  14th-order systems of the usual nonlinear differential equations  that appear when the solution of the problems of optimal control  of motion of the center of mass of the spacecraft is based on  the maximum principle. In the current context, solution that  involves shooting requires selection of 4-6 unknown initial  conditions. Figures 5, references 33 (Russian).</p>

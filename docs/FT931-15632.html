			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Technically Speaking: Catching the pornographers IF MEDIEVAL alchemists had succeeded in turning base metals into gold, what is the betting they would have blown the proceeds in the local brothel? Humans seem to have an irrepressible urge to turn technologies developed for noble uses to baser ones. An obvious example is the videorecorder, developed to free people from the tyranny of broadcasting schedules, but now a primary tool of the pornographer. Satellite television is another. And when virtual reality - advanced computer simulations which encourage viewers to believe they are a part of the scene depicted - made its debut some years ago, what caught the public imagination first was the prospect of electronic sex. Although this is a futuristic example of the potential use of computers in the sex industry, there is growing concern about a much less esoteric phenomenon - the dissemination of pornographic material either as computer diskettes or over computer networks. Computer pornography is not a new issue; in the early days of personal computing there was justifiable outrage over the dissemination of crudely drawn computer games with sexist and racist themes. What is new, however, is the quality of the images that modern technology makes possible and the ease with which they can be disseminated, especially where young people are involved. Diskettes can be swapped in the playground; computer bulletin boards can be accessed by home computers. Regulation is difficult, if not impossible. John Ashley of Greater Manchester Police, a specialist in obscene publications, says there is no pornographic image, still or moving, which cannot be captured on floppy disk or disseminated over a network. The computer pornography now being distributed in the UK seems to be coming from the traditional sources - the US and the Netherlands. Is there a real problem and if so how serious is it? Yes, and very serious, according to Catherine Itzin of Bradford University whose book Pornography has just been published by Oxford University Press, and who is chiefly concerned with its social effects. It is certainly serious enough for the Law Specialist group of the British Computer Society, the chartered institution for information technology specialists, to have set up a consultative group to examine two questions: first, are there technical answers to the problem of regulation? Second, what are the legal implications of pornography in this form and are changes in the law required? The BCS, aware that what is pornographic can often be a matter of opinion rather than fact, is directing the thrust of its campaign towards the protection of young people. That computers have become a medium for pornography is not in itself of any more significance than the more traditional use of books or films. But computing has special characteristics. Ron McQuaker, BCS vice president responsible for professional affairs, argues that a diskette is unlike a magazine or a videotape; its contents are not obvious and it can be protected by passwords; it can be programmed to self-destruct if the wrong key is used. Furthermore, parents, who may well have encouraged their children to become computer-literate, are less likely to be aware of the uses to which their home computers are being put. Ashley and Itzin believe it is impossible at present to regulate computer pornography. Ashley, indeed, does not foresee any technical developments which will improve matters. His approach is to prosecute when he can, and he believes it has a salutary effect. There is no real answer, technical or otherwise, to the issue of pornography apart from changes in social attitudes. In that sense, Itzin's approach may have more long-term influence than that of the BCS. But a technical trap for pornographers might open the possibility of catching virus writers and others who misuse computer systems. It is an avenue of research well worth exploring.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Shares of the Funds presently are offered with no front-end sales charge. Pursuant to the terms of the Prior Order, the Money Market Funds currently offer and sell two classes of shares designated as Mileage Class shares and Institutional Class shares. Mileage Class shares are presently offered and sold only to natural persons and certain grantor trusts. Institutional Class shares of the Money Market Funds and shares of the Non-Money Market Funds are presently offered and sold primarily to institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Shares of each existing Fund are distributed directly by the Trust. In the future, some or all classes of the Funds may be distributed through one or more principal underwriters. Under the current self-distribution arrangement, distribution activities are carried out primarily by officers of the Trust. The Mileage Class of each of the Money Market Funds has adopted a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan, which provides that each Mileage Class will pay .25% of its average daily net assets to AMR as compensation for distribution services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Currently, each shareholder of the Non-Money Market Funds is required to enter into a shareholder services agreement with AMR (a ``Shareholder Services Agreement''). Under this agreement, AMR provides or oversees on behalf of the shareholder's account certain administrative and management services (other than investment advisory and portfolio allocation services) for which each shareholder (and not the Fund) pays an annualized fee directly to AMR. This fee currently equals 0.30% of a shareholder's assets invested in each Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. If applicants' proposed multiple class distribution system (``Multiple Class System'') is approved by the SEC, and subject to shareholder approval, the Non-Money Market Funds will no longer have Shareholder Services Agreements. After implementation of the Multiple Class System, the Non-Money Market Funds will have internalized fees as described below. Certain classes of the Funds, however, may establish an externalized account maintenance fee for low balance accounts. It is presently expected that any account maintenance fee charged will not exceed an annual fee of approximately $25. The fee will be a direct charge against the shares held in the account and will be collected by redeeming a sufficient number of full and/or fractional shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. With respect to each new class of shares created, the Funds could enter into a Distribution Plan agreement and/or a Shareholder Services Plan agreement with AMR and/or other groups, organizations or institutions (``Organizations'') concerning the provision of certain services to shareholders of a particular class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Because many of the services contemplated under a Distribution Plan will be distribution related, such Plan will be adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act. A Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1 (b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, although the shares offered in connection with such a Plan need not be accorded the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. Under a Shareholder Services Plan, fees will be paid by a Fund to one or more Organizations for shareholder services provided with respect to the shares. Organizations may charge other fees directly to class shareholders who are the beneficial owners of shares in connection with class shareholder accounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. With respect to each new class, a Fund could pay an Organization either directly or indirectly pursuant to a Distribution Plan or Shareholder Services Plan for its services and assistance in accordance with the terms of its particular Plan agreement (``Plan Payments'') and the expense of such payments will be borne entirely by the beneficial owners of the class of the Fund to which each Plan agreement relates. Plan Payments paid to an Organization pursuant to a Distribution Plan agreement currently are not expected to exceed .75% of the average daily net asset value of the shares of the class subject to that particular Distribution Plan agreement. Similarly, Plan Payments paid to an Organization pursuant to a Shareholder Services Plan agreement are currently not expected to exceed .30% of the average daily net value of the shares of the class subject to that particular Shareholder Services Plan agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

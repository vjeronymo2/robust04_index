			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Luedwigsburg May 13 TASS -- "We have managed to  reach an agreement on all economic issues," said Russian  President Boris Yeltsin at a final news conference.    "During a meeting with leading representatives of the German  economy we discussed concrete principles of relations between  Russia and Germany in this field and major joint strategic  projects. Isn't Germany interested in the construction of an  automobile highway Moscow-Berlin, to be paid for? Or isn't the  construction of a new high-speed railway Moscow Berlin  interesting?" Yeltsin said.    "Taking into account that today's meeting was attended by  prominent representatives of all branches of the German economy,  we outlined immediate tasks not only for today or tomorrow, but  for a period after the year 2000. The people of Russia and  Germany will be the first to benefit from it," Yeltsin said.    Commenting on political results of the visit, Yeltsin  pointed  out that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany on August  31 will herald a new era in Russo-German relations -- the era of  reconciliation. "Festivities on the occasion of the troops  withdrawal will take place in Berlin, which will set the minds  of our society at rest. Several months later in Weimar, we  shall arrange a joint cultural festival, inviting best Russian  composers, writers, poets and ensembles. Let us make it a great  cultural holiday," Yeltsin said.    He expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome given to him  by the government of Baden-Wurttemberg, its Prime Minister Erwin  Teufel whom Yeltsin had invited to visit Russia.    "I am leaving Germany with good and friendly feelings. We  are crossing out the word "war" from our relations and from  German and Russian dictionaries," the Russian president said in  conclusion.</p>

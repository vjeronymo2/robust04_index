			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Egypt expects to forge S Africa links soon EGYPT could move swiftly to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa once Pretoria names the date for its first all-race elections and establishes its advisory transitional executive council, Egyptian Foreign Ministry officials said yesterday. Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, arrived in Cairo yesterday for a three-day visit during which he will discuss establishing diplomatic links with Mr Amr Moussa, his Egyptian counterpart. These will be the first bilateral talks between the two countries. The South African minister's arrival in Cairo follows his tour last month to Jordan, Oman and Qatar. It underlines Pretoria's determination to increase trade and investment and develop political relations in the region. Egypt, which formally applies the international embargo against South Africa, has very limited ties with the republic. These amount to the exchange of a handful of tourists and a small amount of informal import and export trade. But Egyptian officials said that once an election date and transitional executive council - which will advise the South African government before the planned elections - were named, Cairo would see no great impediment to diplomatic relations. Parties to constitutional talks in South Africa earlier this month said they hoped to fix an election date by early next month. The officials did not expect any progress on South Africa's desire to join the Organisation of African Unity, which will hold its annual summit in Cairo at the end of next month.</p>

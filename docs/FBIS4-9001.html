			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP), which supports the government, asked  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov for cabinet changes and for a new  programme by May 15. After a meeting of the top leadership of  the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), on  whose mandate the present government was formed in late 1992, it  announced the DPS would insist that the government be overhauled  completely. The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS)  calls for the government's resignation and for early  parliamentary elections. The SDS will not move for a vote of no  confidence in the cabinet pending debates on a question about  the government's financial policy posed by MPs of the SDS.  Today's meetings of the three major political forces showed  they are readying for elections. The SDS discussed principles  of selecting candidates. The DPS is likely to run on a separate  list in the next elections.    Meanwhile, BSP leader Zhan Videnov and DPS leader Ahmed  Dogan  visited the prime minister who is working in hospital. "The  prime minister's condition admits of political activity,"  Videnov said. According to Dogan, Prime Minister Berov, who  underwent heart surgery over a month ago and is now in hospital  after developing hepatitis symptoms, is in a very good state of  health.    Videnov said the prime minister had promised to hold two  rounds of meetings with the major political forces to discuss  cabinet changes. The Socialist leader told the press today that  cabinet changes should be made with a view to three main goals:  Bulgaria's international financial stabilization, industrial  restructuting and de-escalating tensions in the army and the  law-enforcement authorities.    Critical views on the government prevail in the DPS and it  will insist on a complete overhaul. The land reform and  privatization are the major points of its criticism. According  to Osman Oktay MP of the DPS, the movement has not drawn up a  list of new cabinet members. [passage omitted]    Stefan Sofiyanski, deputy chairman of the leadership of the  SDS, said it was absurd to demand of "a sick person under  quarantine to form a new cabinet" and added that this pressure  comes from the BSP. The SDS will wait for the interpellation on  the cabinet's financial policy to enter the debating chamber and  if the draft resolution criticising this policy is voted down  than it will consider moving a no-confidence vote. According to  Sofiyanski, it would be impossible for a no-confidence vote to  take place before parliament's Easter recess. So far the SDS  has moved five no-confidence votes which were defeated.    George Ganchev, leader of the extraparliamentary Bulgarian  Business Bloc, told journalists today that the Premier would  resign by the end of the week. He cited a "firsthand source"  without naming it.</p>

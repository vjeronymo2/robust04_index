			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Portugal capitalises on potential for growth - Prospects for equities in Lisbon Portugal is the only European market where the main stock exchange indices are currently higher than at the start of the year. That is the good news. Even better is the fact that the motor for growth has shifted from liquidity to economic and corporate fundamentals. Funds flowing into equities because of the sharp drop in government debt rates pushed the BTA index up by nearly 60 per cent in 1993 and to a two-year high of 3,226.6 in February. The market fell back following that peak on turbulence in the currency markets, to hit a year's low of 2,612 in late June. But from then on the index gained ground - 1.9 per cent in July and a further 6.3 per cent in August as the escudo stabilised and economic and corporate performance confirmed forecasts of a recovery. The index closed yesterday at 2,936, up 7.7 per cent since the start of the year. Trading volume for the first eight months of 1994 was also very strong, rising by 77 per cent in escudo terms over the same period last year, which itself followed a rise of 97 per cent in 1993. A partial explanation of the market's growth over the past two years can be put down to a process of catching-up with the other European bourses after a long period of virtual stagnation. But prospects for strong, non-inflationary economic growth and the expected benefits of corporate restructuring are beginning to take over from less stable factors as the drive behind the market. Analysts are unanimously buoyant about Portuguese equities, and the most optimistic are forecasting a further 15 per cent rise by the end of the year. 'Portugal has the advantages of an emerging market in terms of high potential growth, without the economic and political risks associated with markets in Latin America and Asia,' says Mr Trevenen Morris-Grantham of Carnegie Portugal. The economy is thought to have begun emerging from recession in the second quarter of 1994. The government is forecasting economic growth of between 1 to 2 per cent this year, based mainly on increased export and tourism earnings. Next year's budget is being prepared on an estimate of 2.5 to 3.5 per cent growth in 1995. Unlike most of Europe, the return to growth is being accompanied by a steady fall in inflation: year-on-year figures fell from 6.3 per cent in January to 4.8 per cent in August. The government is forecasting an average annual inflation rate of 4.5 to 5.5 per cent this year, down from 6.5 per cent in 1993. But the 1995 goal of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent may be over optimistic, especially as a general election is due in October 1995. Financial market tensions have also eased considerably in recent months: since the last speculative attack on the escudo in May, the currency has appreciated from a low of Es104.5 to the D-Mark to Es101.7 at present. 'Although improving fundamentals partly explain the turnaround, perhaps the more crucial factor has been the markets' acceptance that they cannot beat a central bank that persists in suspending official money-market rates at the first sign of trouble,' says Ms Sally Wilkinson, southern Europe economist with Union Bank of Switzerland. A stable escudo and falling inflation have enabled the central bank to begin a cautious lowering of interest rates - the intervention rate has been cut in gradual steps from 11 to 9.25 per cent since July, two months after the currency crisis. With the liquidity injection rate remaining suspended the monetary authorities have continued to lend through a variable rate repo system, which has been cut from 9.72 to 9.5 per cent over the past few days. The central bank's decision to lower the compulsory cash reserve requirement for banks from 17 per cent of customer liabilities to two per cent from November 1 will also help create a fresh climate for interest rate reductions. And there is ample room for more cuts. Portugal's short-term rates are more than 200 basis points higher than Spain's, although inflation in the two country's is almost identical. But analysts expect the central bank to halt rate cuts as soon as there is any indication of renewed attacks on the escudo. The recession in 1993 has given Portuguese companies the incentive and opportunity to streamline and refocus. 'Companies are now in a much better position to take advantage of a resumption in economic growth and produce higher profits,' says Ms Mari Vargas of Dillon Read. Two half-yearly results announced last week reflect this confidence. Sonae, Portugal's largest private-sector industrial and distribution conglomerate, reported a 110 per cent increase in net consolidated profits, while Corticeira Amorim, the world's largest cork producer, showed a 269 per cent increase. Half-yearly bank results were also better than expected. Some analysts are now forecasting a recovery for the banking sector, which accounts for more than half the market turnover, by the end of 1995. Banco Comercial Portugues' bid for control of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, although vetoed by the government, has shown that there is a drive towards rationalisation and cost-cutting in banking as in other areas of the economy.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Floor debates in the two houses_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The legislative history does contain extensive floor debate about the reformulated gasoline provisions. While these focus primarily on the specific requirements found in section 211(k)(2) though (10), they still provide important insight on overall Congressional intent for this program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  First, Congress expected that this motor vehicle fuel program would provide several important benefits for the nation. Most obviously it would lead to major reductions in air pollution in the largest metropolitan areas with the worst ozone nonattainment problems, reducing ozone forming VOCs and toxic pollutants. Reformulating the gasoline used in conventional vehicles would constitute a significant component of the federal program to control motor vehicle pollution. There was a clear concern that gasoline had gotten more polluting over the prior twenty years, primarily through increased levels of aromatic compounds in gasoline, used to replace the octane previously obtained from lead additives. Benzene and aromatics were seen as the predominant air toxic threat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference Committee Report contains limited discussion of the reformulated gasoline program, and the Reports for the bills reported out of the respective House and Senate Committee's are of limited use as these bills were changed significantly prior to passage. The floor debates, however, do contain extensive discussion of the bills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Second, Congress emphasized that reformulated gasoline would provide benefits in the form of improving our energy security, reducing our reliance on foreign oil, and providing a major opportunity for the agricultural sector of our economy to market renewable alcohols and their derivatives. This would come from the use of oxygenates as gasoline additives, including renewable oxygenates like ethanol and ETBE. In effect, Congress intentionally designed the reformulated gasoline program to obtain emissions reductions benefits in a way that would promote these other very important benefits. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, the following statements are from the floor debate on the Conference Committee bill: 1 Leg. Hist. at 851&hyph;856 (Sen. Durenberger); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1154&hyph;71 (Sen. Simpson); 1 Leg. Hist. at 969 (Sen. Baucus); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1073 (Sen. Dole); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1187 (Rep. Dingell); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1195 (Rep. Waxman); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1209 (Rep. Sharp); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1263&hyph;67 (Rep. Madigan); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1315 (Rep. Hall); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1435 (Rep. Richardson). Similar statements were made during consideration of the respective House and Senate bills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Third, the structure developed by Congress to obtain these various benefits involved a complex balance between imposing detailed requirements and preserving refiner flexibility. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The floor debates include detailed responses by individual members of Congress to various arguments that Congress was mandating ``government gas'' or a ``recipe,'' or was mandating use of only one oxygenate, such as ethanol. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The floor debates also show there was no common understanding of terms such as ``fuel neutral,'' or ``government gas,'' or even whether certain provisions did or did not require the use of a specific oxygenate such as ethanol. These debates do make clear, however, that Congress designed the detailed provisions in section 211(k)(2) through (10) to ensure achievement of various benefits from this program, while retaining an appropriate degree of refiner flexibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This complex balance can be seen in the various specific requirements of section 211(k). Congress established both specific content requirements (section 211(k)(2)) and minimum requirements for either a performance standard or a ``formula,'' whichever EPA determined to be more stringent (section 211(k)(3)(A) and (B)). A certification program was also established, with EPA to certify any fuel that obtained emissions reductions of a fuel that met the requirements of section 211(k)(2) and (3). A credit program was also established for the three specific content requirements established in section 211(k)(2) and (3). Both the emissions performance standards and content requirements of section 211(k)(2) and (3) act as performance standards in light of the certification equivalency provision of section 211(k)(4). For example, the ``formula'' of section 211(k)(3)(A) acts as a performance standard based on section 211(k)(4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> From the debate on the Conference Committee: 1 Leg. Hist. at 853, 855 (Sen. Durenberger); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1233 (Rep. Fields); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1263 (Rep. Madigan); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1270 (Rep. Synar); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1325 (Rep. Hall); 1 Leg. Hist. at 1395&hyph;7 (Rep. Moorehead). From the debate on the House bill: 2 Leg. Hist. at 2606, 2694&hyph;7, 2701&hyph;2, 2750&hyph;58 (Rep. Richardson); 2 Leg. Hist. at 2716 (Rep. Dingell); 2 Leg. Hist. at 2717 (Rep. Lent); 2 Leg. Hist. at 2722 (Rep. Michel); 2 Leg. Hist. at 2733&hyph;34 (Rep. Synar). From the debate on the Senate bill: 4 Leg. Hist. at 6812, 15, 19 (Sen. Daschle); 4 Leg. Hist. at 6820&hyph;21 (Sen. McClure); 4 Leg. Hist. at 6824 (Sen. Grassley); 4 Leg. Hist. at 6825 (Sen. Nickles); 4 Leg. Hist. at 6829&hyph;30 (Sen. Wirth); 4 Leg. Hist. at 6836 (Sen. Dole); 4 Leg. Hist. at 6836 (Sen. Johnston).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Various statements were made by different members of Congress that any oxygenate could be used that met the oxygen content and emissions reduction requirements for reformulated gasoline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These statements reflect Congress' interest in retaining appropriate refiner flexibility. However, they only address compliance with the oxygen content requirement mandated under section 211(k)(2) and the emissions reduction requirements mandated under section 211(k)(1) and (3), and do not address compliance with additional requirements established under section 211(k)(1). They do not indicate an intention to preclude EPA from appropriately exercising its authority under section 211(k)(1) to either require greater than the minimum reductions called for in section 211(k)(3) or to establish additional requirements like the renewable requirements. Given the ambiguity in the debates on this issue and the Act's provision that the requirements of (k)(2) be issued under the (k)(1) rulemaking authority, EPA believes this rule may also be considered a reasonable implementation of the (k)(2) oxygen content requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See, e.g., 4 Leg. Hist. at 6812 (Sen. Daschle), and 1 Leg. Hist. at 1216 (Rep. Sharp, noting that ``[t]he Administrator may not discriminate among these different oxygenates, and should encourage fair competition among them. As long as the percentage weight requirement is met,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> and other requirements of new 211(k) .&blank;.&blank;. are satisfied <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , any oxygenate should be allowed to satisfy new United States needs.'') Also see 1 Leg. Hist. at 1325 (Rep. Hall). EPA's renewables requirement is fully consistent with this_refiners may use any oxygenate as long as the resulting gasoline meets the oxygen content and renewable requirements established under section 211(k).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This legislative history indicates that while Congress itself did not choose to mandate any one oxygenate or class of oxygenate, it also did not restrict EPA's ability to require the use of a class or category of oxygenates if that would reasonably ensure achievement of these benefits and would not inappropriately limit the operational flexibility of refiners and importers. The renewables requirement is entirely consistent with this approach. It is designed to achieve important goals, and includes provisions specifically designed to maximize the flexibility of refiners in meeting the requirement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Certain commenters claimed that the requirement was inconsistent with Congressional intent as expressed in the debate over the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Congress rejected an amendment to that bill which would have required that an increasing portion of the octane in all gasoline be obtained from domestically produced, renewable, nonpetroleum sources. The floor debate on this amendment indicates several reasons various members of Congress were opposed to this amendment, including concern that there would not be enough supply of ethanol, concern over possible interference with implementation of the Clean Air Act (based on a confusing provision addressing the interrelationship of the two laws and authority under the amendment for DOE to waive the requirement for air quality reasons), as well as concern over not being fuel neutral. EPA therefore believes that the rejection by the House of Representatives in 1992 of an amendment to an unrelated statutory provision, apparently based on a wide number of different reasons, is not relevant to Congress's prior intent in 1990 when it amended the Clean Air Act. Section 1508 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation of 1987 is much more relevant on the issue of Congressional intent and supports EPA's interpretation and rule. 42 U.S.C. 7545. In that provision, Congress found that the United States was increasingly dependent on the Middle East for its energy needs, that ethanol could be used in gasoline to produce a cleaner burning fuel and reduce pollution, and that ethanol was a renewable resource and its increased use would reduce farm program costs and grain surpluses and create new jobs. That bill explicitly states the sense of Congress that EPA should use its authority under the Clean Air Act to require greater use of ethanol as a motor fuel. EPA's renewable's requirement is fully consistent with this statutory provision. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Turchynov, chairman of the political </F> and economic council of the Hromada All-Ukrainian Association:  "A Shadow That Wants Into the Light. In Lieu of a Confession of  a `Typical Businessman Engaged in the Shadow Economy'"]    [Text] "He who observes the wind will not sow; and he  who regards the clouds will not reap." (Ecclesiastes 11:4)    The Hromada All-Ukrainian Association was created only  two months ago, yet the press has already carried numerous  articles, whose authors have focused their attention on one  small element of our economic program -- i.e., the need to  legalize Ukraine's shadow economy. In the process, some  journalists are also reporting the "sensational" discovery that  Hromada is striving to win power as the representative of the  interests of those engaged in unauthorized economic activity.    In an attempt to meet all such "penetrating" authors  halfway, let me try to elucidate some of our economic views  through the prism of the legalization of the shadow economy.    There is no need to elaborate painstakingly on the economic  situation in Ukraine. We are all quite familiar with the  reigning atmosphere of bureacratic anarchy and administrative  chaos, the fuel and energy crisis, the burden of direct and  indirect taxes on enterprises that is beyond their ability to  carry, and the various deductions from wages that have long  since passed the 50-percent level. Add to this the  hyperinflation that no one anticipated, the across-the-board  drop in production, the legal jumble, the confiscation from  exporters of 50 percent of their hard currency earnings in  accordance with a fixed exchange rate made up by officials, and  then put yourself in the place of an entrepreneur or enterprise  director.    The novice entrepreneur's actions adhere to approximately  the  following pattern: he borrows capital at an exorbitant rate of  interest, gives the bank his privatized apartment as security,  pays a bribe to lease a shop, buys raw materials, hires  employees, produces and sells finished production, and pays all  his taxes and deductions to the state. Despite all of the  state's efforts, he accomplishes the impossible -- he makes a  profit. Wanting to make an official salary, the subject of our  study must not orget to deduct from it the tax on profits.  Beginning with the amount in excess of 50 official minimum wage  rates, the profits tax rate is a mere 90 percent. Translated  into real purchasing power, this "salary" then amounts to no  more than the average Soviet engineer earned in the seventies.    Thus, the state as personified by the government, the  National Bank, and the Supreme Council is destroying any  economic rationale for the existence and growth of enterprise  regardless of forms of ownership, and proposes to the  entrepreneur that he accomplish a titanic, often very risky task  in order to give back to the state 90 percent of his honestly  earned and declared income.    Even assuming that owing of some mental aberration such an  entrepreneur is found, he will be able to perform this trick  only once or at most twice. That is because what the state does  not take away officially, it will take away through  hyperinflation as it tries to fill the bottomless holes in the  budget through seigniorage -- namely, revenues obtained through  monetary emission. Working capital is devalued, and there is no  money to replace capital stock. This cycle can only be repeated  in a decremental mode.    Adding to the prospect of inevitable collapse are the  general  decrease in production and the sharp drop in the people's  purchasing power, which is causing a rapid shrinking of the raw  materials market and product sales. Are the state and those whom  it has an obligation to support (the nonproduction sphere,  pensioners, invalids, etc.) growing richer by stripping hired  workers, entrepreneurs, and enterprises in general of  everything? Definitely not!    A state that has adopted a policy of openly robbing its own  citizens has reached the point of economic absurdity: the more  it takes, the less it gets.    The reason for this is simple. When resistance to robbery is  not possible, there are only two alternatives left. The first is  to give away all that one has and go begging. The second is to  try and hide what one owns -- if not everything, then at least  some portion of it.    In their struggle to survive, most enterprises and  entrepreneurs choose the second way. They choose to conceal  their economic activity from the state by engaging in what has  been known since the days of developed socialism as the "shadow  economy." But whereas those who set up shop in the seventies  were driven into the shadows by the Criminal Code, our  contemporaries have been driven into the shadows by economic  expediency. It is important to distinguish between the  "national" shadow economy and the traditional business of  organized crime--trafficking in drugs, arms, people,  prostitution, racketeering. These forms of activity are illegal  in all civilized countries, and they have no direct link to the  level of economic development attained by these countries.    Our state, on the other hand, with its inept tax, foreign  trade, credit and finance, and investment policies is driving  the overwhelming majority of enterprises into the shadows or  forcing them to close.    How does the shadow economy work? Mainly, this entails  hiding  capital from the state's fiscal services and exporting it from  the country. Countless variations have been worked out. These  include unaccounted for cash transactions, disguising profits as  production costs, deliberately withholding income from the sale  of goods in "undeclared" accounts (for the most part located  abroad), transferring the difference between the real and  undervalued contractual price into private accounts, etc. There  are hundreds of highly perfected financial schemes for  concealing and exporting capital, specifically adapted to the  way that banks, industrial enterprises, or agricultural concerns  operate.    But it is not only traditional economic structures and the  individuals who run their operations that are part of the shadow  economy. Increasingly more private citizens, beginning with the  children who wash cars in the street and ending with the  veterans who sell their war medals, are easing to report their  earnings to the state. At legal and illegal markets and  "barakholky," millions of citizens sell a variety of goods --  ranging from contraband consumer goods to ficus plants grown on  the balcony. For others, cottage industries and "moonlighting"  have become a source of survival -- from knitting socks to  building garages and summer dachas. But none of them -- from  individuals with doctoral degrees who hold second jobs as night  watchmen to professional beggars -- are in any hurry to stand in  line to declare additional earnings to the tax inspectors. Thus,  concealing from the state the kopecks they earn, they join the  nationwide shadow economy in their struggle to survive.    One can now state with confidence that almost the entire  economic infrastructure of the young independent state is bound  up in a single shadow conglomerate. This shadow has now covered  the whole of Ukraine!    One would think that it matters not what you call a chicken,  as long as it lays eggs. Let our whole economy become a shadow  economy, just so long as it works. But as all of us discover  every day, the shadow economy is much too inefficient.    Capital cannot be kept in a cage that is convenient for  officials. It is very active and will always move to where it  can be most effectively used. It is especially apt to leave any  space that is not suited to its existence. That is why capital  is fleeing Ukraine, and where flight is impossible, it is being  hidden in dark corners where the fiscal services cannot reach  it. Huge amounts of illegally exported capital from Ukraine are  now working to increase the prosperity of other countries,  creating new jobs there and filling their markets with new  products and services. This loss to Ukraine cannot be  compensated by foreign credits, or by humanitarian aid, or by  the sale of the Black Sea Fleet and nuclear missiles.    Another problem is that capital that circulates in the  shadow  economy cannot be used for large-scale investment in the means  of production because this would immediately "bring it into the  light." Saving profits that have been hidden from the state in  the form of the national currency also makes no sense. Hence  these funds are converted into convertible currencies and  exported out of the country. Consequently, economic structures  that rely on the shadow turnover of capital lack the opportunity  for extensive capital renewal and generally show a tendency to  fail. Moreover, unauthorized (cash) turnover is easiest for  trade enterprises and small enterprises, while large industrial  enterprises are forced to combine operating within the legal  economy with illegal activities. In the case of large  industries, the shadow component consists mostly of manipulating  the difference between the sale price and the demand price, in  "working" receipts (usually in hard currency) by retaining them  on deposit accounts or by channeling them through more complex  financial schemes.    But the shadow portion of such a mixed economy most often  serves only the interests of the directors of large state  enterprises and cannot compensate an enterprise's costs in the  legal sector of the economy, where it has to officially pay its  employees, service production, buy raw materials, and so on.  That is why the majority of large enterprises have now been  brought to a state of collapse by the state's economic policy.  They are simply too large to be able to hide in the shadows  (recall the fate of the dinosaurs when the climate deteriorated  sharply).    The shadow economy engenders yet another very dangerous  problem. It promotes the rapid growth and rising power of  organized crime.    The ordinary, law-abiding citizen in our country, who has  worked his entire life for the state, is helpless when faced by  a criminal. However, he can draw attention to himself and turn  to the state for protection. The citizen engaged in unauthorized  economic activity does not have even this option available to  him. Criminals know this, and as a result, instead of the tax  inspectorate, those working in the shadows have to deal with  racketeers. Criminal gangs are better versed in the laws of the  market than their "colleagues" in the state apparatus.  Consequently, only very rarely do they impose a 90-percent tax  rate; they usually settle for 10 to 30 percent.    But we should not idealize the common sense of the shadow  economy "inspectors." Sooner or later, the criminal world  attempts to take over the whole "business." The alternative to  this is very often the lethal end of the "shadow businessman."  As a result, an active process of criminalizing the shadow  economy is under way, a process of criminal "statization." This,  in turn, sharply reduces the effectiveness of the shadow economy  and raises the prices of finished products because of  "additional" costs and the incompetence of the new owners.  Ultimately, all of this makes the employees of such enterprises  and the "free" entrepreneurs hostage to the plans of criminals.    Let us ask ourselves the traditional question: "Who gains  from the economy being driven into the shadows?" First,  organized crime is interested in having the state push the legal  economy into the shadows, because the shadows are crime's  traditional patrimony.    Second, today the interests of organized crime coincide  objectively with a whole bouquet of interests of officialdom's  ruling leadership, above all, because the harsh government  regulation that is devastating the economy gives officials the  power to dole out the beneficia they control: credit resources,  currency, licenses, quotas, etc.    Furthermore, large-scale illegal export of capital is  impossible without the "cover" provided by highly placed state  officials, who "deservedly" become the partners of exporters.    The issuance of permits for temporary legal survival  (namely,  temporary exemptions from taxes or payment of customs duties) is  also a profitable business. Nor does organized crime skimp on  rewarding its "benefactors." A merging of the interests of the  state's and organized crime's upper echelons is taking place. I  have deliberately avoided using the term "mafia" in this  article, because it has become so all-encompassing here that it  is applied to everybody -- ranging from high officials knee-deep  in corruption to small-time pickpockets.    In listing all the parties interested in the "shadowization"  of the economy, we cannot ignore the real advantages obtained by  Western countries, their banking and industrial structures, from  the infusion into their economic systems of our financial, raw  material, and professional potential.    Lastly, the political gains from the economic ruin being  wreaked by the ex-Bolsheviks are being shared by our  neo-Bolsheviks (Communists, Socialists and Co.). Inasmuch as, in  addition to the complete discreditation of market reforms and  the collapse of the economy, their "comrades" (former, to be  sure) have also put business outside the law, creating a basis  for widespread "revolutionary" dissatisfaction among the masses  as well as the prospect of future legalized expropriations.    Therefore, if we are to talk of who is not interested in the  "shadowization" of the economy, we need to point out that this  group consists of all those entrepreneurs and enterprise  directors for whom working in the shadows means constantly  risking their lives, large additional expenses (protection, the  cost of establishing accounts abroad, levies by officials and  criminals, etc.), being excluded from the Ukrainian market, and  having to constantly face the prospect of losing everything they  have. Apart from them, of course, the shadow economy brings  hunger, poverty, lawlessness, and coercion to the overwhelming  majority of Ukraine's people. That is why those working in the  shadows want to emerge "into the light" -- an outcome that would  benefit everybody.    The left and right of various hues are bruiting around  recipes for resolutely combatting the shadow economy. But  inasmuch as today the term "shadow" has to be applied to  practically every element of the conomic space of Ukraine, the  slogan that results is "Fight the economy!". And this is  something that the country's government has already been  vigorously engaged in for the last few years. Thus, the  substitution of one set of "warriors" with another will result  in no more than an insignificant reassignment of official  feeding troughs.    In my opinion, if we are truly serious about saving the  economy, there is only one solution -- creating conditions to  legalize it. Conditions, in which it would be profitable to  invest capital in Ukrainian enterprises, profitable and safe to  hold money on deposit in Ukrainian banks, conditions in which  under a reasonable tax law it would be more expedient not to  conceal income because the state would protect it rather than  rob one of it. The recipe for legalization is simple and easily  understood -- it is necessary to create better conditions for  business in Ukraine than outside it, lower taxes, create a more  conducive investment regime, remove restrictions on exports of  finished products, put an end to the forced confiscation of  earned foreign currency, etc. The public can learn more details  about the ways to heal (legalize) the national economy by  reading the program documents of Hromada, which holds one of its  principal tasks to be to unite the healthy economic and  political forces in our society in order to lead our economy out  of the shadows and to check criminal-bureaucratic anarchy. That  is why we want to "legalize shadow capital."    We are convinced that the creation of conditions for  legalizing the economy is the only way to save Ukraine from the  stifling shadow that has covered the country and is transforming  every living thing in it into mouldy rot.</p>

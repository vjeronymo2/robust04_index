			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (10): Added value in Toronto THE UPSIDE of suffering an unexpectedly long and deep recession is that Canada's biggest city now offers the business traveller far better value for money than it did in the late 1980s. Taxis are easier to find, and drivers will often negotiate fares for long trips, such as to the airport. Queues for restaurant tables have noticeably shortened. Prices for hotel rooms, meals and rental cars have barely moved over the past two years. Some foreign visitors will also find that their currency goes a lot further, with the Canadian dollar now 12 per cent lower against the US dollar than it was in 1991. Toronto remains one of North America's more pleasant cities. The streets are clean, and public transport efficient. Torontonians are not as friendly as New Yorkers at their best, and they are invariably more polite than New Yorkers at their worst. The crime rate is low; women have little to fear on the streets, even after sunset. Downtown hotels are within a short walk of Lake Ontario. Two, the Westin Harbour Castle (tel 869-1600) and the Radisson Plaza (203-3333), are on the waterfront. Downtown Toronto has two new attractions for the visitor with a couple of hours to spare. The refurbished Ontario Art Gallery, now one of the 10 biggest in North America, opened earlier this year to enthusiastic reviews. For an insight into another side of Canadian culture, the ice hockey Hall of Fame, located in a former Bank of Montreal building in the centre of the financial district, is worth a visit. The best hotel bargains are over weekends (which usually include Friday and Sunday nights). A room at the King Edward Hotel, which is a member of the Forte chain (tel 863-9700), is priced at CDollars 199 a night (CDollars 183 for corporate accounts). The rate drops to CDollars 150 on weekends. The Camberley Court Hotel, located in one of the financial district's office towers (tel 947-9025), charges CDollars 170 on weeknights, and CDollars 120 at weekends. One of Toronto's joys is the plethora of ethnic restaurants. A popular, moderately-priced Italian choice is Giovanna Trattoria (tel 538-2098, dinner only). For Thai food in the downtown area, try Golden Thai (868-6668). More elegant (and expensive) restaurants include Splendido (929-7788), Scaramouche (961-8011), Prego della Piazza (920-9900) and Truffles at the Four Seasons Hotel (964-0411). Budget-conscious travellers would be well-advised not to eat breakfast in the hotel. Muffin and bagel shops abound in the subterranean shopping malls which criss-cross the financial district. A popular choice for a heartier start to the day is Movenpick's self-service Marche (366-8986). Travelling to and from Toronto is also more relaxing these days than it used to be. The airport, whose spacious third terminal opened just as the recession hit, is seldom crowded. In their eagerness to please, Canada's two main airlines, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines International, frequently upgrade economy passengers to business class. Don't hesitate to ask.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Waigel believes Bonn deficit may hit Emu hopes MR Theo Waigel, German finance minister, yesterday warned Germany would be unable to join a European monetary union (Emu) in either 1997 or 1999, referring to two deadlines set by the Maastricht treaty, unless it took further radical action to curb its budget deficit. This was the first time a senior cabinet minister had publicly questioned the possibility of Germany participating in 1999. He insisted there could be no suggestion of relaxing the economic convergence criteria for Emu - including strict limits on budget deficits, government debt, and inflation - and that Germany itself would be hard pressed to comply. Mr Waigel was giving evidence before the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe, which yesterday began hearing complaints against the ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union. In response to questions over the future stability of a single European currency, the finance minister insisted that it would prevent turbulence in the European money markets, and prove stronger in competition with the dollar and yen than the present European Monetary System. His colleague Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister, also weighed in with a staunch defence of Maastricht, reminding the court it was approved by the German parliament with an overwhelming majority, only 16 votes against. He warned that any decision by the court to declare the ratification of the treaty invalid would cause a huge loss of international confidence. The court is hearing a series of challenges to the treaty, on the grounds that it infringes the individual rights of German citizens, by undermining the country's sovereignty. Complainants include four Green members of the European parliament, and Mr Manfred Brunner, a former chef de cabinet to Mr Martin Bangemann, senior German commissioner in Brussels. The Green MEPs have based their challenge on a lack of democratic control at European level over the actions of the European Commission and EC council of ministers. Mr Brunner maintains the treaty offends the constitutional definition of Germany as a 'democratic and social, federal state'.</p>

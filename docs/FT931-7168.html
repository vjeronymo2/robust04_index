			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures traded in a tight range of 20 points for most of the day, as the market waited to see if ICI will launch an anticipated Pounds 1bn rights issue with its demerger plans, writes Joel Kibazo. The March contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,819, just ahead of its close on Tuesday. After a period of sideways trading, the contract started drifting lower as the talk of the possible ICI cash call increased. The day's low of 2,810 was seen only 45 minutes after the start of trading, before a bout of closing of positions led to a brief respite in the downward trend. That, however, did not last long and March once again drifted downwards with the early strength on Wall Street having no impact. March finished at 2,818, at the same level as its close on Tuesday and at a small discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover was 8,037 trades by the close. In traded options, the expiry of the February stock options was the main feature and it made a large contribution to the day's total turnover of 41,189 lots. Some 7,378 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and the Euro-FT-SE saw a total of 2,890 trades. BT was the most actively dealt stock option with a total of 4,450 contracts and was followed by BTR at 3,243. Hanson, Asda and British Aerospace were also busy.</p>

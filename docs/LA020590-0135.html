			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OAKLAWN'S SUNDAY DEBUT LOKS LIKE AN ODDS-ON FAVORITE  </P> <P> For a Sunday, it was a great Friday, Oaklawn Park General Manager Eric Jackson  said.  </P> <P> It was the first-ever regularly scheduled Sunday racing program at Oaklawn  Park, Jackson said, and Sunday's numbers -- 16,921 people wagering $2,179,161  -- met track officials' "most optimistic expectations," Jackson said.  </P> <P> "We looked at what we did last year on Fridays and weekdays in February,"  Jackson said. "Compared to almost any yardstick, this was a tremendous day for  us."  </P> <P> Legislation approved last year cleared the way for local-option Sunday racing.  After voters approved it, the track added two Sundays.  </P> <P> "Last year, we did $1.8 million on opening Friday, $1.9 million the next one,  $1.4 the next one, $1.7, $1.8."  </P> <P> "Gosh, for early in February, this is a big day," Jackson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> NO STATE OPINION IN CITY ATTORNEY LEAVE  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office has declined to give an opinion on whether  four City Council members have the power to put City Atty. Edward J. Cooper on  a 60-day administrative leave.  </P> <P> Instead, Assistant Atty. Gen. Eugene Hill recommended that the city ask the  state for a special quo warranto proceeding, a method of settling disputes over  the rights and procedures of a public office.  </P> <P> Hill said that under state law, the attorney general's office is not authorized  to provide a legal opinion to a city council.  </P> <P> Cooper, who refuses to leave his post, said he had advised councilmen John  Acosta, Ron May, Richards L. Norton and Miguel A. Pulido that the quo warranto  proceeding was the proper procedure, rather than seeking a formal opinion from  the attorney general's office.  </P> <P> The four councilmen could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> On Oct. 17, the four council members voted to put Cooper on a 60-day leave of  absence without saying why they wanted him removed from his post. But Mayor  Daniel H. Young has said they are retaliating against Cooper for previous legal  battles three of the four men have had with the city.  </P> <P> Cooper has refused to step aside, saying that the city charter requires five  votes on the seven-member council to put him on administrative leave. The four  councilmen counter that Cooper is disregarding the wishes of the majority.  </P> <P> Young, who along with council members Daniel E. Griset and Patricia A. McGuigan  support Cooper, has called for a grand jury investigation of the attempt to  have Cooper removed. LILY ENG  </P></p>

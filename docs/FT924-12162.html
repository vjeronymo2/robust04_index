			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / RAF cuts search and rescue ROYAL Air Force helicopters are to end search and rescue operations at four UK bases under cuts announced yesterday. The reorganisation of search and rescue activities - the most popular aspect of the RAF's presence in coastal and mountain areas of Britain - comes after a year-long review. The Ministry of Defence opted against hiving off rescue responsibilities to the private sector. The bases affected are at Leuchars, Fyfe, Brawdy in Dyfed, Manston in Kent and Coltishall in Norfolk. No redundancies were announced, but the future of the Manston facility is in question.</p>

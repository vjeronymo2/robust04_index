			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Shares in MTM see-saw as inquiry deepens SHARES in MTM, the speciality chemicals company, swung wildly yesterday as the stock exchange investigated circumstances surrounding the company's two recent profits warnings within six trading days. As stock exchange officials interviewed analysts about announcements and briefings made to them by Mr Richard Lines, the company's chairman who resigned last week, the exchange refused to suspend MTM's shares. It is understood that Robert Fleming, MTM's advisers, did not give the stock exchange adequate reason why the shares should be suspended. MTM's shares closed up 14p at 84p, after falling to 55p, barely a fifth of their level before Mr Lines's warning on March 2 that disagreement with the auditors over accounting policy meant profits would be substantially lower than City expectations. Fleming asked the exchange for the shares to be suspended before a second warning on March 9. In this announcement, MTM admitted that there was a problem with trading profits and a disagreement over accounting. MTM's non-executive directors said yesterday that final results, already postponed, might not be available as anticipated on March 31 because the auditor, Binder Hamlyn, was investigating the share price fall. As MTM entered its third week of uncertainty, it emerged that Mr Lines knew nine months ago about the differences of opinion with his auditors. Binder Hamlyn wrote to him about the matter in June last year. Sources close to the company also said that last year MTM was involved certain questionable transactions that now are receiving closer examination. The accounting problem revolves around MTM's capitalisation of interest and development during the start-up and construction of capital projects. MTM could eventually report trading profits up to 40 per cent lower than the Pounds 23m pre-tax figure which the City had forecast just before the profits warning. The stock exchange is reluctant to suspend a company's shares unless there are severe financial problems that threaten an orderly market in the shares or unless it is told that a Department of Trade and Industry or Serious Fraud Office investigation is to take place.</p>

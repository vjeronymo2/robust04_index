			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / World Trade News: British companies reap benefits of Japanese markets - Their success owes much to a change in attitude to doing business there WHILE prominent US companies campaign for a bigger slice of the Japanese market, a growing number of UK companies, both large and small, are quietly reaping the benefits of success in what is arguably the world's most competitive market. Last year, UK exports to Japan rose 16 per cent to Pounds 2.63bn from Pounds 2.26bn in 1989, against an increase in overall imports to Japan of 11.2 per cent to Dollars 234.6bn (Pounds 138bn), according to the Japanese finance ministry. In the past three years, visible exports from the UK to Japan rose by over 75 per cent, the UK Department of Trade and Industry says. The greater headway British companies are beginning to make in Japan owes much to a change in their attitude to doing business there, and an increasing awareness of the wider benefits to be derived from being in the Japanese market. Market research commissioned by the DTI shows that 28 per cent of UK companies surveyed saw Japan as their first or second most important market, against 13 per cent five years ago. The DTI says Japan has become the UK's third biggest export market, after western Europe and the US. Given that Japan has the highest per capita GDP among the Group of Seven industrialised countries, it is not surprising that UK companies have made strenuous efforts to break into the Japanese market. The success of British companies in Japan is not limited to the large companies such as Glaxo, or even those with well-established marques either. For example, Teknek Electronics, a small company making a precision machine that cleans sheet materials in the printed circuit industry saw Japanese sales grow by almost 500 per cent last year. The group was able to do this despite its major competitor in the market being a Japanese machine. Solid State Logic is a relatively young company which makes professional audio equipment - another area where Japanese manufacturers are gaining prominence. Yet in the 20 months since it set up its Japanese subsidiary, it has seen sales to Japan jump 60 per cent from Pounds 4m to Pounds 6.4m a year. Foseco, the specialty chemicals maker, acquired by Burmah Castrol at the end of last year, has seen sales of its Japanese subsidiary surge from Y5.8bn (Pounds 24.5m) in 1989 to Y6.2bn last year, up from Y4.3bn in 1986. In the consumer market, Scholl, the footwear and health care products group, last year sold 2.8m pairs of its 'healthy' support tights in the first year it introduced the product to the Japanese market. This was achieved despite Scholl not being as much a brand name in Japan as in other markets. The rise in UK exports to Japan owes something to the gradual disappearance of that country's visible trade barriers. But while the non-tariff barriers to trade - the group-oriented trading practices, convoluted distribution system and the generally inscrutable ways that have been blamed for keeping foreigners out - still exist, the recent success of UK companies probably stems largely from a new willingness to meet the Japanese market on its own, highly-competitive terms. 'While we treated the Japanese market as any other market it was not a success,' admits Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of Glaxo, one of the winners of this year's Opportunity Japan Awards, a programme sponsored by the DTI in recognition of UK companies especially successful in Japan. It was only after taking boardroom decisions that Glaxo's Japanese business began to grow, Sir Paul adds. Many UK companies are themselves starting to preach that having a high-quality product to offer, a high level of commitment to the needs of a specific market, an ability to respond efficiently to those needs, and an understanding of the specific business culture, are key ingredients to success in Japan in particular, and the rest of the world in general. 'You have to understand the different philosophy,' says Mr Mark Sunderland, commercial manager of Teknek Electronics. Teknek found being defensive about a product problem was the wrong reaction. 'The Japanese end-user said that if we had told them the equipment would have problems after so many thousand hours, they would have worked around it. Once they understood what the problem was, we could work together to overcome it. It was the surprise element that they found difficult to accept.' It takes a high degree of commitment to the market, preferably through direct representation at a fairly high level, to attain that kind of understanding. 'It may seem daunting, but in the long run it is the key to success,' says Mr Sunderland. Teknek, which employs 38 people, has an executive sales representative who spends three weeks out of four touring Japan and the Pacific Rim. What has encouraged more and more UK companies to pay this kind of attention to the needs of the Japanese market and undergo the rigours of being there, is the spreading realisation of the technological and disciplinary benefits thus derived which filter through to their operations elsewhere. Foseco, for example, licensed a new casting technique it had developed, to a Japanese partner. The Japanese company collaborated with Foseco in making improvements to that technique, which were so useful that Foseco is now considering marketing the improvements in other countries. Cut-throat price competition, another feature of the Japanese market, imposes a cost discipline that is universally applicable. 'It is a great rarity for prices to increase in Japan,' according to Mr Martin Issot, president of Foseco Japan. 'The western philosophy of annual price increase is totally unknown. This has had a good and continuing 'competitive' influence on central research and development functions.' The group's Japanese subsidiary sold its Sedex filters at a loss for one year while it set up local production to meet intense domestic price competition. It emerged from the ordeal with 55 per cent of the Japanese market, and a reduction in production costs that has brought the sales price down by 30 per cent. Foseco Japan now sells three times as many different types and sizes of Sedex filters as any Foseco company. Many UK companies in Japan also benefit from Japanese technological advances. Bowthorpe, the diversified electrical components maker, says it uses prime technology developed in Japan, particularly involving robots, in other factories worldwide. But the greatest benefit could be that companies successful in marketing a particular product in Japan find it easy to market that product in other countries. 'The image that success in Japan can lead easily to success elsewhere is very significant,' Mr Issot points out. Sir David Plastow, chairman of Vickers, put it somewhat differently: 'If we can't succeed there, we won't succeed at all.'</p>

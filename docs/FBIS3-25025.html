			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There is violent fighting going on in the Cuito area  of Angola. The latest reports tell us that more than 100 people  have been killed and more than 200 have been injured. We have  been informed that, despite that, UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] will continue the negotiations in  Lusaka. On the other hand, the Angolan Government admitted it  is engaging in a major military offensive action in northern  Angola:    [Correspondent Mendes Oliveira] Heavy shelling continued  this  morning in the city of Cuito. According to the Angolan national  radio correspondent in that city, the number of people who have  died since the fighting resumed on Saturday [5 February] is now  over 100. The government forces stated yesterday evening that  they controlled 85 percent of the city, which had been under  UNITA control for five months.    The UNITA leadership held an emergency meeting and decided  that, despite the fighting, it will continue to be present at  the talks in Lusaka and respect the unilateral cease-fire it  declared in September. Despite justifying the attack on the  grounds of maneuvers by the UNITA forces in Cuito, military  sources in Luanda have admitted that the Angolan Armed Forces  are engaged in a major offensive action all over northern  Angola. They stated that they have recaptured the city of  Ambriz and that they are engaged in the attempt to recapture the  oil city of Soyo and city of N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza  Norte province.    Despite this recent escalation, the two delegations will  today resume talks in Lusaka. The presence in Lusaka of the  head of the UNAVEM [United Nations Angola Verification Mission]  military mission has been used as an excuse for them to start  discussion on the mandate of the UN mission and the role of the  observers, leaving behind, unfinished, the difficult issue of  national reconcilliation.    UNITA Spokesman Jorge Valentim yesterday defended the  lifting  of sanctions which prevent the sale of weapons and fuel to  UNITA. Valentim stated that in allowing one of the sides to be  over-armed and engage in an ethnic cleasing policy, the  international community is allowing the creation of new Bosnias  in UNITA-controlled areas.</p>

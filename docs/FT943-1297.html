			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Outdoors: Why cats get the bird - Country View The news that, in 1994 for the first time, magpies have moved into the top ten garden birds will be greeted with cries of horror in some quarters. The survey, carried out by almost 20,000 members of the Young Ornithologists Club, shows an overall fall in the numbers of songbirds visiting our gardens. No doubt there will be some who blame the magpie for the loss. Certainly this fine bird, with its beautiful black and white plumage, tinged with metallic green and blue, and its bold piratical manner, has done extremely well during the past 30 years for its numbers have trebled. On the other hand it has made a come-back from extreme scarcity and there was a time when it was most unusual to spot a magpie as they were heavily controlled by gamekeepers. Even today, in areas with large shooting estates, it is a rare occurrence to see one of these birds. But neither the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds nor the British Trust for Ornithology condemns the magpie. In the poor habitats provided by some gardens, which offer little cover for songbird nests, magpies can be devastating but, generally-speaking, their bad reputation is unwarranted. Research shows that in rural areas an increase in the number of magpies has been matched by an increase in songbirds and even the recent YOC survey indicated that chaffinches and coal tits were also moving up in the top ten. The real reasons for the decline in our songbird population are much more difficult to pin down and probably result from a complex mix rather than one single determinant. Blaming the magpie merely masks the real causes and diverts attention from a proper investigation. Various explanations have been put forward including the increased use of slug pellets. One significant cause is likely to be the domestic cat, the population of which, in Britain, now numbers around 8.5m. While the magpie empties a nest by removing nestlings one at a time with a great deal of noise and distress, it is generally taking nature's doomed surplus, the young of incautious or incompetent parents, Often, the then wiser parent birds nest elsewhere and successfully raise a second brood. Cats, on the other hand, move silently by night and eliminate the parents, leaving the chicks to perish and thwarting any chance of a second brood, a much more devastating blow. So rather than blame the magpie, why not contribute to The Cats Protection League which works hard to persuade cat owners to have pets neutered? The spaying of a single female could prevent thousands of unwanted kittens and help many more garden birds to survive.

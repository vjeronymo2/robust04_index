			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul--Turkish National Defense Minister Mehmet  Golhan reiterated indirectly, but clearly, accusations that  Greece trains Kurdish autonomists. Meeting with his Spanish  counterpart, Golhan said Turkey has been fighting against PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] activities for the past 10 years.  He also noted that this party causes damage in Europe by  carrying out arms and narcotics trade, and said: "Germany and  France have banned the activities of this organization."    The Turkish minister added: "We expect similar behavior from  other countries. However, this is not done by certain  neighbors, such as Greece. We have learned, through confessions  by members of this organization, that certain people are trained  in that country."    Referring to the Cyprus issue, he stressed that Turkey  supports a solution that would appease both sides.</p>

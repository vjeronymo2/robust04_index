The National Police arrested this week Herrera Agurcia, a  retired Army officer, when he was hiding in the home of  Subcommander Tobias Gadea, a retired Government Ministry  official and an Esteli City resident.    The leader of Cobra 93, which operates with the support of  cooperatives in the Miraflor area, said at the time he was  arrested he was making contacts related to his guerrilla  activities. Although Herrera did say: "I have been staying in  his house for a long time," he denied Tobias Gadea's involvement  in this new recompas movement.    Herrera said many retired officers support Cobras 93, but  when there are criminal activities involved, sympathizers begin  to suspect the rearmed members.    Herrera Agurcia, a Quilali native, led the Battalions for  Unconventional Warfare during the past decade, and after joining  the retirement plan for a large number of officers he left for  San Bartolo to farm his father's lands. According to Herrera  Agurcia, the 3-80 Northern Front [FN 3-80] recontras killed his  brother and other relatives and raped and beat his wife, leading  her to have an abortion.    This is how he arrived in Esteli, where he organized the  self-styled Cobra 93 so as to "make the recontras pay for the  death of our relatives."    Herrera Agurcia explained the movement's objectives were  betrayed by Ramon Alejandro Bermudez, a retired officer and  Cobra 93 second in command, because his men began to rape  peasant women and to become involved in kidnappings and attacks  against communities along the Pan-American Highway from Esteli  to Condega.    During a news conference at the National Police Command  Operations Center in Esteli that took place on 25 February,  Herrera Agurcia said before the main police commands of the  department Bermudez had told him before his arrest six policemen  and EPS members on duty were supporting the movement, and they  were even donating war weapons.    Subcommander Douglas Zeledon, second department police  chief,  confirmed Policeman Leonel Valenzuela was arrested as a presumed  "Cobra 93" collaborator.    He added investigations are still going on to detect the  possibility of individuals being involved in planning the  recompas actions. So far the recompas have perpetrated nine  robberies and other crimes.    Zeledon said the operations will continue until  approximately  16 criminals are arrested, although Herrera Agurcia said his  forces include up to 80 men, and if the government does not give  them an enclave, they will begin actions against the FN 3-80 in  El Zungano.    The military operations have resulted in the arrest of 12  people, including two injured, most of whom are retired EPS  members and members of cooperatives in Miraflor, 27 km  northeast of Esteli.    The authorities have also seized 10 AK and M-16 rifles, one  23-25 carbine, TNT explosives, a large amount of ammunition,  backpacks, uniforms, medicine, and other military material.    Subcommander Zeledon explained three criminal bands operate  in Esteli Department, including the remnants of Cobra 93,  robbers who operate in Pueblo Nuevo and affiliate with the FROC  [Peasant-Worker Revolutionary Front], and another group that  operates between Yali and Condega.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with R. Khabibrakhmanov, chief of a subdepartment </F> of the State Land Committee of the Republic of Tatarstan,  conducted by Tatyana Korneyeva: "In Order To Turn the Land Over  to the Peasants in the Rayons"; date and place of interview not  given]    [Text] About three years have passed since the  beginning of the proclamation of land reform in Tatarstan. At a  recent conference in the State Land Committee, some interesting  figures were cited. In 1993 alone, 34,317 orchard plots were  granted to the republic's population. Now there are more than  445,000 of them with a total area of 26,000 hectares. More than  3,700 parcels of land were allocated for individual housing  construction in cities and settlements. The number of personal  auxiliary farms increased by 5,200. However, land reform has not  proceeded smoothly everywhere and in every respect.    R. Khabibrakhmanov, chief of a subdepartment of the  State Land Committee of the Republic of Tatarstan, comments on  the current situation.    [Korneyeva] Rauf Khabibrakhmanovich, although the figures  look impressive, they say little to the uninitiated. What can  you say about the pace of land reform in the republic?    [Khabibrakhmanov] The process of the democratization of land  relations and creation of a mixed economy is proceeding much  more slowly in Tatarstan than in Russia. One of the key aspects  of land reform is the organization of peasant and individual  farms. There are 712 of them in the republic with a total area  of more than 24,000 hectares. But that is only 0.7 percent of  total agricultural land. If one says that 57 farms ceased to  exist last year, the overall picture is a dreary one. In two  cases the individual farmers themselves couldn't make it and  gave up. In the remaining cases land was confiscated because of  various violations of land-use regulations.    The greatest number of peasant farms was organized last year  in Aznakayevskiy, Almetyevskiy, Bavlinskiy, Bugulminskiy and  Spasskiy rayons. And yet no one was found in Atninskiy,  Kaybitskiy and Cheremshanskiy rayons who wanted to establish  individual farms, and there are very few farms in  Tyulyachinskiy, Drozhzhanovskiy, Muslyumovskiy and Apastovskiy  rayons.    [Korneyeva] What are the reasons for that situation?    [Khabibrakhmanov] First of all, there is the effect of  objective circumstances. Despite broad-scale propaganda for  individual farming arrangements, rural residents continue to  prefer collective labor on kolkhozes and sovkhozes. Despite all  their drawbacks, social and economic questions are resolved much  more easily on them. And there is hardly any need to speak yet  again about the numerous difficulties involved in creating a  sound and dependable basis of physical facilities and equipment  for peasant farms. They are well known.    Those are the main but, alas, not the only reasons that have  held up the development of the individual-farming movement. Many  economic executives and local administrations have shown a  negative attitude toward the development of new production  relations in the countryside and have artificially created  various obstacles. Just let a city dweller try to obtain a  parcel of land in a rural locality to use for personal auxiliary  farming! In rare cases will he meet with understanding and  support on the part of local authorities. The picture is more  likely to be the opposite: The kolkhozes and sovkhozes, which  are still monopolistic land owners, do not part so readily with  their property. The flood of complaints from citizens is rising.  A great deal could be done here by the local authorities, who  have been granted broad powers to dispose of parcels of land.  However, the soviets have been acting extremely timidly to  defend citizens' legitimate rights and interests.    [Korneyeva] But perhaps the economic executives and local  administrations are right in not rushing to hand out land right  and left. After all, you mentioned those who have voluntarily  given up parcels of land they have taken, and those from whom it  has even been necessary to take back land parcels.    [Khabibrakhmanov] Unfortunately, there have been a good many  violations of land laws. Last year our service identified more  than a thousand such cases, and administrative penalties were  imposed on many violators; the total amount of the fines came to  3,700,000 rubles. Typical violations involve the unauthorized  construction of facilities by enterprises and organizations  without the necessary official permission to withdraw parcels of  land for such purposes. Quite often production wastes are dumped  on land and fertile soil is polluted. In Baltasinskiy Rayon,  subdivisions of Kazankhimstroy [approximate expansion: Kazan  Trust? for the Construction of Chemical-Industry Facilities] and  Selkhozkhimiya [approximate expansion: Agricultural Chemistry  Association] have been building their own production facilities  without authorization, and a hospital and production facilities  for the gas depot are also being built without authorization. In  Atninskiy Rayon, the rayon DRSU [Regional Directorate of Road  Repair and Construction], the veterinary station and the gas  service are among those engaged in unauthorized construction.    There have been a good many cases in which land has been  used  ineffectively by peasant farms and the auxiliary farms of  industrial enterprises. We analyze matters and attempt to take  action. The ways to improve soil fertility and crop yields and  to make effective use of land on such farms have been discussed  in Almetyevskiy, Rybno-Slobodskiy, Sabinskiy, Verkhneuslonskiy,  Mamadyshskiy and other rayons.    The oil drillers, the Bugulminskiy Highway Administration,  the "Kamgesenergostroy," the Yelabuga Motor Vehicle Plant, the  Yelabuga Brick Plant and other enterprises simply cannot or do  not want to restore disturbed land to fit condition.    It is important to provide a mechanism in the near future  for  effective state control over the conservation and effective use  of land. This is very important at the stage of the development  of private land ownership and of various forms of economic  operation. Unfortunately, it has proved extremely difficult to  eliminate even the violations that have been identified: we  still lack legislative acts on administrative penalties for the  violation of land legislation. And so far the measures taken  against violators are simply not serious. Fines are meager.    [Korneyeva] Rauf Khabibrakhmanovich, but it seems that there  are no permanent documents codifying citizens' right to land. Is  that the case?    [Khabibrakhmanov] That is not quite the case. Legal  codification of the forms of land possession and use does exist.  In the past two years more than 750,000 land owners and land  users have received appropriate permits--granting the right to  land ownership and to the use of land without a time limit  (permanent use). But these really are temporary permits. Our  committee has prepared the forms for state documents granting  the right of land possession and use. They will be issued in  place of the temporary permits. In this connection, according to  a recent decree of the government of the Republic of Tatarstan,  the reregistration of land previously granted for all categories  of land use has now begun.    [Korneyeva] Aren't the norms for the size of parcels  allocated being changed in this connection?    [Khabibrakhmanov] According to existing legislation, the  size  of parcels turned over at no charge only for ownership by  citizens is strictly limited. I may recall that for an orchard  plot it is 0.1 hectares of land, for housing construction in a  suburban zone--up to 0.15 hectares, for personal auxiliary  farming by city dwellers in a rural location--up to 0.2  hectares, and for rural residents--up to 1 hectare.    Norms also exist for the amount of land turned over for  private ownership for peasant farms. They are different in  different rayons and are approved by the local soviets.</p>

			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Maxwell pensions shortfall cut to less than Pounds 100m LESS THAN Pounds 100m in assets stolen from the Maxwell pension funds remains untraced or in disputed ownership as negotiations intensify for out-of-court settlements to meet the shortfall. Investigators have now identified or secured more than three-quarters of the Pounds 440m they initially believed liquidated or illegally used as collateral for loans by the late Robert Maxwell, reducing the total outstanding to far less than originally feared. The ownership of less than Pounds 100m remains in dispute, but lawyers and accountants are nearing completion of statements of claim that may lead to court action over handling the assets or for professional negligence. The threat of fighting lengthy and costly court actions is intensifying pressure on City institutions that did business with the Maxwell empire to contribute instead to the shortfall through the Maxwell Pensioners Trust. Sir Peter Webster, a retired high court judge and mediation consultant appointed earlier this year to the trust, has now successfully negotiated a settlement to a dispute that would otherwise have led to a costly legal battle. He hopes to to negotiate settlements in place of up to six potential legal actions, which would substantially increase the money available to pensioners. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, is one of several organisations and individuals that did business with the Maxwell group, and has now paid money into the fund without admitting any culpability. Invesco MIM, the fund management group, is coming under increasing pressure to contribute after its Pounds 750,000 fine and Pounds 1.6m in costs imposed last week by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation for breaches including three relating to Mirror Group pension assets. The Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the City's senior regulator, is considering using its powers under Section 61 of the 1988 Financial Services Act to sue Invesco to seek redress for investors. That would come on top of an existing Pounds 11.3m action launched by the Mirror Group pension trustees. SIB could also use its powers for the first time under Section 59 of the act to ban individuals from the financial services industry and under Section 60 to criticise authorised people. Most of the Maxwell pension fund assets have been traced. Others - such as shares in Teva, the Israeli pharmaceutical company, already handed back to the pension funds - have appreciated in value. The Maxwell trust fund continues to receive some donations, with the total to date standing at about Pounds 6.25m. That will allow pensioners to be paid for a further three years.

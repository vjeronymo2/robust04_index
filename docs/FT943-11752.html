			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Company News: Steel group shares tumble Shares in Bethlehem Steel, one of the best-performing big company stocks in the US earlier this year, fell about 8 per cent to close at Dollars 20 3/4 yesterday, as the company's second-quarter results failed to match expectations. After-tax income of Dollars 26m, or 14 cents a share, marked the fourth consecutive quarter in which the big steelmaker has been in profit, and compared with a loss of Dollars 14m, or 27 cents a share, a year ago. The year-on-year improvement stemmed from 'higher realised steel prices and increased shipments,' the company said. Sales were 10 per cent higher than a year before, at Dollars 1.23bn. For the first six months of the year, net income was Dollars 39m, compared with a loss of Dollars 54m a year before.</p>

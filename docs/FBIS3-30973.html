			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network] </F>   [Text] An agreement was reached early this morning between  the strike committee and the board of the Jastrzebie Coal  Company. The Miners Trade Union, however, has withdrawn from  the signing of the protocol.    [Correspondent Adam Sojka] The agreement envisages a  7.2-percent pay increase for January, compared to December last  year, and a 10-percent increase for February, as compared to  January. Earnings will remain at the February level in March.  Moreover, the union side has pledged that it will only use  legal means of protest in the future, means that are provided by  the law on trade unions.    At the same time, the board announced that it will request  the law-enforcement bodies to stop criminal proceedings against  people involved in the blockade of the board's offices and radio  broadcasting networks in collieries. Both sides have agreed  that no pay is due for the period of the strike, and the  financial compensation for people who did not work will take  place after making up for lost output. The board of the  company, however, stipulated that the agreement would come into  force when it is signed by all the trade unions. Only the  Miners Trade Union refrained from initialling the agreement. At  the moment, negotiations are being held concerning this matter.  Unofficially, we have learned that the strike may be suspended,  possibly even today.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / International Bonds: EIB eurobond offering takes centre stage The European Investment Bank's expected Y50bn offering of three-year eurobonds was the main focus of attention in the eurobond market yesterday. Lead manager Mitsubishi Finance reported firm demand for the offering. The issue passed mainly to Japanese institutions although there was also some interest from European investors. The EIB said the proceeds of the offering would refinance a yen-denominated bond it called recently. However, other syndicate managers expressed disappointment at the pricing, which they said was expensive. The bonds were issued with a coupon of 3.2 per cent to yield 3.134 per cent. Syndicate managers had been looking for a yield which was 10 to 15 basis points higher. They said given such aggressive pricing, much of the issue was likely to be sold back to the lead manager over the the next few days. According to one trader, once the bonds were freed to trade the spread widened from six basis points below the yield on the Japanese government's No 102 three-year bond to one basis point above the JGB. However, the lead manager said that the spread was unchanged at the close. The other deal of interest yesterday was a Dollars 265m offering of seven-year amortising notes from MC Cuernavaca Trust, the Mexican state-owned toll road which links Mexico City with Cuernavaca. The securitised offering will be backed by receipts from the toll road. The bonds, which will have an average life of 3.38 years, are due to priced today at about 350 basis points over US Treasuries to produce a semi-annual yield of 10 1/8 per cent. Lead manager Lehman Brothers said the single-A rating on the offering, the first of its kind from a Mexican toll road, resulted in a broad spread of demand from both sides of the Atlantic. Elsewhere, news that Standard &amp; Poor's had lowered Venezuela's eurobond ratings to single-B plus from double-B minus had little impact on spreads on Venezuelan bonds since they had already widened out substantially last week in response to the deteriorating situation in the country. Indeed, some bankers are not ruling out an early military coup, in view of the government's recent limitations on civil liberties. The outlook on the ratings is negative. S&amp;P has raised its senior long-term debt rating of Aegon, the Dutch insurer, to double-A from double-A minus and subordinated debt rating to double-A minus from A plus. S&amp;P said the ratings reflect Aegon's strong market position, favourable operating performance and conservative capitalisation. The outlook on the rating is stable.</p>

			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Clearer finance law urged A CHANGE in the law is needed to clarify the duties of financial firms towards their customers, according to the head of the Law Society's company law committee. Mr Bill Knight, a partner at City law firm Simmons &amp; Simmons, called present law 'a mess' and said clarification was necessary to ensure that financial firms knew where they stood in dealings with customers. He was responding to a Law Commission paper published last week on the complex legal issues raised by the trend for investment firms to offer a much wider range of services. The discrepancies between a firm's common-law duties to its customers and regulations that govern its activities leave the true legal picture un-clear, the commission said. For example, under common law, an insurance broker should disclose all fees and commissions received for helping a customer choose a life assurance policy. Under City regulations, those payments are kept secret. Also under common law, stockbroking firms should not deal in securities on their own account while simultaneously advising clients whether to buy or sell the same securities, and also advising the companies that issued the securities. Such practices are common in the City. It is unclear what the true legal position is in such cases because the courts have not been asked to rule on such matters. The uncertainty has raised fears of a legal minefield on a par with the local-authority swaps fiasco. In that instance, after a long legal dispute the House of Lords ruled that UK local authorities were not obliged to pay out losses on swap transactions to banks. Those deals involved authorities' exchanging fixed-rate debts for floating-rate ones. Mr Knight said: 'It's important to have our markets based on concepts which everyone understands. We are in favour of the minimum possible legislation to achieve clarity.' The Law Society would have to analyse the Law Commission's paper in more detail before it could decide how extensive changes in law needed to be, he said. According to the commission, the courts are likely to take City regulations into account when judging whether a firm has carried out its common-law duties. However, it called for a simple legal change to make that explicit.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Opening statements began Tuesday in the trial of an ex-convict who  investigators say is responsible for a crime rampage that terrorized East San  Diego residents in August, 1989.  </P> <P> Emmanuel Lucious, 30, is being tried on 12 felony counts stemming from attacks  on three residences, including one in which a 64-year-old woman was raped.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Josephine Kiernan detailed for the jury the crimes Lucious  allegedly committed.  </P> <P> Besides the rape, Lucious is charged with one count of attempted rape in an  attack on the same woman, one count of assault with the intent to rape, three  counts of residential robbery with the use of a gun, one count of attempted  residential robbery, four counts of residential burglary with the use of a gun,  one count of false imprisonment.  </P> <P> Kiernan said DNA testing will reveal that Lucious was the man who raped a woman  in her neighbor's house while the neighbor was forced to lie on the floor in  another room.  </P> <P> Lucious had been freed after serving eight years of a 14-year sentence for  similar crimes only six weeks before the crime spree in the Oak Park area of  East San Diego.  </P> <P> Lucious is being held in lieu of $500,000 bail, and his trial is expected to  last well into the new year.  </P></p>

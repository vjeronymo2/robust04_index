			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring lifts Platignum PLATIGNUM made a profit of Pounds 384,000 in the second half to produce Pounds 713,000 pre-tax for the year to March 31, against Pounds 405,000. The improvement was achieved substantially through restructuring. Several business disposals and acquisitions have been made, providing a clearer strategic focus. Mr Rob Campbell, chief executive, said the group was well structured for further progress. However, 'we are not experiencing any improvement in demand in the markets in which we operate'. Activities of the group cover stationery, housewares, cabinet furniture, and paper recycling. Sales in 1992-93 fell to Pounds 15.1m (Pounds 17.1m) because of discontinued activities. Mr Campbell said stationery had an excellent year following the integration of Ivy into the Royston factory. Housewares benefited from the Coffee Connections acquisition last September, but low demand made it a poor year for furniture and substantial cost cutting took place. Earnings per share were 2.88p (1.98p) and the final dividend is 0.25p for a total of 0.5p (nil).</p>

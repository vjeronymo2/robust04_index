			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> All in the Family: "Roots" author Alex Haley was the guest of honor during the  weekend at the first Black Family Reunion staged in his hometown of Memphis,  Tenn. Attended by an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people, the celebration ended  Sunday with services at area churches. "This reunion celebration feels to me  like a great big church supper," Haley said. "We don't know each other as well  here as we might have in smaller communities, but the more occasions we have  like this, the more all of us . . . will be strengthened."  </P> <P> Lighten Up: Baltimore contractor Donald E. Keister, 30, is white but he wants  some of the city contracts set aside for minorities. While city officials grant  that Keister certainly is in the minority, they have rejected his demands. At  his 640-pound weight, the contractor maintains he is a minority of one but  officials say the preference law was to help women and members of races who  have suffered discrimination -- not overweight people.  </P> <P> The Dark Side: Actress Marriette Hartley's autobiography belies her sunny  image. In the book, Hartley, 50, talks about her father's suicide, her own  suicide attempt at 15, her days as a battered wife and her own alcoholism.  Hartley was 23 when her father killed himself, but she and her mother  "pretended that nothing had happened." Years of drinking and binge-eating  followed. "I'd drunkenly squat in front of an open refrigerator, an open  cupboard, drinking vodka and eating everything, including Purina Cat Chow," she  writes. After psychotherapy and support groups, Hartley says she's able to face  her problems, although "when I talk about the past, my knees shake."  </P> <P> Expert Witness: Clarence Brandley, who says he's proof of the power of prayer,  made his preaching debut Sunday night at his family's Baptist church in  Houston. Brandley, 38, was released from death row after nine years Jan. 23  when the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed his 1980 murder conviction.  Brandley preached from Acts 12:5: "So Peter was kept in prison but earnest  prayer for him was made to God by the church."  </P></p>

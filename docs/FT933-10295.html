			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / Nigerian opposition leader flies to London NIGERIA'S political crisis took a new turn yesterday when Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of the country's aborted presidential election, arrived in London to press his claim for recognition as the country's civilian leader. He left Lagos on Tuesday night in his private jet bound for the northern city of Katsina, according to the flight plan. The jet flew on to Luton airport, where he landed early yesterday. A close aide said the Social Democratic party leader feared for his life. Later in the day, however, Mr Abiola denied there was anything unusual about his arrival, saying he was en route to Washington for discussions on recent developments in Nigeria. He left behind a divided SDP. He and senior party officials are at odds over President Ibrahim Babangida's proposed interim government. In an interview with the BBC yesterday, Mr Abiola again rejected it and pressed his claim on the presidency. Earlier in the day, however, a party official in Lagos defended the idea, saying that Gen Babangida had promised that an interim government would be wholly civilian. Mr Abiola apparently won the presidential election in June but the military cancelled the polls and offered the SDP and the one other legal party, the National Republican Convention, a choice between a fresh election and an interim government. Gen Babangida has repeatedly promised that the military will hand over power to civilians by August 27, but on Saturday he said the proposed interim government was 'a consensus arrangement for concluding the transitional agenda of this administration'. Mr Amos Idakula, SDP spokesman, told Reuter yesterday that the president had made his promise about a civilian administration on July 5 when he first presented the two parties with the choice. Mr Abiola's supporters in the SDP have accused the party's national officers of selling out to the government. Twenty-four of the 30 state chairmen of the SDP also dissociated themselves from the interim government proposal on Tuesday.</p>

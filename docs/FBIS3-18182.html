Imset: "Dicle's Mission: Closing </F> Down Democracy Party"]    [Text] Ankara--Recent statements made by Kurdish based  Democracy Party (DEP) chairman Hatip Dicle and Friday's [20  February] bomb attack on the party headquarters in Ankara have  made it even more clear that Dicle's mission in the DEP is to  have the party closed down altogether. If those within the DEP  want their pro-Kurdish political party to survive and if they  are sincere in their bid for unity between the Kurds and turks,  they must either toppled the Dicle flank as soon as possible or  resign from the party. Otherwise, they have to accept that under  Dicle's management, the party is serving only to fan alienation  between the people who make up modern Turkey and to take the  country to the brink of civil war.    The election of Dicle as the party's chairman last December  was the result of three developments known to all observers.  Firstly, Turkey's military solution to the Kurdish crisis,  which prevented any moderate approach or political initiative,  had naturally strengthened radical trends within the Kurdish  armed and political movement. Second, Dicle had maintained an  upper hand in relations with the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] leadership and had thus strengthened his own local  support through their support of him. Third, the moderates were  too weak seriously to challenge him during the convention.    It was evident, months before Dicle's election to the party  chairmanship, that the hardline trend which has taken over the  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was having its impact on this  party as well.    Through reports of DEP radicals reaching the PKK chairman  and  his close aides, the party's moderate and peaceful  parliamentarians became targets, and were harshly criticised for  the lives they lived. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, receiving his  only information on DEP from the party's hardliners, lashed out  at everyone "living in the lodgings" referring to  parliamentarians, and in a highly Marxist-Leninist tone, accused  them for living in a bourgeois style.    Ocalan's European-based political adviser Kani Yilmaz issued  a statement about the same time, calling for the DEP to withdraw  from parliament altogether and telling its parliamentarians to  return to their people.    The main motive of the PKK leadership prior to Dicle's  election was for the party to be closed down, the democratic  platform to be abandoned altogether and everyone to go  underground.    A TDN [TURKISH DAILY NEWS] analysis published when Dicle  took  power had rung the necessary alarm bells: "Perhaps the best way  to explain what is going on in Turkey's Democracy Party is to  define it as the Hatip Dicle Syndrome--if one wants to avoid  openly to brand it the PKK takeover," it had said.    Even then it was evident that in reality: "Nothing is to be  the same for the DEP any longer, and those who in the past  argued that the party's policies were too radical can now parade  on the streets. For, looking at what the new DEP chairman is  saying and doing, the word `radical' may indeed be too light an  expression to describe where the party is headed after this."  The December DEP convention had started off spreading hope in  the hearts of many turks (even the most cynical ones) that the  party had finally seen the realities and that it could pull  itself together. Even columnists such as Emin Colasan, who have  been the staunchest critics of this pro-Kurdish entity, wrote  advice to the party to conclude its metamorphosis.    But many missed the irony behind the window dressing. Days  in advance of the convention, a decision was made to ban any  flags other than the Turkish and party flags and even slogans  had been censored. It was decided that party officials would  prohibit any "unwanted" demonstrations and slogans. A decision  was also made not to decorate the meeting hall with the  red-yellow-green colors of the Kurdish flag as in previous  gatherings of similar nature.    In the words of one newspaper, it appeared that the DEP was  seeking "a new and Turkish image" for itself. Television news  programs even claimed that the party was to open up to Turkish  candidates and accept them to run for local and general  elections. The window dressing was to demonstrate that this  Kurdish-based party was becoming part of the Turkish political  apparatus.    But it was evident to observers that something was seriously  wrong with the way things were going in the party and thus those  who followed Kurdish politics closely were not surprised by the  result.    On the one hand, the DEP was trying to give the impression  that it was in the midst of a serious policy change and turning  to moderate views. On the other, it was certain from even  before the convention that Dicle, one of the most radical  activists, would win.    In his first speech as chairman, which angered millions of  Turks, Dicle literally praised the PKK, branded it as a  political party, defined it as a counterpart and defended its  position. Although he said the DEP and PKK were different  entities and that the former was a legal organization, the  message he gave was that nothing could be done to solve the  Kurdish issue without reserving a place for the PKK at the table.    This was, as far as Turkish public opinion was concerned, a  clear indication that the DEP had set its goals and priorities.  It was evident from then on that as long as Dicle ran the  party, the future of the DEP lay with the PKK.    Dicle's position was clear from the very beginning for the  DEP moderates. According to them, he had direct links with the  PKK leadership; he even reported on his own colleagues to Ocalan  and he had completely taken charge of the DEP-PKK link. As for  the PKK, its position is also clear. In January 1994 alone, a  total of 254 militants were killed by security forces in the  troubled region. The Zhalah camp was bombed and bombings of  camps inside Turkey still continue.    It is thus clear that what the PKK needs at a time like  this,  when it is concentrating more than ever on building up its  strength in the region, is to get as many people as possible up  to the mountains.    A closure of the DEP, or its complete alienation with a  majority of Turks, is thus crucial for the PKK's own hardline  plans and will undoubtedly serve the PKK's interests in the near  future for it will be used to legitimize illegal and armed  struggle in the Southeast.    This can best be seen in the PKK leadership's constant  argument, supported lately by Dicle, that the doors to a legal  struggle have been closed, that Turkey is preventing all  democratic approaches, and that the only way to solve the  Kurdish problem is through escalated guerrilla warfare. Thus  the window dressing of the DEP convention -- "opening up to the  Turks" -- fits well into the picture. Once the party is closed  down, there will be even more propaganda; that it was closed  despite its move to extend a hand to the Turkish people and that  Ankara, by shutting down the party, closed down the only  peaceful way available.    Now, the argument, however justified it may be, that the DEP  may be blocked in the upcoming March 27 local elections, serves  this scenario as well.    Abroad, such a development, along with a closure of the  party, will undoubtedly -- and quite rightly -- be portrayed as  more evidence against Turkish "democratization" and to justify  armed activities, even those targeting civilians. Such a  message can clearly be seen in Dicle's recent remarks that the  PKK's attack on a train station was legitimate and directed at  "a military target."    It is evident that Dicle is a disgrace not only for Turkey  as  a whole but more importantly for the Kurdish people. He is not  working for their benefit or for any known or justified cause.  A TDN analysis published on Dec. 13 had correctly concluded  that: "Now, with Dicle, the DEP will undoubtedly do all it can  to have itself closed down as soon as possible. If there is no  surprise development in the coming months, the Dicle Syndrome  will be the last that the DEP ever sees. From then on there  will only be the PKK."    For those who have not yet heard, the most recent  speculation  among Kurdish circles in Ankara is that closing shop for the DEP  will not be an exclusive development and will actually be  followed by "other withdrawals from the legal platform," or, to  be quite clear, "a full withdrawal from legality."    The daily OZGUR GUNDEM, for instance, is now preparing to  close down. There are also similar rumors for other legal  pro-Kurdish organizations.    More or less as if there were a concerted plan underway to  pull everyone, all Kurdish institutions, underground. What  cannot be missed at this point is that Turkish reaction to the  DEP has been building up for some time and has reached its peak.  In other words, this reaction may be the key to the overall  plan and instrumental in implementing it.    Thus Dicle has a great "responsibility" here in further  fanning that reaction and alienating the Turks. His only  success has been in doing just this. In turn, the reaction  among a majority of Turks to armed attacks only serves to  increase the strength of the radicals in the Kurdish movement.  A vicious circle.    It is now up to those within the DEP who in private argue  against Dicle's policies and say they sincerely support Turkey's  unity, to take action to break this circle.    Either through an emergency convention which will topple  Dicle and replace him with a moderate leader, or by resigning  from the party altogether, such activists must immediately take  action and differentiate themselves from the central ruling  flank. What is equally important, for the sake of all the  people of Turkey, is to be able to take a strong and determined  stance against terrorism, whatever its source.    If those now gearing up to move against Dicle are sincere,  they have to come out once and for all and condemn terrorism.  They must condemn the use of terrorist tactics aimed at  civilians for any cause and they must condemn such tactics put  into force by the PKK.    Turkey today is living through a serious era of provocation  and it does not matter from which side it comes. Dicle, for his  part, is as dangerous as those provoking Kurdish enmity on the  Turkish side. Everyone who genuinely wishes to break the  vicious circle and thus to avoid a civil war or another  interruption of democracy, has to come together and act against  "provocateurs." For now, what is clear is that the first step  has to come from the DEP side and the main culprit within it.  This person, who betrays not only humanity in general but the  Kurdish people he so much claims to be "fighting for," has to be  either isolated with his own groups -- and left in the pit he  has so clumsily fallen into -- or removed from the party's  leadership. Even then, it is going to be a difficult task for  the "moderates," since they too are now among the unwanted in  Turkey. But at least they will have to chance to maintain their  own dignity and perhaps, in taking the necessary action, will  have the personal satisfaction of having given peace a chance.</p>

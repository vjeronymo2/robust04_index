			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / BMW talks to Honda on Rover BMW is expected to start learning in Tokyo today Honda's response to the German carmaker's Pounds 800m plan to buy Rover Group, Honda's UK partner. Talks this week involving Honda executives and teams led by Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, and Mr John Towers, chief executive of Rover, will help determine whether Honda will continue under BMW's majority ownership its 15-year partnership with Rover. Last night Honda, which has a 20 per cent stake in Rover, was giving no clues as to which way it might jump. Its agreements with Rover allow it to break formal ties as little as seven days after the passing of Rover into new ownership. However, analysts this weekend said such a move would be almost inconceivable given the commercial value to Honda of its collaboration with Rover. Honda receives some Pounds 400m annually in parts revenue alone, for example. The Japanese carmaker has made clear its anger at the intended deal, which it regards as a betrayal of the close working relationship which has developed between Honda and Rover. But this anger is directed solely at Rover's current owner, British Aerospace. Honda executives say that Rover itself has been powerless to prevent its own sale. BMW hopes to persuade Honda to stay in the partnership. However, Honda regards BMW as a rival, strongly wished for Rover to remain independent, and at the least is expected to extract a high commercial price for not pulling out. Should Honda be persuaded to form a long-term, tripartite collaboration, 'it would be a seminal event which could change the status of the motor industry for ever', and guarantee the futures of all three, according to Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School and adviser to the House of Commons select committee on trade and industry.

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE DEFEND TREATMENT OF MAN WHO DIED IN JAIL  </P> <P> Santa Paula police on Wednesday defended their treatment of a 23-year-old man  who died in their jail of a suspected drug overdose and said they could not  rule out the possibility that the man smuggled cocaine in with him.  </P> <P> Police Chief Walter H. Adair said Daniel Guajardo, who was found dead about 10  hours after he was arrested, may have entered the jail cell with drugs.  </P> <P> He said he did not know if officers had done a body cavity search.  </P> <P> However, Adair said it was his opinion that the man had simply had a delayed  reaction to the cocaine.  </P> <P> Toxicology reports that may explain whether Guajardo died of a cocaine overdose  might not be finished for eight to 12 weeks, coroner's investigator Mitchael  Breese said. An autopsy on Guajardo revealed no apparent cause of death such as  disease or injury, he said. The body did have "marks from a fight he had with  his wife," Breese said.  </P> <P> Santa Paula police said there were no indications when Guajardo was booked that  he was at risk of suffering an overdose.  </P> <P> "There was no indication of a medical emergency, so there was no need to take  him to the hospital," Adair said. "We arrest hundreds of people every year who  are under the influence who don't need to be taken to the hospital."  </P> <P> Guajardo was arrested about 5 p.m. Monday at an apartment complex in downtown  Santa Paula after a heated argument with his wife, his relatives said.  </P> <P> Guajardo was highly emotional and agitated when officers arrived, Adair said.  Guajardo was exhibiting symptoms that signal someone is on cocaine, such as  dilated pupils and a high pulse rate, said Commander Bob Gonzales of the Santa  Paula Police Department.  </P> <P> One officer used a restraint hold to put handcuffs on Guajardo but did not  cause any injuries, Adair said.  </P> <P> Guajardo was arrested on suspicion of cocaine possession, being under the  influence of cocaine and interfering with a peace officer.  </P> <P> Three folded paper containers holding cocaine were discovered in the police car  that was used to take Guajardo to the station, Gonzales said.  </P> <P> Guajardo admitted that the drugs belonged to him, Gonzales said. The officer  said squad cars are routinely checked when officers change shifts in case a  suspect has stashed drugs under the seats.  </P> <P> Two hours after Guajardo was arrested, he was able to remember phone numbers,  Adair said. He called his family and complained of chest and leg pains, his  estranged wife said.  </P> <P> A sergeant who has worked as a narcotics officer checked on Guajardo, Adair  said.  </P> <P> Guajardo, who was last seen alive at 1:30 a.m., was pronounced dead when he was  found between 3 and 3:15 a.m., Breese said.  </P> <P> Gonzales said Sgt. Wes Easley found Guajardo's body.  </P> <P> "It's very stressful for everyone concerned, the department and the family,"  Adair said. "It's very disconcerting to have something like this happen."  </P> <P> The family said Guajardo, who is survived by his wife and four children, was  not a violent man.  </P> <P> He had been arrested in the past 10 years by the Santa Paula Police Department  on suspicion of possessing switchblades, on suspicion of grand theft and twice  on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, Adair said. He said he had no  further information on the arrests.  </P> <P> Adair said the department would have more comments about the case when the  toxicology report is completed.  </P> <P> He said it was possible to develop an arrhythmia, or abnormal heartbeat, after  taking cocaine.  </P> <P> "Maybe his heart did fine until afterward when he was coming down off of it and  developed an arrhythmia," Breese said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today  repeated his invitation to Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda,  Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and  the acting president of Burundi to a meeting in Nairobi on  Monday, 6 June. This will be to deliberate on lasting peace to  Rwanda.    In a statement issued in State House, Nakuru, President Moi  said the Rwandan problem is so complex that it not only requires  serious commitment to peace by all concerned but also needs an  agreed approach by all neighbors of Rwanda who are now affected  in one way or the other. He added that the meeting would  require the presence of all heads of state invited. He pointed  out that if one may not be able to attend, the meeting will be  postponed until all heads of state concerned are present.  President Moi expressed grave concern regarding the loss of  life of the innocent citizens of Rwanda.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Personal View: Russian arithmetic doesn't add up Now that President Boris Yeltsin has survived the political battle, the focus shifts back to the economy. Can Russia really stop printing money and control inflation? One might think that, with the western aid already promised, it should be easy. But the arithmetic shows otherwise. That is why the US is urging the other Group of Seven industrial nations to support an additional Dollars 4bn privatisation fund. The proposal will be discussed when G7 finance ministers meet in Washington this week. Without this extra money Russian industry can only be restructured with printed roubles. And that would ruin everything. Let us examine the arithmetic. The government is pledged to reduce inflation to 5 per cent a month by Christmas (compared with 25 per cent a month since last September). This means a massive cut in the growth of central bank credit. Even if the government's share of this credit is limited to 5 per cent of the national income, and even with all the aid already promised, enterprises will be able to borrow very little. In fact they will be unable to borrow even enough to maintain the real value of their working bank balances. There would be no finance for investment or budgetary costs of restructuring. That would defeat the objective of the exercise. But, more important, it would make the government's whole disinflation programme politically infeasible. What is needed is a two-handed approach. There should be a sharp tightening of central bank credit, including what goes to the commercial banks. This will apply hard budget constraints to enterprises, and will stop them borrowing to pay wage increases and to finance unproductive labour. It will sharply reduce obsolete lines of production. But at the same time there must be a source of finance for new lines of production and to cover the social costs of closures. Enterprise loans should be made only to privatised (or privatising) enterprises that produce viable business plans. For such plans there is currently no source of long-term finance; most loans are for six months or less. And there could be no domestic source of investment finance that is not inflationary, because profits get squeezed during a stabilisation programme. So substantial money for restructuring should come from abroad. Though some oil loans are in the pipeline along with a few other western export credits for industrial buyers, the industrial sector as a whole will on present plans get no money beyond what is needed to protect its working capital. That is why the US government has had the vision to propose, at Russia's request, a Dollars 4bn privatisation fund. It would have three main, closely related parts. The first would be a large financlng facility under joint western-Russian control, to respond to requests coming from enterprises, regardless of sector, and using western criteria of risk appraisal. The only criterion should be the likely profitability of the project, and lending would be step-by-step for specific expenditures, with later tranches depending on adequate performance. If the lending agency is to approve a project, it must receive an intelligible business plan. The agency would have to specify the form in which such plans were to be drawn up. But to produce such plans the enterprises will need independent business advice. This is the second critical need in Russia. Many enterprises makepromising products for which they could find foreign markets as domestic markets collapse. But they have no marketing skills and often no idea who to contact in the west. If there is not to be a devastating collapse in the industrial sector, these enterprises desperately need advice. Training is also vital. Russia desperately needs workers trained in commercial skills that were totally lacking under communism. Almost a third of the workforce needs to be retrained. The third need is for money to cover the budgetary costs of restructuring. Adequate severence is vital, and housing and healthcare formerly paid for by enterprises will have to moved on to the budget. Thus the concept of the fund is an integrated whole. Business plans are no good without money, and money is no good without sound business plans. And both will fail if the government cannot provide a sound social basis for reform. The whole of the west should endorse this plan, and do it now. The World Bank is not short of money and the US government has offered to put up Dollars 500m. Why delay agreement till the Tokyo summit in July? The author is director of the Centre for Economic Performance at London School of Economics and an adviser to the Russian government</p>

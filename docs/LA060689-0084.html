			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOVE IS ON TO THIN OUT DIVISION I;  </P> <P> NCAA COMMITTEE PROPOSES REQUIREMENTS TO RESTRICT MEMBERSHIP  </P> <P> Tom Hansen, commissioner of the Pacific-10 Conference, once watched tears come  to the eyes of a university president as the man pleaded for his school to  remain in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s Division I, the big time of  college sports.  </P> <P> "This is the type of emotion we are dealing with," Hansen told a group of  several hundred athletic directors in Anaheim Monday.  </P> <P> The issue at hand is the swollen membership of Division I, which stands at 293  schools, 291 of which play Division I basketball. The prevailing sentiment  among the members -- and particularly among the big-budget, high-profile  schools -- is that some of the fringe schools operating a bare-bones program  simply must go.  </P> <P> "There's no question about that," Hansen said. "There is currently great  disparity in Division I, where there are programs with 25 to 30 sports and a  $15-million budget, and those that don't average a minimum of six sports and  have budgets of less than $1 million."  </P> <P> Hansen, a member of an NCAA restructuring committee that is studying a range of  issues including Division I membership, made his remarks at the Anaheim  convention of the National Assn. of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, a  professional organization that has no governing powers.  </P> <P> Hansen painted a picture of a Division I membership that includes scores of  schools that award minimal scholarships to athletes in sports such as track and  field, schools that rarely send competitors to NCAA championships and an  astoundingly high number of schools -- 102 -- that average fewer than 2,500 in  home basketball attendance.  </P> <P> The ability to compete in Division I basketball -- thus having a shot at the  financial rewards of the NCAA tournament -- is considered the major lure of  Division I.  </P> <P> "You really have to question whether they should be voting with North Carolina,  Syracuse and Michigan," Hansen said.  </P> <P> The NCAA restructuring committee, chaired by Fred Jacoby, Southwest Conference  commissioner, has proposed a set of requirements to make Division I membership  more restrictive, among them:  </P> <P>  -- Minimum scholarship levels.  </P> <P>  -- Minimum average basketball attendance levels, possibly 2,500.  </P> <P>  -- Minimum qualifiers for NCAA championships over several years.  </P> <P> Those are criteria that are threatening to some schools, but the proposals drew  minimal argument Monday, probably because they could not come up for a vote  before 1991, and still face several obstacles before making it onto a ballot.  </P> <P> There also is the logic offered by several athletic directors in attendance:  How can you expect segments of the membership to vote themselves out?  </P> <P> "We're not worried about it at this time," said Cal State Fullerton Athletic  Director Ed Carroll, whose only concern among the criteria was the minimum  attendance. Fullerton averages well under 4,000 for basketball.  </P> <P> As part of an effort to entice fringe schools to move to Division II, Hansen  said he proposes allowing Division II schools to be considered for the NCAA  tournament, as well as enhancing the Division II tournament with financial or  television guarantees.  </P></p>

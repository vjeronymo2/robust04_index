			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SPORTSCOPE;  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVS' OWNER TO HEAD GREATER L.A. SOCCER LEAGUE  </P> <P> Gabriel Cucuk of Rancho Palos Verdes has been elected president of the Greater  Los Angeles Soccer League. Cucuk, owner of the San Pedro Yugoslavs, replaces  Tony Morejon, who has served for eight years. Cucuk's term is four years.  </P> <P> Morejon was retained as an administrator and consultant to the league, which  opens its 87th season Nov. 11 at Daniels Field in San Pedro. Cucuk, a machine  shop operator, plans to create a league all-star team that will play  international touring teams when they swing through Southern California.  Interviewed last year, Cucuk told The Times that he was looking for a role to  play in helping the United States prepare to play host to the 1994 World Cup.  </P> <P> One of the requirements for the United States to get the World Cup was that it  establish a professional soccer league of its own. Cucuk said he can foresee  the Greater L.A. Soccer League taking advantage of that atmosphere. He said he  hopes the league can play statewide competition.  </P> <P> H. J. Meyers, 77, a regular at Los Verdes Country Club, shot his age recently  to win the second low-gross title of the Los Angeles City Senior Men's Golf  Championship at Griffith Park.  </P> <P> The Gamblers co-ed slow-pitch softball team, based in Redondo Beach, begins  defense of its title Thursday in the fifth Mexicana Silver Cup at San Jose del  Cabo, Baja California. Twenty-one teams from Canada, Mexico and the United  States will compete. The event runs eight days.  </P> <P> Ascot Raceway begins its final month of the 1989 campaign with CMC Nationals  tonight at 7:30, followed by the CRA Series for sprint cars Saturday night at  8. Only three CRA events remain. Ron Shuman of Tempe, Ariz., has a 51-point  lead over Jerry Meyer of Chino and a 97-point lead over Rip Williams of Yorba  Linda. Mike Sweeney of Carson is stuck in sixth place with very little room to  move up or down. Mike Kirby of Redondo Beach, once as high as sixth, has  dropped to 10th.  </P> <P> Babbitt Enterprises of Redondo Beach has folded its racing division, but owner  Jeff Babbitt said last week that he plans to have a car ready for the final  three weeks.  </P></p>

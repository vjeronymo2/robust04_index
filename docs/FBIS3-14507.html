Here are more details from Zohra Zemit.    [Zemit] At the meeting which brought together the head of  state and the FLN party delegation, the latter conveyed to the  head of state a letter of proposals on the means for making the  national dialogue successful and overcoming the current  political crisis.    The letter, a copy of which was received by the radio today,  has pointed out that the chances, albeit very small, for making  the national dialogue a success were still there. The letter  hoped that the national dialogue, called for by the head of  state, would not be another missed opportunity. Consequently,  the letter added, that the FLN political bureau believed that  the state, represented in the person of Mr. Lamine Zeroual, was  called upon to take firm measures which would create chances for  making such a dialogue a success, and would bring about a  political relaxation which would allow the people as well as the  rest of political and social forces to continue the dialogue, to  get involved in it, and to prepare themselves to accept its  outcome.    The letter pointed out, furthermore, that the people were  called upon this year to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1  November revolution and to be loyal to such a great revolution.  The latter would require, however, the generation which fought  it, including the head of state Lamine Zeroual, to mobilize  itself to put an end to the confrontation between the Algerians,  which has nearly blown away everything such a revolution has  achieved.    The letter concluded by asserting that the FLN political  bureau was convinced that a serious and a profound dialogue  between all Algerians, without any seclusion, would bring back  hope to the people and would overcome the serious and  complicated problems which have been threatening the country's  stability, security, progress and independence.    The Ettahaddi movement has issued a statement today, after  its Coordinator Mr. Hachemi Cherif was received by the head of  state Lamine Zeroual, in which it stressed its known stances  towards the situation and the ways to deal with the crisis.  With regard to the latter, it considers that redrawing the  political map and the emergence of a new political class, on the  basis of the project of modernization, were a pressing need for  bringing about the rupture with all the methods and practices of  the past.    The Ettahaddi movement considered that the transition  leading  to a modern state of law compelled the country to embark upon  radical structural reforms. This need goes hand in hand with  the complete elimination of terrorism and fighting extremism  relentlessly on all fronts, in the society and the institutions  of the republic.</p>

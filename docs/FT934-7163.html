			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Capital Spending (22): Smell the tenderness, laughter, candour . . . - Perfumes are very big business. Lucia van der Post meets a man trying to identify the scent of money JEAN Courtiere, President Directeur-General of Parfums Givenchy SA is sitting at his desk in Le Vallois in Paris sniffing. 'This one is a leetle . . . shall we say . . . heavy. This one, it is not audace enough and this one . . . it, perhaps, needs to be a leetle softer.' Three times a week, between nine and 10 o'clock in the morning, this is what he does - he sniffs, sifting the fragrances. From the essential oil houses, from the big international creators of successful smells, from smaller independent 'noses' they come with their little phials which they offer for approval. Courtiere has already defined the concept, he knows the name (Insense), has commissioned the bottle and he is relatively sure that when he smells it he will know the fragrance that fits the bill. It is a race with only one winner. 'It is heartbreaking, but that,' says Courtiere, 'is the name of the game - the winner takes all. We give them all the same marketing brief, the same concept and ask them to bring it to life.' After 12 months there are just four parfumiers left in the race. Just one of them will win the prize - the contract to supply the essential ingredients for as long as the fragrance goes on selling. For everybody else there is nothing but to hope for better luck next time. For Parfums Givenchy there is a lot at stake. If Courtiere manages to usher in a world-wide classic, the pot of gold can run to many, many millions. (Chanel No 5 and Guerlain's Shalimar, two of the all-time best-sellers, are each rumoured to have a turnover of Pounds 50m a year). If it fails . . . and even the most golden of names have their disasters . . . then a great deal of time, money and effort will have been wasted, not to mention the loss of face. In the US, where, it is said, a perfume is launched every six days, only one out of six will still be doing business after three years. Everybody in the industry shudders at the memory of Lacroix's C'est La Vie which is rumoured to have lost LVMH some Dollars 40m. It takes roughly two years to bring a fragrance to the marketplace - 'if everything falls into place, ' says Courtiere. 'It begins with a concept. In the case of Insense it was easy. We had launched Amarige ('sunlight made woman, a hymn to joie de vivre'), in 1991 and what we needed next was a man's fragrance to match it. 'What,' I asked my female colleagues, 'appeals to you in a man?' 'Laughter, candour, tenderness, romanticism, a bit of dash and unexpectedness,' they said. So all that went into the brief.' After much adding and subtracting of elusive ingredients, the 95th version of one of the original recipes is deemed to be the one and Insense ('names are difficult but this one I had had in my head for a long time') is born - 'Wild and Impulsive, The man who will capture the heart of Amarige.' The packaging is planned and the price fixed - though an up-market men's fragrance it cannot be too highly priced for men's fragrances are usually bought by women who, it seems, are meaner (or poorer?) and will not pay as much as men will pay for the fragrances they buy their women. One fine day Insense is ready to be launched. A plane-load of journalists is flown to the Dordogne in the LVMH jet. In the garden of a perfect little manoire awash with blue and yellow flowers (the Insense colours - no detail is too small) Insense is born. Champagne corks pop, music plays, Hubert de Givenchy flies in, cameras click, mounds of foie gras are consumed. If you ask what all this costs, you get a pretty shifty answer. Dollars 50m for a major US-style launch is the industry guess but Courtiere says many are launched with much less. 'Kenzo Parfum, for instance, is a very small company and it has done very well because it clearly relates to Kenzo's own story. Boucheron, too, is small and did not have millions to spend and yet it, too, has been a success according to the goals they set themselves. Jean-Paul Gaultier's fragrance is another great success that did not cost millions to launch - it is exceptional, so consistent with his image, so honest that it has attracted a whole new category of customers.' The good old days when Chanel could summon up her exclusive 'nose', Ernest Beaux, and ask him to make something that simply smelled ravishing seem to have gone. These days it is all about life-styles and niches and keeping up with the trends. We have, so say the fragrance supremos, done with power and aggression - out with assertive scents such as Giorgio, Obsession, Poison. Sweet, sensitive 1990s woman (have you met her yet?) first had a little run with floral essences and softer smells such as Calvin Klein's Eternity, Ralph Lauren's Safari and Cassini. She has now gone 'green' as well as a bit fey. She likes a bit of counter-culture (Jean-Paul Gaultier with his funky woman-shaped bottle) and a breath of Eastern mysticism (L'Eau D'Issey). She also, it seems, is not at all averse to smelling of melon (Dior's Dune) and water melon (New West For Her), of ginger (Jean-Paul Gaultier), of lychee and nectarine (Yves St. Laurent's Champagne) and of Orange Blossom mixed with Vanilla (Van Cleef). These New Age perfumes depend upon something called Ozonics. If that conjures up images of ocean and fresh air, then you are on the right track. Fresh, natural, that is what the latest perfumes are all about. Then we come to the matter of price. There are those who seek to prevent the customer paying over the odds for ingredients that add up to a fraction of the retail price. But today's customer is not fooled. She knows she is paying for image and packaging, for launches and concepts but she knows, too, that perfume was never about logic. Who wants a wonderful smell out of a utilitarian bottle sold in a warehouse? (What happened when Marcel Bich tried to sell a lovely smell in a plain glass phial for Pounds 1.85 a time? Nothing happened. Nobody bought it.) When a customer complained to Christian Dior about the exorbitant price of a hat given the cost of the materials, he dismantled it, gave her the wisp of tulle and the rose saying, 'the materials, Madame, are free.' It is the invisible, the magic that most of us are happy to pay for.</p>

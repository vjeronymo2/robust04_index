			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Libya 'to renounce terrorism' LIBYA claimed yesterday that it was renouncing terrorism but again refused to hand over the two men accused by the US and Britain of responsibility for bombing a PanAm aircraft over Scotland in 1988 which killed 270 people, writes Our Middle East Staff. Mr Ibrahim Mohammed Beshari, Libyan foreign minister, said in Indonesia, where he is attending a meeting of the non-aligned movement, his country's laws prevented extradition of the two suspects. A foreign ministry statement issued in Tripoli referred only to the second part of UN Security Council's Resolution 731 which called on Tripoli to cut all links to terrorist groups. Libya's failure to comply with the first part of the resolution, demanding the extradition of the two suspects, led to the imposition of sanctions last month which cut its international air flights, imposed an embargo on arms sales and scaled down diplomatic representation. Britain repeated yesterday that Libya had to comply with all and not just some of the UN demands. 'The resolutions aren't a menu from which the Libyans can pick and choose,' a UK official said in London.</p>

			<p>Traffickers   To Be Rewarded   <F P=102> PA0406032694 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 45 </F> <F P=103> PA0406032694 </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City LA JORNADA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Carrizales] </F>   [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, 1 Jun -- Mario Ruiz Massieu,  deputy attorney general of the Republic, said that police  commanders or policemen who arrest drug traffickers will receive  a reward, but admitted that his office "does not have the means  or the capacity to compete with the corruption funds offered by  the drug cartels."    Ruiz Massieu reiterated that Attorney General's Office (PGR)  officials who do not work will be fired and that, in the event  that their links to drug traffickers are proved, action will be  taken against them. Ruiz Massieu told members of the Nuevo Leon  Lawyers Association (CANL) that since Jorge Carpizo joined the  PGR and later became Government Secretary he has encouraged  citizens to view the institution "with trust and not with  terror."    He said that regardless of the established inertia and  faults  there is confidence that the PGR can become the institution that  all Mexicans want. Ruiz Massieu asked lawyers and citizens to  criticize and point out faults and deficiencies so that all PGR  officials and agents do their duty, if not by conviction, then  at least out of fear of being exposed.    After meeting with CANL members, the federal official  reiterated in an interview that the call made a few days ago to  PGR delegates and deputies, as well as to Federal Judicial  Police commanders, was not an ultimatum, "they simply were told  that they must know who the most important drug traffickers are  in the states where they work, because their work is to  investigate and they should know all these networks."    Therefore, he added, they should yield results, and these  should begin to be seen in about four weeks. If by then no  results are seen, he reiterated, "we will analyze whether or not  this is due to incompetence or negligence, or because they are  covering up and are accomplices; this is what I said and what I  am repeating."    He added that officials who manage to arrest drug  traffickers  will receive a reward, but the PGR does not have the capacity or  means to equal or surpass what the criminals may offer. He said  that the desire to earn a reward and the commitment to work and  serve society as citizens and human beings must be combined.    Afterward, in a meeting with local business members of the  Nuevo Leon Civic Council Institutions and Civilian Association,  Ruiz Massieu received a request by Gerardo Gomez Valdez, legal  director for the Monterrey National Chamber of Commerce, for the  PGR to unfreeze 200 million new pesos seized from three currency  exchange houses (Monterrey, Colon, and Mercado de Cambios) in  this city, which were charged with laundering money. This  freeze not only affected the business owners, but over 200  businessmen who had nothing to do with the legal procedure.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Amir] </F>   [Excerpts] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] today complied  with the request of Fatah leaders in the Gaza Strip, and in the  context of the understandings reached with them, released the  five armed terrorists who were arrested in two incidents  yesterday. [passage omitted]    Palestinian sources noted that the five are members of  (al-Tanzim al-Siri), a secret organization of Fatah usually used  for internal killings.    Processions and rallies were held today to mark the 29th  anniversary of the establishment of Fatah. One rally, in  Palestine Square, turned into a riot during which six locals  were wounded by soldiers' gunfire, including a 60-year-old  woman. A youngster who threw an explosive charge at the  soldiers was also shot and wounded in the leg.    Thirty-five-year-old 'Azzam al-Aymuni was murdered in Hebron  this morning. He was shot dead while walking in Hebron's 'Isa  neighborhood. His body was taken to the forensic institute. He  was apparently murdered on suspicion of being a collaborator.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 2 January  adds that "two firebombs were thrown at a fuel tanker in Hebron.  The bombs shattered on the road. Soldiers escorting the tanker  opened fire at the perpetrators, but they fled the scene."]</p>

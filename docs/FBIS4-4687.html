			<p>BFN     [Text] Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, made an appearance on a program broadcast by  the FNN Television Network on 3 April and commented on such  issues as Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's controversial 100  million yen loan from the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking group  which has caused a delay in Diet deliberations on the fiscal  year 1994 draft budget. Watanabe said: "Although there may be  arguments against my opinion, I feel that everyone will make  efforts to resolve the situation this week. I plan to do my  part." He thus indicated that the situation should be resolved  this week in order to normalize the Diet's deliberations on the  draft budget.    Concerning rumors regarding the possible dissolution of the  lower house of the Diet and the resignation of the entire  cabinet as a result of this, Watanabe said: "A dissolution of  the lower house rarely occurs, but it cannot be ruled out." As  for the resignation of the entire cabinet, however, Watanabe  said, "It is true that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  intends to corner the cabinet into resigning altogether, but the  party needs to think a little more about what to do afterwards."  He thus indicated that the party should take a more cautious  approach, taking into account the possibility of forming a  cabinet "supported by the whole nation," in which the LDP would  also participate.    In this connection, Watanabe also made a comment regarding  the LDP's cooperation with the ruling coalition government. He  said: "If requested to do so by the government, and should our  demands be adopted, it is only natural for the party to  cooperate. We also have the option of providing support from  outside or within the cabinet."    Regarding the possibility of a further political realignment  taking place this year, Watanabe said, "I think there is a  70-percent chance of this happening." He added, however: "In  case an emergency should arise concerning the Korean peninsula  issue, it will be necessary to make prompt decisions (regarding  how the government intends to deal with the situation). It  (further political realignment) will not happen if the  government fails to carry out political measures and merely  continues to remain a lazy, diabetic cabinet (in responding only  to symptoms while putting off the real problem)." He thus  pointed out the possibility that a further political realignment  could be triggered by a split between the ruling coalition  parties regarding foreign affairs and other policies.    As for the emergence of moves within the LDP recommending  that Watanabe assume the post of party vice president, Watanabe  said, "Although I have not been directly requested to do so (by  LDP President Yohei Kono), I have heard about them."</p>

			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  POLICE WANT TO TALK TO RUBIN ABOUT PIG  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said Thursday they want to question Jewish Defense League  leader Irv Rubin about a television videotape on which he apparently referred  to the delivery of a pig to the home of activist Stanley Sheinbaum two days  before it happened.  </P> <P> On Wednesday night, KCBS broadcast a videotape of a Friday press conference in  which, the station said, Rubin could be heard saying off camera, ". . . be  delivering a huge pig to Stanley Sheinbaum's home."  </P> <P> On Sunday, someone left a skinned, dead pig in the driveway of Sheinbaum's West  Los Angeles home. Sheinbaum acknowledged that some Jewish groups reacted  angrily to the Stockholm meeting that he and four other American Jews had with  Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat in an effort to help  bring about negotiations with the United States.  </P> <P> "Based on the tapes that we've seen and the audio we've heard, we certainly  have to talk to Irv Rubin," Cmdr. William Booth said. He said officers are  "viewing it as as a hatred incident," which in certain cases can be prosecuted  as a felony.  </P> <P> Earl Krugal, the local JDL chapter chairman, said the organization "has no  knowledge of who did it, but we applaud the act highly. . . ."  </P></p>

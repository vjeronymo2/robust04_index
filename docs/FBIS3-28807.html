			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Cho Sun, former deputy prime minister and </F> current adviser to the Bank of Korea governor: "Korea's Choice  Under Changing World Economy"]  <H3>  [25 Dec p 1] Impossible To  Survive Under Old Frame </H3>   [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Throughout the process of the  Uruguay Round [UR] settlement it was obvious that the United  States and the EC, particularly the former, called the tune in  making all settlements. Japan exercised a very marginal  influence, and the influence of the rest of the countries was  negligible. Fortunately, the principle of free trade was pushed  through to the end. However, it cannot be overlooked that big  powers were more persistent in promoting their national  interests than in any previous negotiations. In his official  message to the U.S. Congress calling for the passage of the UR  agreements, U.S. President Clinton pledged that he will "see to  it that U.S. interests will be protected" in future negotiations.    What would the world trade organization [WTO] order be like?  It would be the kind of order in which all countries, nay, all  enterprises in all countries will compete with each other  one-on-one. It will not only govern competition in commodity  trade but also in services, brain power and knowledge, and  ability among nations and enterprises. Expansion of competition  will pose an awesome challenge to us. Underdeveloped countries  might be able to hold their own in competition in commodity  trade. But they will discover that there are many areas in the  software field, such as technology, brain power, and knowledge,  where they are no match for their competitors from the  beginning. They will also discover that rules governing  competition are not interpreted in a uniformly fair manner. Just  as lions get their lion's share in the food chain, advanced  countries will interpret the substance of the economic order in  a way advantageous to themselves. While absorbed in exporting  commodities, the underdeveloped might lose everything before  they are aware of it, like a hunter too much absorbed in chasing  a hare to see the mountain.    During the recent UR negotiations, our country ran about in  confusion like soldiers surprised by the enemy. The UR is  concluded for now, and work will begin soon to work out details  necessary to implement it. We should immediately revise a number  of laws, regulations, and systems to prevent outsiders from  unilaterally setting our national destiny without our knowledge.    Economic policies under the WTO order cannot succeed with  the conventional methods and ideas. If so, what should be  changed, and how? First, the government's functions and roles  must be changed. "Economic planning" by the government will  become virtually meaningless. It will be practically impossible  to make cyclical adjustments through Keynesian stop-gap  government intervention. We come to keenly realize that  globalization signifies a limitation on government economic  policy-making. With the WTO order, the government will no longer  be able to control and adjust the economy unilaterally and at  will. For instance, as foreign capital moves from one country to  another as a result of the liberalization of capital, currency  authorities will not be able to maintain a certain volume of  currency in circulation as they please. Needless to say, this  does not mean that the role of currency authorities will be  eliminated. In some areas, their role may even increase. But  their role and meaning should change. The government should  review and reorganize its roles and functions as soon as  possible so that they may be adapted to the new environment  under the WTO. Our government structure is a carryover from the  era in which it was to help attain the growth targets under the  closed economic system of the 1960's and 70's. Public  understanding of its functions still remains at that level. With  this structure it will be difficult to flexibly take up the  challenge of the WTO era. The concept that prevailed in those  says gave rise to a tendency to denigrate the role of the price  mechanism and be overconfident of the control function of  government agencies. All policies based on this is bound to end  in failure in the WTO era.  <H3>  [28 Dec 93 p 1] Costly, Inefficient Structure Needs Urgent  Revamping </H3>   [Text] To adapt ourselves to the WTO era, we need to push  for the establishment of an order founded on free competition  as extensively and swiftly as possible. Needless to say, order  under free competition does not simply mean laissez-faire. Order  founded on free competition cannot take root in a vacuum. It  needs rules for its preservation and development. Just as the  old order founded on control was a "system," the order founded  on free competition is similarly a "system" based on strict  rules. The written part of these must be worked out and enforced  by the government.    If conventional economic planning becomes unnecessary and  stop-gap fine tuning becomes impossible, the role of the  planning authorities (the Economic Planing Board [EPB], for one)  needs to be changed drastically. Until now the EPB has  formulated macroeconomic plans and made an overall adjustment of  economic policies to fulfill goals. But instead of setting  macroeconomic goals, the EPB will from now on have to set goals  for liberalization and competition and piece together and adjust  all the directions in establishing systems necessary for their  attainment. Still intact in our economy are so many systems  that arbitrarily regulate, ban, punish, or watch private sector  economic activity. Most of the high cost and low efficiency of  our economy is their legacy.    Will government ministries be able to fulfill satisfactorily  the liberalization goals that reduce their own authority? It  will be difficult to get an affirmative answer. But the flimsy  supply system in the ROK economy characterized by high cost and  low efficiency will not improve unless the government changes  its ways. [passage omitted]    For the ROK to be internationally competitive in the WTO  era, it is necessary to select a sound direction for  macroeconomic policies. The most desirable macroeconomic policy  direction in improving the high-cost, low-efficiency economic  structure is to do away with the the stop-and-go pattern and  consistently build up the basis of economic stability. When  prices rise and bubbles are formed while pursuing a growth  policy, the government switches to retrenchment; and when this  retards growth, it returns to a growth policy once again. Under  this kind of "stop-and-go" policy, it is impossible to gain  competitiveness. In the current condition of the ROK economy, it  is difficult to adopt a strong retrenchment policy. But if the  government unflaggingly pursues a determined policy of  stabilization for several years while pushing reforms designed  to establish an order founded on free competition, it will be  able to attain desirable results without fail. This is the only  way to win public trust and response. The majority want price  stability more than anything. "Macroeconomic stability and  microeconomic liberalization"--this will be the most appropriate  policy mix at present.    This mix will be accompanied by many difficulties. It will  be difficult to expect immediate results. For this reason, it is  very possible that it will come under attack from an impatient  press and interest groups. That is why it will be difficult to  pursue without economic vision and conviction. There is the  danger of reverting to the old stop-and-go policy. Many desire  easy growth; they want capitalism without cost. But no such  capitalism has ever succeeded.    Most important for the ROK economy now is monetary reform.  The United States and other big powers are expected to press  hard for financial liberalization in our country in the future.  Should we fail to prepare for this pressure, we could find  ourselves running about in confusion just as we did in the  opening of the rice market. What kind of preparation do we need?  The most essential preparation will be the "liberalization of  the domestic financial market." We should move up Phases III and  IV in the liberalization schedule as soon as possible. It is  desirable to reduce or abolish policy-driven financing,  liberalize all interest rates including those on bank loans,  establish a responsible management system for banking  organizations, and abolish all forms of window guidance. To this  end, many statutes and regulations for financial control need be  revised. When liberalization is pursued while curbing inflation,  it will bring about increased savings, stable interest rates,  and a turnabout in our high-cost, low-efficiency economy.    Financial operations in the WTO era will require a high  degree of expertise. Along with financial liberalization, it is  desirable to revise the Bank of Korea Law so that the central  bank may take charge of currency management. Only by so doing is  it possible to put an end to the vicious "stop and go" cycle and  insure expertise in financial operations. Inasmuch as the  central bank is a government agency, there is a stark limitation  on its "independence." Nevertheless it must be clear where  responsibility for currency control lies in order to increase  the effectiveness of economic policy.  <H3>  [30 Dec 93 pp 1, 2] Cultivate Intellect, Train Personnel  With Foresight </H3>   [Text] Following the conclusion of the UR negotiations, the  government announced various measures designed to achieve an  epochal development of our agriculture. What we need is not  epochal measures, but epochal results. But it is questionable  whether we will be able to easily find means to achieve epochal  results.    Inasmuch as our agriculture and rural communities are  problems for our industry and society as a whole, it is  impossible to find ways to achieve epochal development only in  agriculture by divorcing it from the rest of the nation's  economic policy. Many have pointed out, "Our agriculture is  backward," or "Our rural communities are backward." But in my  opinion, those who hold this perception labor under a  misconception of what lies at the heart of the matter. True, our  agriculture and rural communities are backward. But it is more  appropriate to say that there has been a discrepancy between  agricultural policy and directions of economic management in all  other sectors. This was created because policies concerning  agriculture and rural communities were always formulated  independently of overall economic policy. As overall economic  policy was being implemented with no link whatsoever to  agricultural policy, the latter focused only on agriculture and  persistently sought to increase production. As a result,  development of non-agricultural rural income sources has been  neglected and agriculture has continued to be wholly dependent  on rice farming. It is impossible to reconstruct agriculture and  rural communities so long as the dichotomy in policy described  above remains unchanged. It is impossible to develop agriculture  and rural communities alone by keeping agricultural policy  separated from the economy as a whole. [passage omitted]    It is often said, correctly, that our economic future  depends on export. But now that we are at the outset of the WTO  era, it is necessary to appropriately amend this perception. We  must think more broadly and deeply. What drives export? Export  depends on technology and business management efficiency. What  drives these two factors? In the final analysis, they depend on  man, namely, talent. If our civil servants are inferior to their  American and Japanese counterparts, if our company employees are  inferior to their American and Japanese counterparts, if the  level of our knowledge is below that of other nations, it is  obvious that we will be defeated in international competition.  [passage omitted] In a sense the WTO era may be interpreted as  one in which the United States and Europe, finding themselves  shoved aside by Asians countries in commodity trade, will  challenge their Asian competitors once again by shifting from  commodity to knowledge and intellect as weapons of competition.  [passage omitted] Unfortunately, we have achieved no great  success in either.    To begin with, the system for properly employing trained  talent needs improvement as a short-term objective. The civil  service system should be improved. It is well known that many of  our civil servants are talented. But it is undeniable that there  is ample room for improvement in the way they are employed if we  are to achieve policy innovations to suit the tide of the times.  [passage omitted]    In our country civil servants rely on the each ministry's  research institute for supplementing their deficiencies in their  specialties. A similar system hardly exists elsewhere. It has  merits, but it also has serious demerits. If civil servants  depend too much on institutes, it may become an impediment to  their "intellectual" development in the long run, and the  institutions will fall into the trap of working for departmental  interests while failing to produce good research for the  national interest. It is desirable to increase researchers'  autonomy and reduce civil servant dependence on research  institutions. [passage omitted]</p>

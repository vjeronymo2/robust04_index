			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Individuals' shareholdings fall THE GOVERNMENT is further than ever from achieving its goal of creating a nation of individual shareholders, according to figures released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office. In its August Economics Trends Bulletin, the CSO says the percentage of UK quoted company shares held by individuals and unincorporated businesses fell for the third successive year to just 20 per cent in January. The figure was 20.5 per cent in January 1991 and, in 1981, before most of the privatisation programme had got under way, 37.5 per cent. More than half UK company shares are in the hands of financial institutions. Pension funds hold 31.1 per cent of the total, down marginally from 31.4 per cent the year before, while insurance companies increased their percentage by 0.3 per cent to 20.7 per cent. The CSO noted that the latest drop in individual holdings comes despite the privatisation of the electricity industry. Privatisation has been advocated as a means of promoting wider share ownership. However, the percentage held by individuals and unincorporated businesses of the shares of the 10 largest privatised companies increased over the past year to 22 per cent of outstanding shares, largely reflecting the sale of the second tranche of the government's British Telecom stake. Without the effects of that sale, however, individuals' holdings in privatised companies fell to 17 per cent of the total from 17.9 per cent. The CSO noted that its data was hampered by the existence of nominee accounts, which obscure the ownership of a large portion of shares. Holdings by the overseas sector rose by 1 percentage point to 12.8 per cent, about level with the 1989 figure. In 1981 overseas shareholders owned just 3.6 per cent of the shares in UK companies. Overseas shareholders now have 10 per cent of shares in privatised companies. Thirty seven per cent of the overseas owners have holdings valued at Pounds 100m or more. The number of UK companies with ordinary shares listed on the London Stock Exchange fell from 1,946 in December 31, 1990 to 1,852 in January this year. Market capitalisation rose to Pounds 530.2bn from Pounds 445bn, primarily because of higher share prices. The UK spent Pounds 12.1bn on research and development in 1990 - 2.2 per cent of gross domestic product, the same as in 1989. This was an increase in real terms of 12 per cent since 1985.

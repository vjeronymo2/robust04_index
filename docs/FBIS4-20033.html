			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Burg (DDP/ADN) -- Today the 10th Russian Guards  Tank Division left Altengrabow Garrison in Burg district. This  means that the last major combat unit of the former Soviet  forces in Saxony-Anhalt is now on its way home.    Wolfgang Rauls, deputy prime minister and land environment  minister, stressed that there has been extensive personal  contacts between local people and the members of the division,  despite the odd problem with living side by side over the past  few years. [passage omitted]    Before the withdrawal agreement there were around 100,000  Russian soldiers as well as 40,000 civilian employees and family  members stationed in Saxony-Anhalt. They were based at a total  of 276 locations.</p>

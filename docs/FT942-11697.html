			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (2): Municipal superman rescues budget - Patrick Harverson traces the impact of a mayor who is admired throughout the US He is riding high in the opinion polls, and is the subject of almost universally positive coverage in the media. Everywhere he goes there are warm greetings and words of encouragement. He is now so well-known nationwide that he has been dubbed 'America's Mayor'. Barring disaster, he will win re-election by a landslide next year. He has even appeared in a Hollywood movie starring Oscar-winner Tom Hanks. Meet Mr Edward Rendell, mayor of Philadelphia, probably the most popular politician in the US today. In his 27 months in office, Mr Rendell has earned a reputation as one of the the most effective mayors in the US. During his term, Philadelphia's finances, so desperate in 1992, have been restored to good health. The city is now poised to announce its second consecutive budget surplus, and the pace of local economic growth is finally beginning to pick up. The flight of jobs from the city and region has not been stopped, but it is slowing. Philadelphia's relations with the Pennsylvania state capital of Harrisburg, and with its neighbours across the Delaware River in New Jersey have improved greatly. And with the help of its pro-business mayor, the city has won the support of a once-hostile local business community and the respect of Wall Street, where Philadelphia's bonds may soon lose their 'junk' rating. Perhaps as important as anything else, Mayor Rendell has restored Philadelphians' faith in their local government. Mr Peter Hearn, partner at the law firm of Pepper, Hamilton and Scheetz, and Mr Rendell's principal opponent in the race for the Democratic nomination prior to the 1991 mayoral election, says that the mayor is extremely popular because he has proved that local government can work. 'This has been a wonderful demonstration of good government being good politics.' Admirers also claim that Mr Rendell's growing national stature - he enjoys a close personal relationship with President Clinton - is helping the city. Mr Bob Hall, publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News, says: 'His popularity outside the region, and the demand for him as a speaker to mayors' groups, or other political groups, or urban developers, is such a plus for the city. I don't recall another mayor of Philadelphia ever enjoying that national recognition.' So who is this municipal superman? A native New Yorker, the 48-year old Mr Rendell is a lawyer who has spent all of his political life in Philadelphia. First elected to public office as the city's district attorney in 1977, he ran for governor of Pennsylvania in 1986 and mayor of Philadelphia in 1987. Although he lost both campaigns, he came back strongly to win the November 1991 mayoral election by a landslide on a campaign of fiscal reform. Although a registered Democrat, his appeal crossed traditional party lines. Like many other so-called 'new Democrats', he is a conservative on fiscal policy but a liberal on social policy. He believes that many city services can be improved through privatisation, and that government has to be pro-business if it is to attract and keep jobs in the cities. Nationally, Mr Rendell may be lauded for engineering the city's financial recovery, yet he is quick to praise his partners in government. In particular, he relies heavily on his main political ally, Mr John Street, the president of the city council. 'I do not deserve, by any means, the lion's share of the credit,' says Mr Rendell. 'We've received wonderful support from the city council, and from it's president John Street.' The mayor's championing of Mr Street is not just political rhetoric. In Philadelphia, the offices of mayor and city council president have traditionally been occupied by politicians pursuing separate agendas and serving different constituencies. For most of the time, it was a recipe for political gridlock. When Mr Rendell arrived in office, however, he found in Mr Street someone equally determined to end decades of political and financial irresponsibility. Some say that Mr Street has proved the more fiscally conservative of the two. Since the first day of Mr Rendell's term, they have worked in harmony to rebuild the city's finances, constructing a five-year fiscal plan that has been greeted with universal praise. Mr Fred Voigt, executive director of the Committee of 70, a local non-partisan political watchdog, says the importance of the alliance between the mayor and council president cannot be understated. 'Together, recognising the fiscal plight, they took steps that were absolutely necessary. They had to balance the budget, which meant hurting people, saying no to people. Yet, that (first) budget was passed 17 to zero. This last budget had only one vote negative. That's extraordinary.' A welcome by-product of the close working relationship between Mr Rendell, who is white, and Mr Street, who is black, is that it has helped the city avoid much of the racially-inspired political acrimony that has dogged so many US cities. If all this sounds too good to be true, Mr Rendell does have his critics. The cuts in municipal expenditure that have helped him balance the budget since 1992 have come at a cost to some local services. Rubbish collection is now said to be less reliable, aid to museums and libraries has been cut, and the wait for non-emergency treatment in the public healthcare system has lengthened. He is also criticised for focusing too much on Philadelphia's finances and not enough on its social problems, particularly in the deprived neighbourhoods just outside the city centre where living conditions are as bad as anywhere in urban America. Mr Rendell counters that the longer-term problems could not have been addressed until the immediate fiscal crisis was first resolved. He knows that, having tackled Philadelphia's financial woes, he now needs to turn his attention to the more serious issues facing the city - too few jobs, too many poorly runs schools, and too much poverty, homelessness, and crime. Yet, typical among the new breed of big-city mayor, Mr Rendell does not believe urban blight can be addressed by throwing more federal, state or city money at the problem. He sees economic growth and job creation, nurtured by government incentives aimed at attracting the private sector into the cities, as the long-term answer to urban social ills. He says: 'If I could create 100,000 jobs paying the inflation-adjusted equivalent of Dollars 22,000 a year, I could do more to reduce drug use and crime in the city of Philadelphia than if I had a thousand new policeman.'</p>

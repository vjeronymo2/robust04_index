			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tomkinsons shares dive 10% after warning Shares in Tomkinsons, the carpet manufacturer, dived more than 10 per cent from 240p to 215p yesterday, after the company said second half results would be below market expectations, with trading running at a similar level to the first six months. The company said trading conditions in the home furnishings sector had continued to be very difficult and demand for carpets had been very depressed during the summer. Recently however, there had been some signs of a modest strengthening of demand. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 430,000 to Pounds 332,000 in the six months to April 2, but the interim dividend was held at 3.5p.</p>

			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> PIPE BOMB HIDDEN IN STEREO EXPLODES  </P> <P> A pipe bomb hidden in a borrowed stereo blew up when the stereo was plugged in  at a motel and an apparently unrelated bomb exploded on a store roof, police  said. "It's kind of unusual to have them so close together," said Sgt. Bob  Ensley, but he doubted that the explosions were at all connected.  </P> <P> The booby-trapped stereo went off when Kathy Dastrup plugged it in at her motel  room. Dastrup, 32, suffered only minor injuries because she was bending near a  table at the time, said Ensley. An acquaintance, Herman Nathaniel Belkins, 21,  who had borrowed the stereo, was sitting on a couch 12 feet away and was  uninjured. Ensley said he did not know who loaned Belkins the equipment. About  90 minutes earlier, a pipe bomb exploded on the roof of a K mart store. Police  released no additional information on the store blast, and K mart officials  were not available.  </P></p>

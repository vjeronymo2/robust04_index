			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: REVERSE MORTGAGE TURNS HOME EQUITY INTO CASH  </P> <P> Q: I recently heard of something called a reverse mortgage. I own my home free  and clear and believe it is worth about $400,000. I am on a fixed income and  would like to tap into my equity so I can have more money. I am an 82-year-old  widow and live alone. I checked with three bankers in Southern California and  all told me no reverse mortgage program was available in the state. Is this  true? -- M.B.".  </P> <P> A: No. But it's not surprising that you've had difficulty getting the full  story on these complex and sometimes controversial mortgages.  </P> <P> Reverse annuity mortgages were first offered in California in 1980 to help  senior citizens who have substantial equities in their homes but need more cash  to meet their living expenses. Basically, these mortgages allow owners who owe  little or nothing on their home mortgages to tap into their equity without  selling their homes.  </P> <P> Here's how they work: Typically, a lending institution makes the homeowner a  loan based on the borrower's age -- the minimum ranges from 62 to 65 -- and the  property's appraised value. After taking its loan fees and points, the  institution pays the homeowner the balance of the loan either in equal monthly  installments, in a lump sum or as a line of credit for as long as the borrower  continues living in the home. The loan balance -- actually the amount dispersed  plus interest and loan fees -- is repaid when the house is sold by the owner or  his heirs.  </P> <P> These open-ended loans are complicated because it's impossible to know how long  the homeowner will continue to live in the house. If he stays just a brief  time, the reverse mortgage proves a costly way to pull equity out of the house  because loan fees and points on the full potential loan amount are assessed at  the outset. However, if he stays a very long time, the lending institution  stands to pay out more than the home may be worth. Because of the risk, several  institutions offering reverse mortgages charge an additional "guaranty fee" or  require that they share in the appreciation of the home's value during the  course of the loan.  </P> <P> According to the American Assn. of Retired Persons, three private lenders offer  reverse mortgages to Californians. They are: American Homestead in New Jersey,  (800) 233-4762; Providential Home Income Plan in San Francisco, (800) 441-4428,  and Capital Holding Corp. in Kentucky, (800) 942-6550.  </P> <P> Each lender offers a slightly different loan package, explains Bronwyn Belling,  a housing specialist at the AARP, so it is important for borrowers to carefully  evaluate their choices before making a decision.  </P> <P> Belling said that with a $200,000 loan at current interest rates, monthly  payments from the three lenders mentioned previously would range from $903 to  $1,124, with substantially varying requirements and restrictions.  </P> <P> For more information about reverse mortgages, send a self-addressed, stamped  envelop to the Independent Living Resource Center, 70 10th St., San Francisco,  Calif. 94103. Another source is the American Assn. of Retired Persons. Send a  postcard asking for Home-Made Money to AARP Fulfillment D-12894, 1909 K St.  N.W., Washington, D.C. 20049. Delivery takes six to eight weeks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Social Security Taxes Just Keep on Coming  </P> <P> -: It's already August, and I'm still paying Social Security taxes. How much do  I have to earn before I satisfy my obligation? It seems as though I finished  paying the tax earlier last year. -- M.J.  </P> <P> A: You didn't imagine it; you did finish paying your Social Security taxes  earlier last year. This year, the Social Security tax rate and the maximum  earnings subject to the tax were increased.  </P> <P> The tax rate paid by employees, as well as their employers, this year is 7.65%,  up from 7.51% in 1989. This year the rate is applied to the first $51,300 of  earnings, for a maximum Social Security tax obligation of $3,924.45. Last year,  the tax rate was applied to the first $48,000 of earnings, and the maximum  amount of taxes paid by employees was $3,604.80.  </P> <P> For 1991, the tax rate remains at 7.65%, but the amount of earnings subject to  the tax has not yet been set. The level is established annually by Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Both Spouses Can Reap Tax Break After Split  </P> <P> -: My wife and I are getting a divorce. One of us will keep the house, and the  other will buy another place in which to live. Is there any way we can both  keep the $125,000 tax exclusion for home sale profits? -- I.C.".  </P> <P> A: Yes; assuming that each of you is individually qualified to take advantage  of the tax break, each may leave the marriage with a full $125,000 exemption.  </P> <P> Under the tax laws, an individual or a married couple may exclude from taxation  $125,000 of profits from the sale of their home if certain conditions are met.  In the case of couples, at least one must be age 55 or more, and both must have  owned and lived in the home for three of the past five years. Individuals must  meet all three qualifications on their own, and once divorced, each former  spouse must meet those three requirements to take the tax break.  </P> <P> A caveat: Be sure that your divorce is completely final before selling the  house you shared. If you are still married when you sell, you qualify for only  a single $125,000 exemption that you would both be required to share, even if  you file separate tax returns.  </P></p>

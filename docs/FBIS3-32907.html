Over 3 million Cubans are currently participating in  discussions promoted by the unions in an attempt to find  solutions to various problems that hinder the efficiency of each  workplace and affect the country's financial reorganization.    According to the Center for Social-Political Studies and  Research [Centro de Estudios Socio-Politicos y de Opinion],  which conducted a poll among 1,300 workers, the leading topic  discussed in the meetings held thus far is labor efficiency. In  response to a call by the union leadership, the main concern of  Cuban workers has been to find a formula to produce more  efficiently given the availability of enough raw materials,  fuels, and production equipment.    During the meetings on economic issues called by the unions,  the participants have contributed many ideas, recommendations,  and useful reflections on how to face the management problem.  According to official figures, only 31 percent of Cuban  enterprises are profitable due to primarily external factors  linked to the loss of Cuba's traditional partners in the  vanished socialist sphere and the intensification of the U.S.  blockade.    However, other factors are involved in this situation,  namely  an inefficiency accumulated over many years, a lack of concern  regarding costs, expenditures, and the balance between earnings  and expenditures as well as a poor resource-management. The  Cuban economy needs to place greater emphasis on all these  aspects and to that effect, the current meetings come in very  handy. In these meetings, both workers and administrative  leaders examine thoroughly the best ways to eradicate  inefficiency. What constitutes one of the most pressing tasks  is to implement the agreements fully in order to eradicate  inefficiency, without waiting for the measures that will soon be  approved by the Cuban Parliament to reorganize the country's  finances.</p>

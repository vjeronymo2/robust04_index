			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, grant exemptions from the provisions described below to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of the daily charge for mortality and expense risks. Applicants state that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state further that the proposed mortality and expense risk charge is consistent with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable and proper insurance charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act provides that no payment to the depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered unit investment trust shall be allowed the trustee or custodian as an expense except compensation, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties normally performed by the trustee or custodian. Section 27(c)(2) prohibits a registered investment company or a depositor or underwriter for such company from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments on such certificates, other than sales loads, are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed in section 26(a)(1), and are held by such trustee or custodian under an agreement containing substantially the provisions required by sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the Act. Applicants request an exemptive order because the proposed mortality and expense risk charge is not a bookkeeping or administrative charge allowed by sections 26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. United of Omaha represents that the mortality and expense risk charge is a reasonable charge to compensate it for assuming the risk that annuitants under the Policies will live longer as a group than had been anticipated in setting the annuity rates guaranteed in the Policies; for the risk that the accumulation value will be less than the death benefit; and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. United of Omaha represents that the charge of 1.25% for mortality and expense risks is within the range of industry practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon United of Omaha's analysis of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. United of Omaha will maintain at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. United of Omaha has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements will benefit the Variable Account and the Policy owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum which will be maintained by United of Omaha at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. United of Omaha also represents that the Variable Account will only invest in management investment companies which undertake, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate and approve any such plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants request exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit them to deduct on a daily basis a charge equal to 1.25% annually of the assets of the Variable Account for the assumption of mortality and expense risks described herein. For the reasons set forth above, Applicants believe that the exemptions requested are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

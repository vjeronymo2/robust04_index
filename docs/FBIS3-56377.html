"The  president had earlier been on a three-day trip around Europe,  where he had to contend with the difficult problems of security  in the world which have arisen since the end of the Cold War."    Clinton stopped off in Ukraine en route to Moscow and  concluded a deal there whereby all the former Soviet nuclear  missiles on Ukrainian territory will be handed over to Russia,  the report commented. "There has actually been no use  whatsoever for these weapons. They have been targeted on the  United States, with which Ukraine most of all wants to enjoy  friendly relations."    London, 13 Jan -- THE DAILY TELEGRAPH writes: The American  president's television address to the people of Russia could be  the most important feature of the American president's visit to  Moscow. If Clinton strikes the right note, appeals to the  Russians' pride and patriotism, and refrains from delivering a  lecture on the theme of the free market and democracy he will  improve relations between the two countries. But if he is  unable to do this, it will only intensify skepticism regarding  the "American Dream," which is something now manifest not just  among extremists.    Paris, 13 Jan -- The success of the political and economic  reforms in Russia will lead to the reform of the Russian state's  foreign policy, LE MONDE thinks, noting that this explains  Clinton's desire to support Yeltsin. The American president is  convinced that a democratic Russia will not threaten its  neighbors or show hegemonic tendencies in Europe, but not all  members of his administration share such a viewpoint. In  assessing the Russian-American summit talks now under way the  newspaper opines that the United States will pressure the IMF to  be more energetic in granting financial aid.</p>

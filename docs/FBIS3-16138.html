"A decision to this effect, which will not be easy to  materialize, has to be made by the UN Security Council and have  proper financing backing," Shevardnadze said. In his words, the  financing issue was solved to all practical purposes during his  visit. "I have assurances from both the President and Congress,"  he emphasized.    Shevardnadze said that "the proposal that international  peace  keeping units be sent was supported by nearly every member of  the UN Security Council."    According to Shevardnadze, the Security Council session at  which he "outlined what had happened in Abkhazia, the causes and  consequences of those events and the situation there now" showed  understanding and denounced separatist extremism, fascism and  genocide of the Georgian population. "The Russian, U.S.,  British, Chinese, French and other ambassadors to the UN  Security Council gave their full support to the policy pursued  by Georgia for the resolution of the conflict and for  territorial unity and sovereignty of Georgia," Shevardnadze  emphasized.    Shevardnadze said the Security Council resolution on the  sending of peace keeping troops, expected to be passed on March  21, would become "an important, if not decisive, contribution to  the resolution of the Abkhazian crisis and so to neutralization  of a source of larger danger. ...It is essential that this  action be taken under UN auspices."    Shevardnadze thought that his visit to the U.S. and UN "was  a  major step" towards resolving the Abkhazian conflict.    Shevardnadze's interview is published in full in INTERFAX's  Monday edition of the Presidential Bulletin.</p>

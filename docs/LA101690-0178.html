			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> RAIDERS DEAL MCELROY TO SEATTLE; ALLEN, BEUERLEIN STAY IN L.A.  </P> <P> The Raiders traded safety Vann McElroy, a two-time Pro Bowl performer, to the  Seattle Seahawks today for an undisclosed future draft choice.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, running back Marcus Allen and reserve quarterback Steve Beuerlein,  two players rumored to be headed elsewhere, stayed put as the NFL trade  deadline passed.  </P> <P> McElroy, 30, was a training camp holdout in a salary dispute and has played  only sparingly on special teams since being activated.  </P> <P> McElroy was a third-round draft choice of the Raiders in 1982 from Baylor and  became a starter in his second season. He earned Pro Bowl honors in 1983 and  1984 and was an alternate selection in 1986.  </P> <P> In 1989, McElroy was off to what he called his best start before he suffered a  torn hamstring, which sidelined him for the most of the rest of the season. He  returned for the final three games.  </P> <P> During the time McElroy was out, Eddie Anderson established himself at free  safety. When McElroy returned, he was used as a backup.  </P> <P> In his career with the Raiders, McElroy intercepted 31 passes and had four  quarterback sacks on safety blitzes.  </P></p>

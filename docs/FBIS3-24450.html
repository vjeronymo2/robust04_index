Food prices rose at  a higher rate (by 2.5-4 percent) in the Northwestern and Volga  regions and Kaliningrad Oblast; in the cities of the Far East  prices remained practically unchanged.    Consumer market indices of prices for consumer goods and  services were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding date):                     02/22       02/28       03/05       Average daily price rise                                                         March       February   Consumer goods   101.9       101.5       101.7       0.34        0.34  and services   including:   foodstuffs       101.6       101.2       101.5       0.31        0.32   nonfood items    102.4       101.9       101.5       0.31        0.34   for-fee          101.7       101.7       104.8       0.94        0.48  services for  the population       Since the beginning of the year prices for goods and  services  have increased by 35.7 percent, including for foodstuffs--by  34.4 percent, nonfood items--by 25.6 percent, and for-fee  services for the population--2.1-fold.    Foodstuffs. Over the first five days of March  prices in organized and unorganized trade rose at practically  the same rate--1.5 percent and 1.9 percent.    Price changes by main categories of food products over the  period 28 February to 5 March are shown below:                         As % of the preceding observation date                        Total           including:                                        in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All food products    101.5           101.5               101.9   including:   Meat and meat        101.3           101.4               101.0  products   Fish and fish        102.3           102.3               100.6  products   Milk and milk        102.9           103.1               101.8  products   Eggs                 101.1           101.2               99.6   Sugar                100.3           100.3               100.0   Bread and bakery     106.4           106.4  products   Cereals and          102.5           102.5               102.3  macaroni items   Vodka                97.2            97.1                100.4   Potatoes and         104.2           104.2               104.2  vegetables      [Text] In organized trade over the first days of March  prices went  up by 5-9 percent for basic varieties of bread and bakery  products and some varieties of fruit and vegetables. Milk and  milk products prices increased by 3-4 percent. Prices for  butter, vegetable oil, meat products, eggs, and sugar remained  practically unchanged. Prices for oranges and vodka decreased by  1-3 percent.    In nonorganized trade the greatest price increases were  registered with respect to fresh cabbage--by 9.5 percent,  milk--by 5 percent, potatoes, beets, and carrots--by 2-3 percent.    The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose  over the week by 2.4 percent and as of 5 March amounted to  42,300 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. The price  differential between monitored cities measured a factor of 3.7.  Moscow is in 35th place of 132 monitored cities (R46,000 on a  monthly basis).    Nonfood items. Over the period 28 February to 5  March prices for medicines increased by 2.3 percent; those for  fabrics, sewn items, and knitwear rose by 1.5-1.7 percent, and  for footwear--by 0.6 percent.    For-fee services for the population. Service fees  rose by 4.8 percent over the period under review. Rents in  municipal housing went up by 25 percent, and hot water supply  rates--by almost 20 percent. The cost of some varieties of  consumer services, urban bus fares, and the cost of keeping a  child in a preschool facility went up by 5-8 percent.  <H5>  Cost of Raw and Manufactured Input Materials </H5>   The Russian State Committee on Statistics has summarized the  current data on the level and dynamics of average prices of  purchasing 170 categories of basic raw and manufactured input  materials obtained from a selected sample of enterprises in  industry and construction. The average price includes, in  addition to production cost, transportation and selling  expenses, taxes and excise taxes.    Prices for raw and manufactured input materials purchased by  enterprises increased in February of this year by 13 percent as  compared to January, including those purchased from suppliers  within Russia--by 12 percent, from CIS countries--by 22 percent,  and from foreign countries--by 16 percent (wholesale prices for  industrial output increased by 16 percent in February of this  year as compared to January 1994). Over two months of the  current year, prices for raw and manufactured input materials  purchased by industrial users increased by 34 percent  (industrial producers' wholesale prices--by 37 percent).    The cost of construction materials increased at a greater  rate. Over the month prices for materials purchased by  construction contractor organizations rose by 26 percent, and  since the beginning of the year--by 51 percent. Wholesale prices  of construction materials producers increased by 16 percent and  40 percent, respectively.    Purchase price dynamics by main categories of raw and  manufactured input materials are characterized by the following  data:                             as % of the preceding month        February 1994                                                              as % of                                                              December 1993                            January 1994     February 1994   Electric power           118              109               129   Heat                     118              128               151   Fuel                     125              113               142   Raw and manufactured     113              113               127  materials for heavy  industry   for light and            106              115               122  food-processing  industry   Construction             120              126               151  materials, parts, and  prefabricated  components      Purchase prices for fuel rose over the month by 13 percent,  including for oil--by 19 percent, natural gas--by 14 percent,  boiler oil and diesel fuel--by 15-18 percent. Oil refining  industry enterprises purchased oil in February on average at  R80,000 per tonne (production cost--R52,000). The price of  natural gas used in electric power generation amounted on  average to R32,000 per thousand cubic meters (production  price--R3,200); the average price of coal used in power  generation--R19,000, and coal for coking--R50,000 per tonnes,  with a production price on average across Russia of R13,000.    Purchase prices for raw and manufactured input materials  differ depending on the supplier. For instance, it was cheaper  for Russian producers to purchase conversion pig iron, iron ore,  certain varieties of rolled metal, flax fiber, and granulated  sugar from CIS member countries suppliers than on the domestic  market. At the same time, coal and some varieties of synthetic  thread and fiber were purchased from suppliers in near abroad  countries at higher prices.    Purchase prices differed considerably by region. For  instance, the purchase price of lumber for Ivanovo Oblast  enterprises amounted to R76 million per 1,000 cubic meters of  solid wood, and in Rostov Oblast--R92 million. Food-processing  enterprises in Krasnodar Kray purchased vegetable oil at  R735,000, and in Sverdlovsk Oblast--R1,496,000 per tonne. Cement  prices ranged from R96,000 in Amur Oblast to R19,000 per tonne  in Smolensk Oblast (with an average for Russia price of  R37,000). In the Central region the highest level of purchase  prices for basic construction materials was registered in Moscow  and Moscow Oblast.    Higher freight rates (by 15 percent in February as compared  to January of this year) led to increased transportation  expenses for enterprises in industry and construction. Last  month freight expenses at surveyed industrial enterprises and  construction contractor organizations amounted on average to 12  percent of the cost of purchased raw and manufactured input  materials. Transportation expenses comprise more than  one-quarter of the purchase price of commercial timber; apatite  concentrate--more than 40 percent; road metal and sand--about 50  percent; cement, asphalt-concrete mix, asbestos-cement sheets,  and construction brick--more than 15 percent.  <H5>  Industrial Production </H5>   In January-February of this year Russian industry produced  almost R34 trillion worth of output in current prices, including  R18 trillion worth in February. As compared to last  January-February, the physical volume of production declined by  23.6 percent, including by 23.1 percent in January and 24.1  percent in February.    The volume of average daily production (as a percentage of  the preceding month, without taking into account seasonal  factors) amounted to: February--105 percent; January--89  percent; December 1993--103.7 percent; and November--97 percent.    In January-February 1994, of the 406 most important  categories of products counted in periodic reports, the  production volume of 37 items increased as compared to  January-February of 1993, and of 362 items--declined.    In the fuel and power generation sectors, the volume of  electric power generation declined by 4 percent in  January-February of this year as compared to January-February of  last year. Over two months of this year, oil production amounted  to 50.5 million tonnes, including gas condensate, which is 13  percent less than in January-February of 1993; 50.3 million  tonnes of coal (8 percent less), and 109 billion cubic meters of  gas (the same level as over the same two months last year).    In ferrous metallurgy in January-February of this year the  lag as compared to the corresponding period of last year  amounted to: with respect to pig iron output--20 percent;  steel--26 percent; production of finished rolled metal--22  percent; and that of steel pipe--48 percent.    In January of this year the output of half of the monitored  items in machine-building amounted to 50 percent or less of that  for the corresponding period of last year (metal-cutting machine  tools, drop forge machines, bulldozers, freight railcars,  tractors, trucks, grain and fodder harvesting combines, and  others).    In the chemical and petrochemical industry, production of  most varieties of the most important categories of output  continued to fall in February. Over the two months as a whole,  production of synthetic ammonia declined by 26 percent, sulfuric  acid--by 30 percent, calcinated soda--by 53 percent, mineral  fertilizer--by 29 percent, chemical thread and fiber--by 49  percent, and automotive tires--by 41 percent. Production of  pipeline pipe and components made of thermoplastics, as well as  fiberglass and items made of it, declined by more than one half,  and of chemical insecticides and pesticides--by two-thirds.  Output of tires for agricultural vehicles amounted to less than  one-third of last year's.    In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry  average daily output of wood-chip panels, window and door  frames, and garden homes increased in February as compared to  January. At the same time, the output of commercial timber fell  in January-February of this year by more than one-third as  compared to the corresponding period of last year, of lumber--by  30 percent, laminated plywood--by 22 percent, mine props and  wooden transportation containers--by more than one-half, and  prefabricated homes made of wood--by three-quarters.    In the pulp and paper industry, production of paper and  cardboard declined as compared to January-February of last year  by 22 percent and 39 percent. The output of newsprint was 20  percent greater than last year.    In the construction materials industry in January-February  of  this year, as compared to the same period of last year,  production of cement declined by 35 percent, soft roofing and  insulation materials--by 43 percent, brick--by 24 percent, and  window glass--by 33 percent. Output of preassembled  ferroconcrete, wall materials, linoleum, porous fillers, and  decorative ceramic tile dropped by 22-29 percent,  asbestos-cement pipes and couplers, high-grade asbestos, and  mineral cotton--by 43-62 percent, and of roof slate--by 72  percent.    Production of consumer goods in January-February 1994  declined as compared to the analogous period last year by 27  percent, including that of nonfood items--by 31 percent, and  foodstuffs--by 17 percent.    In light industry there was a decline in output of hosiery  and knitwear--by 27 percent, footwear--by 54 percent, woolen  fabrics--by 53 percent, silk fabrics by--61 percent, and linen  fabrics and sack cloth--by 45 percent. Production of cotton  fabrics increased by 22 percent.    In January-February of this year, as compared to the same  period of last year, there was a considerable decline in  production of most garment industry items: coats and short  coats--by two-thirds; jackets, raincoats, suits, slacks, and  skirts--by almost one-half; and shirts and dresses--by 22-28  percent.    Shortage of working capital and difficulties in selling  output because of high prices remain the main causes of  production decline.    In the production of complex home appliances, over the  elapsed period of the year there was a decline in the production  of: refrigerators and freezers--by 2 percent, washing  machines--by 42 percent, tape recorders--by 56 percent,  television sets--by 17 percent, and porcelain, stoneware, and  majolica tableware--by 22 percent.    Compared to the corresponding period of last year, the  output  of two- and three-chamber refrigerators and freezers increased  in January-February of this year.    Among the most important food items whose output increased  in  January-February 1994 as compared to the corresponding period of  last year are high-fat cheeses and feta cheese, mayonnaise, and  canned tomato products. Production of canned milk products and  vegetable oil remained practically at last year's level.    With respect to most foodstuffs, the volume of production  declined as compared to January-February 1993: meat--by 26  percent, whole-milk products--by 17 percent, butter--by 31  percent, flour--by 17 percent, and cereals--by 34 percent.    Considerably less macaroni items, lump sugar, starch, and  food concentrates (37-50 percent), confectionery items, and  baker's yeast (15-20 percent) was produced than last year.  Output of bread and bakery production declined by 13 percent.    Production of vodka and other hard liquor amounted to only  one-half of that over January-February of 1993; in February it  amounted to 44 percent.    Since the beginning of the year, production of manufactured  feed concentrate dropped by more than one-quarter, and output of  protein and vitamin feed additives amounted to only 14 percent  of last year's volume.    Enterprise and production stoppages. In February  of this year 4,300 enterprises in Russia experienced lengthy  complete or partial stoppages of production; the loss of work  time amounted to 22 million man-days, or 18 percent of scheduled  clocked time of these enterprises (in February, 2,400  enterprises experienced shortages; 6 million man-days were lost,  or 8.6 percent of scheduled clocked time of these enterprises).    At enterprises experiencing shortages, 22 percent of the  labor force was sent on additional unpaid or partially paid  leave in February at the administration's initiative (8 percent  in February 1993).    Over the elapsed month, 28 enterprises in the fuel industry  were on strike; as a result, 60,000 man-days of work time were  lost.  <H5>  The Consumer Market </H5>   According to preliminary data, in January-February of this  year R27 trillion[.sup]*[/] worth of consumer goods and  services was sold to the Russian Federation population through  all sales channels, which is eight times more than in  January-February of last year in current prices, but 3 percent  less in comparable prices. In February 1994 their physical  volume was 6 percent less than last February.    Retail turnover, including public catering, at officially  counted enterprises amounted to R12.5 trillion over two months  of the current year, which comprises 52 percent of the total  turnover (a sevenfold increase in current prices as compared to  the corresponding period of last year, and a 5.7 percent decline  in comparable prices). Its physical volume in February of this  year was 6.2 percent below that of February 1993.    The share of the private sector (including consumer  cooperatives) accounts for 56 percent of retail turnover (40  percent in January-February 1993), the state sector--35 percent  (58 percent), and other nonstate forms of ownership--9 percent  (2 percent).    The coefficient of the retail trade network's saturation  with  consumer goods in February of this year remained unchanged as  compared to January of this year (86 percent)[.sup]**[/], and  increased by 23 percent[.sup]***[/] as compared to February  of last year. Officially counted enterprises in January-February  of this year sold to the population R6.8 trillion worth of  foodstuffs, which is 7.6 times more in current prices than over  the same period of last year and a 9.7-percent decrease in  comparable prices. In February of this year the physical volume  of retail turnover in foodstuffs declined as compared to last  year's February by 10.6 percent. In January of this year 9-17  percent less meat and poultry, canned meat, and vegetable oil  was sold than last year, and 24-30 percent less canned fish,  eggs, and sugar.    Slower sales of foodstuffs resulted in higher retail trade  inventories. For instance, butter inventories increased from 19  days of trading as of 1 January of this year to 23 days as of 1  March; eggs--from seven to 10; sugar--from 53 to 61;  confectionery items--from 21 to 27; and tea--from 58 to 62.    The coefficient of retail trade saturation with foodstuffs  measured 82 percent in February of this year and increased as  compared to February 1993 by 28 percent, including with respect  to meat products, butter, vegetable oil, and bread products--by  8-18 percent, sugar--by 21 percent, and milk products--by 35  percent.    With the formation of the consumer market and the emergence  of new sales channels, part of the population switched to buying  foodstuffs at farmers markets. For instance, while the sale of  basic foodstuffs at retail trade enterprises declined, sales of  meat and milk products, vegetable oil, and potatoes at farmers  markets increased by 17-35 percent, and of eggs--2.8-fold.    In January-February 1994 the population purchased (at  officially counted enterprises) R5.7 trillion worth of nonfood  consumer goods (a 6.7-fold increase in current prices and a  1-percent decline in comparable prices).    In the environment of shrinking production, already existing  elements of market relations are exerting a positive influence  on the state of the market. While in the past domestic industry  and state procurement were the only sources of goods coming in  to the market, now a considerable share of nonfood goods inflow  comes through various commercial and middleman structures, trade  enterprises' independent purchases, and other channels. This  contributes to consumer market saturation, and creates favorable  conditions for alternative choices in purchases and meeting the  demand of different groups of buyers.    Evidence of the process of market saturation with nonfood  items is increased trade inventories of these goods. For  instance, trade inventories of woolen fabrics increased from 40  days of trade as of 1 February of last year to 64 days as of 1  February of this year; silk fabrics--from 38 to 53 days;  clothing and underwear--from 55 to 81 days; knitwear--from 47 to  80 days; footwear--from 47 to 71 days; and radio receivers--from  25 to 51 days.    In January-February of this year R2.6 trillion worth of  for-fee services were rendered to the population through all  channels of realization--an 11-fold increase in current prices  and a 42-percent decline in comparable prices (in February of  this year as compared to February 1993--42.3 percent).    Over two months the volume of for-fee services provided by  officially counted enterprises amounted to R1.6 trillion (61  percent of the total volume), which is 10 times more than last  year in current prices and 48.5 percent less in comparable  prices.  <H5>  Foreign Economic Relations With Far Abroad Countries </H5>   In January-February 1994, Russia's foreign trade turnover  (without CIS countries) amounted to $8.1 billion and declined as  compared to January-February 1993 in current prices by 7.2  percent. Russia's exports amounted to $5.5 billion and increased  by 1.2 percent; imports amounted to $2.6 billion and declined by  21 percent.    In January-February of this year Russia had a $2.9-billion  positive foreign trade balance ($2.1 billion positive trade  balance in January-February 1993).  <H5>  Monetary Income of the Population </H5>   The monetary income earned by the population in  January-February this year amounted to R32.4 trillion and  increased as compared to the corresponding period of 1993 by  9.2-fold.    In February this year the volume of monetary income of the  population amounted to R18.3 trillion, which is 1.3 times more  than in January of this year. This increase is mainly due to the  difference in wages raised on 1 December 1993 and 1 January 1994  for certain categories of the budget-financed sphere and  administrative organs and paid out during this month, as well as  an increase in the amount of compensation added to pensions. As  a result, there was considerable monetary emission in February  of this year--R1.6 trillion, while in January of this year  R313.5 billion was taken out of circulation.    In the structure of expenditure of income, purchases of  foreign currency and securities account for an increasingly  greater share, with a simultaneous decline in the population's  expenditures on goods and services.

For instance, in February this year the population  deposited in commercial banks about R800 billion, and in the  State Savings Bank--R444.7 billion; in February 1993--R15.5 and  R89.3 billion, respectively.    In February this year as compared to the corresponding month  in 1993, the population's disposable income (income less  compulsory payments and contributions) increased 9.1-fold, while  prices for goods and services increased approximately eightfold.  The real disposable income of the population over this month was  13 percent higher than a year ago (in January--7 percent).  <H5>  City and Local Transportation Services for the Population </H5>   The current difficulties and problems in the public  transportation operations, which stem first and foremost from  great wear and tear on the rolling stock, and the haphazard  system of subsidies to public transportation enterprises are  resulting in declining quality in passenger service, especially  in cities; in particular, this is manifest in cutbacks in  planned and actually performed route runs.    For instance, in Pskov 14 percent fewer runs were planned  for  February this year than February last year, and in reality 16  percent fewer were performed; Makhachkala--22 percent and 12  percent, respectively; Ivanovo--7 percent and 5 percent;  Orenburg and Chelyabinsk--4 percent and 8 percent;  Krasnoyarsk--7 percent and 19 percent; Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk--5  percent and 14 percent; and Blagoveshchensk both with respect to  the plan and in reality--10 percent.    During February of this year 1.7 million (11 percent) of  planned trips by city ground passenger transportation were not  made in republic capital cities and kray and oblast centers in  the Russian Federation, and in some of them--between 14 percent  and 33 percent.

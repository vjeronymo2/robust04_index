			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM-TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev 3 June ITAR-TASS -- "Ukraine's relations with  Russia must be built with the future in mind, with the  realization that the two states must live in peace and accord,"  announced Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in Kiev on Friday  [3 June]. The president was speaking at a meeting with the  heads of Russia's leading mass media, members of the Moscow  editors-in-chief club.    Speaking of the situation in the Crimea and the Black Sea  Fleet, Kravchuk emphasized that "it would be absurd for the  Crimea to completely distance itself from Ukraine, since the  peninsula is inseparably connected to Ukraine and depends on it.  Of course," Kravchuk noted, "there are questions which must be  jointly resolved. One of them is the division of the Black Sea  Fleet and the decision where to establish the bases for the  Russian fleet and the Ukrainian navy. But here, too, everybody  must demonstrate patience, common sense, and mutual respect."    Asked whether he was sure the conflict with the Crimea could  be resolved in exclusively peaceful ways, Kravchuk announced,  "Not under any circumstances will we resort to the use of armed  force, and we appeal to the Crimean leadership to adhere to the  same principle."    Concerning the future of land and federalism in Ukraine, the  president noted that, "this is not a subject for casual  conversation, it cannot be examined on the everyday,  non-professional level." In that connection, he stressed that  he supports economic federalism, "if one may use such a  category," and favors handing over some power to the regions.  But, Kravchuk noted, "as world experience shows, real  federations were created over long periods. One must not forget  about that."    The Russian mass media heads expressed their concern over  the  Ukrainian president's attitude toward foreign journalists  working in his country. Naturally, they had in mind the recent  Ukrainian Foreign Ministry's decision to refuse to accredit  three "Ostankino" correspondents. Kravchuk replied, "I do not  share (the Foreign Ministry's) position. That was also  unexpected for me. Those questions should be resolved in a  different way than they were." He agreed to discuss the  proposal to create a single informational space with the rest of  the CIS heads of state, and announced his readiness to take the  initiative in sponsoring such a document.    The mediamen also asked the president about his personal  ambitions: what would he like? The answer was: "For the Ukraine  to make some progress in the economic sphere; for friendly  relations to be developed between neighbors, not de jure, but de  facto, in particular, between Russia and Ukraine, since there  are no alternatives in this respect. I want Russians to look at  Ukraine as an equal partner."    Speaking about his relations with the Ukrainian Supreme  Soviet and its chairman Alexander Moroz, Kravchuk called the  former business-like, and the latter, were termed "normal."  "Time will tell how they will be in the future. After all, as  it is, the deputies have only looked at, besides the situation  in the Crimea, the internal questions of their work."    As far as the upcoming presidential elections are concerned,  Kravchuk said, "the elections will be held. The main battle, in  my opinion, will take place in the second round. Who will enter  it? I think that Kuchma will. I am almost sure of that. Who  else? I might," the president commented.</p>

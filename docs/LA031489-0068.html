			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLET REVIEW;  </P> <P> BROWNE AND BUSTAMANTE IN 'SWAN LAKE' MATINEE  </P> <P> There's a unique chemistry to nearly any American Ballet Theatre performance in  which Leslie Browne dances with Ricardo Bustamante. Whether the ballet is  dramatic (Tudor's "Pillar of Fire") or abstract (Tippet's "Bruch Violin  Concerto"), something beyond skillful execution occurs: something unmistakably  elemental.  </P> <P> Sunday afternoon, Browne and Bustamante assumed the leading roles in the  company's new "Swan Lake" and their rapport again proved extraordinary. His  remarkable calm and reliability as a partner seemed to free her to be daringly  spontaneous. In return, her passion appeared to call from him a deep,  instinctual response. (Can there be a more sweetly protective Siegfried in the  White Swan pas de deux?)  </P> <P> Browne's emotionalism sometimes verged on the neurotic -- especially in the  ballroom adagio, where her hot, willful characterization clashed with the  music. She proved more artful as Odette, emphasizing hopeless suffering and an  intense but steady flow of movement. The solo seemed to perplex her but  otherwise she managed to motivate and energize all of the role without  distorting its formal beauty. Not a majestic Swan Queen, perhaps, but a highly  individual and convincing one.  </P> <P> From his princely bearing to his nobly phrased, effortlessly produced solos,  Bustamante made an ideal Siegfried. Occasionally, arm positions looked rushed  or perfunctory, but this was clearly a performance conceived in the grandest  danseur noble tradition.  </P> <P> The matinee cast also offered the brasher bravura of Danilo Radojevic (Benno),  Gil Boggs and John Gardner (Neapolitan Dance), along with the informed  conducting of Emil De Cou.

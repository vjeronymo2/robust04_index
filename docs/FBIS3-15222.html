The decision of the Russian  leadership to declare James Morris, counsellor at the U.S.  Embassy in Moscow, persona non grata, became known Monday  evening. The U.S. CIA resident, who was working under  diplomatic cover, was instructed to leave Russia within seven  days. Let us recall that Aleksandr Lysenko, the 56-year old  Russian Foreign Intelligence Service representative who was  expelled from the United States, received exactly the same  "term." Thus, the sides kind of traded blows and exchanged  figures on the board where the invisible dispute between the  intelligence services is being conducted.    According to our experts, Lysenko's expulsion testifies to  the weakness of the accusation against the Ameses, who are being  accused of espionage for Moscow's benefit, and the insufficiency  and obvious weakness of the evidence against them. First of  all, Lysenko, who only arrived in the United States in July of  last year, would not have been able, even if he had wanted to,  to "blow his cover" in contacts with Aldrich Ames so quickly.  If such contacts really existed.    In that case, our intelligence agents who ran the Ameses  should be expelled. But at the moment they are not being  touched. Obviously, the Americans have either been unable to  establish their contacts, or, what is more likely, there were no  such contacts at all. This version is also corroborated by the  fact that Lysenko, in accordance with a previously reached  agreement between the Russian and U.S. intelligence services,  was known to CIA staffers. Just as Morris was known to the  Foreign Intelligence Service. This was done for the purposes of  better cooperation between the two intelligence services in  spheres like the struggle against drugs trafficking and the  monitoring of the nonproliferation of weapons of mass  destruction. But, by expelling Lysenko, the Americans have  violated the gentlemen's agreement on not divulging the  department to which the employees of their special services  belong.    Second, even the U.S. press is talking about the  insufficiency and obvious weakness of the accusation against the  Ameses. Evidently, in order to somehow compensate for this  failing, a sensation is deliberately being whipped up in the  United States over the Ames' arrest. Since there is little  evidence, all kinds of rumors are being circulated. For  example, Ames is already being accused of cooperating with the  drug mafia. (As we know, Aldrich Ames recently worked in the  department for the struggle against drug trafficking). Neil  Gerardo, president of the U.S. corporation "Gerardo  International," which is involved in the development of secret  weapons systems to Pentagon orders, even claims that Ames could  have passed secrets to Moscow about the production of the  company's latest invention -- the so called MRX defense  technology. According to experts, all this is rank  disinformation, circulated with only one aim -- to create the  impression of the monstrous guilt of the Ameses despite  obviously insufficient evidence.    As has become known, the decision on Lysenko's expulsion was  adopted after two high-ranking CIA representatives visited  Moscow last week. According to our experts' assessments, they  rank third and fifth respectively in this organization's  intelligence hierarchy. The purpose of their visit to Moscow  was to attempt to persuade our intelligence agents (Foreign  Intelligence Service Director Yevgeniy Primakov was in Slovakia  at that time) to take the blame upon themselves and recall  Aleksandr Lysenko nicely, as well as give up any countermeasures  or comments in the press.    Comments really did appear in the press, and our  intelligence  officers could not assume responsibility and kind of admit their  guilt by agreeing to Lysenko's recall. And they particularly  could not fail to respond adequately to the expulsion of our  intelligence officer.    The desire to move the affair of exposing someone's agent  from a generally speaking routine level in the intelligence  world onto a political level, onto the level of Russian-U.S.  relations, and the desire to create a pause in relations between  our countries, is obvious. This is confirmed by relevant  articles in the U.S. press. In particular, statements about the  reawakened Russian bear, and about some intrigues or other on  Russia's part, apparently undermining the United States'  national security, have been appearing. These are sometimes  being presented in a way suggesting that the U.S, tax payer is  virtually financing Russian spies. At the same time, the  impression is created that behind all the Americans' demands,  there lies the naive certainty that only they have the right to  conduct intelligence activities, while Russia no longer has this  right.</p>

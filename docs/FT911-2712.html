			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Currency funds: for the bold only - How can you profit from the dollar's strength? THE US dollar has taken many people by surprise this year by the speed with which it has risen on the international currency markets. Many investors must be wishing that they had shifted funds into the US currency in January. It is possible to back your hunches in the foreign exchange markets by investing in an offshore currency fund. The average dollar fund earned 10.26 per cent, offer-to-offer, in March alone and 12.35 per cent over three months, according to Finstat. There are two main types of currency fund: a managed fund, where the manager picks and chooses which of the world's major currencies he or she expects to do well, and a single currency fund, which simply invests in short term deposits of the currency concerned. It is then up to the investor to pick the right unit. These funds can be offered in two forms. Accumulation, or roll-up, funds were extremely popular in the days when it was possible to use them to convert income into capital gains - and make a tax benefit. The Inland Revenue has put a stop to the practice but it is still possible, if the income is not repatriated, to postpone the date when tax is paid. Distributor funds, in contrast, pay out their income gross and this makes them attractive to non-taxpayers such as non-working wives. The reward from a currency fund comes in two ways. The manager invests the fund in interest-bearing deposits to earn income. The return varies depending on the level of interest rates in the country concerned. The Old Court Spanish peseta fund, for example, is currently yielding 13.2 per cent; the Singapore dollar fund is yielding just 3.48 per cent. Capital gain arises if the currency or currencies selected rise in value against the pound. The danger, of course, is that the currencies fall against the pound and the investor loses money. The charges depend on the type of fund that you choose. Managed funds carry an initial charge, slightly lower than on a unit trust. The Old Court (N M Rothschild) initial charge on the managed funds is 3 per cent and the charge on the Guinness Flight managed fund is to be increased from 4 to 5 per cent, from April 30. Single currency funds normally carry no initial charge. Both sets of funds have annual management charges, 0.5 per cent in the case of Guinness Flight as from April 30, 1 per cent in the Old Court range. Minimum investments vary with the Rothschild funds setting no minimum at all and Guinness Flight about to raise its minimum to Pounds 5,000. Among managed funds, Guinness Flight International Managed Currency is top over seven and ten years, achieving growth (offer-to-offer with income reinvested) of 131.6 per cent and 351.6 per cent respectively. But to show the risks involved in this area, the worst performing fund - Forexfund - actually lost 11.1 per cent over seven years. Of the single currency funds, four of the top five over three years were Australian dollar based, with the best performing being Lloyds International, which returned 70.5 per cent. The same fund was the best over five years, with a 81 per cent return, although one or two sterling-based funds were not far behind. It paid to be adventurous in 1984, since the two best funds over seven years are in Italian lira (124.9 per cent) and Danish kroner (119.3 per cent). Both are part of the Old Court range. Old Court funds also take top billing over ten years, with the Italian lira (304.9 per cent), Canadian dollar (257.9 per cent) and French franc (226.6 per cent) in first, second and third place respectively. To put this into perspective, the average UK general unit trust returned 398.3 per cent over the last ten years - and indeed the average UK general trust beat the best currency fund over seven years as well. This merely illustrates the oft-repeated investment belief that equities offer the best returns over the long term. On the other hand, it is quite surprising to find how few funds have actually lost money over longer periods. Ten managed funds are down in price over one year - including two which have fallen by 26.6 per cent. That is the kind of fall that can easily occur with a conventional unit trust, but it might be a different story if there was a sharp rise in sterling against other currencies. The other kind of risk is much more difficult to quantify. By being offshore, the funds do not qualify for the UK's compensation scheme, although some will be backed by local investor protection plans. Much may depend on the safety of the company concerned and it is perhaps unsurprising that the blue-blooded N M Rothschild is the largest in this field. This is not, therefore, an area in which the small investor should speculate. But if you are gloomy about the prospects for sterling, or if perhaps you have a regular need to use one currency, such a fund might be worth considering.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WRONG-WAY DRIVER, 2 OTHERS KILLED IN HEAD-ON COLLISION  </P> <P> Three Orange County residents were killed early Thursday in a head-on collision  involving a wrong-way driver suspected of being drunk, police said.  </P> <P> The driver of a van heading the wrong way on eastbound 7th Street was  identified as Choong Kim, 47, of Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Kim was taken to St. Mary's Medical Center in Long Beach with critical  injuries, but died about nine hours after the accident.  </P> <P> Two other victims in the 2 a.m. crash, the driver of a Fiat and his female  passenger, died at the scene, a stretch of 7th Street just west of its junction  with the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> The Fiat driver was identified as Augustine Moreno, 18, of Santa Ana, and his  passenger was Guadalupe Romero-Mendoza, 21, Long Beach Police Detective Don  Terrell said.  </P> <P> Terrell said Kim is suspected of drunk driving and that his autopsy will  include toxicological tests for alcohol and drugs. Results will not be  available for several weeks.  </P> <P> Other details of the fatal accident remained sketchy, Terrell said, because it  is not clear how and where Kim entered the eastbound lanes of 7th Street,  before striking Moreno's car about 160 feet west of where the road spans the  San Gabriel River channel.  </P> <P> "We're not real positive where he came from," Terrell said. "There are no cross  streets in that area."  </P> <P> The portion of 7th Street where the accident occured has a 30-foot-wide earthen  divider, with the two westbound lanes on a grade about six to eight feet higher  than the two eastbound lanes where the Fiat and the van collided, Terrell said.  Both cars were traveling at speeds well over 40 m.p.h., in the far left lane,  he said.  </P></p>

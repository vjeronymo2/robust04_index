			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (2): Stock exchange seeks more local investors - The ranks of banks seem a little crowded TORONTO has not only overtaken Montreal as Canada's financial centre, but is now home to almost all the biggest organisations in the financial services industry. The city has also attracted about 50 Canadian subsidiaries of foreign banks, together with a growing number of North American, European and Japanese investment managers, and a long list of foreign-controlled insurance companies. The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) accounts for more than three-quarters of the value of shares traded on Canada's five exchanges. But the liveliness of the TSE trading floor will soon be history. The floor will be converted into offices when the TSE completes its transition to a fully-automated trading system, next January. The exchange will then take its place among the 'most sophisticated trading systems in the world,' according to Mr Pearce Bunting, its president. The transition to a fully-automated floor has not been without problems. The project was originally scheduled to be completed in early 1993. The deadline was moved to the end of this year, then to early 1994. The delays have arisen partly to give the TSE time to respond to suggestions made by members. Reliability is also an important concern. The TSE is anxious to avoid a repetition of the criticism levelled at it last spring when problems with new software closed the floor for four hours. In 1992, the TSE traded 7.3bn shares, up 25.5 per cent from 1991. The value of shares traded last year was CDollars 76.2bn, up 12.4 percent. Preliminary figures show that trading on all Canadian exchanges rose 12.9 per cent to CDollars 101.8bn in 1992. Upgrading the trading system has been a high - and sometimes controversial - priority for Mr Bunting since he took over as TSE president in 1977. A Computer Assisted Trading System, known as Cats, was installed when the exchange moved to its current quarters in First Canadian Place in 1983. (The Cats system was sold to exchanges in Brussels, Paris and Madrid.) The prospect of automation has dramatically lowered the cost of a seat on the TSE. Previously, a seat entitled a member to only 6 traders. So the more traders a firm wanted, the more seats it required. But the disappearance of the trading floor means that each member will need only one. Seats changed hands at a peak of about CDollars 370,000 in 1988, but the price has now tumbled to roughly CDollars 50,000. A growing number of smaller 'niche' firms is joining the TSE, Mr Bunting says. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's pension fund became the exchange's first (and so far, only) institutional member late last year when it purchased a seat on the exchange. Mr Jerome Lapointe, manager of the CBC pension fund, said that lower membership fees and the opportunity to save on brokerage commission were considerations in the decision to obtain a TSE seat. The TSE hopes to improve its appeal to investors with the introduction of a third, medium-level index, to be composed largely of the 100 stocks with the biggest market value. Currently, the TSE's performance is measured by its TSE 35 and the more broadly-based TSE 300 composite index of stocks. Mr Gordon Walker, director of derivative marketing, calls the TSE 300 the 'index of investor sentiment,' or a Canadian version of the Dow Jones index on Wall Street. But the TSE 300 includes many stocks which are not traded by the larger institutions. The new TSE 100 will more closely reflect what money managers in Canada are buying and selling, Mr Walker says. Efforts to reach smaller investors include a 'mini-exchange' at a financial trade show held in Toronto each February. Newcomers to the market can buy or sell up to 100 shares of a select group of stocks at a fraction of the regular brokerage fees. At last year's 'mini-exchange', members of the public traded a record CDollars 2.9m in the 10 shares on offer. Instead of trying to compete with other North American exchanges for international capital flows, the TSE is focusing most of its attention on Canadian investors. 'Our general view at the moment is to concentrate our marketing on our existing products and try to improve their liquidity,' says Mr Bunting. Foreign financial institutions have taken a higher profile in the Toronto securities market through their purchase of stakes in local firms. Deutsche Bank, SG Warburg, James Capel and Sanwa Bank are among those which have joined forces with Canadian firms over the past five years. Mr Patrick Mars, president of Bunting Warburg, in which SG Warburg has a 50 per cent stake, says that the link with a well-known international money manager has broadened his firm's base. It has enabled the firm to expand its activity in the primary financing area, managing a number of issues. Moreover, Mr Mars says that the alliance has given the Canadian dealer greater access to research worldwide, and improved its ability to advise Canadians on investing overseas. Many other financial institutions have not found life in Toronto so rewarding. Some foreign-owned banks which set up operations following the deregulation of the 1980s are struggling in the face of an unexpectedly fierce competitive environment. 'The Canadian market is pretty over-banked as it is,' says Laurence Booth, professor of finance at the University of Toronto. 'The (foreign banks) that are in trouble are the ones which haven't got a focus.' Insurance companies in Ontario worry about additional costs which would follow the implementation of proposed auto insurance reforms in Bill 164. Under the new rules, the provincial government has projected a 4 per cent rise in costs which, among other things, would expand accident victims' ability to sue for pain and suffering. But an Insurance Bureau of Canada study predicts that costs could rise by between 12 and 15 per cent.</p>

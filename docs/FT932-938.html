			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / International Bonds: EIB surprises with further tranche of Eurosterling offer THE European Investment Bank raised a few eyebrows yesterday when it launched a further tranche of its existing Eurosterling bond issue at the same yield as the 8 per cent gilt due 2003. The latest Pounds 400m tranche of the EIB's 8 per cent 10-year bonds brings the total size of the issue up to Pounds 1bn, making it the largest Eurosterling issue in the market. The initial Pounds 400m tranche, launched in January, was priced to yield 13 basis points over the gilt, while the second tranche of Pounds 200m, launched in March, was priced to yield 5 basis points over the gilt. Since then, the yield spread in the secondary market has narrowed, with the result that the EIB issue was trading at between two and three basis points below the comparable gilt yield shortly before the latest tranche. Salomon Brothers, the lead manager for yesterday's tranche, said that the bond was trading in line with the gilt yesterday afternoon. 'It is extraordinary that the EIB can trade through gilts in this way,' commented one analyst yesterday, referring to the fact that gilts are more liquid and regarded as the top-quality sterling assets. The proceeds were kept in fixed-rate sterling. Dealers reported continued strong demand for Eurosterling paper, both from domestic and overseas investors. The latter are keen on sterling assets because they see scope for the pound to appreciate against other European currencies. In addition, Eurosterling yields are relatively high compared with those available in other European currencies. The EIB deal attracted considerable interest - partly because dealers were glad to see the creation of a large liquid Eurosterling issue, and partly because the maturity is the same as for the Bank of England's forthcoming Pounds 3.25bn gilt auction. However, dealers did not expect the EIB deal to detract from the auction, given that there is plenty of demand for 10-year paper. French borrowers tapped the international bond market for a total of FFr6bn in longer-dated issues yesterday, attracted by the prospect of a further rally in the French franc sector. Eurobond dealers in France said that investors regard the eight to 12 year maturity area as particularly attractive, given some forecasts that 10-year French government bond yields could fall from around 6.7 per cent to 6 per cent within 12 months. Credit Foncier, which has a AA1/AA+ rating, raised FFr3bn of 10-year bonds with a coupon of 6.75 per cent, priced to yield 27 basis points over the relevant government bond. Credit Lyonnais, which was the book-runner and joint lead manager for the Credit Foncier deal, said the spread tightened fractionally. However, the reaction among the other French Eurobond houses was mixed. Some claimed the deal was priced too aggressively and that the spread widened out slightly as the bonds proved hard to place, while others thought the pricing was quite fair. Credit Lyonnais itself launched a FFr2.5bn nine-year bond issue, which was quickly raised to FFr3bn. The bonds were priced to yield 70 basis points over the government bond, which some dealers described as 'on the generous side' for a borrower with an A1/AA- debt rating.</p>

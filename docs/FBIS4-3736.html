			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanjing, April 22 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scientists  have proposed investing 7.8 billion yuan (896.55 million U.S.  dollars) over 10 years in deepening and dredging the deep-water  channel of the Chang Jiang river mouth from the current 7 meters  to 12.5 meters.    Upon completion of the project, the channel may allow the  passage of 100,000-ton common vessels in high tide and of  50,000-ton container ships day and night, said Yan Kai and Dou  Guoren, academicians from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  Currently, it allows the passage of only 10-ton vessels in high  tide.    The proposed project is believed to be significant toward  making the Shanghai harbor a rising new hub of international  transportation on the western shore of the Pacific Ocean, and it  will greatly enhance the economic development of the Chang Jiang  river delta and the whole of the Chang Jiang river valley.    The State Planning Commission has approved the plan, saying  it is "technically feasible and economically profitable."    The "river mouth," from Nanjing to Shanghai, is a  cross-point  of China's coastal areas with the vast Chang Jiang river valley  areas. It is the shipping route for 200 million tons of goods a  year.    There are more than 100 over-10,000-ton ports along the  edges  of the mouth, including Shanghai harbor, one of the world's ten  100- million-ton harbors.    The current difficulty in the Chang Jiang river mouth costs  several hundred million yuan each year, since ships have to  unload part of the goods or wait for high tides in order to sail  into or to enter harbors.    The two academicians said that the project will bring 4.05  billion yuan in profits to the transporters, harbors and  manufacturers in the first five years of construction; later, it  will save them an additional 7.36 billion yuan. Ten years after  the project is completed, 28.8 billion yuan will be saved.    The proposal was based on a key national research project on  the Chang Jiang waterway, the results of which have been  approved by the State Planning Commission.    The research was conducted by nearly 100 scientists from the  Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Shanghai Waterways Bureau and  the Nanjing Water Control Institute.    Studies on the evolution of the Chang Jiang river bed and  physical and mathematical model verification measures were used  to produce the proposal.    Experiments show that the project will neither affect the  river's ability to drain floods, nor affect the water supply to  cities along the river, despite an increase in the inflow of sea  water.    Experts believe the project will be conducive to the  comprehensive management of the Chang Jiang river mouth and  urged that it be put into action soon.</p>

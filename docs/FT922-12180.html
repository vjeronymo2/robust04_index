			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Observer: Hanson's choice Meanwhile, it sounds as if Sir Owen Green's arch rival, Lord Hanson, is tinkering with his top management team again. After Lord White's surprise promotion of 50-year-old David Clarke to be chief executive of Hanson Industries in the US, Hanson has promoted Derek Bonham, 48, to be chief executive of the UK end of the business. The choice of Bonham for the job should help to curb City concerns about the next generation of Hanson management. Even so it could be a brave move. Unlike Clarke, who was already one of Hanson's two chief operating officers, Bonham is a finance man. While it is no great surprise that he has leapfrogged Martin Taylor, one of the two vice- chairmen, it is odd that UK chief operating officer Tony Alexander no longer seems in line for the topmost job.</p>

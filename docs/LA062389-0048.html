			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Iran has rejected several recent attempts by third countries to mediate with  Washington, Iran's foreign minister was quoted as saying. Ali Akbar Velayati,  interviewed in the Dubai-based Arabic newspaper Al Bayan, said Iran is  interested in good foreign relations as long as that doesn't compromise its  independence, Al Bayan reported. "Several countries have approached us for some  kind of mediation with the United States. But we reject that as the Islamic  republic in Iran has never welcomed such mediations," Velayati was quoted as  saying.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDAISM PERVADES WRITER'S LIFE AND HER PLOTS  </P> <P> When Faye Kellerman was little, she used to climb into the apricot tree in her  Sherman Oaks back yard and fantasize, sometimes speaking lines from her  daydreams out loud. "Is this child normal?" her grandmother would fret.  </P> <P> Now 37, Kellerman climbs into the office studio above her bedroom and  fantasizes still. She figured out long ago that "if I can put it down on paper  then I'm a writer, not a weirdo."  </P> <P> Kellerman, who lives in Beverlywood, recently published her third and most  ambitious novel, a 600-page mystery set in Elizabethan England titled "The  Quality of Mercy."  </P> <P> Like her earlier, contemporary mysteries, "The Ritual Bath" and "Sacred and  Profane," the new novel features a pair of seriously star-crossed lovers.  Rebecca Lopez, the exotic protagonist of "The Quality of Mercy," is a conversa,  a secret Jew posing as an Anglican in Elizabethan England, where Judaism was  outlawed from 1290 until Oliver Cromwell lifted the ban in 1656.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Imaginative Account  </P> <P> Cursed with a good mind in a bad century for women, Lopez falls in love with a  silver-tongued playwright named William Shakespeare, who is neither Jewish nor  single. The rest is historical suspense fiction, including a highly imaginative  account of how Shakespeare came to write "The Merchant of Venice."  </P> <P> Kellerman will sign copies of "The Quality of Mercy," published by William  Morrow &amp; Co., on July 20 at Vagabond Books in Westwood.  </P> <P> Although much of "The Quality of Mercy" is fanciful, it is grounded in  Kellerman's considerable knowledge of a great many subjects. "I write about  what I know," Kellerman said, and, as the author's blurb on one of her books  indicates, that covers a lot of territory. She "is not only a gifted  storyteller but a dentist, an expert fencer, a musician who plays four  instruments, a guitar maker -- and the mother of three young children."  </P> <P> She is also the wife of psychologist-turned-mystery writer Jonathan Kellerman,  who works at his own word processor in another part of their sprawling Westside  home. Her husband is her favorite mystery writer, Kellerman said unhesitantly,  and the couple regularly critique each other's work. "It took many years to  learn how to do that without having a cold night," she noted.  </P> <P> Kellerman sought training in dentistry because "I thought it would be a good  profession to practice. It still may be. I don't know." Although she has done  only volunteer work as a dentist, she considers it excellent preparation for  her career as a mystery writer. "I have a very good knowledge of anatomy and  forensics." In "Sacred and Profane," a forensic dentist helps solve a murder by  tipping the police to the likelihood that the victim was deaf -- a deduction  she makes from the condition of the dead woman's teeth.  </P> <P> What the publisher's blurb fails to mention is Kellerman's knowledge and love  of Orthodox Judaism, which pervades her daily life. The Kellermans live where  they do, in part, so they can walk to their temple on the Sabbath. Her ketubah  -- her marriage contract, beautifully hand-lettered in Hebrew -- hangs in a  place of honor over the fireplace.  </P> <P> The realities of observant Jewish life also inform her novels. Rina Lazarus,  the heroine of Kellerman's modern mysteries, packs kosher brown-bag lunches of  salmon and noodle kugel for the man she loves -- big, red-headed police  detective Peter Decker. But her religious values don't allow her to entertain  him overnight without benefit of marriage.  </P> <P> "I thought the Orthodox Jewish world was a very interesting one that had not  been portrayed accurately in the medium," Kellerman said. She fact-checks all  matters of Halakha, or Jewish law, with Orthodox rabbis, but her meticulousness  has not exempted her from criticism from some parts of the Jewish community.  She has been chided for setting a scene of sexual violence at an Orthodox  ritual bath.  </P> <P> On the other hand, she said, she gets fan mail from young Orthodox women who  say they identify with feisty Rina Lazarus.  </P> <P> Kellerman likes Rina, too, but she emphasizes that she is not Rina or any of  her other characters. Rina might not approve of the fact that Kellerman, though  married, does not cover her cascade of brown curls, as Orthodox women  traditionally do. "I admire her," Kellerman said, "but I'm not going to cover  my hair just because she does."  </P> <P> Fiction gives Kellerman the opportunity to explore alternative lives, if only  in her mind. "It's fun writing because you put yourself into other worlds," she  said. Kellerman says she has no trouble getting inside the skin of Decker, the  Los Angeles police detective, raised a Baptist, who is so unlike his creator.  </P> <P> "I can feel what he's like," she said. "There's a very masculine side to me.  Maybe that's why I took all those math and science courses."  </P> <P> Kellerman also attributes some of Decker's authenticity to the hours she spent  with her brothers, and to a good ear. "I listen to people," she said. "I'm a  big eavesdropper."  </P> <P> Kellerman has finished two more books featuring Decker and Lazarus, "Milk and  Honey," to be published next year, and "Day of Atonement," scheduled for 1991.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demanding Project  </P> <P> "The Quality of Mercy" was a far more demanding project than a modern mystery,  Kellerman said, because of the extensive research involved.  </P> <P> Her initial idea for the book, about three years ago, was to have Shakespeare  and Shylock from "The Merchant of Venice" solve a crime. Later, she came upon  an account of the life and death of Roderigo Lopez, (the father of her  heroine), the physician to Queen Elizabeth, a converso who was executed for  treason at the instigation of the Earl of Essex.  </P> <P> Kellerman's book is both a mystery and a fictional account of what happened to  Lopez. It is a work of the imagination -- it includes, for instance, a scene in  which Queen Elizabeth takes the heroine to bed ("I figured, 'What the hey,' "  Kellerman said, "this is fiction"). But every word, every detail, had to be  grounded in fact.  </P> <P> It wasn't easy, the author said. She learned that the Elizabethans didn't eat  tomatoes -- they believed they were poisonous -- that an improperly doffed hat  was deemed an insult, and that the word incontinently meant "immediately" to  Shakespeare and his contemporaries. She studied Elizabethan history, culture,  medicine, cooking.  </P> <P> She also learned as much as possible about "The Merchant of Venice." She found,  though, that she could not read the plays and poems of Shakespeare while she  was trying to write about him. "To put words into his mouth was terribly  intimidating," she recalled, and his body of work "showed too much of the  genius and not enough of the human being."  </P> <P> She decided not to have her fictional Shakespeare quote real Shakespearean  lines, as some other writers have done. "He can't talk like a poet all of the  time," she said. "Sometimes you yell at your spouse, and you don't do it in  verse!"  </P> <P> Writing "The Quality of Mercy," Kellerman said, left her with the conviction  that crime doesn't change and that she was "really glad to be living in the  20th Century."  </P> <P> Shuddering at the thought of both Elizabethan sanitation and anti-Semitism, she  said: "You can keep your courtly behavior, just give me my microwave. Good  title for a country-Western song, nu?"  </P></p>

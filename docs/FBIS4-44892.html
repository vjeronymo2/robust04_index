			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Riki Nakayama] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Manufacturers Mastering Use of Photomolding Systems in </H5> Development/Production Processes    Photomolding systems for producing solid, three-dimensional  models using photocured resins (plastics that harden when  subjected to light rays) have been around in Japan for the past  five years. Manufacturers who have mastered these systems have  been getting good results using them in ordinary operations.  There are numerous examples of photomolding systems being used  in the development process to create prototypes for verification  and testing purposes, and in the production process for vacuum  casting and to make casting models. All past methods for  accomplishing these same tasks required large amounts of time  and money. The point of mastering photomolding systems is to  produce plastic models with minimum precision and strength.    Decreasing numbers of experienced, skilled technicians means  that it now takes several weeks to produce wooden patterns for  casting purposes, thus making it impossible for makers to  respond to sudden orders. And pressured by budgetary constraints  and development deadlines, manufacturers are unable to prototype  and test their products adequately. Photomolding systems have  the potential for solving all of these problems.    Photomolding systems harden or cure photocured resins in  layers by carrying out laser scanning operations based on  three-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) data, and then  create three-dimensional shapes by stacking sectional forms. As  long as 3D CAD data is available, plastic models can be produced  rapidly, and even shapes that are not possible with machine  processing, like hollow structures, can be integrally molded  using photomolding systems.    Although they share a common production method called  "sectional stacking," various equipment have been developed  recently according to the types of materials and processing  methods employed. The generic term "Rapid Prototyping &amp;  Manufacturing" (RP&amp;M) is often used to refer to this  equipment  and the processes they are used in.    There are a wide variety of uses for plastic models produced  via photomolding systems, including prototypes for checking the  shape and functions of products and as casting  models.[.sup](1)[/] On the flip side of the coin, however,  the equipment alone runs several tens of millions of yen, and  the resin used in the photomolding process costs upwards of  &yen;15,000 per kilogram, making photomolding systems extremely  expensive. And there are also those who harbor doubts about the  effectiveness of these systems, citing the need for 3D CAD data,  and insufficient precision and molding speeds as their reasons.    However, progress is being made in the development and  improvement of photomolding system equipment and resins from the  standpoints of lowering their costs and increasing their  accuracy and operating speeds. A Photomolding Production  Association has also been founded, and the government has begun  supporting photomolding systems via tax breaks and technological  development subsidies.    Under these circumstances, manufacturers have already begun  to incorporate photomolding systems into their daily operations  and are getting results. This article relies on case studies to  try to determine just how these systems can be utilized to  achieve the best results, and exactly how effective they are  from the standpoint of reducing production time and costs.  <H5>  Plastic Models Machine Processed Using NC Tools -- Average </H5> Daily Operating Time Is 20 Hours    The Nakashima Propeller Company (headquartered in Okayama  City) introduced a photomolding system into their operations in  March 1991, and ever since, according to Vice President Hiroshi  Nakashima, they have been using that equipment "...as part of  our production line." Nakashima Propeller is engaged primarily  in the manufacture of propellers for boats and ships, and uses  the plastic models produced via its photomolding system in place  of wooden patterns as casting models.[.sup](2)[/]    The shape of a propeller will differ slightly according to  the shape of the ship, the type of engine, the location where it  will be used and the type of performance being sought.  Therefore, there aren't many cases where the same shape  propeller is mass-produced; the tendency recently being toward  small-lot, multi-product production.    Up until recently, three types of casting models were used  at Nakashima Propeller -- metal molds, wooden patterns and  rotating molds (a kind of sand mold that employs a rotating  squeegee-type device). Casting is performed using these models,  and machine-processing is relied upon to complete the product.    Metal molds are produced in dimensions that will enable them  to be used in common on products for which continuous demand is  anticipated, whereas wooden patterns are used to produce  propellers for which there is a concentrated, short-term demand.  The rotating mold is used to turn out small lots of small-sized  propellers, as well as large-sized propellers.    The company has recently been turning out increasing numbers  of propellers with completely new shapes, and for these, has  been relying more and more on wooden patterns and rotating  molds. Because the rotating mold process is done completely by  hand, it requires skilled technicians and longer production  schedules. The same can be said for wooden patterns. The longer  schedules, combined with a shortage of skilled technicians, have  been making it very difficult to meet orders with short delivery  times.    It was this situation that prompted Nakashima Propeller to  take a close look at photomolding systems. Its photomolding  system cannot be applied to the manufacture of truly large-sized  propellers, but is more than capable of handling three-blade  propellers, the maximum diameter of one blade of which is one  meter. Depending on the shape of the propeller, the photomolding  system can often produce plastic models that are closer to the  finished product than those using wooden patterns or rotating  molds, a factor which helps cut down on machine-processing time  as well.    The costs involved in producing a single mold using the  photomolding system are about the same as those for rotating  molds, but because the photomolding system does not require the  intervention of skilled technicians, according to Koichi  Kuramoto, head of the Medical Business Office, "It is cheap when  you think in terms of the investment required to train skilled  technicians."    Compared to the roughly one week required to manufacture a  wooden pattern for a propeller with a diameter of 80 cm, the  photomolding system can produce the same size plastic model  overnight.    The photomolding system makes effective use of nighttime  hours to complete the molding process, leaving daytime hours for  removing the plastic models from the molds and/or replacing the  resins. The average operating time per day works out to 20 hours.    Thus, it only takes about one day to complete a plastic  model, and several small models can be produced at a time,  further increasing efficiency. And the photomolding system  enables the user to enlarge the pitch of the lamination layer to  the limits to create hollow shapes, thereby reducing molding  time and material costs. Since the plastic models are ultimately  machine-processed, their surfaces need not be all that precise  upon coming out of the mold.    Also, it isn't like propeller designers simply determine the  sectional forms and major dimensions to create a completely  three-dimensional shape. That is why Nakashima Propeller  constructed a system that makes use of CAD macro functions to  automatically create 3D CAD data. This data is shared by the  photomolding system and the numerically-controlled (NC) machine  tools. But because the photomolding system produces plastic  models that are slightly larger than the end product, some  revisions must be made to this data.  <H5>  Government Intervening to Improve Utilization Environment </H5> Via Tax Breaks and Development Support Aimed at Lowering Prices    In October 1993, the Japanese Government added photomolding  systems and their peripheral equipment to the list of  systems/equipment that fall under the purview of the Basic  Technology Research and Development Promotion System (high-tech  tax system). These systems/equipment will remain on this list  for one year, until September 1994. During that time, 7 percent  of the price of purchasing such systems/equipment can be  deducted from the purchasing firm's corporate taxes. There is  also a possibility that this time period and the items targeted  for inclusion on the list will be expanded.    As a measure aimed at lowering the price of photomolding  system equipment, the Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise  Corporation plans to commence development of related  technologies on a consignment basis. The budget for this  undertaking is expected to total &yen;800 million covering a  four-year period beginning in FY94.    On the industry side, a Photomolding Industry Association  was officially launched on January 26, 1994, with a total  membership of 57. This group will not only promote photomolding  systems, but will encourage RP&amp;M activities in general.    Membership is comprised of representatives from photomolding  equipment and resin manufacturers and users, CAD vendors,  peripheral equipment makers and researchers, who plan to engage  in technology exchange and research and development work, as  well as activities designed to certify what equipment falls  under the purview of the above-mentioned high-tech tax system.  <H5>  Copes With Future Shortages of Skilled Workers and Cuts </H5> Processing Time Roughly in Half    Ideally, a manufacturer can construct a system such as the  one put together by Nakashima Propeller which automatically  creates 3D CAD data, but in actuality, often the product in  question makes this impossible. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries'  Mihara Works is also utilizing plastic models in place of wooden  patterns, but they must input 3D CAD data into the photomolding  system by hand from the drawings.[.sup]3)[/] Even so, they  claim the results have been significant.    The Mihara Works installed a photomolding system into its  operations in May, 1992, to produce plastic models in place of  the wooden patterns the plant had had to rely on up until that  time. Of course, a certain amount of knowledge concerning how to  read drawings is required, but even employees who have only been  with the company a year can input 3D CAD data into the company's  photomolding system.    The 3D CAD data required by the photomolding system can be  obtained from verifications of casting system plans, mass  calculations and shape studies. There are also occasions where  scale models are produced for use in design work. The plant also  studied assembly processes based on 3D CAD.    Up until the plant installed the photomolding system, the  preparation of most wooden patterns was assigned to specialists.  However, with the growing shortage of skilled technicians, the  plant found itself in a situation where it couldn't meet  delivery dates even when its employees worked on weekends and  holidays. And when they tried consigning their wooden pattern  production work to outside firms, even "urgent" orders took  around 10 days to get back. Their photomolding system cuts this  time in half, to five days turnaround time.    Hiroaki Sano, chief of the Casting &amp; Forging Section of  the  Machine Department, stated that when they were considering  installing equipment for the production of models, "We couldn't  decide whether to go with NC machine tools or a photomolding  system." Their reasons for choosing the photomolding system  were: (1) No need for skilled technicians; (2) Even hollow  shapes can be integrally formed; (3) Unmanned operation  capabilities make it possible to effectively use nighttime hours  and days off (for short delivery times); and (4) The same shaped  models can be produced over and over again.    The final analysis was that NC machine tools were more  troublesome to operate than a photomolding system from the  standpoint of having to change tools and work.  <H5>  Dimension Accuracy Above Specs and Increased Strength With </H5> Fluororesin-Coated Sheets    The photomolding system being used at the Mihara Works can  produce plastic models up to 850 x 600 x 500mm in size. Models  larger than this are produced in several parts, which are then  joined together when they are attached to the plates.    As for the dimensional accuracy of these plastic models,  according to Chief Sano, "The plastic models exhibit around half  the errors allowed by the precision specifications for the  castings, and are more than satisfactory as replacements for  precision casting wooden patterns." Metal shrinkage and sand  mold deformation greatly affect precision. But plastic models  turned out via the photomolding system exhibit little change  over time, and can be taken out and used after six months in  storage with no problems. There have been cases recorded where  the same plastic models were used between 100-200 times.    To cut back on the expense of the raw materials used in  plastic models, honeycomb structures are employed. The surface  layer of these models is about 1mm in thickness. If this surface  layer is made any thinner, molding time and material costs might  be reduced even further, but model strength could not be  maintained.    When it comes to repairing broken plastic models or revising  their shapes, excess parts can be cut off and fast curing resins  used to fill in cracks and depressions, and the repaired/revised  area can then be coated with a photocuring resin. This  photocuring resin will harden up with exposure to sunlight.    A few techniques being used to enhance the strength of  plastic models include thermal spraying aluminum (Al) and  pasting a fluororesin-coated sheet on the surface of the model.  Chief Sano says that applying these measures "Extends the  service life of the plastic models longer than that for wooden  patterns."    Since the costs involved in thermal spraying are quite high,  this technique is not used that often, but fluororesin-coated  sheets are employed all the time. These sheets not only improve  strength, but also add to the surface precision of the plastic  models.    Thus far, fluororesin-coated sheets have been used on wooden  patterns in place of mold-releasing agents. This is because the  long service life of these sheets helps hold costs down.    For example, the same model is used to produce 200 sand  molds. Ordinarily, a mold-releasing agent would have to be  re-applied to the pattern or model about once every five times,  or roughly 40 times during the course of turning out the 200  molds. But a fluororesin-coated sheet is applied once and can be  used for all 200 operations. This cuts costs by roughly one-half.    And since the sheets offer better releasability vis-a-vis  casting sand than mold-releasing agents, you can get by without  allowing for a large draft. This reduces pads, and helps lighten  weight and reduce the amount of raw materials used. Techniques  are also being used whereby these sheets are only pasted to  those areas where mold-releasing agents peel off easily.  <H5>  Molding Simple Shapes to Increase Rate of Operation </H5>   At the Mihara Works, roughly 18,000 man-hours are put in per  month on casting models. The photomolding system is operated  approximately 300 hours a month, but since it possesses twice  the productivity, these 300 hours are equivalent to roughly 600  man-hours put into producing wooden patterns. The photomolding  system therefore accounts for one-thirtieth of the overall  monthly man-hours spent on casting models at Mihara Works.  Because the photomolding system is being used primarily to turn  out small-size models, in terms of numbers of models produced  per month, photomolding accounts for between 20-30 percent of  the total.    Producing small, intricately-shaped models by photomolding  costs less than with wooden patterns. Therefore, there are times  when the simply-shaped portions of large-sized models are  constructed of wood, while the smaller, more complicated parts  of these models are photomolded.    Let's compare the cost of producing molds using wooden  patterns and plastic models on differently shaped objects, using  as examples brake covers and cylinders. The volume of the brake  cover is roughly five times that of the cylinder, but the shape  of the cylinder is significantly more complex.    Manufacturing these brake parts using conventional wooden  patterns cost 260,000 for the covers and 260,000 for the  cylinders. Producing the same parts using photomolded plastic  models cost 200,000 for the covers, but only 135,000 for the  cylinders.    The cost of the resins used to make the plastic models  increases proportionally to the volume of the model, thus  working out to 75,000 for the covers and just 16,000 for the  cylinders. In addition to raw materials costs, producing a  plastic model prototype also involves depreciation costs,  energy, laser wear and tear and personnel expenses.    From the standpoint of production time, it took 90 hours to  construct the wooden pattern for the brake covers and 135 hours  to put together the brake cylinder wooden pattern. The cylinder  pattern took considerably longer to produce. If we do not count  CAD data preparation time and look only at the molding time  required by the photomolding system, we see that it took 49  hours to produce the cover model and just 45.7 hours to turn out  the cylinder model. Photomolding required less time to do the  cylinder model than the cover model.    These findings indicate that complex shapes have a big  impact on the time required to produce the wooden patterns for  them. Naturally, this increases the costs involved in the  process as well. We also learned that the greater the volume of  the product, the longer it takes to produce a photomolded  plastic model for it, but that complex shapes have little or no  affect on model production time using the photomolding system.  Thus, the more complex the shape involved, the greater the  merits of using the photomolding system.    However, if this were the only criteria used to choose  between wooden patterns or photomolded plastic models, the  operation ratio of the photomolding system would probably drop  and the per-model costs of producing plastic models would most  likely increase in accordance with the types of orders received.  This in turn could lead to a vicious cycle wherein the criteria  used to determine the shapes for which plastic models are most  effective become increasingly strict. To avoid this situation,  the Mihara Works raises the operation ratio of its photomolding  system equipment by producing whenever possible plastic molds  even for simple shapes that could just as quickly be done by  hand (wooden patterns).    This approach has other advantages as well, one being the  shortening of delivery times. And contrary to wooden patterns,  the in-house quality control procedures required for photomolded  plastic models are easy to carry out.  <H5>  Rapid Response to Frequent Shape Changes and Fewer </H5> Misunderstandings Concerning Perceived Shapes    Nihon Morex, a manufacturer of connectors (headquarters in  Machida-shi, Tokyo), is employing a photomolding system to turn  out prototypes for submission to its customers. In developing  connectors for consumer electrical appliances and equipment in  particular, the shapes of these connectors undergo numerous  changes from order-receipt to commencement of mass production,  and the photomolding system is very effective at dealing with  these frequent shape changes.    Connectors for use on consumer products come in an infinite  number of different shapes, and are generally produced on the  basis of specifications dictated by customers at order  placement. Below is a brief explanation of what the work flow  from order placement through mass production looked like in the  past.    Based on specifications provided by the customer at order  placement, Nihon Morex designers would put together product  drawings tailored to satisfy these specifications. Once the  customer had checked and approved these drawings, then  prototyping began.    Prototypes can be divided into two major types. These are  prototypes for studying shapes and for confirming functions.  Prototypes for studying the shape of a product are almost always  produced singly, while prototypes for checking out the functions  of a product need to be turned out in larger numbers and require  metal molds. There are times when both types of prototypes are  manufactured simultaneously.    In the past, since solid, three-dimensional shapes were  created based on two-dimensional data in the form of  orthographic projections, shapes were often changed following  the manufacture of the prototype. The reasons for these shape  changes included engineering changes made by the customer and  different perceptions of the final shape held by the customer  and Nihon Morex, as well as design and manufacturing errors.    Despite the fact that connectors come in relatively straight  shapes, it is very difficult to describe all the data involved  in drawings. This results in differences between the shape the  customer has in mind, and the shape envisioned by the designers  based on the specifications. The shape envisioned by the  designers based on the specs often also differs from the shape  imagined by the customers after looking at the drawings.    Because these kinds of misunderstandings existed, claims  were often made whenever Nihon Morex showed the customer the  prototype, and Nihon Morex would have to redo the prototype a  number of times until the customer was satisfied. There were  occasions in the past when the company had to redo prototypes as  many as eight or nine times. It normally takes about a week to  produce a single prototype, but it can be done in two to three  days with five to six engineers working overtime on it.    And when a large number of prototypes are needed for  functional testing, the patterns or molds for these prototypes  must be prepared. This can take between three to four weeks,  with two to three weeks required just for the pattern parts.  This time-consuming process must be undertaken every time there  is a shape or other change to the original specs.    With the photomolding system, however, it only takes one  night to prepare the required shape. And when a prototype of the  same plastic material as the product is needed for functional  inspections, the plastic model produced using the photomolding  system is transferred to a silicon mold and vacuum-casting is  carried out. The process is completed in two to three days.    Nihon Morex has developed a system for rapidly producing  plastic models reflecting shape changes. The company's sales  representatives now carry notebook-style personal computers  around with them with drawings of client products stored in  memory. When a customer dictates a shape change to a visiting  sales representative, the sales representative inputs this data  directly into the digitalized drawings of the original design  stored in the PC's memory and immediately transmits that revised  drawing over public telephone lines to the company.    And whereas customers used to have to confirm their  specifications based on drawings alone, the photomolding system  now enables the company to provide its customers with plastic  models at the initial stage of the process, a development which  has drastically reduced the number of shape changes made by  customers. What used to require eight to nine shape changes, now  can be accomplished with as few as two to three changes. The  shortening of prototype production time and the reduction of  changes has had a considerable impact on Nihon Morex operations.    For instance, customers are not about to delay the start of  their mass production operations because their connector  supplier can't meet its delivery deadline. Prior to installing  the photomolding system, Nihon Morex engineers had to put in  considerable overtime producing prototypes as delivery times  drew near.    Nihon Morex has taken a number of measures aimed at taking  full advantage of its photomolding systems capabilities. For  instance, in order to produce a high precision model, the  company has deliberately lowered the output of the laser by  inserting a glassplate in the laser path. This has improved the  level of precision from what used to be 0.1mm to 0.05mm.    As a result of enhanced precision and improved resins, pins,  terminals and other metal parts can now be inserted into the  plastic models. Prior to these improvements, plastic models  often broke when metal parts were inserted into them,  prohibiting the functional testing of these plastic models under  the same conditions as the finished product operates in.    Nihon Morex also purchased a special American-made software  package for US$500 that automatically produces the shapes of the  supports. (Parts required to support those parts suddenly thrust  out when producing solid models by stacking sections. The  location and shape of these supports depends on the stacking  direction.) When the user inputs the three-dimensional shape and  stacking directions of the model and the material value of the  resin, this software produces the minimum support in the optimum  location. This support is made to bend at the touch of a finger,  making follow-up processing extremely easy.  <H5>  Reduced Annual Prototype Expenses by 100 Million; System </H5> Expanded for Common Use of All Departments.    After installing and using a photomolding system to produce  prototypes for one year, Toyota Motor Corporation "reduced its  prototyping expenses by 100 million," according to Akihide  Kobayashi, a foreman in the Coordination Department, Engine  Development and Engineering Division No. 1, Vehicle Development  Center IV. TMC produced 66 different types of molds for a total  of 212 molds in all during that one-year period.[.sup]4)[/]    This figure was arrived at by totalling up the difference  between the costs of producing prototypes using the photomolding  system and the postulated costs of producing prototypes of the  same shapes using conventional methods. This figure did not take  into account such secondary effects as shortened development  time and reduced numbers of engineering changes.    TMC installed the photomolding system in its engine design  division in 1990. TMC worked together with the manufacturer of  the system to develop an enhanced version capable of turning out  models larger than those possible with off-the-shelf  photomolding systems so that TMC could use this system to  produce all the prototypes required by the engine design  division.    The prototypes produced using the photomolding system are  reportedly used to confirm shapes that cannot be satisfactorily  checked using 3D CAD alone, to confirm mountability and to study  the intake parts required for comparative testing. Foreman  Kobayashi claims that the photomolding-produced prototypes are  "especially effective for visualizing air intake flows."    In the past, the prototypes produced for visual testing  purposes were constructed of acrylics and polycarbonates. It  cost several million yen to produce just one of these  prototypes. Depending on the shape of the prototype, there were  instances where they could only be made with channels or  passages inside rectangular parallelepiped, which meant that  intake flows were not visible from all angles.    When TMC uses its photomolding system, it reportedly  estimates molding expenses at 10,000/hour, which includes the  time required for everything from data preparation to molding  and follow-up processing, and after making comparisons with  other prototyping methods, advises its engineers.    When TMC produces a prototype for visual testing, it  acquires a clear understanding of just what degree of precision  is needed for which parts, and what is required in terms of  surface processing, such as support removal and polishing. This  enables the company to manufacture a product without engaging in  extra and unnecessary work. For this reason, even though they  have an order (specifications) in hand, the designers always  meet with the engineers in charge of molding.    The photomolding system can fall victim to abuse. Because  the photomolding system makes it possible to produce prototypes  faster and cheaper than conventional methods, there is a  tendency to turn out more plastic models than are really  necessary. Although one approach calls for making the most of  the special features of these plastic models to carry out more  studies than was possible in the past, desktop studies are often  just as beneficial.    TMC has therefore implemented a follow-up survey to  determine whether or not the plastic models produced using the  photomolding system are actually being put to use. This survey  program is designed to put a halt to the unnecessary production  of plastic models. And to lower unit costs, the company is also  striving to utilize a single plastic model in numerous studies.    TMC purchased a second photomolding system at the beginning  of 1993, and has created a system whereby the chassis, body and  other divisions can simultaneously use this system together with  the designers in the engine division. This had evolved from the  fact that the engine division had been asked in the past by  other divisions to produce molds for them, and because the  advantages of the photomolding system have been recognized by  all of the company's other divisions. The knowhow needed to  operate the system is passed on to each new section that is set  up, and TMC says that its photomolding systems are now operating  5,000 hours a year.  <H5>  Consigning Model Production to Outside Firms </H5>   Because photomolding system equipment is so expensive, if a  company cannot assure a certain rate of operation, then its  investment will not prove effective and the cost of model  production will be high. And to operate a photomolding system  effectively also requires 3D CAD data and molding knowhow.    For these reasons, numerous manufacturers opt to contract  with outside firms to have their models produced for them. What  does it cost to have models produced outside? There are  basically two ways of calculating these costs. The first  involves calculating unit costs on an hourly basis (hourly  rates) for each process, such as CAD input, molding, etc., and  the second calculates costs based on the volume of the model  being produced.    One manufacturer who uses a photomolding system to produce  plastic models on a consignment basis determines his costs in  the following manner.    First, this maker charges a basic fee of 30,000 per job. In  addition, it then establishes the hourly costs for each of four  processes -- 3D CAD data input, slice data preparation and other  data processing work, molding and follow-up processing, such as  removing supports, etc.    Molding expenses include equipment depreciation costs, laser  wear and tear expenses, the cost of raw materials, utilities  charges, personnel expenses and site rental fees.    The hourly rate for CAD input is 10,000, data processing  costs 5,000 an hour, molding is 20,000 and follow-up processing  runs 5,000 per hour. For example, if CAD input and molding each  takes 10 hours, and data processing and follow-up processing  each require two hours, then the final bill, including basic  fee, will work out to 350,000.    Costs cannot be arrived at this simply for complex shapes  and/or when detailed processing is required. But costs can be  held down somewhat if the company contracting for the production  of the model produces the slice data in-house.  <H5>  3D CAD Is a Necessity; Goal Is Improved Overall Efficiency </H5>   When using a photomolding system, the time required to input  data can be shortened if 3D CAD data is prepared right from the  initial stages of the design process.    The Sony Corporation is pushing forward simultaneously with  the promotion of 3D CAD and the use of a photomolding system.  The company applies 3D CAD to the development of specific  products, then makes use of that data in its computer-aided  engineering (CAE) and photomolding system operations. Sony says  this enables it to evaluate any problems and the measures to  deal with them, and the effectiveness of each of these tools.    Sony's System Development Section, which falls under the  Research and Development Department, Production Engineering  Development Division, is in charge of operating the photomolding  system, and produces plastic models requested by Sony's other  divisions. Since actual costs would be too high if calculated in  detail, the System Development Section calculates the cost of  operating the system at roughly 10,000 an hour. But Hiroshi  Harimaya, manager of that section, says that "There are also  times when the cost is set at the figure given by the requesting  division."    The company expects operating costs to drop once utilization  of the system increases, the rate of operation goes up and  operating knowhow is accumulated. Until then, Sony feels it is  has to turn a blind eye, at least to a certain degree, towards  test period operating costs.    If a company is capable of using a photomolding system to  its full potential in-house, then installing such a system on  these terms is one possible approach. However, for small- and  medium-sized companies, it is quite likely that even if they  introduced a photomolding system into their operations, it would  lie idle much of the time.    For these companies, better approaches to making use of  photomolding systems might be to get together with other  like-minded firms to purchase and use a photomolding system on a  group basis, and or to take advantage of firms that undertake  the production of plastic models on a consignment basis. These  latter approaches would not afford the opportunity to accumulate  operation knowhow, but firms would still be able to acquire  knowledge on the capabilities of photomolding systems in the  area of applications.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Photomolding systems have a variety of applications, but  more often than not, if a company tries to use a system in too  many different ways, it will not acquire the skills and knowhow  necessary to utilize it well in any one of them. This is because  the degree of precision, strength and production time differ for  each application. And those users who are benefiting the most  from their photomolding systems have come up with numerous  schemes to enable them to master the operation of these systems.    In the future, as users increase in numbers, equipment  prices drop and 3D CAD comes into more widespread use, it should  become a lot easier for companies to install photomolding  systems. When this happens, the key to the successful use of  these systems will lie in steadily building up experience and  coming up with ways of utilizing these systems that are tailored  to the company's operations.  <H5>  Appearance of New, Low-Cost Equipment; Expanding Selections </H5> Based on Applications    Numerous RP&amp;M equipment centered around photomolding  systems  can now be purchased in Japan (See Table 1). Roughly 100 of  these devices/systems are already being operated domestically.       Table 1.

Systems of the U.S.[.sup](a)[/] Most of the  photomolding systems in operation in the U.S. were produced by  this company.    As a result, a variety of RP&amp;M equipment, other than  photomolding systems, is now being proposed and developed in the  U.S. And a number of these equipment can also be purchased here  in Japan.    There are also numerous manufacturers marketing photomolding  systems in Japan. These include 3D Systems, Electro-Optical  Systems (EOS) of Germany and a number of Japanese manufacturers.    Most of these systems make use of helium-cadmium (He-Cd) or  argon (Ar) laser devices. There is only one system that utilizes  a semiconductor laser, and that is the SLP produced by Denken  Engineering headquartered in Oita-shi.[.sup](b)[/] The  development of a resin that cures (hardens) in the semiconductor  laser wavelength region was the impetus behind this system. The  SLP is both compact and inexpensive.    Another system scheduled for marketing by Ushio Electric  this  year is also compact and relatively inexpensive. This system  uses a He-Cd laser, but achieves compact size by reducing  output. Scanning speed is slow, however, and molding takes a  long time.    Let us briefly explain some of the other molding methods.  The  Solider by Cubital of Israel employs a photocured resin, but  uses a different layer-curing method. Without performing a  laser-scanning operation, this equipment produces a sectional  form mask using electrostatic force and exposes this mask to  ultraviolet lamps.    Wax is then filled into the gaps created after unhardened  resin has been removed, and the surface is scraped flat. Then a  new coat of resin is applied on top of this, and the next layer  is exposed.    The Sinterstation manufactured by DTM of the U.S. operates  like a photomolding system, producing each layer by scanning it  with a laser. A thermoplastic powdered resin is employed as the  raw material, and new supplies are needed for each layer. The  total amount of resin to be used is heated to near melting prior  to processing, and then the sectional forms are fused and  sintered by scanning them with a CO[.sub]2[/] laser.    The Stratasys Co. of the U.S. uses thermoplastic resin in  its  3D MODELER and FDM, too, but supplies this resin in the shape of  a wire. The resin is fused by means of a nozzle that moves  three-dimensionally, and pressure is used to discharge the model.    The LOM produced by the Helisys Co. of the U.S. bonds  together paper and resin sheets coated with thermoplastic  adhesives by subjecting them to heat and pressure. The contour  lines of the sectional forms are cut using a CO[.sub]2[/]  laser. And finally, to facilitate the removal of margins, the  LOM also produces grid-like cut lines.    Kira Tekkojo (headquartered in Kira-machi, Aichi Prefecture)  is the only Japanese manufacturer to develop an RP&amp;M device  other than a photomolding system. The Kira system also employs  paper layers. Thermoplastic powdered resin is only used on the  sectional forms of the model, being attached via electrostatic  force and bonded using a hot press. A cutter is used to put  notches in the model for the contour lines and  margins.[.sup](c)[/] The company plans to commence marketing  this system in March 1994.    Generally speaking, molding time can be calculated from the  time required to produce a single layer and the thickness of the  layers. In the case of photomolding systems, the time needed to  produce a single layer depends on laser scanning speed and spot  diameter. It also takes time to move the plastic model up and  down to get ready for the next layer.    However, mechanically-speaking, no matter how much  laser-scanning time is shortened, there will still be limits  placed on this process by the sensitivity of the resin, laser  output and layer thickness. And the precision of the model will  depend on what portions of the layer are hardened in what order,  and at what scanning speed and spot diameter. This aspect of the  process is dependent on control software.    RP&amp;M equipment come in a variety of different systems,  and  even photomolding systems are characterized by stacking  direction and laser method. Right now, photomolding systems are  head and shoulders above the other RP&amp;M systems when it  comes to  actual usage, but we could see these other systems come into  more widespread use in future.

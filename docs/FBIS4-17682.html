			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1625 GMT on 25 April broadcasts an 8-minute report  within the "Details" program, during which Sergey Dorenko speaks  to Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Yabloko faction, and  briefly with Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, opponents  of signing the Public Accord agreement.    Zyuganov lists his reasons for not signing the document,  which include the fact that he believes the government has lost  the trust of the people and that its social policies have  failed. Although many parties and movements have signed  agreements, there is no guarantee that these agreements will be  implemented, he argues.    Grigoriy Yavlinskiy tells Dorenko that some 7-8 million  people voted for him during the elections. He says that his  party believes in stability, but does not believe that signing  this agreement will lead to stability. On the contrary, he  stresses, it will exacerbate the situation in the long term, as  it will separate reformers from anti-reformers.    Yavlinskiy says he believes that the agreement should be on  more specific issues, such as privatization, social policy, or  foreign policy. He expresses his displeasure with the fact  that, among the signatories of the document are parties which  could not be trusted, such as the Liberal Democratic Party,  saying he does not believe their slogans and objectives or their  policy, which is fraught with war.    Asked if he felt he would be isolated if he does not sign  the  document, Yavlinskiy responds that this would not be the case.  His party cannot take part in matters which it does not believe  in.    Dorenko sums up by saying that some people will be signing  the document in order to stress their closeness to the  president, and to help influence decision-making. Meanwhile,  the non-signatories will continue the struggle out on the  streets, Dorenko concludes.</p>

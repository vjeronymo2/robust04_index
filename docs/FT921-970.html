			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Slovak leader to face probe CZECHOSLOVAKIAN federal police have launched an investigation into the activities of the most popular Slovakian politician, Mr Vladimir Meciar, following accusations that he collaborated with the hated secret police under the communist regime. If the allegations were to be proved, they could ruin his political career. Mr Meciar leads the strongest opposition party in Slovakia and, in the run-up to the June general election, is advocating greater Slovakian autonomy from the federal government. The police move follows a report written by the Slovakian parliament's defence and security committee. It is based on witnesses' testimonies and accuses Mr Meciar of having once been a secret agent, of having removed incriminating evidence and having promoted loyal former agents in the Slovakian interior ministry after the November 1989 revolution. Mr Meciar, a lawyer under the communists, joined the Slovakian dissidents spearheading the revolution and became Slovakian interior minister until June 1990.</p>

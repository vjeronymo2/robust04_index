			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / People's Bank opens London office LI GUIXIAN, governor of the People's Bank of China, today opens a representative office in London, the central bank's first outside China. The office is a sign of a more outward-looking approach from the Chinese authorities as they proceed with 'open door' economic reforms. The Bank of China, a state-owned commercial bank, already has a London operation and opens a new building in the City this week. As well as being an observation point for European economic developments, the central bank's office could be useful in the management of China's rapidly growing foreign exchange reserves, which exceed Dollars 42bn. As part of the reforms, the People's Bank was officially designated the central bank in 1984. It oversees the banking system, which is still in great need of restructuring, partly because much lending is directed to lossmaking state-owned industries at subsidised interest rates. Though individual banks have gained greater independence in making loan decisions, they are still subject to officially set lending quotas, and interest rates play only a limited role in the distribution of credit. Foreign banks have so far been allowed a limited presence in China, though some branches are expected to be permitted in the booming special economic zones. Chinese officials caution, however, that it will be will be difficult to permit full-scale branches of foreign banks, taking deposits and making loans in the Chinese currency, until reforms of the domestic banking system have been addressed.</p>

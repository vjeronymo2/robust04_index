The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on December 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The refinery complex (1,457 acres) consists of 4 sites located in Port Arthur and Jefferson County, Texas:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site 1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1,244 acres)_main refinery complex located along the Neches River at State Farm to Market Highway 366 and 32nd St., Port Arthur;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site 2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (19 acres)_West Port Arthur Tank Farm (564,000-barrel capacity), owned by American Petrofina Pipe Line Company (subsidiary of Fina, Inc.), located at Roosevelt and 53rd Streets, Port Arthur;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (194 acres)_refinery expansion site, located adjacent to the refinery at State Farm to Market Hwy 366, Port Arthur;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Site 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _Sun Marine Terminal-Nederland tank storage facility, leased storage (1,278,500-barrel capacity), along the Neches River in Nederland, Texas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The refinery (150,000 barrels per day; 470 employees) is used to produce fuels and petrochemical feedstocks. Fuels produced include gasoline, jet fuel, gas oil, diesel fuel, fuel oil, residual fuels and naphthas. Petrochemical feedstocks include methane, ethane, butane, benzene, toluene, xylene, propane and propylene. Refinery by-products include sulfur, petroleum coke and asphalt. Approximately 77 percent of crude oil (88 percent of inputs), and some feedstocks and motor fuel blendstocks are sourced abroad.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Zone procedures would exempt the refinery from Customs duty payments on the foreign products used in its exports. On domestic sales, the company is seeking to avoid duties on fuel used in the refinery and to choose the finished product duty rate on certain petrochemical feedstocks and refinery by-products (duty-free). The duty on crude oil ranges from 5.25&cent; to 10.5&cent;/barrel. The application indicates that the savings from zone procedures would help improve the refinery's international competitiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Board's regulations (as revised, 56 FR 50790&hyph;50808, 10&hyph;8&hyph;91), a member of the FTZ Staff has been designated examiner to investigate the application and report to the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public comment is invited from interested parties.

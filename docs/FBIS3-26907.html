			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reproter Liu </F> Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149  1627)]    [Text] Beijing, 15 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng chaired  the fifth (enlarged) plenary session of the State Council this  afternoon to discuss the government work report (draft for  soliciting comments) to be submitted to the second session of  the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] for deliberation.    Li Peng said at the meeting that 1993 was a year in which  the  nation fully implemented the guidelines laid down by the 14th  national party congress and proceeded victoriously along the  course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; major  successes were achieved in reform, opening up, and  modernization; new situations appeared in work in all fields;  and the tasks which the first session of the Eighth NPC set for  the year were basically accomplished.    He said: The year 1994 is important for the national economy  to maintain its good developmental momentum and a year crucial  for expediting reform. On the basis of fully analyzing the  situations at home and abroad, the CPC Central Committee has  clearly defined the basic principle governing the work of the  whole party and the whole country. This principle is: Under  the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidance of the  party's basic line, we should fully implement the guidelines  laid down by the 14th national party congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; accelerate  the process of building a socialist market economic system;  maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic  development; maintain political stability; and expedite social  progress in all fields. The CPC Central Committee stressed that  seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to  the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining  stability are requirements of overall importance for the whole  party and the whole country. The State Council and governments  at all levels must clearly understand these requirements while  doing their work in all fields and must earnestly and properly  handle the relationship among reform, development, and  stability. We must continue to be firm in handling things in  two areas at the same time, namely: While concentrating our  efforts on promoting economic development and reform, we must  make positive efforts to develop science and technology  education and cultural services, intensify construction of  socialist spiritual civilization, and intensify construction of  a socialist democracy and legal system. This is also the basic  principle we followed while drafting the government work report.    Li Peng said: The government work report has been printed  and distributed to all departments, all relevant units, and all  provinces, municipalities, and regions to solicit their  comments. The purpose of doing so is to pool the ideas of all  quarters so that the government work report can embody the views  and wishes of all social circles, and so that the government  will be able to do its work more effectively.    During the meeting today, Wang Mengkui, deputy director of  the State Council Research Office and person in charge of the  government work report drafting panel, reported on the drafting  of the report.    Taking the floor one after another, Zhu Kaixuan, minister in  charge of the State Education Commission; Cao Qingze, minister  of supervision; Li Boyong, minister of labor; Wu Jiquan,  minister of posts and telecommunications; Liu Jiang, minister of  agriculture; Xu Youfang, minister of forestry; Chen Minzhang,  minister of public health; Lu Peijian, auditor general; Zhu Xun,  minister of geology and mineral resources; Hou Jie, minister of  construction; Shi Dazhen, minister of power industry; Gu  Xiulian, minister of chemical industry; and Wu Yi, minister of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, discussed the government  work report (draft for soliciting comments) and expressed their  views on places that need to be amended.    Zhu Rongji, Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Chi  Haotian,  Li Guixian, Chen Junsheng, Peng Peiyun, Luo Gan, and other State  Council members attended the meeting.    Responsible persons of relevant departments under the CPC  Central Committee, the State Council, the NPC, the National  Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, the Central Military Commission, the Supreme  People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate attended  the meeting as observers.

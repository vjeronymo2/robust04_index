			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / When bureaucrats are brought to book: The implications of a legal challenge to European Commission rulings As a headline, 'Brussels Slammed For Lack Of Bureaucracy' is from the same school as 'Man Bites Dog' - unexpected, unbelievable and eminently newsworthy. That was certainly the impact of last Thursday's unprecedented court decision condemning the European Commission for failing to apply all the red tape required by its own internal administrative rules. The EC's lower judicial body, the Court of First Instance (CFI), quashed the Ecu23.5m (Pounds 16.66m) fine levied on 14 of Europe's largest chemical companies in 1988 for operating a cartel in the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). As Brussels' work-hungry lawyers have been quick to realise, that could be only the beginning. Some believe that competition decisions going back years  -in particular, fines imposed on cartels and on companies which abused their dominant position - could be overturned on the same grounds. At the same time, the court judgment, the latest in a series of rulings criticising procedural faults, calls into question the way the increasingly powerful Brussels bureaucracy works. As one competition official put it following Thursday's ruling: 'No act of the Commission in the past 25 years has followed the procedure that the Court of First Instance would like us to follow.' Appeals based on Thursday's ruling would not be trivial. As the confidence of the Commission's competition directorate has grown under successive commissioners, Mr Peter Sutherland and Sir Leon Brittan, so have its punishments. They range from last week's Ecu750,000 fine on Aer Lingus, for a restrictive ticketing operation, to last July's record Ecu75m fine imposed on Tetra Pak, the Swiss-Swedish packaging group, for abusing its dominant position in the EC market. Since the 1960s, the Commission - now working at a rate of 8,000 decisions a year - has been taking short-cuts past its own strict internal rules. Those rules require official decisions, sometimes in all nine Community languages, to be signed by Mr Jacques Delors, the president, and Mr David Williamson, the Commission's secretary general. But to speed the process, Mr Delors and Mr Williamson routinely sign only the minutes of the meetings where such decisions are taken. Legally, according to the CFI, such decisions do not exist. The Commission, not surprisingly, is to challenge the CFI ruling in the European Court of Justice, the EC's highest judicial body. Whether every company ever fined by the Commission has a case is debatable. In theory, appeals against Commission decisions have to be lodged with the CFI within two months. But some lawyers argue that, if the original decision was 'non-existent', the deadline itself is meaningless. Some appeals are already under way. The two largest fines ever imposed by the Commission - the one on Tetra Pak, and the Ecu47m fine levied on Solvay of Belgium and ICI of Britain in 1990, for operating a cartel in the soda-ash market - are being challenged. Whether the latest CFI ruling becomes a factor in these cases will hinge on how far they have got. It will also depend on the extent to which the companies' lawyers are already using procedural arguments against the Commission. Individual circumstances will play an important part. In the case of the PVC cartel, the wider implications of the companies' successful appeal have been clouded by certain specific criticisms of the procedure relating to this decision. In an attempt to head off further appeals, the Commission is likely to seek a European Court ruling which supports its internal procedure even if it upholds criticisms specific to the PVC decision. There is no doubt, however, that for Sir Leon and the Commission's competition directorate - often attacked for their own legal nit-picking  - this is an embarrassment. In a speech last September on competition policy and procedures, Sir Leon, himself a lawyer, criticised companies for bringing complaints to the court which 'usually turn out on analysis to be no more than a procedural quibble', and urged them to concentrate on 'the substance of administrative justice'. But in the last month, the competition directorate has found itself at the wrong end of a string of judgments overturning Commission decisions on procedural technicalities. Most notably, the Commission's attempt to force British Aerospace to repay 'sweeteners' it received from the government as part of the purchase of Rover, the UK car company, was overturned. Such judgments have hinged more on the court's interpretation of the EC treaty's requirements. However, lawyers involved in the PVC case suggested last week that the CFI was equally fed up with Brussels bureaucrats flouting their own rules, even for good reasons such as efficiency and confidentiality. As the CFI itself said in its ruling: 'All those formal requirements governing the drawing up, adoption and authentication of measures are necessary in order to guarantee the stability of the legal order and legal certainty for those subject to measures adopted by Community institutions.' Competition officials in Brussels are exasperated by what they see as the court's pernickety attitude. 'We are talking about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin here,' said one. But as most EC lawyers are quick to point out, if the Commission cannot abide by legal technicalities, why should the companies which submit to its decisions?</p>

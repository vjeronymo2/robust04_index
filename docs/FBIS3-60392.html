			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sean Ryan, environment correspondent: "Toxic </F> Cocktail Killing North Sea Dolphins"]    [Text] The wildlife of the North Sea, one of Europe's most  diverse habitats, is under increasing threat from a build-up of  pollution that is killing dolphins, seals and countless birds.    The most comprehensive study of the sea, undertaken by  leading scientists from the eight countries surrounding it, has  found that concentrations of toxic chemicals are high enough to  cause tumours and breeding failures across a wide range of  species.    Ministers from all the countries concerned meet in  Copenhagen  this week to consider the conclusions of the Quality Status  Report of the North Sea, which took six years to complete and is  regarded as a conservative analysis of the impacts of pollution.    They are expected to respond with measures to curb illegal  dumping of oil from ships, pesticide pollution and over-fishing.    Conservationists warned that marine wildlife was facing  disaster in "a synthetic soup of chemicals" because governments  had failed to meet anti-pollution targets set three years ago.  Dr Sian Pullen, of the World Wide Fund for Nature, said action  so far had failed to reverse decades of deterioration. "The  commercial and environmental losses are enormous," he said.    The study, to which Britain contributed more than &pound;5m,  says mammals are particularly at risk from thousands of  industrial chemicals that accumulate in body fat after getting  into the sea from rivers, waste tips and the air. Some,  including polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs), are thought to  suppress immunity to disease and damage ovaries.    Poisonous waste metals such as mercury have attacked the  kidneys and livers of minke whales, bottle-nosed dolphins and  grey and common seals. Tens of thousands of sea birds are also  dying each year in oil slicks from rigs and ships' tanks. Dr  Nancy Harrison, of the Royal Society for the Protection of  Birds, said: "Accidents make headlines, but chronic oil  pollution is the biggest danger to wildlife and the health of  the sea."    Some of the most startling impacts have been recorded in  fish. Contamination by tributyl tin, a highly-toxic component of  paints used on ships' hulls, has triggered sex changes in  whelks, often miles from shipping routes.    Vast numbers of cod have developed tumours on their gills  because of general chemical pollution and food and poisoning  from shellfish, including mild paralysis, is on the increase:  the report blames sewage.    Dr John Huthnance, a leading British oceanographer, said the  North Sea was especially vulnerable to pollution because it was  largely landlocked. Chemicals that might disappear in six weeks  in other seas could linger there for two years.    The study warns that fertilisers seeping into the sea from  rivers and underground channels have contributed to high levels  of phosphorous and nitrogen, which have fed blooms of toxic  algae.    The Thames Humber, Tees and Tyne are all identified as  important sources of industrial pollution. Metals swept  downriver sink into sediments where they are absorbed by tiny  organisms and gradually work their way up the food chain.    Britain's pollution record has been fiercely criticised by  other North Sea countries, particularly in Scandinavia, who  pride themselves on their environmental performance. They are  expected to complain this week that Britain has fallen behind  targets set for curbing several pesticides. The use of  dichlorvos -- one of the most toxic chemicals -- to deal with  lice on fish farms was due to be cut by half between 1985 and  1995, but has so far increased.    In Copenhagen, however, Britain is expected to accuse  Denmark  of taking grossly excessive catches of fish. The report says  that up to 40&percnt; of all commercial species by weight are  hauled  out of the sea each year. More than half the adult cod and  haddock in the North Sea were netted between 1986 and 1990, a  rate described as impossible to sustain.    Tim Yeo, the environment minister, said he regarded  excessive  spraying of pesticides on roadsides and railway embankments as  one of the priorities for the conference. "We are committed to  reducing their use to the absolute minimum," he said.</p>

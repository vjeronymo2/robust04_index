			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Bullion bounces from three-month low - Market Report The GOLD price touched a fresh three-month low in London yesterday before bouncing in line with a steadying New York market. US prices had opened lower and at the afternoon fix the London price was set at Dollars 375.30 a troy ounce. But trade buying and short covering, encouraged, traders said, by a drop in bond and stock prices, reversed the New York trend and London responded with a rally to Dollars 379.55 an ounce, up Dollars 3.55 on the day. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER prices surrendered Tuesday's advance after displaying an 'inability to overcome Dollars 1,920 (for three months delivery)' that one trader suggested might be a signal for 'a downward retracement'. Upside potential had also been dampened by a widening of the cash discount against three months metal from Dollars 15.50 to Dollars 20.50 a tonne. London Commodity Exchange COCOA and COFFEE futures ended their recent uptrends as no fresh fundamental news appeared to underpin those gains. Compiled from Reuter</p>

			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Sport: Fleet gathers for exquisite torture - Sailing Sydney Harbour on Boxing Day will host the largest fleet of yachts ever assembled for a long ocean race. With 380 boats, the entry for the 50th running of the Sydney-Hobart classic is more than double the highest previous entry. The previous biggest fleet in the Sydney-Hobart was a mere 179 yachts in 1985. To cope with the number of competitors on the water, the race committee is running four starts: the two groups of veteran yachts from 20 and 30 years ago will leave the shelter of the Harbour 30 minutes before the traditional 1pm start. Heading the fleet will be 15 of the world's fastest and most powerful maxi-yachts, their sights fixed on breaking the record for the 630-mile course and taking race sponsor Kodak's Pounds 50,000 prize. 'To collect the cash, the first yacht must cross the line before 3.36am on December 29 to break Kialoa's 1975 record of two days 14 hours 36 minutes,' said race chairman Bill Sherman of the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia. Among those with the best chance is the British-owned Longobarda, 80ft long and pride of City property man Mike Slade, but under charter for this race to a Tasmanian syndicate called The Dairy Farmers. Chris Law, a regular at the wheel of Longo-Bongo, will helm. Alan Bond, the disgraced entrepreneur, is likely to be following the race with interest. In 1989 he built a maxi named Drumbeat with the aim of smashing Kialoa's record, but never managed it. Under her new name Congere, the US-owned maxi is one of the favourites. However, she will have to get past the Whitbread twins. New Zealand Endeavour, 1994 Whitbread race winner in the maxi-class, and Yamaha, W60 winner, are competing. Both are designed more for a marathon than a sprint but could do well. Among the new yachts the 66ft pocket-maxi Exile is attracting most interest. Designed by the Reichel / Pugh team which secured the 1992 America's Cup for Bill Koch, Exile has a radical construction. Almost everything in the hull and on deck is in carbon fibre, even the twin steering wheels and the pedestal winches. The keel is of stainless steel and the towering four-spreader mast of aluminium. Owner Warwick Miller has been repaid well for his expense. On her first outing in early December, Exile blitzed much bigger yachts and took line honours in the Cruising Yacht Club's short ocean race. When the first fleet sailed for Hobart in 1945, there were just nine competing yachts. Two of these, Archina and Winston Churchill have been completely refitted and will be racing again next week. The instigator and winner of that first race was a British naval officer, Captain John Illingworth. In his 36ft Rani, he took both line honours and first place on corrected time. This feat was not equalled until 1972. Britain's best year was undoubtedly 1969, in the 25th anniversary race. The late Sir Max Aitken's boat Crusade was first to finish and took line honours, a victory accorded some prominence in the Daily Express of the day. Edward Heath, shortly to win the 1970 general election and become prime minister, won on handicap at the helm of Morning Cloud. For three days they had a dream ride down the coast, holding the same spinnaker for 67 hours. Then came a savage storm that had Heath and crew desperately bailing with buckets as the bilge pumps failed. Then came a nail-biting drifting finish up the estuary into Hobart. Morning Cloud was the last British yacht to win the Sydney-Hobart, although four years ago there was a huge controversy when the Whitbread maxi Rothmans was disqualified and lost the race after a row over sponsorship. After a stormy and exhilarating ride across the Bass Strait, Rothmans, skippered by Lawrie Smith had shredded several spinnakers and the only one left intact was a small kite with the sponsor's logo prominent - against the Sydney-Hobart rules to use. It was miles from land so there was no promotional value in flying the sail and Smith warned the race committee by radio that he was about to do so, but the breach was spotted by a photographer in a press aircraft and the damage was done. If records are to be broken this year, the fleet will need a north-easterly breeze and come out of Sydney Heads under spinnaker, holding the kites for the next 48 hours or more. It is a relatively rare weather pattern for New South Wales, hence the longevity of Kialoa's record. At least as likely is the famed 'southerly-buster', which produces big seas in the formidable Bass Strait between the mainland and Tasmania and an on-the-nose gale. The other exquisite form of torture for competitors is the routine calms and zephyrs in the sheltered estuary of the Derwent River which meanders nearly 20 miles from the open sea to Hobart. In many races, leaders have stormed to the mouth of the Derwent and then crept up-river, being overtaken by smaller, lighter rivals.</p>

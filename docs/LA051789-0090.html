The John Young and the cruiser Gridley "spotted the  craft about 1 a.m. (Philippine time) while en route from Singapore to Subic Bay  in the Philippines," said Lt. Cmdr. Bob Anderson of the Pacific Fleet. "Upon  investigation, the refugee craft was determined to be unseaworthy -- without  propulsion and navigation equipment," Anderson said. The 28 men and 18 women  were taken aboard the John Young and transported to Subic Bay Naval Base.  </P></p>

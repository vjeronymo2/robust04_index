			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Consumers more confident, says poll Consumers have become more confident about their financial position and about the economy over the past month, according to a Gallup poll for the European Commission. The monthly poll finds that 28 per cent of respondents expect the economic situation to improve, as opposed to 29 per cent who believe it will worsen. This negative balance of 1 per cent marks an upturn from the balance of minus 6 per cent recorded in July and is the most optimistic result since January. Asked about their own financial position, a balance of 8 per cent expected it to worsen over the next 12 months. However, this represents an increase in optimism over July, when the balance was minus 17 per cent. Consumer confidence had deteriorated in the early months of the year, a development which many believed was caused by fears about the impact of tax increases.</p>

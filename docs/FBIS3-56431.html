This was stated by  Yegor Gaydar at a meeting with journalists today. He added that  he cannot be in the government and in opposition to it at the  same time. [passage omitted]    At the same time, Yegor Gaydar spoke out for continuing to  work with the Government. Touching upon the question of  personalities, the leader of the "Russia's Choice" also spoke  out for joining Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's government [as received].  [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 1214 GMT on 16 January, in a  similar item, renders this sentence as: "Gaydar came out for  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy to join the government."]    The leader of the "Russia's Choice" told journalists that he  spoke with Boris Yeltsin on 13 January before making his  decision not to join the new Government.    Yegor Gaydar said that he intends to "concentrate his  attention on work in the State Duma." He noted that in this  connection "Russia's Choice" intends to do everything possible  not to allow representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party to  join the key committees of the lower chamber -- that is the  committees for defense, security, and international policy.</p>

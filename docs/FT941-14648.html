			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Elf earnings plunge to FFr1.1bn Elf Aquitaine, the French oil group to be privatised within the next few weeks, yesterday announced a sharp drop in net profits last year to FFr1.1bn (Dollars 186.4m) from FFr6.2bn in 1992. The results, in line with forecasts made last year by Mr Philippe Jaffre, chairman, included net exceptional charges of FFr2bn. These were largely the result of a write-down in some oil and gas assets, mainly in the North Sea, restructuring costs in the group's chemicals activities and charges against some financial investments. The charges partly reflect Mr Jaffre's policy of cleaning up the accounts and disposing of non-core financial assets ahead of privatisation. The government is due to launch the sale of most of its 51 per cent stake within the next few days. The privatisation of Elf, the largest operation so far in the government's plans to sell 21 publicly owned groups, is expected to raise between FFr35bn and FFr40bn. Analysts in Paris are forecasting a price of about FFr380 a share, compared with yesterday's closing price of FFr408. The government is planning to retain about 13 per cent of the shares in Elf, with a further 10 per cent of the group's shares to be reserved by a core of stable shareholders. These are expected to include some of the country's largest financial and industrial groups, such as Union des Assurances de Paris and Renault. Analysts argue that investors are likely to be encouraged by the prospect of a recovery in profits at Elf this year. But they caution that improvement will be gradual given the weak state of the European economy and the fact that the oil price remains below Dollars 14 per barrel for the benchmark Brent crude. In 1993, according to Elf: 'The worsening economic situation, particularly in Europe and the steep drop in crude oil weighed heavily on the group.' Refining margins increased slightly, from Dollars 2.8 a barrel to just over Dollars 3 during the year, but excess capacity, depressed demand and intense competition in marketing continued to affect the sector. In chemicals, prices were depressed by reduced demand, while the group's healthcare and pharmaceuticals division was affected by cuts in public health spending. The result of these various factors was a fall in operating profits to FFr6.5bn last year from FFr12bn in 1992. Turnover rose to FFr210bn from FFr200.6bn in 1992. The group said it would maintain its dividend at FFr13 per share. The debt burden increased, partly as a result of acquisitions and increased investments. Lex, Page 20</p>

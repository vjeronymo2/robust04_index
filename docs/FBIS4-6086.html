			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yasuhiro Murota, chief researcher of the Japan </F> Economic Research Center: "On the Center's Forecast of Japan's  Economic Structure in 2010: Make Reform To Prevent System  Fatigue; Enterprises Should Also Attach Importance to Earnings  and Face Up to the Work of Breaking Through Resource and  Environment Restraints"]    [Text] 1. The Japanese economy will step into a  period of maturity but it will still be able to achieve an  average growth rate of 3.5 percent in the first 10 years of the  21st century. However, this is premised on the realization of  various system reforms such as financial reform, the opening of  the market, and decentralization.    2. Under such circumstances, enterprises will be  pressed to shift from conventional management that places  emphasis only on sales to management that places emphasis on  earnings from creating new markets. In addition, for future  enterprise strategies, it is useful to fully utilize business  econometrics that connects macro economics and individual  enterprise's micro numerals (financial statements, etc.).    3. By the time 2010 arrives, the "wall of 2030," that  is, global-scale resource and environment restraints will come  in sight. Japan should tackle these tasks by making the most of  its high economic power and technical capability.    The 21st century is close at hand as we are now about  halfway  through the 1990's. By the year 2000, what will become of  Japan's economic structure?  <H5>  3.5-Percent Growth Possible if Reform Implemented </H5>   Japan will face the following two tasks in this period.  First is what Japan, whose economy steps from adolescence to  maturity should do to avoid contracting the so-called advanced  nations disease (the high unemployment rate, twin deficits,  etc.). The second is how Japan, which has now become a leading  economic power in the world, should relate itself to the running  of the future world economy.    The center has reached the conclusion that Japan will still  be able to achieve 3.5-percent growth in the 2000's without  contracting the advanced-nations disease, provided that  necessary system reforms are implemented.    Japan will have to make the best use of this economic power  to actively face up to the tasks of the world economy, including  the reduction of gaps between the North and the South. In this  case, the 1990's will serve as a period of reform for such tasks  to be put on track.    By setting up a computing system suited for the long-term  economic forecast, we have carried out various simulations. This  system is a distributed-type simulator enabling a PC-based  dialogue, and it is made up of three parts--the data base, the  model computation (the econometric model, the inter-industry  relations table, etc.) and the output unit (printing, AV  [audiovisual], etc.).    At first, we sought upper and lower limits of the growth  trajectory of the future Japanese economy. The upper limit  represents the continuation of the same growth as has been made  thus far (average growth rate of 4.6 percent by the year 2000  as was recorded in 1975 through 1990), and the lower limit  represents a case in which Japan lapses into the  advanced-nations disease (the average growth rate of 1.5  percent). As a result, we have learned that either case carries  its problems.    First, in case of high growth, the Japanese economy cannot  but continue its dependance on foreign demands, thereby becoming  the sole winner in the world. Its current account surplus will  reach as much as $300 billion by the year 2010. Even if part of  the surplus is applied toward aid, international friction with  various countries will intensify.    Moreover, concerning the environmental issue, carbon  dioxides  (CO[.sub]2[/]) emission will increase by 10 percent over  1990, making it impossible to abide by Japan's international  commitment to "stabilize the amount of emissions by the year  2000."    On the other hand, in case of low growth, there will be a  burst of economic issues such as the rising unemployment rate (a  little under 5 percent by 2010), the hollowing out of the  industrial structure, and twin deficits (fiscal and  international payments deficits).  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     Then, would there be no way to avoid the advanced-nations  disease and at the same time to coexist with other countries?  We have conducted various simulations to search this  feasibility, and as a result we found that system fatigue must  be eliminated by carrying out the following reforms:    1) Establish healthy finances through restraints on spending  and the innovations of the tax system and annuities. 2) Promote  "decentralization" by shifting all activities from  unipolarization in Tokyo to key cities (hereafter referred to as  local "decentralization"). 3) Facilitate women's social  participation by improving nurseries and increasing part-time  jobs. 4) Open the market to foreign countries. 5) Revitalize  industries and restore agriculture by means of multimedia as a  driving force.    As a result of such system reforms, the Japanese economy,  which is to achieve a growth rate of 3.5 percent by the year  2000 will assume the following aspects.  <H5>  Need for Enterprises To Cultivate Markets </H5>   1. The Japanese economy will assume a domestic  demand-oriented growth. This is attributed to: growth in durable  consumer goods and leisure time-related consumption due to  decentralization, annuity expansion, and the increase in leisure  time; and purchasing houses will become much easier due to local  decentralization (in key local cities, the price of a house  will be about five to seven times annual earnings).    2. The leading industry will be that of information such as  PC's, electronics, and communications devices in terms of both  hardware and software.    The realization of multimedia is the key to the development  of the information industry in the future. We explored the  possibility in the information industry by introducing  multimedia in this forecast system.    For example, reports on this project are distributed by  means  of video, and their details are outputted directly from the  database and the computing system.    On the other hand, the automobile industry, the leading  industry at present, will reach maturity. Domestic production  will go down to about 9 million cars (of which, 4 million are to  be exported) by 2010. In addition, as for agriculture, there is  a need to actively restore agriculture in terms of food  security, particularly when there is the possibility that the  United States will decrease its export of agricultural products  in the future. Rice production by the year 2010 is estimated to  be 12 million tons.    3. Finances will go into the black through restraints on  spending, and the innovations of the tax system and the annuity  system. Meanwhile, the current account will also acquire a  balance.    That is, the balance of trade will go into the red, and this  deficit will be offset by invisible trade surplus. This means  that products are imported and earnings are made through  investment. The transfer payments will continue to be in the red  to a large extent because of assistance to developing countries,  etc. In our study, we set the change in business behavior as our  central subject. All the enterprises had to do in the past was  secure the growth of sales in step with the high growth of the  Japanese economy. This linked to the assurance of their  long-term profits.  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     However, when the economy attains maturity, because of a  rise  in the cost of raw materials and personal expenses, enterprises  will find it hard to secure sufficient profits by simply keeping  step with the macro growth.    Accordingly, it becomes important for future enterprises to  cultivate profitable markets by themselves. In short, importance  should be shifted from sales to earnings.    Whenever one studies such an issue, it is important to build  business behavioral models. Since the beginning of the 1980's, a  field called business econometrics has developed in the United  States, and econometric model-building on business structure is  in progress.    However, such a move is sluggish in Japan. In this forecast,  using business econometrics, we tried to obtain forecast  numerical values based on macroeconomics and inter-industrial  relations. We also sought to consolidate financial statements  (P/L--the profit and loss statement and B/S--the balance sheet).    First, we built P/L and B/S models on an all-industry basis  (corporate business statistics) and then models on each industry  basis (electric machines, transport equipment, construction,  retail, iron and steel).    In working out a long-range management plan, each enterprise  has thus far separated the forecasting sector, which estimates  sales, etc. on the basis of macroeconomic predictions, and the  financial sector dealing with P/L and B/S. Therefore, it appears  that the contacts between the two sectors have not always been  smooth within an enterprise.    This is where the Japanese enterprises compare quite poorly  with their U.S. counterparts. In order for Japanese enterprises  to lead the world economy in the future, they require a  philosophy regarding future management of the world economy and  business strategies which indicate the philosophy in concrete  and fixed quantities. The full utilization of business  econometrics will be indispensable for putting this into  practice.  <H5>  Resources and Environment Are To Restrain Prosperity </H5>   Our business analysis through this method revealed several  mooted points with regard to a conventional break-even analysis  largely adopted in conventional P/L analysis. That is, the  linear hypothesis on the cost function and an arbitrary  classification of fixed and variable costs, on which the current  analysis is premised, have mooted points, and, in essence, the  analysis is possible only by using the model we worked out  herein.    For example, the break-even point of "all industries" is 85  percent by 2010 under the conventional method, but it is 68  percent according to our model. This smaller percentage for our  model is because the gradual rise in the cost curve is clearly  reflected and because fixed and variable parts are distinguished  in all items. This alone indicates that the break-even analysis  of the conventional type has many mooted points.    In this context, if necessary reforms in various fields are  carried out, Japan will be able to attain considerable  prosperity and fulfill its appropriate role in the management of  the global economy by the year 2000.    Will Japan be able to continue its prosperity for long  thereafter as well? We cannot necessarily have an optimistic  view in this regard. This is because by the year 2010, "the  wall of the year 2030" (the actualization of the resource and  environment restraints on a global scale) will come in sight  beyond the horizon.    First, with regard to resources, the exhaustion of oil will  become a problem. According to our calculation, the RP ratio  [given by dividing reserves by annual consumption) will be 31 by  2010, but it will go down as low as 14 by 2030.    That is, the reserves will meet only 14 years of  consumption. Reflecting this, the oil export dependence rate on  the Middle East will reach as high as 65 percent, a critical  level, by 2010.    Moreover, turning to the environment issue, there is a  fairly  high possibility that the atmospheric temperature will begin to  rise around 2030 unless effective measures are taken to restrain  CO[.sub]2[/] emissions.    The ozone layer destruction is a more impending problem. An  agreement has already been made on the disuse of specific and  alternative fluorocarbons among the Montreal Protocol  signatories; the use of alternative fluorocarbons, however, will  continue for refrigerators, etc., for some time. Some  alternative fluorocarbons have large short-term ozone layer  destruction effects, and the warming-up effects of the  alternative fluorocarbons are several hundred and several  thousand times as great as CO[.sub]2[/]. A campaign launched  in some quarters to retrieve them is hardly expected to be a  cure-all.    Accordingly, if the present situation continues, it is  strongly possible that in the near future an ozone hole will be  created in the northern hemisphere as well and that the  intensity of ultraviolet rays on the Earth's surface will  increase in Europe, the United States, Japan, and elsewhere in  the northern hemisphere.    How could we best cope with these problems? This is the very  task that Japan should tackle by taking advantage of its  economic affluence, powerful production means, and technology by  2010.

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: Police probe Perrier stake sale FRENCH police have been called in to investigate suspected irregularities over the sale of a stake in Perrier, the mineral water group, to Saint Louis, the sugar group which is allied to Italy's Agnelli family. Mr Hubert Gasztowtt, a legal official of the French public prosecutor's office, yesterday told the Paris commercial court a preliminary inquiry into possible 'penal infractions' had been handed to the fraud squad. Legal officials said that the investigators would be looking for evidence of insider trading. This latest twist in the increasingly bitter struggle for control of Perrier came on the first day of one of two court cases in which Nestle, the Swiss food multinational, is seeking to reduce the Agnellis' stake. An Agnelli holding company launched an agreed bid for Exor, a French holding company owning 35 per cent of the water group, late last year. The subsequent purchase of more Perrier shares by Saint Louis allowed the Agnelli camp to lift its stake in the water company to 49 per cent, only days ahead of a hostile FFr13.4bn (Dollars 2.3bn)bid for Perrier from Nestle four weeks ago. The Swiss group's chances of success hinge largely on its winning at least one of the legal cases. Nestle met an initial setback yesterday when the public prosecutor advised the Paris court to uphold the sale of a 13.8 per cent stake in Perrier to Saint Louis, alleged by the Swiss group's lawyers to be 'fraudulent.' Nestle claims the sale should be annulled because Perrier and Saint-Louis both knew that the Swiss company was about to bid for the mineral water group and at a higher price. Mr Gasztowtt said that an inquiry by the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the stock market watchdog, showed there was no proof that Mr Jacques Vincent, Perrier's chairman, knew about the impending Nestle bid at the time, so the sale to Saint Louis should be valid. The case appeared to swing back in Nestle's favour when Mr Gasztowtt announced the police inquiry into the conditions of the transaction. The Paris court,which is free to choose whether to follow the prosecutor's recommendations, is to issue its judgment on March 16. Nestle's other legal attack is in Nimes, near Perrier's main plant in southern France, where it has challenged Exor's voting rights on its 35 per cent stake in Perrier. The public prosecutor has advised the Nimes court to reduce the voting rights of Exor and its allies to 20 per cent for two years. A decision from Nimes is expected on March 6.</p>

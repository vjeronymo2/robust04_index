			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent He Jingsong (6320 0513 2646)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- To keep pace with the  development of the socialist market economy and to focus on  economic construction, the China Institute for Workers'  Ideological and Political Work has been exploring new ways and  means to carry out ideological and political work. Its efforts  have promoted the development of ideological and political work  within enterprises, have stabilized the workers' ranks, and have  deepened reform and development.    To improve and intensify enterprises' ideological and  political work, over the past two years the institute has  dispatched eight groups to investigate nearly 100 enterprises  along open coastal areas and in certain provinces and cities;  their findings have helped enterprises build stronger party  organizations and make decisions on carrying out ideological and  political work. Recently, the institute also organized the  fifth and sixth national seminars on enterprises' ideological  and political work in order to exchange experiences on studying  theories of market economy, and called a symposium in Shenzhen  to study and discuss the relationship between enterprises'  cultural work and ideological and political work in an effort to  guide political workers to move out from their "small circles"  [xiao xun huan 1420 1789 3883] of ideological and political work  and step into the "large circles" of economic construction,  reform, and opening up; the symposium also helped the vast  number of political workers change their mind sets and improve  proficiency so they can meet the requirements of the  transformation period as quickly as possible.    According to a person in charge of the institute, the  institute will continue to employ its resources for doing  ideological and political work for enterprise development. He  said members of his institute will serve party committees and  governments at various levels as advisers, providing them with  investigative findings and relevant information. He said the  institute will soon carry out studies on the modern enterprise  system as well as ideological and political work, and on  ideological and political work in joint ventures and village and  town enterprises. He added that efforts will be made to produce  significant research results in one or two areas. Meanwhile,  the institute will improve its service for grass-roots units,  will intensify doing ideological and political work and  propagating public opinion, and will provide the grassroots with  more effective guidance in accordance with the actual conditions  of grass-roots enterprises.</p>

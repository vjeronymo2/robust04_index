			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Studies for an exercise in containment / The limited scope for reducing the pressure on education spending THE EDUCATIONAL issue facing the Portillo public spending review is not how to cut the bill, but how to stop it shooting through the roof. Education will this year cost the Exchequer more than Pounds 30bn (the pie chart gives figures for England only, and local authorities will spend more than government estimates). Yet all the pressures are for spending to rise exponentially: 16-year-olds are staying on at school or college in unprecedented numbers, with politicians campaigning in unison for still more to do so. In 1987 less than half of all 16-year-olds remained in full-time education. This year three quarters are doing so and more than four in five are expected to stay on within three years. Although the trend is partly influenced by the recession, most observers believe a cultural shift is afoot and that staying on will soon be the norm among all social groups, not only the professional classes. The rate of increase is as rapid at university level. In 1991 the Department for Education projected that by 2000 one in three 18-year-olds would be going on to higher education. It now expects that target to be reached in the next three years and has just imposed quotas on vice-chancellors to prevent the target being reached sooner. The government's campaign to persuade schools to abandon local-authority control and seek grant-maintained status is costing it dear. Only 337 of England's 21,000 schools have yet opted out but getting that figure to 1,500 by the middle of next year is a top political priority for Mr John Patten, education secretary. To encourage them to opt out, grant-maintained schools get special bonuses in revenue and capital funding. The government is concerned about the funding implications when more schools have opted out, but to prevent momentum flagging Mr Patten has promised that the new central funding formula for grant-maintained schools, to be introduced over the next two years, will leave virtually all better off than they now are under local-authority control. The only compensatory savings on offer are from Mr Patten's promised assault on surplus places in schools. But in recent months he has almost halved the number he thinks he can eliminate, and with rising rolls and the inevitable concessions to parents of small schools in marginal constituencies, even that target may prove illusory. Anyway, set against the spending pressures the sum involved -  about Pounds 150m -  is chicken-feed. So what is to be done? At the school level, radical options for user-charges, or means-tested vouchers of the kind once favoured by the Adam Smith Institute -  but by few others even on the right wing - have been ruled out. Mr Major is simply not prepared to send out bills for school fees and the practical difficulties in the way of means-tested vouchers are of poll-tax dimensions. At university level the field is more open. Having burnt its fingers on the issue in the mid-1980s, in 1991 the government abandoned ideas for making students pay means-tested fees. Instead, the state continues to pay fees direct to universities for all first-degree students, irrespective of parents' income. Mr Portillo could review that. The Labour party is considering plans for charging fees to the better off. The education department already has a student-loan scheme for living expenses in place and machinery for assessing parental income, which is used to determine maintenance grants, which are being gradually replaced by loans. With the total bill for university fees at little more than Pounds 1.5bn, no bonanza is to be had from that source, however. On the face of it there is scope for retrenching on teachers' pay. After hefty increases in the past two years pay is no longer derisory. From this September a teacher midway up the salary scale will get Pounds 18,000 a year, with heads of large secondary schools eligible for up to Pounds 50,000. Recession and improved pay have given the classroom a new appeal. Teacher-training colleges are swamped with applications and the proportion of vacancies fell three quarters in two years. Regional pay could be on the agenda. Vacancy rates in Wales, the Midlands and the south-west are barely half those in London. In the Yorkshire area, the north and north-west they are a third or lower. But since pay cuts would create uproar, only a sharp rise in inflation would enable sizeable differentials to be introduced soon. No wonder Mr Patten agreed to the Portillo review so willingly. With most of his budget politically out-of-bounds, its most likely result will be to give the Treasury imprimatur to his steep upward spending curves. Unless, that is, the government wants to risk a poll tax on children.</p>

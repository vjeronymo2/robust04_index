			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Asset sales help Wharf to 44% rise in profits THE Wharf (Holdings), the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of the late Sir Y. T. Pao, yesterday announced a 44 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 1.38bn (USDollars 178m) for the six months ended June. Operating profit was boosted by a HKDollars 478m pre-tax profit from the sale of the International Bank of Asia building and a portion of Wharf Cable Tower. Wharf has interests in infrastructure, transport and communications, but has recently focused on enhancing returns from its land bank. The company will complete 9m square feet of new property within the next four years, compared with its existing 7m sq ft of investment property. Next month, Wharf's giant Times Square retail and office project will open. The company estimates the property will provide a recurrent income stream of HKDollars 700m at current market prices.</p>

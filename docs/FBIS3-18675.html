The move was seen as an attempt to placate Unionists  following their threat earlier this week to boycott cross-border  talks on the future of Northern Ireland, though the committee  was promised several months ago. But it angered Ulster's  nationalists and also threatened a row between the Government  and Labour over who sits on the parliamentary body. Mr Tony  Newton, Commons leader, tabled a motion for debate next week  setting up the committee -- which has long been sought by  Unionists and was suspected to be at the centre of a deal with  Mr Major last summer to secure support over Europe.    On the same day, the Commons will be asked to give its  annual  approval for renewing the Prevention of Terrorism Act -- which  will again put Labour on the spot as it opposes the legislation.    Ever since direct rule was imposed in 1972, Unionists have  objected to the way Northern Ireland business is handled at  Westminster without any effective monitoring by MPs.    The Government had resisted a select committee for Northern  Ireland, fearing it would degenerate into a sectarian squabble.  But ministers have judged the time is now right to establish  the group to bolster recent efforts to broker a settlement among  the political parties.    Nationalists have long harboured suspicions about a select  committee, which they see as an attempt to tie Northern Ireland  closer to the Union and cutting across efforts to win an agreed  settlement among all the parties.    Mr Seamus Mallon deputy leader of the SDLP [Social  Democratic  and Labor Party], said in the Commons yesterday that the  committee was being imposed against the wishes of a substantial  group of MPs.    Ministers, however, do not anticipate any boycott of the  committee, though they envisage fierce arguments over the  composition. The Government wants an overall majority, in  keeping with the convention that select committees should  reflect the balance of power in the Commons. But with none of  the main parties represented in Northern Ireland, the issue has  become complicated.    The committee is to have 13 members -- six Conservatives two  Labour, two Ulster Unionists, one Democratic Unionist, one  Nationalist SDLP and Sir James Kilfedder, the lone Popular  Unionist, who could be chairman and would ordinarily vote on the  Government side.    Labour is unhappy with such a balance, arguing that it  breaches all the rules of select committee composition set down  since 1979. They also want the chairmanship. A possible  compromise could be a 15-strong committee, retaining an overall  Government majority but giving Labour more seats.    The Government disputes any suggestion that the select  committee cuts across the three-strand talks process it is still  pursuing despite recent setbacks.    Earlier this week, Mr James Molyneaux, Ulster Unionist  leader, said that he did not see any future in talks involving  Dublin and that he wanted to concentrate on winning agreement  for new forms of government in the province.    However, he has not broken off contact with the Government  and further meetings are planned between the Unionists and Mr  Michael Ancram, Northern Ireland Minister, who is trying to find  common ground. Realistically, ministers do not expect any  movement on the talks process until after the European election  on June 9.</p>

The enforcement discretion would permit NNECO to operate Millstone Unit 2 while the proposed amendment is being processed. Millstone Unit 2 was scheduled to begin its refueling outage on October 1, and to enter Mode 5 on October 3, 1994. On September 23, 1994, NNECO discovered that Type B and C containment leak rate tests for certain containment penetrations had not been performed within the 24 months as required by SR 4.6.1.2.d. The specific Action Statement for LCO 3.6.1.2. applies and requires that containment integrity to be restored within 1 hour or place the plant in hot standby within the next 6 hours, and in cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. Since SR 4.6.1.2.d was inadvertently missed, SR 4.0.3 was invoked at approximately 1 p.m. on September 23, 1994. This SR permits the action requirements to be delayed for up to 24 hours to permit the completion of a missed surveillance when the allowable outage time limits of the action requirements are less than 24 hours. Since the Type C test cannot be performed while at power and the Type B tests that have exceeded the 24-month period cannot be completed within the 24-hour window, Millstone Unit 2 would have been forced to shutdown to comply with the requirements of the Millstone Unit 2 TS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC staff granted orally on September 24, 1994, NNECO's request for enforcement discretion associated with Action Statements of LCOs 3.6.1.1. and 3.6.1.2. to be effective until the proposed amendment would be issued. This enforcement discretion was confirmed by the NRC letter to NNECO dates September 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.91(a)(6) for amendment to be granted under exigent circumstances, the NRC staff must determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards (SHC) consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed changes do not involve a SHC because the changes would not: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications will extend the frequency for the Type B and C tests that were due between June 2 and September 1, 1994, to the end of the twelfth refueling outage. This change will allow Millstone Unit No. 2 to continue to operate until the plant conducts an orderly shutdown for the next refueling outage. This proposal does not modify the maximum allowable leakage rate at the calculated peak containment pressure, does not impact the design basis of the containment, and does not change the post-accident containment response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 8, 1988, NNECO conducted the first Type A test for the Millstone Unit No. 2 present 10-year service period. The test passed the ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' ILRTs. The ``As-Found'' leakage result was 0.201 weight percent per day and the ``As-Left'' leakage result was 0.138 weight percent per day. These values represent 53.6% of 36.8% of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification Limit of 0.75 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (0.375 weight percent per day, based on an L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  equal to 0.5 weight percent per day), respectively. The second Type A test for the present 10-year service period was conducted on December 24, 1992. The ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' ILRT results were 0.2809 and 0.2577 weight percent per day, respectively. This values represent 74.9% and 68.7% of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification limit of 0.75L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (0.375 weight percent per day, based on an L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  equal to 0.5 weight percent per day). In addition, as of December 1992, the total Type B and C ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' leakage results were 0.049 and 0.008 weight percent per day, respectively. These values represent 16.3% and 2.7% of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specification limit of 0.6 L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  (0.3 weight percent per day, based on an L <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  equal to 0.5 weight percent per day), respectively. The results of these tests demonstrate that Millstone Unit No. 2 has maintained control of containment integrity by maintaining a conservative margin between the acceptance criterion and the ``As-Found'' and ``As-Left'' leakage rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the past two refueling outages, there have been few failures of penetrations/values to pass their LLRTs. During the 1992 and 1990 refueling outages, there were a total of five failures (four in 1992 and one in 1990) of penetrations/valves to pass their LLRTs. Of these failures, only one (penetration 23/72 with valves MS&hyph;191B and MS&hyph;220B) was a repeat failure. This penetration was tested successfully approximately five months ago. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During Cycle 12, maintenance has been performed on several penetrations/valves. Their operability has been assured by the performance of post-maintenance LLRTs which demonstrated that the leakage from the penetrations/valves were within their acceptance criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the 48 Type B penetrations (electrical) and 21 Type C penetrations (valves) that are currently outside of the 24 month interval have each passed their last two ``As-Found'' tests, as a minimum. These results indicate that the penetration/valves are reliable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.2.1.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications will extend the frequency for the Type B and C tests that were due between June 2 and September 1, 1994, to the end of the twelfth refueling outage. This change will allow Millstone Unit No. 2 to continue to operate until the plant conducts an orderly shutdown for the next refueling outage. This proposal does not make any physical or operational changes to existing plant structures, systems, or components, does not modify the maximum allowable leakage rate at the calculated peak containment pressure, does not impact the design basis of the containment, and does not change the post-accident containment response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed changes do not modify the acceptance criteria for the Type A, B, or C tests. Maintaining the leakage through the containment boundary to the atmosphere within a specific value ensures that the plant complies with the requirements of 10CFR100. The containment boundary serves as an accident mitigator; it is not an accident initiator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the proposed change to Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.d of the Millstone Unit No. 2 Technical Specifications does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

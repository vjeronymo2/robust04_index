			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Ukraine issues warning on Start UKRAINE'S prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, warned yesterday that unless the west offered further inducements he would have a hard time selling the strategic arms reduction treaty (Start) to parliament. 'Ukraine is giving up its nuclear umbrella and in exchange we are receiving only advice, not real aid,' said Mr Kuchma, who was director of the world's largest missile factory before becoming prime minister last month. Ukraine has repeatedly promised to become a non-nuclear state and has already removed all tactical nuclear weapons from its territory. However, 176 inter-continental missiles (ICBMs) remain in Ukraine. The ICBMs are to be removed and dismantled through a complex process regulated by Start, the Lisbon protocol (which extended the bilateral Start treaty to include Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belorus) and the non-nuclear proliferation committee, all of which must be ratified by the legislature. Russia's parliament ratified the Start treaty yesterday with some reservation. 'I am for ratification but if we go to parliament with nothing it will be a fiasco for me and for the president,' Mr Kuchma told journalists. He said that Ukraine should get security guarantees and economic aid from the west in exchange for its historically unprecedented renunciation of nuclear weapons. Revealing the technical expertise which should make him a tough arms negotiator, Mr Kuchma also gave a detailed critique of the method for destroying the missile silos proposed by the US. Ukraine will shortly introduce the coupon and ignore cash currency, effectively taking the second most powerful former Soviet republic out of the rouble zone, said Mr Kuchma yesterday. The move is part of his broader effort to improve his republic's often hostile relationship with Russia, which has urged Ukraine to introduce a separate currency in order to shield Russia from Ukraine's spendthrift monetary policy. Mr Kuchma, who warned of impending economic disaster in Ukraine, said he would restrict the allocation of credit to faltering state enterprises and raise the central bank's discount lending rate to at least 50 per cent per year - at a time when inflation has exceeded that rate per month.</p>

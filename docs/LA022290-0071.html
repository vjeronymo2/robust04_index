			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> AGGRESSIVE VALLEY ROLLS TO WIN OVER PASADENA  </P> <P> The Valley College gym was unusually quiet during the Lady Monarchs'  first-round state basketball playoff game against Pasadena City College on  Wednesday night.  </P> <P> But the Valley women made a lot of noise on the court in routing Pasadena,  85-69, at Valley.  </P> <P> "We were aggressive on defense and were able to cause turnovers," Valley Coach  Doug Michelson said. "As a result, we were able to get high-percentage shots.  </P> <P> "We played hard and ran our offense well."  </P> <P> And executed in a dominating fashion from the opening tip-off.  </P> <P> Valley, the No. 2-seeded team in the Southern California regional, sealed  Pasadena's fate in the first half, racing to a 16-point lead with eight minutes  left.  </P> <P> The lead grew to 44-24 by the intermission.  </P> <P> Freshman guard Sylvia Casteneda led Valley with 16 points, 12 in the first  half. She also had five steals and five assists.  </P> <P> Sophomore forward Sandrine Rocher pulled down 14 rebounds.  </P> <P> "We were kind of sluggish at the beginning," said Angela Smith, a sophomore  from Reseda High who registered career-high totals of 13 points and 13  rebounds. "But we played great defense and came out with a lot more intensity  in the second half."  </P> <P> And while Valley was warming up, Pasadena was cooling down.  </P> <P> Valley (28-5), the Western State Conference co-champion, went on a 9-0 blitz to  expand its lead to 59-29 with 14 minutes 32 seconds to play, and then coasted.  </P> <P> Pasadena made a brief run, scoring 10 unanswered points in a four-minute span  to pull within 59-39, but never threatened again.  </P> <P> Cameron Inouye and Cara Vergo each scored 19 points for Pasadena (17-11), which  placed fourth in the South Coast Conference.  </P> <P> "We weren't surprised to win," Michelson said, "when you're the second seed,  playing the No. 15 seed, you expect to win."  </P> <P> Valley, the state runner-up last season, will meet Mt. San Antonio, a 61-48  winner over Southwestern, on Saturday. KIRBY LEE  </P></p>

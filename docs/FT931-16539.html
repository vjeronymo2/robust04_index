			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Observer: Signature trial Germany's habit of precipitating dramatic resignations over absurd events seems to be becoming a disease. Yesterday the presiding judge at the trial of Erich Honecker was forced to quit - for asking for an autograph. As if the weekend resignation of Jurgen Mollemann as economics minister were not enough - he was guilty of using his ministerial notepaper to promote a plastic token invented by a distant relative - the dismissal of Hansgeorg Brautigam from the bench in Berlin's criminal court number 700 surely takes the prize. The whole affair of the Honecker trial, at which the grim and grey dictator of the former East Germany stands accused of murder - for ordering his soldiers to shoot at his citizens trying to flee across the Berlin Wall - is rapidly turning into a tragi-comic chapter of accidents. Brautigam has been fighting a stern battle to keep the case going in the face of mounting evidence that the 80-year-old Honecker will die of liver cancer long before any verdict can be reached. He has rejected a string of efforts by the defence to have it called off. Yesterday they finally succeeded in proving he was 'biased'. He was found guilty, by a panel of fellow judges, of asking for an autograph from Honecker on behalf of a curious juror, and then pretending he had done nothing of the sort. Already, two co-defendants have been stood down from trial on the grounds of incapacity. The question remains whether a case billed as the most spectacular political trial since Nuremberg can survive this latest indignity.</p>

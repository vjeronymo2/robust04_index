			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UK Company News: Prestwick returns to the black with interim Pounds 81,000 PRESTWICK Holdings, the Ayr-based printed circuit board manufacturer, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 81,000 in the six months to January 31, compared with a loss of Pounds 741,000 in the comparable period of 1991. Turnover rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 13.9m, reflecting increased exports, mainly to EC countries, and contributions from acquisitions. Prestwick said that the costs associated with the new acquisitions and the costs of increasing production in the company's plants at Ayr and Irvine were being taken in the first half. 'We will continue with our strategy to create a broader-based interconnection group,' Mr Wayne Osman, chief executive, said. Many of the elements designed to give the company a significant competitive edge were now in place. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.5p, payable from fully diluted earnings of 0.4p (losses of 2.3p) per share.</p>

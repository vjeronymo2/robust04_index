			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT HELD AFTER ROCKS SMASH 5 CARS ON GOLDEN STATE  </P> <P> An Arleta man was arrested Friday for throwing softball- to watermelon-sized  rocks from an overpass above the Golden State Freeway, hitting at least five  cars and slightly injuring a teen-age boy, the California Highway Patrol  reported.  </P> <P> The suspect was held for CHP officers by an enraged motorist whose truck was  struck by a rock as it passed beneath Branford Street in Arleta. The motorist  said he ran across the freeway and up the incline to the overpass, and then  chased the suspect for a mile and a half.  </P> <P> David Colon, 29, was arrested on suspicion of throwing debris at cars on a  freeway, a felony, Officer Dennis Yates said.  </P> <P> "He was throwing rocks about the size of softballs off of the overcrossing and  at least five vehicles were damaged" in the southbound lanes, Yates said. "Some  had dents and some had broken windows." One of the rocks that crashed through a  windshield was the size of a small watermelon.  </P> <P> "There is no known motive at this time," Yates said.  </P> <P> Yates said a teen-age boy, whose name was unavailable, suffered a slight cut  from broken glass but did not need medical treatment.  </P> <P> The damaged cars pulled to the side of the freeway and traffic was not slowed,  Yates said.  </P> <P> Yates said at least two other men were throwing rocks from the overpass but got  away.  </P> <P> Terry Nichols, 50, of Mission Hills said he was a passenger in a pickup struck  on the hood by a rock. Nichols said when the driver pulled over, he saw a man  on the overpass "standing there with a big rock in his hand," and set out after  him.  </P> <P> "I figured if we tried to call the cops, by the time the cops got there, the  guy is going to be gone," Nichols said.  </P> <P> Crossing the freeway and dashing up an incline, he chased the fleeing man about  a mile and a half, Nichols said, catching him with the help of CalTrans workers  who saw the chase.  </P> <P> Yates said Colon was being held at the Van Nuys Jail.  </P></p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Alexandra Workwear lifts dividend by 47% Alexandra Workwear, the uniform supplier, yesterday increased its dividend by 47 per cent on the back of a substantial improvement in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 4.6m. Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said the increase marked a 'restoration of the dividend', which was cut in 1992 when the company fell into losses. The pay-out rose from 3.8p to 5.6p, including a 75 per cent increase in the final to 2.1p. For the first time in two years, the dividend was covered, with earnings rising from 3.5p to 9.5p. The improvement in profits was achieved on a 3 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 58.5m for the year to January 29. Mr Budd said gross margins had improved by two points to 44 per cent, due to a shift towards higher quality business. 'In previous years there was a need to get . . . volume at very low prices,' Mr Budd said. 'We are now seeing those strategic sales dropping out.' Profits also benefited from a sharp reduction in interest payments from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 800,000. Alexandra had reduced net debt from 46 per cent of shareholders' funds to 19 per cent last year.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLEXIBILITY FOR CONVENTIONAL CUTS;  </P> <P> EUROPE: EAST AND WEST ARE RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING MILITARY ISSUES  FROM INTERFERING WITH POLITICAL CHANGE, OR NEW SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS.  </P> <P> The bonhomie of the Malta meeting between George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev  underscored one key development of the new detente: Confrontation between the  Atlantic Alliance and the Warsaw Pact has effectively come to an end. But that  fact also contains an imperative to close the gap between decisive political  change and the persistence of the old military structures.  </P> <P> Most striking, the Warsaw Pact has ceased to be a viable military alliance,  although nearly 400,000 Soviet troops remain in East Germany. Lines of  communication between the Soviet Union and Germany are no longer guaranteed,  and the pact's political basis has collapsed.  </P> <P> By contrast, NATO's political cohesion sustains its military capacities. But  its doctrines are being hollowed out. Most obviously, the role of nuclear arms  in NATO strategy is under challenge. As recently as last May, for example, the  United States and Britain were pressing West Germany to accept deployment of a  new short-range nuclear missile. But when the Berlin Wall opened, that became  impossible. No government in Bonn can agree to target democratic countries,  actual and incipient, with nuclear weapons. Indeed, it would probably accede to  a renewed Soviet proposal to denuclearize both Germanys.  </P> <P> The nuclear element in Western strategy will not, in fact, be abandoned anytime  soon. But from now on there will be little willingness within the alliance to  deal with any of the requirements of making credible NATO's doctrine of  "flexible response" -- the process of escalating, if need be, to nuclear war.  </P> <P> Two other changes must also be recognized. Efforts to rationalize and modernize  NATO defenses will proceed at a much slower pace, if at all. And U.S. efforts  to get the Europeans to assume a greater share of the common defense burden  will now fall on ears even less willing to hear. Indeed, now that the United  States is committed to making significant cuts in its forces deployed in  Europe, the debate will shift to a competition among the allies to benefit from  any reductions agreed at the Vienna talks on conventional forces.  </P> <P> Given these pressures, President Bush is wise to press for an early conclusion  of the conventional force talks. An agreement would also begin getting Soviet  troops out of Eastern Europe, where their presence still poses a latent threat  to the West and is a potentially explosive factor in a region ablaze with  democratic revolution.  </P> <P> But as now designed, the Vienna talks are deficient. When convened, they were  predicated on the need to regulate the potential for conflict. Because distrust  formed the political background, great emphasis has been put on elaborate  mechanisms for ensuring that everyone's interests are protected. Following an  agreement, these new military arrangements would be frozen in time and space.  So, presumably, would be East-West politics.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, however, the states of East and West have begun to realize  that they share a new set of interests that are not based on confrontation but  on common security. They are coming to recognize the importance of keeping  military issues from interfering with political change, or from later on  inhibiting the development of new security arrangements embracing the entire  Continent.  </P> <P> Ideally, therefore, the Vienna talks should not be directed toward creating an  inflexible agreement but rather toward helping both alliances coordinate  mutual, unilateral reductions in troops and weapons. This method would dispense  with elaborate zones and ceilings on forces that impose unwanted rigidities --  especially, in the West, on the U.S. presence on the Continent. Each alliance  could structure its remaining forces as it saw fit -- mindful that the other  alliance would not continue its own cuts unless the process were satisfactory.  Most important, there would be no new and cumbersome military arrangements in  the way of the eventual creation of an all-European security system.  </P> <P> Even this more flexible approach to reducing conventional forces in Europe  would not answer the most critical question: How to proceed with the politics  of unifying both Europe and Germany while security is based on opposing  military machines. One Germany cannot be in two alliances or be neutral between  them so long as they form the basis of European security. Nor can it belong to  NATO, as President Bush has asserted. Thus the job of both devising and  developing an alternative for European security -- from the Atlantic to the  Urals -- cannot be postponed. It must begin now, before either "history in the  streets" or political strife between West Germany and its neighbors over  unification clashes with the remnants of East-West military confrontation.  </P></p>

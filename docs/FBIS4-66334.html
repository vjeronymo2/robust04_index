			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Xing You [5281 1429]: ``Nation to Build Public </F> Digital Data Network'']    [Summary] To implement an ``Information Highway'' and to  provide high-speed data communications, MPT is now building a  national public digital data network (DDN). In this DDN  project, MPT will import from Canada a 3600 bandwidth management  system and from the U.S. some DACS 11-2000 digital cross-connect  (DXC) equipment. DXC node computers will be installed in 24  provinces and municipalities nationwide. The main channels of  this DDN are scheduled to be completed and operational by July  of this year. DDN users will be provided with digital channels  for data/image/videoconference transmission services at a  variety of bit rates up to and including 2 Mbps, and will have  trans-provincial transmission capabilities via public  telecommunications networks, packet-switching networks, and  local/provincial-level DDNs now being built.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Personnel directors lose on pay Personnel directors are paid an average of almost 10 per cent less than other types of director, a report published today has found. The report on personnel management pay, published by the Reward Group in association with the Institute of Personnel and Development, says that, overall, personnel staff received a median across-the-board pay rise of 3 per cent in the past 12 months. Personnel directors earn Pounds 45,000 a year on average, says Reward, compared with Pounds 49,920 for all other types of director. Most middle and senior ranking personnel managers below the level of director, however, are ahead of their management colleagues. A senior personnel manager could expect to earn Pounds 36,500 a year on average against Pounds 34,736 for other managers at an equivalent level. The pay of women personnel officers trails that of men. The proportion of women in top personnel jobs, however, is growing. Just over a quarter of personnel directors in the survey were women, compared with just over a fifth in the previous two years. The report found a high level of job satisfaction in personnel departments although overall, compared with last year, respondents consider they have fewer job prospects. The Institute of Personnel and Development is preparing a bid for royal charter status, Mr Geoff Armstrong, its director general, said yesterday. The 72,000-strong institute was formed this year by a merger between the Institute of Personnel Management and the Institute of Training and Development. Personnel Rewards.

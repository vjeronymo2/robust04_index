			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSTS EXPECT MORE JOB CUTS IN FOOD INDUSTRY;  </P> <P> KRAFT TO LAY OFF 250 AS RESULT OF RECENT MERGER  </P> <P> Kraft Inc. said Monday that it will lay off about 250 employees during the next  two months as a direct result of its recent merger with Philip Morris Cos.  </P> <P> Analysts say jobless Kraft employees could have plenty of company soon as the  recent wave of mergers and takeovers -- such as Grand Metropolitan PLC's  acquisition of Pillsbury and the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. purchase of  RJR Nabisco -- in the food industry forces corporations to eliminate jobs and  cut expenses.  </P> <P> "I do think that's going to be the case, with Kraft and Pillsbury being the two  most obvious," said food industry analyst Craig Carver at Dain, Bosworth Inc.,  a Minneapolis brokerage firm.  </P> <P> The Kraft layoffs, which comes about two months after the company agreed to be  acquired by Philip Morris for $12.9 billion, is aimed at reducing costs and  eliminating redundant staff positions, a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> Kraft, which makes such products as Velveeta spread, Miracle Whip and  Philadelphia cream cheese, said the 250 layoffs will involve employees at its  headquarters in Glenview, Ill., near Chicago and in nearby offices. The company  employs 46,000 workers, including 2,800 in the Chicago area.  </P> <P> Kraft spokesman Gene Stevenson said no further layoffs are expected as a result  of the merger with Philip Morris. However, he said an ongoing cost cutting  program and "aggressive" profit goals could trigger other staff cutbacks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Productive  </P> <P> Last year, Stevenson said, Kraft laid off 250 employees nationwide as a result  of efforts to curb expenses and boost profits. "Anytime you are in a  productivity program, that kind of thing can always happen," he said.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said Monday that further layoffs at Kraft will probably be  limited to corporate staff and top managers, whose jobs are duplicated at  Philip Morris' General Foods division.  </P> <P> "It makes them a little more productive," analyst Roger W. Spencer at Paine  Webber said of the layoffs. "That's what counts."  </P> <P> Analysts said Philip Morris has moved much more quickly to cut staff at Kraft  than it did four years ago when it bought General Foods, which makes such  products as Post cereals and Jell-O desserts.  </P> <P> "When they bought General Foods, the chairman of Philip Morris said they were  going to leave it alone for two years," said John C. Maxwell Jr., food analyst  for Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va. "This time around he made no  promises. He learned his lesson. They've been chopping away at General Foods  for the past six months," Maxwell said.  </P> <P> Job cuts at Kraft will probably spread to the other food companies that have  been caught up in recent takeovers, analysts said.  </P> <P> Maxwell predicted that more jobs will be lost if some of RJR's divisions are  sold, as expected, to other food companies.  </P> <P> "If they get merged with another food company, I'm sure there are going to be  some redundancies," he said.  </P> <P> Since salaries, benefits and other associated costs can account for 70% of  corporate expenses, it's not so surprising that takeovers often result in quick  cutbacks in company payrolls, said Andrew K. Sherwood, president of Goodrich  &amp; Sherwood, a consulting firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brands More Important  </P> <P> Sherwood said food company managers may be even more vulnerable to layoffs than  most executives because brand names are often the target of an acquiring  company, not current employees.  </P> <P> "The brands are more important than the people are," Sherwood said. "It really  does not matter who is the brand manager on Hellman's mayonnaise. You can find  someone else who is a good brand manager. But you can't find another Hellman's  mayonnaise."  </P></p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Record bond prizes Someone in Britain is getting used to becoming an instant millionaire. For only the fourth time, National Savings' premium bonds yesterday paid out a Pounds 1m jackpot, writes Richard Willsher. The chances are that it wasn't you - but you might well have won a prize, anyway, because there are plenty to go around. July marks the first time that more than 250,000, with a total value in excess of Pounds 16.5m, will have been paid out in a single month. This record-breaking pay-out represents a return of 5.2 per cent on the Pounds 3.8bn total value of bonds held. Since January, the number of prizes has risen by 34 per cent and their value by 37 per cent. News of the Pounds 1m prize was announced on December 16 and investment in premium bonds took off, reaching Pounds 201m in February. This was the last month in which newly-bought bonds were eligible for the first seven-figure pay-out at the start of April. The approach of a National Lottery has sparked even more interest in premium bonds - where buyers have the added advantage of not losing their stake - and marketing has been intensified. But will investors find them worth-while? The best instant access accounts at building societies are, typically, paying around 6.5 per cent gross or 4.9 per cent net of basic rate tax. But winnings on premium bonds are free of UK income tax. Investors with the maximum holding of 20,000 Pounds 1 bonds - and anyone over 16 can hold that many - can expect, with average luck, to win 16 prizes of Pounds 50 in a full year. That is, roughly, 4 per cent gross. Even if you win nothing, you lose only the chance of earning interest on your money - which is not much in the present low interest-rate environment.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Inspirations to buy Caledonian - Disposal marks British Airways' exit from the charter airline business British Airways yesterday announced its departure from the charter airline business by revealing it was to sell Caledonian Airways to Inspirations, the tour operator, for Pounds 16.6m. BA said the development of vertically integrated holiday groups meant it made sense for Caledonian to be part of a tour operating company. Inspirations, which was floated on the USM a year ago, is attempting to emulate large travel groups such as Thomson and Airtours, which have their own airlines. BA said Caledonian represented a 'tiny proportion' of British Caledonian, which it bought for Pounds 250m in 1987. Most of British Caledonian has been integrated into BA's scheduled services. Caledonian, which was set up in May 1988, absorbed British Airtours, BA's charter airline. BA said that although it would still provide aircraft, such as Concorde, on a charter basis, it would no longer provide charter services for tour operators. Inspirations said it would raise Pounds 6.7m through a 1-for-4 rights issue at 120p a share. The shares closed yesterday at 143p, up 3p. The consideration to BA will take the form of a Pounds 4.9m cash payment, with Pounds 2.9m payable on March 31 1995, when the deal is due to be completed. Two payments of Pounds 1m each will be made on November 1 1996 and November 1 1997. Inspirations will also take on an Pounds 11.7m loan made by BA to Caledonian, repayable over five years. Inspirations will receive five Lockheed TriStar aircraft. In addition, Inspirations will abandon its plan  -announced in October  - to set up an airline called International Airways, although it will still lease three Airbus A320s, which will become part of the Caledonian fleet. Caledonian will retain its brand name and livery, including its golden lion logo and tartan uniforms. Inspirations' pre-tax profit for the year to September 30 was Pounds 4.5m, compared with Pounds 2.54m in the 11 months to September 30 1993. Turnover was Pounds 209.8m, against Pounds 118.4m last time. Earnings per share were 21.4p (9.3p) and the final dividend is 2.24p, making 2.8p.</p>

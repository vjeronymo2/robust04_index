			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lack of reality in funding large transport projects Sir, Your article 'Manchester trams beat forecasts' (January 10) correctly highlighted the benefits in combining the public and private sectors in infrastructure investment. We wish Manchester continued success and are adopting an identical approach here in the West Midlands. The problem is a much more difficult one to solve than suggested since it goes right to the heart of the way the government thinks and the way that the public sector has been financed over the past 14 years. The big projects currently suggested in the press are still a long, long way from being brought to fruition, due to the requirement to inject an unrealistically high level of private sector finance. If a partnership has to be forged between the public and private sectors then a better understanding of the risks and rewards must be achieved. It is not the case that private sector finance can be substituted for what should be properly spent by the public sector. A proper partnership is essential. This view comes from practical experience of attempts to persuade the private sector and the government to invest in the light rail rapid transit scheme for the West Midlands - Midland Metro. This scheme, which represents excellent value for money, has passed the stiffest financial cost-benefit analysis of any scheme submitted to the Department of Transport. The massive benefits the project will give to the West Midlands conurbation far outweigh the requirement for Department of Transport finance. It is, however, prevented from proceeding due to the continual squeeze on the public sector borrowing requirement. The partnership with the private sector between Centro (the West Midlands passenger transport executive) and the Altram consortium grouping of John Laing and Ansoldo Trasporti is complete. The land for the scheme is being acquired. Significant risks have been transferred to the private sector and a firm contract price agreed with the consortium. We are able and willing to start immediately the government gives the go-ahead. When the public and private sectors can reach agreement, as we have done, and are ready to start, the government has an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that the 'private finance initiative' can be realistically implemented. We look forward to a quick, positive government decision in order that this particular transport scheme can proceed. P Evans, director of finance, Centro, 16 Summer Lane, Birmingham B19 3SD</p>

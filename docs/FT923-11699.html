			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / SPD demands destroyer pull-out GERMANY'S Social Democrat (SPD) opposition yesterday called for the immediate withdrawal of federal troops from the allied force monitoring the United Nations trade embargo against Serbia and Montenegro. It also urged the government to press for war crimes charges to be prepared in the UN against Serbian leaders whom it accused of 'genocide' in Bosnia-Hercegovina. In a sustained attack on the Bonn cabinet's decision last week to send a destroyer and three aircraft to join other Western European Union and Nato forces in the Adriatic, Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, leader of the SPD parliamentary party, said the mission was unnecessary and would be of no help to the people of the former Yugoslavia. Surveillance could be carried out equally well by satellites or the secret service, he told Bundestag members called back from holiday for a special sitting. The cabinet's decision to send the forces without full consultation was a snub to parliament and an attempt to expand Germany's global military role in defiance of the constitution, he declared. The SPD group agreed on Tuesday night to appeal for a ruling at the constitutional court in Karlsruhe. The government firmly defended its position, citing the use of German forces in non-interventionist supporting actions going back 30 years. Mr Wolfgang Schauble, leader of the governing group of Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union, said he was confident the court would back the move. To be able to take part in the future European union, Germany had to be able to play a full role in common security and foreign polices, he said. Whatever the ruling, it will help clear the foggy constitutional position, and prepare the ground for change. The SPD has proposed changes which will limit German forces to peace-keeping missions under the auspices of the United Nations. The government, which has made no specific proposals, wants a full commitment to both peacekeeping and peacemaking.</p>

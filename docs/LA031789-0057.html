			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Barcelona-born painter Eugenia Tusquets, who has lived in San Francisco for the  past nine years, has a coolly decorative neo-Realist approach and a fondness  for sealing off space with an expanse of textured wall that seems  quintessentially Spanish. Against these walls, she poses "interesting"-looking  young women, either grave ivory-skinned damsels, generally dressed in black, or  more individualistic, ethnic-looking faces.  </P> <P> A Moroccan fabric border runs across the top of "Alter Ego 2," in which a  full-cheeked girl poses in profile at the lower edge of a painterly brown wall  and reappears -- in a faceless fragmentary view -- at the extreme left-hand  edge. In "Mi-Ombre," a swatch of painted green, yellow and brown pattern  running up the right-hand side of the diptych matches the fabric in the dress  worn by an attractive woman with long black hair posing against a bronze-tinged  wall with a granular texture.  </P> <P> This figurative approach runs the risk of being too dependant on superficial  values: the sweetened physical appeal of the sitters and the modish severity of  their surroundings. But Tusquets also locates a certain theatricality in most  of these scenes -- mostly through posture and placement of the figure -- and  makes her mark as a personable stylist. (Ivey Gallery, 154 N. La Brea Ave., to  March 29.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

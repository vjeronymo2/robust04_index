			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Economic Watch: Austrian industrial output rises Austria's industrial output rose 4 per cent year-on-year in August following a 5 per cent rise in July. The figures confirm the strength of the economic recovery following the country's short and shallow recession last year. Economists have recently raised their forecasts of real GDP growth this year to nearly 3 per cent after a 0.5 per cent fall last year. Industrial production is being supported by buoyant exports, a housing construction boom and undented consumer confidence. Inflation remains a concern, but the annual rate eased to 3.1 per cent in September from 3.2 per cent in August. Economists hope that pressure on consumer prices will grow when the country joins the European Union at the beginning of next year. The other worry, the public sector deficit, is more likely to be aggravated by EU entry as well as by the less stable political situation following national elections earlier this month. Wholesale prices in Denmark rose by 0.1 per cent from August to September, and were 1.7 per cent higher than in the same month last year. This supports government claims that despite a predicted GDP growth rate of 4.6 per cent this year there are no signs that inflationary pressures are increasing. Swedish producer prices rose 0.4 per cent in September from August, when they rose 0.8 per cent. Year-on-year, producer prices rose 5.5 per cent.</p>

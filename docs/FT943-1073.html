			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / The Markets: Base metals under scrutiny - Commodities Base metals analysts will be watching early trading at the London Metal Exchange with particular interest today. After a week of mixed rises, followed by consolidation, further strong advances on Friday and, in late trading, widespread though moderate trimming of gains, they will be anxious to ascertain whether leading contracts are coiled for a resumption of the run-up or due for a shake-out. Just before business ended on Friday, figures were released showing that Russian exports of copper, aluminium and nickel were running well above 1993 levels in the January-August period. It was those data that prompted the paring back of the week's advance, together with an inevitable element of profit-taking. But today's performance should show whether the speculators who returned late last week to push copper prices to 25-month highs and aluminium prices to 3 3/4 -year highs are ready to take their profits. By common consent fundamental supply/demand factors suggest that LME metals are set for further, in some cases quite substantial, gains. But the question is: when? During the present extended uptrend the LME copper price first ventured above Dollars 2,500 a tonne, for the three-months delivery position, in July. That was in response to a sudden rush of US investment fund buying, however, and many analysts were dubious that the line could be held through the northern hemisphere summer shut-down period. Their doubts were quickly justified - the price held above Dollars 2,500 for just a few days. A second attempt a few weeks ago was equally short-lived. But the price has now been in the Dollars 2,500-plus area for 10 out of the last 11 trading days, and with the shut-down season over there is less obvious cause for caution. Aluminium's position is similar. After a week of Dollars 1,600-plus trading, and with LME stocks falling at an increasing pace, further gains could well be on the cards, traders say.</p>

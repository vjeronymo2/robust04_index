			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 1, RIA -- Russia is not going to  join the Organisation of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC),  but will continue consultations with it, Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin said at a news conference. In his opinion,  conditions are not yet ripe to enter this international  organisation, but he emphasised the need of coordinating  activity on world oil markets. Russia and OPEC, he said, are  largely concerned over the drop in oil prices, and they intend  to take measures to stabilise them. This considered, meetings  between Russia and OPEC will be continued on the ministerial  level.    As Viktor Chernomyrdin and OPEC Secretary-General Subroto  met  in Davos, Switzerland, the sides discussed mutual reductions of  oil export quotas with a view to stabilising prices for the  product.</p>

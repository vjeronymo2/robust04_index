			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the imprecise nature of the impacts of the blocks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time, and upon receipt of the NMFS Northeast Fisheries Science  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Center's (NEFSC) comprehensive spatial and temporal analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bycatch in the fall of 1993, the Council voted to support the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of a time and area closure management system. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent was to replace the existing gillnet alternative (nets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removed from the water for specified blocks of time) as the harbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> porpoise bycatch mitigation measure. The Council decided, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS agreed, that the gillnet fleet would not be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groundfish effort reductions until the effect of the harbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> porpoise bycatch reduction measures could be evaluated for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts on groundfish fishing effort (approximately 1 year after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of Amendment 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS is amending the regulations under the framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abbreviated rulemaking procedure established by Amendment 5 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codified at 50 CFR part 651, subpart C. This procedure requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Council, when making specifically allowed adjustments to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FMP, to develop and analyze the actions over the span of at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two Council meetings. The Council must provide the public with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advance notice of both the proposals and the analysis, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting. Upon review of the analysis and public comment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Council may recommend to the Regional Director of NMFS that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures be published as a final rule if certain conditions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met. The Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may publish the measures as a final rule or as a proposed rule if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional public comment is needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council complied with the procedural requirements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted the rule to NMFS, and NMFS concurs with the provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Council's submission. This final rule implements time and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area closures based on an analysis by the NEFSC of harbor porpoise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bycatch using NMFS weighout and observer program data on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of sink gillnet activity and the seasonal and spatial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine. Extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussions among the Council, the fishing industry and scientists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> led to the measures outlined below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of the management measures contained in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule for Framework Adjustment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4, the Gulf of Maine is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided into three areas: The Northeast (from Penobscot Bay to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eastport, ME); Mid-coast (from Cape Ann to Penobscot Bay); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Massachusetts Bay (from Cape Cod to Cape Ann). The Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended 30-day closures for each of these areas. The timing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the closures corresponds to periods when harbor porpoise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bycatch is most likely to occur. The duration accounts for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variability of harbor porpoise movements. The Council recognizes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Mid-coast and Northeast areas account for more of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bycatch than Massachusetts Bay. At this time, however, harbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> porpoise bycatch mitigation measures are being applied uniformly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> across all regions in the Gulf of Maine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NEFSC estimated that reductions of 20 to 40 percent might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be realized in the first year of implementation of Framework  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adjustment  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4 if boundaries discussed in its initial analysis of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time and area management system for the Gulf of Maine were used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with the proposed 30-day closures. The Council's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundary modifications could alter that estimate to some unknown  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> degree because of the potential displacement of gillnet fishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort to areas where harbor porpoise are still subject to some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of bycatch. It is reasonable, however, to anticipate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum estimate of approximately 20 percent, given that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timing of the closures occurs in seasons of highest bycatch of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harbor porpoise in their respective areas. It is also reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conclude that the continued annual target reductions may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished by modifications to the same measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council adopted the approach of integrating effort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions for key species of groundfish stocks with harbor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> porpoise bycatch mitigation measures after the first year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program implementation. If the measures, or any future approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is adopted, accomplish the harbor porpoise objective without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing gillnet fishing effort sufficiently to reach the 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent effort reduction target, the Council will impose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional fishing restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Northeast Closure Area <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This area will be closed to fishing with sink gillnets from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> August 15 through September 13 of each fishing year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

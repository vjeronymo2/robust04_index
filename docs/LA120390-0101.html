			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> HOLDERS OF JUNK BOND FUNDS ARE URGED TO SELL;  </P> <P> INVESTING: AN ORGANIZATION THAT TRACKS DEFAULTS PREDICTS THAT $50 BILLION WORTH  OF THE HIGH-RISK ISSUES WILL GO SOUR IN 1991 AND 1992.  </P> <P> The Bond Investors Assn. is offering some advice to junk bond mutual fund  investors: Get out before it's too late.  </P> <P> The nonprofit organization, which tracks bond defaults, predicts that $50  billion in junk bonds will go bad in 1991 and 1992. Mutual funds that invested  in the dismal junk bond market are holding many bonds that they would sell if  they could find buyers, the Miami Lakes, Fla.-based association said.  </P> <P> Because the funds have been forced to sell their liquid holdings as investors  cash in shares, they are left with default-vulnerable and hard-to-sell issues,  said C. Richard Lehman, the association's president. That leads to a number of  problems, according to Lehman, including the possibility that the bond funds  will default at a rate higher than that for other types of investments.  </P> <P> On top of that, the group says, the bond funds' daily net asset values, or net  worth, are routinely overstated. If the bond funds could actually sell their  unwanted securities, the bonds' market prices would likely plummet, bringing  down the net asset value, the Bond Investors Assn. said.  </P> <P> "A fund holder who is selling his shares is being overpaid relative to the  realizable value of the portfolio," the association said in the December  edition of Defaulted Bonds Newsletter. "The only benefit fund holders still  have is the ability to liquidate their holdings even while their fund cannot."  </P> <P> The association did not mention particular mutual funds. "We decided not to try  to finger the specific candidates, although we could," Lehman said.  </P> <P> Junk bond fund managers declined to talk about the report.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Investment Company Institute, Betty Hart, said investors  frequently hedge their risk by diversifying.  </P> <P> "There are a number of different types of mutual funds with varying objectives  and, generally speaking, for any fund that is highly aggressive, whether it be  equities or bonds, good financial planning principles suggest people have more  than one investment," she said.  </P> <P> The association also takes bond funds to task for their accounting methods. The  group wants the Securities and Exchange Commission to force the funds to set  aside some of the bonds' interest income to cover losses expected from  defaults.  </P> <P> "This is not unlike a business concern that sells its products on credit to  high-risk customers without booking a provision for uncollectible accounts  receivable," the newsletter said.  </P> <P> There is good news, though.  </P> <P> If the junk bond market ever recovers, there could be huge gains. The  association advises investors who want to stay in junk bonds that they should  sell their current fund holding and buy into a newly established fund -- or one  with assets of less than $100 million.  </P> <P> It says go ahead and pay the typical 5% front-end load. "A new fund should  outperform an existing fund by many times this cost," the newsletter said.  </P> <P> Junk funds have been feeling the heat lately. The collapse of the market has  sent prices reeling and their corresponding yields soaring.  </P> <P> In October, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the funds to make it  clear to potential investors that high yield means high risk.  </P> <P> The bonds' prices have been beaten down as the market has become more fearful  that a recession will make it hard, if not impossible, for some issuers to make  interest and principal payments.  </P></p>

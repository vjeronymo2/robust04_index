			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial] </F>   [Text] Sinn Fein provided the most important clarification  of all at their weekend Ardfheis [annual conference] -- the  Downing Street Declaration, in its present form, is dead so far  as they are concerned. For cynical political reasons, they will  not say so publicly, but the unmistakeable message from Tallaght  -- underscored by another incendiary blitz on jobs and  businesses in the North -- was that the constitutional parties  should waste no more time trying to spot significant policy  shifts in Provo speak. There haven't been any, and there won't  be.    Even the Hume-Adams initiative which set off the present  peace momentum -- and which the SDLP [Social Democratic and  Labor Party] leader naively forecast at one stage could achieve  peace in a week -- has turned out to be a mirage. Neither Gerry  Adams, nor the Provisional movement, for all the reassuring  rhetoric that we have heard in recent months, is prepared to  accept that the principle of Unionist consent to any new  political arrangement also entails the right to say No.    The two sovereign Governments have accepted that fact. It  has been endorsed by some 90 per cent of the population of this  island, according to the latest poll. And even two-thirds of  the Provos' own supporters, according to the findings, want them  to call off the murder campaign and join the political process.    But while Sinn Fein continues to call on everyone else for a  change of attitude, its leadership seems incapable of doing just  that. It is convenient to hide behind the socalled Unionist  veto. That allows the Provos to shirk the much more formidable  task of convincing the North's Unionist majority that their best  interests lie in a political arrangement with the rest of this  island. You don't do that by shooting them and blowing up their  businesses. And even if the British left in the morning, that  task of persuasion would still have to be undertaken -- and it  still could not be done with guns and bombs.    The Sinn Fein leadership, whether through lack of courage or  fear of their paramilitary masters, wasted the unique  opportunity provided by the Ardfheis to give substance to the  current peace process. Now the two Governments and the other  constitutional parties have to move on the the next stage  without them.    The most intolerable veto of all would be to allow a party  which commands just two per cent electoral support in this  country -- and whose real political influence comes out of the  barrel of a gun -- to frustrate the widespread desire for peace  in both parts of this island.</p>

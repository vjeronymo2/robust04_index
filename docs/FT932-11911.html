			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / UK Company News: Flat first half expected from British Gas BRITISH GAS yesterday fore-shadowed flat results for the first half of this year when Mr Robert Evans, chairman, told some 500 shareholders that the conditions which had led to a fall in 1992 profits had continued into 1993. Speaking at what he said may be his last annual meeting, Mr Evans said: 'This year so far we have seen a continuation of the warmer weather, no respite in regulation and a further increase in competition.' Last year British Gas made Pounds 1.16bn (Pounds 1.46bn) before tax and exceptional items. Recalling that his term as chairman ends in June 1994, Mr Evans said 'steps will now be taken by the board to seek my successor' and he will retire when that person is ready to start. Mr Evans's successor will immediately become embroiled in the effects of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into British Gas. Its report is due in July. Mr Evans said that 'whatever the outcome of the MMC inquiry British Gas will undoubtedly be involved in a major reorganisation of its business'. Mr Evans could not resist a tilt at Sir James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, although he did not mention him by name. 'Unless mechanisms are introduced to make the watchdog organisations as accountable as we are, we face the prospect of an arbitrary and unbalanced regulatory environment,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Gadzhiy Shamov] </F>   [Text] Makhachkala May 6 TASS -- Lezghins and  Azerbaijanians living in Derbent in the Republic of Daghestan  (in southern part of the Russian Federation, between the eastern  greater Caucasus and the Caspian Sea) held crowded rallies in  various parts of the city on Thursday.    There were also skirmishes between the representatives of  the  two nationalities, sometimes gunshots could be heard.  Fortunately, there were no casualties.    Units of the Interior Ministry troops and OMON (riot police)  arrived in Derbent from neighbouring districts and managed to  stabilize the situation. However, the tension was not relieved  completely.    Both Lezghins and Azerbaijanians put forward nationalist  mottoes and demanded at the separate rallies that heads of the  city and district authorities resign.    The participants in the rallies appealed to the republic's  leadership to restore order to Derbent and to the southern part  of Daghestan as a whole and to protect the rights of the local  population.    The cause of the unrest traces back to a quarrel between  several Lezghins and Azerbaijanians which took place the other  day and ended in a fight and shootout. As a result, two  Lezghins were killed, several people, including teenagers, were  wounded.    After that, a hundred of Lezghins blocked a motor way  leading  to Derbent. They stopped a car, in which Sayid Kurbanov, head  of the district administration, his deputy and head of the  Derbent police rode.    The policeman-driver was disarmed by unidentified persons.    Kurbanov was arrested and taken to an unknown locality "to  continue the negotiations". He was released soon.</p>

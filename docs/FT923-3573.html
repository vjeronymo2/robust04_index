			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Glaxo Critics of Glaxo's dependence on a single drug can point to the fact that Zantac accounted for 44 per cent of the company's sales last year and perhaps 60 per cent of its profits. They might also worry that the migraine treatment Imigran has not yet received US approval and that the anti-emetic Zofran, while doing well, has a limited market. But that would be to ignore the marketing power of the company; Zantac may be no spring chicken, but sales rose by 13 per cent last year. Clearly longer term prospects are governed by the success of drugs such as Imigran, and while the size of the market is not yet clear, the indications are that they too will be money spinners. Given the large US holding in Glazo, UK fund managers who are underweight may feel the pain in their performance statistics.</p>

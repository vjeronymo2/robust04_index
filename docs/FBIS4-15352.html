			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Nikolay Burbyga and Boris Vinogradov report: "Russian </F> Border Troops Have Business Over the Border"]    [Text] The commanders of the 12 CIS countries' border  troops have held a council meeting in Odintsovo near Moscow.  This is the ninth session in the history of the Commconwealth,  but it is the first time that it has been possible to gather  together the full complement.    In an interview with IZVESTIYA Russia's reprsentative,  Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev, indicated that the 100-percent  quorum is evidence of the "partners' maturity" in realizing the  importance of jointly guarding the CIS' external borders. The  council participants cited the fact that a political concept is  needed for cooperation in this field.    Regardless of whether the Commonwealth is reorganized into a  Eurasian Union in the future, border guards must have a clear  system of mutual commitments in order to ensure the security of  the whole area. The possibility of each CIS member unilaterally  introducing relaxed entry visa procedures for other states'  citizens is precluded.    Until now border guards have cooperated on a bilateral  footing. But in the future the intention is to sign regional  agreements. Russia, Armenia, and Georgia and Russia, Kazakhstan,  and Uzbekistan are preparing to sign such agreements. Steps are  being taken to further strengthen the Tajik-Afghan border with  the participation of five Commonwealth states. Ukraine and  Moldavia [Moldova] have expressed a desire to join in the common  work for the first time. Admittedly, Ukrainian representative  Valeriy Gubenko did not wait for the council to completely  finish its work before leaving for home "on official business."    Viktor Chernomyrdin received the generals and asked them to  step up vigilance on the borders in order to protect Russia and  the other Commonwealth countries from wholesale misfortune --  the incursion of illegals from Asia and Africa. The premier  promised on the government's behalf to afford every assistance  in providing external borders with equipment.    It was decided to man on the "ethnic principle" outposts  where Russian border guards have hitherto mainly served. New  recruits will swear loyalty to their independent homeland and at  the same time swear a "solemn vow" to Russia. Russian officers  will keep their role as military advisers and technical experts.    The recommendations made by the council of commanders will  be  presented to the meeting of CIS heads of state and government,  which is due to start work in Moscow 14 April.</p>

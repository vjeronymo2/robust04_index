			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Olivetti loss forecast to exceed L300bn OLIVETTI, the Italian computers and office equipment group, has warned of a much heavier-than-expected loss for 1992 in a further sign of the crisis affecting some of the world's leading information technology suppliers. Mr Corrado Passera, Olivetti's newly-appointed managing director, said this year's operating loss would be between L300bn and L350bn (Pounds 160.5m). In 1991, Olivetti's operating losses totalled L28.3bn, while group net losses reached L459.8bn. 'To the figure for 1992 operating losses one has to add extraordinary costs and restructuring charges,' Mr Passera said. He did not give an estimate for this year's net losses, and implied the overall figure depended partly on accounting decisions regarding the attribution of extraordinary items. But 'the net loss will not be light', he stressed. Olivetti's earnings have deteriorated this year, in spite of predictions in early 1992 that it would close the year at around break-even. Since then, the company reported a first-half loss of L93.4bn and chairman Mr Carlo De Benedetti warned of a difficult second half. According to Mr Passera, this year's sales would probably fall by around 8 per cent to just under L8,000bn against L8,607bn in 1991. Net debt is expected to surge to L1.200bn, up from L571.9bn, largely as a result of continuing heavy restructuring costs, he added. Background, Page 15</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: BK Vision to pursue UBS action BK Vision, the investment fund that is the largest shareholder in Union Bank of Switzerland, is determined to go ahead with a legal challenge to the UBS shareholders' vote in favour of converting registered shares into bearer shares. UBS yesterday appealed to dissident shareholders not to block the introduction of the new share structure. It pointed out that a clear majority - 57.8 per cent of the registered shares voted at an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday - endorsed the change. Under the new structure, the voting strength of the registered shares, now five times that of bearer shares, would be slashed to equal bearers. UBS said the majority support from registered shareholders was a strong argument against the granting of an injunction to BK Vision to block the implementation of the conversion. BK Vision, controlled by Mr Martin Ebner's BZ banking group, has argued that registered shareholders should have been allowed to vote separately on the issue. Mr Kurt Schiltknecht, a director of BK Vision, maintained there were several other grounds for contesting Tuesday's vote. Investors seem to believe BK Vision will win the injunction next week.</p>

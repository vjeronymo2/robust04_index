			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Thorn EMI weak Worries of a stock overhang at Thorn EMI, following the company's decision to redeem a preference share issue early, sent the shares falling sharply. Leisure analysts said that the move could lead to a stock overhang since many preference holders were unlikely to want to hold on to their converted ordinary shares. At worst, this would mean over 11m Thorn shares coming on to the market over the next few weeks. The stock tumbled 31 to 931p on the announcement. There was also other potentially bad news for Thorn yesterday. According to a US trade magazine, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is to launch an inquiry into the pricing policies of the major record companies in the huge US second-hand CD market, with the suggestion that the probe could be extended into the new CD market. The move follows complaints from retailers of unfair pressure from the record companies in an attempt to keep the second hand market prices more in line with those of new CDs. One US music analyst said last night that the FTC had been hinting at such an inquiry for some time and that an extension into the brand new market was 'quite likely'. Thorn earns around Dollars 110m in sales from the US.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Appointments: London Stock Exchange - Bank dividend pleases PROFIT figures from Lloyds Bank were at the very top end of analysts' expectations and triggered a steep rise in the share price. There was no news, however, regarding possible acquisitions from the troubled Midland Bank, which had been widely rumoured earlier in the week. Lloyds' shares rose steadily throughout the day, closing a net 17 higher at 404p; turnover in the stock reached 5.6m, well ahead of usual levels of activity. Dealers said the stock had responded to a flurry of support prompted by the good dividend. Analysts agreed that the bank had performed exceptionally well during a difficult period; 'Lloyds is a core holding in the sector,' said Mr Mike Fesemeyer at Nomura, the Japanese-owned investment bank. The Nomura analyst said Lloyds had focused on providing return on equity or shareholder value. 'Some banks chose to focus on kudos and ego, while Lloyds chose to focus on profit and cash,' said Mr Fesemeyer. Shearson Lehman's banks team described Lloyds as 'the quality stock in the sector,' highlighting the bank's exceptional return on equity -'53 per cent against 32-3 per cent for the other banks', said Shearson's Chris Wheeler. RHM setback A profit downgrading by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and suggestions that another broking house had placed a substantial line of stock, knocked Ranks Hovis McDougall (RHM) down 8 to 207p, in hefty turnover of 14m shares. The placing was said to have involved a block of 6.1m shares at 207 3/4 p. BZW visited the company on Thursday and has decided to cut its profit forecast for the year to October 1992 from Pounds 115m to Pounds 110m and for the following financial year from Pounds 125m from Pounds 119m. The broker said that possible problems with the bread, milling and cake divisions had resulted in the downgrading. Euro Disney firm An announcement that Euro Disney is to join the CAC 40 - the top 40 listed shares in Paris - at the expense of Source Perrier, lifted the stock 40 to 1,555p. Turnover in London was a meagre 184,000 shares, compared with 2.1m in Paris. The move, scheduled to take place on March 19, will mean that funds tracking the CAC 40 will automatically buy into Disney. Oils rally A tumultuous week in the oils sector closed with the 'majors' staging a determined fight back after a number of serious setbacks earlier in the week. BP rallied 4 1/2 to 258 1/2 p after revealing details of its latest drilling at its Cusiana field in Colombia. BP has a 40 per cent stake in Cusiana as has Total of France. In New York, shares in Triton Energy, holder of 20 per cent of Cusiana, fell sharply following the announcement. One London analyst said the Cusiana news was 'certainly nothing to worry about. It's a good flow rate.' Turnover in BP erupted again, totalling 30m shares and boosting the number of shares traded in BP since their disappointing preliminary results were published last week to more than 230m. Shell, which dropped like a stone after its disappointing figures on Thursday, stabilised yesterday as large-scale switching out of Royal Dutch and into Shell in overnight deals in the US was absorbed. Shell ended another hectic trading session 8 higher at 448p with turnover topping 15m. The post-results analysts' meeting did little to bolster confidence. British Gas, announcing profits figures on Thursday - County NatWest expects historic net income of Pounds 1.275bn against Pounds 1.211bn - eased 2 to 252p on 3.9m. Positive reflection on Glaxo's results saw the shares add 9 to 825p in brisk turnover of 5.7m. But the outlook for the shares remained uncertain in view of the doubt cast on prospects for sales of Zantac, Glaxo's highly successful anti-ulcer drug. Specialist valve manufacturer Bespak, a tightly traded stock, gained 21 to 525p as a buyer moved into the market. Vodafone outpaced the rest of the telecoms stocks, moving ahead to 357p before settling a net 4 1/2 firmer at 355p; turnover reached 2.3m shares. BZW prompted strong support. BZW's telecoms team said it now saw a receding threat to Vodafone from PCN, the new personal communications network. BZW said it was now looking at one regional mobile competitor to Vodafone/Cellnet from 1993 with only two eventual competitors and fully national mobile coverage not until 1996 or 1997. Previously it had expected three new regional PCN competitors by 1993 and a national PCN service and price competition by 1995. A repeated buy recommendation from SG Warburg lifted Argos 7 to 292p. Warburg said the company came out well in a survey on staff costs and the implications of any introduction of a minimum wage if Britain adopts European Community regulations. In the food manufacturing sector Berisford lost 5 1/2 to 20p, on plans to raise Pounds 14.8m via a rights issue of loan stock. This is to provide finance for its associate company Rayner Coffee International after a sharp fall in coffee prices. Berisford is guaranteeing up to Dollars 115m in bank borrowings to Rayner, in which it holds a 45 per cent stake. Greencore fell 3 to 252p following the Irish government's decision to sell off 15 per cent of its stake. The sale comes one week before Irish high court inspectors are due to report on Greencore's financial dealings. Unilever maintained a firm tone, rising 9 to 964p on speculation that next Tuesday's figures will show a rise to Pounds 1.80bn-Pounds 1.84bn in 1991 profits from Pounds 1.782bn. Broker Robert Fleming turned sellers on Ladbroke, the shares slipping 6 to 225p in busy turnover of 4.4m. The house also cut its profit forecast by Pounds 30m to Pounds 210m for 1992. Analyst Mr David Kadarauch, while not bearish on the fundamentals of the company, said: 'I cannot see the basic trading position of the group improving until 1993.' Turnover in British Aerospace rose to 7.2m as the shares jumped 10 to 310p after institutional investors bought stock to take advantage of Monday's dividend payout. Vickers retreated 6 to 162p after Smith New Court reiterated its belief that the company would announce a dividend cut with Monday's full year results. Bid speculation returned to Dowty Group sending the shares 2 1/2 higher at 122 1/2 p on high volume of 6.4m. Tiphook bounced from recent falls, gaining 13 to 312 as bargain hunters picked up stock. Cookson closed unchanged at 116p having touched 115p earlier in the session. There were reports that Kleinwort Benson had easily placed a block of 1.2m shares. Total volume reached 4.6m. P &amp; O were once again hurt by speculation of problems at Chelsfield, its joint venture partner in Pall Mall Properties. The shares fell 15 to 387p on turnover of 1.2m. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi attracted another wave of heavy buying interest, closing 3/4 higher at 16 3/4 p, with turnover topping the 30m-mark. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991/92 NEW HIGHS (79).

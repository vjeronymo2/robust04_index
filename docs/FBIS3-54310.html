Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--An unprecedented American Rabbinical  delegation left Jordan Friday [21 January] after visiting  tourist sites and exchanging views with Jordanians in a mission  billed as an expression of support for the Arab-Israeli peace  process.    The tour group of 80 rabbis, including eight women,  representing 1.5 million American Jews affiliated with 850  synagogues, was described by its spokespersons as totally  different in orientation and ideology from their hardline  counterparts in Israel.    Those who might have taken their cue from the images that  appear on Israel television and expected to see a group of  long-bearded men wearing religious garb, armed with prayer books  and humming hymns under their breath were in for a surprise.  Most of the group's members looked more like business  executives than religious men.    The visit was not without its controversies either, Shaykh  Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman Khalifah, spiritual Leader of the Muslim  Brotherhood movement, condemned the visit saying "this soil has  not been stepped on by a jew since the time of Caliph 'Umar" in  the eighth century.    "Our past experience has proved that Jews in the West  plotted  against Palestine," said Shaykh Khalifah, who also carries the  title of the deputy secretary-general of the broader Muslim  Brotherhood movement in the Arab World. The visit of the U.S.  rabbinical team, he said, means a "plot against Jordan."    "This visit is not acceptable to us at all," he said in a  statement.    Officials said the group was treated as a regular tour team  with the only exception that extra security was provided to the  delegation.    The group said its very visit to Jordan symbolised a  yearning  for coexistence and justice.    "We believe our very presence here is a story," said Rabbi  Ammiel Hirsch, executive director of American Reformist Zionist  Association (ARZA) and the team's leader. "We are here to  support the peace process, and we want it brought to a  satisfactory, comprehensive, permanent settlement."    Rabbi Hirsch speaking in an interview at the  Intercontinental  Hotel where the team stayed, said the delegation's mission was  to "listen, to learn and to convey our impressions to public  opinion."    "We are not politicians and are not an official delegation,"  said Rabbi Hirsch.    But, he added, "We are not a general kind of group. It is  historical for us. To my knowledge there was never this kind of  a group coming to Jordan..."    He implied that the impressions that the Rabbis carried home  from Jordan and elsewhere in the region would have a strong  bearing on the views of their congregations.    By and large, according to delegation sources, a significant  number of the group members supports the establishment of an  independent Palestinian state while others believe that the  shape of a Palestinian entity is better left to direct  negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.    "We have met with ordinary Jordanians in al-'Aqabah and in  Petra, and also with academics here," said Rabbi Hirsch, in his  mid-30s. "We are very grateful for the generous hospitality that  the Jordanians are giving us...they are very warm and friendly  people..."    The rabbi voiced confidence that the peace process would be  successful. "We obviously know very well. There is a great  excitement in the region, in particular in Jordan, and there is  a conviction that there be mutual social and economic benefits  from a settlement. We would like to contibute to that process  if we can, and that is why we are here."    He said the delegation was hoping to be received by His  Royal  Highness Crown Prince Hasan, but the meeting did not materialise  because of scheduling problems.    Rabbi Hirsch said the American Jewish community was in touch  with Arab-American leaders in order to "establish the kind of  communications that were not established before."    Asked how he viewed internal Israeli opposition led by  hardline rabbis against the peace process. Mr. Hirsch said: "I  am not a politician and that is not why we are here. We are  here because we support the politicies of the current Israeli  government... a territorial compromise in exchange for a  comprehensive permanent settlement in the Middle East. We  support that very, very strongly."    The tour group arrived in Israel early this week and  proceeded to the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, but a meeting  with the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators there did not take  place.    From Taba the group travelled to Nuwaybi' to catch the ferry  to al-'Aqabah and then visited Petra.    The delegation visited Ma'daba and the nearby Mount Nebo  Thursday. It crossed the King Husayn Bridge Friday morning.</p>

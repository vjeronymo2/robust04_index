			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome price sees further fall Shares in Wellcome, the drugs group, fell 4p to 778p yesterday as Robert Fleming, the merchant bank which handled the recent Pounds 2.16bn sale of shares by the Wellcome Trust, again cut its bid price. The bid was cut by 3p to 777p, after a 20p cut on Tuesday from 800p, the price at which the Trust sold its shares. Fleming's move is part of its programme of stabilising the share price following the sale, using the so-called green-shoe option. This allows Fleming to buy 40.5m shares which were over-allotted in the sale to mop up loose shares. So far Fleming is thought to have bought about 23m shares.</p>

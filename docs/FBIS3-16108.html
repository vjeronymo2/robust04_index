According to Simes, during the meeting Rutskoy said  that he wanted to run for presidency at the nearest presidential  elections in Russia.    Simes pointed out that in a conversation with Nixon the  former Russian vice-president said that he intends to carry out  his political campaign by exclusively lawful means.    Simes went on to say that Nixon met with a high-ranking  official of the State Duma and a representative of the Russian  Government. He pointed out that the names of those who met with  the U.S. ex-President would be kept secret at their own request.  At the same time, Simes said that one of the anonymous  high-ranking politicians who had asked for a meeting with the  U.S. ex-President canceled the meeting, saying he was unwell.    Returning to the subject of Nixon's having been deprived of  a  limousine equipped with a special security system which had  earlier been in his possession, Simes denied allegations that  this had been done at the request of the U.S. ex-President's  entourage.    Commenting on the situation around Nixon's visit to Russia,  Simes declared that the trip turned out to be the best lesson  for him. "This trip made me realise better than ever how  decisions are adopted by the Russian Government and what  relations exist between its constituent parts, how president's  advisers are operating and what the relations are like between  the president's entourage and the president himself and the  State Duma and an extent to which lawmakers can afford to make  independent decisions. All this was very useful to me," Simes  said.    "The situation which unfolded is unwelcome, but it has  taught  us a good lesson, "making us a little bit wiser," Simes said.</p>

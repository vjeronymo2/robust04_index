			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 22 (AFP) - The EC's executive  Commission sent a letter to the Greek Government on Tuesday [22  February], demanding an explanation for its recent trade embargo  on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, EC officials said.    The Commission said it was very concerned about the step,  which it argued went against European law.    Greece blocked access to its northern port of Salonika to  its  neighbouring state last week, accusing it of usurping the name  Macedonia and having territorial designs on the northern Greek  province of the same name.    Under EC law, the unilateral sanctions would be illegal  unless Greece could prove the action was justified by a threat  to public order and safety.    The Commission cited Article 169 of the European Union  Treaty, which says that if the Commission feels a member state  has not met its obligations, it has the right to issue a  decision on the matter after asking the member state concerned  to contribute its observations.    If the member state does not comply with the decision in the  period specified by the Commission, the latter can have recourse  to the European Court of Justice, according to the treaty.</p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BEARS SIGN ANDERSON FOR 4 YEARS AT REPORTED $6 MILLION  </P> <P> Neal Anderson, the Chicago Bears' leading rusher and receiver last year, signed  a new contract today for what a source said was $6 million over four years, a  figure that would make him the NFL's highest-paid running back.  </P> <P> Steve Rappenecker, Anderson's agent, said from Gainesville, Fla., that the  agreement will give Anderson more than $5 million over the four years. A source  close to the negotiations who spoke on condition his name not be used said the  total actually would be more than $6 million.  </P> <P> That would make him the highest-paid running back in the league on average  salary per year; Eric Dickerson of Indianapolis made $1.3 million last season.  Bears' spokesman Bryan Harlan, who did not disclose a salary figure, said the  deal would make Anderson the highest-paid player in the team's history.  </P> <P> Three weeks ago, Anderson had threatened to seek out other teams after the  Bears withdrew a four-year offer worth an estimated $5.6 million.  </P> <P> "All along I wanted to stay here," he said at the time. "Maybe I made a  mistake."  </P> <P> Rappenecker said Anderson had been talking to other teams, and "two were very  interested," though neither provided Anderson with offer sheets. He would not  name the two teams.  </P> <P> "The Bears were very aggressive in wanting to keep Neal and took the  initiative," Rappenecker said. "I think Chicago had a good attitude about  signing Neal from the word go, and even before the word go."  </P> <P> "I think everybody's happy. We're happy, the Bears are happy, and hopefully,  the fans in Chicago are going to be happy," he added.  </P> <P> Anderson was fourth in the NFL with 1,275 yards rushing last season. He also  led the team with 50 receptions and 15 touchdowns and went to the Pro Bowl for  the second straight year.  </P> <P> Under NFL rules, Anderson had until April 1 to solicit offer sheets from other  teams, but apparently none materialized. Because he is a restricted free agent,  the Bears would have the right to match any offer or get two first-round draft  choices in return if Anderson had signed with another team.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 49ers Sign Center Radloff  </P> <P> Wayne Radloff, an NFL Plan B free agent who was a starting center with the  Atlanta Falcons from 1986 through 1988, has agreed to a one-year contract with  the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers, it was reported today.  </P> <P> Radloff is signing for $275,000 in salary and gets a $40,000 signing bonus  along with a $50,000 bonus if he is active for the entire season, according to  the San Francisco Chronicle.  </P> <P> John McVay, the 49ers' vice president, said the team would consider using  Radloff as its starting center and moving Jesse Sapolu, the 1989 starter, back  to his former position, guard. Radloff, 29, lost his starting job with the  Falcons last season.  </P></p>

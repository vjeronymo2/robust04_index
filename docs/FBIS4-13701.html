			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Military Confused"] </F>   [Text] On Thursday, two American helicopters were shot down  by two American F-15 jets killing 26 American and allied  personnel in what has been termed a `friendly fire' disaster in  northern Iraq.    The incident raises a question. Had the two American  helicopters been downed by Iraqi aircraft what would have been  the consequences? Answer--disastrous. By now, Pentagon would  have mobilized allied support and once again we would have  witnessed a display of American military machismo with innocent  Iraqi citizens being the target of relentless hellfire of the  allied war machine.    Though the blunder has shaken up the whole Clinton  administration, outwardly it has managed to remain calm and  unperturbed by issuing the usual, monotonous statements of  "working as quickly as possible to complete the investigation  into how the accident happened," and offering the perfunctory  condolences to the families of the victims.    It's only when Americans erroneously kill their compatriots  or get killed by the enemy that it becomes an eye-opener for  U.S. policy makers to review their rules of engagements in  military operations abroad. The rules defining when U.S. forces  can attack enemies have now been tightened.    Last year's missile attack on the Iraqi intelligence  headquarters in Baghdad over the `Bush kill plot' controversy,  is still fresh in the mind. President Bill Clinton, just a few  months in office when he ordered the surprise missile attack,  was bubbling with confidence. Now after a series of foreign  policy and military faux pas we see a Clinton deflated and the  American people demoralized over Washington's foreign policy.    Human errors made at the lower levels are a reflection of  bigger blunders committed by the top brass. The American  military has become overbearing, insufferable and bumptious just  like its leadership. Its aggressive attitude towards the  `enemy'--to kill rather than counter--has made even missions,  supposedly altruistic, into bungling operations, nullifying  their very purpose.    In this case, even presuming that the helicopters had been  Iraqi, it would not have justified shooting them down, without  any provocation. During the three years the allied forces have  been monitoring the no-fly zone, in northern Iraq, no Iraqi  aircraft have been sighted as far north in the no-fly zone, as  the U.S. Blackhawks were.    When it comes to firing at the enemy, the normal  international flight procedures and safety rules are completely  violated. Nay, they don't exist at all for the American  military forces. Recall how they downed an Iran Air flight to  Dubai in July 1988 by "erroneously" identifying it an enemy  aircraft? And in October 1992, the U.S. aircraft carrier  Saratoga fired a missile at the Turkish destroyer Muavenet,  killing five Turks including the captain?    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry admits that half a  dozen  procedures should have been in place to have prevented the  latest `friendly fire' tragedy, while General John  Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says the  F-15 pilots were not required to get clearance before firing  their missiles at the `enemy'. Which all goes to show that the  top officials themselves are foggy about the rules governing  such eventualities.</p>

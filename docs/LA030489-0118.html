			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 100 EVACUATE AREA OF TOXIC SPILL  </P> <P> Two 55-gallon drums filled with an ether-based substance fell from a truck in  Irvine, forcing authorities to cordon off the intersection of Von Karmen and  McGaw avenues and evacuate about 100 people from two businesses Friday morning,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said passers-by  discovered the drums, which were leaking into a flood control channel, at about  9:45 a.m. The drums fell from a truck from Anaheim-based Cypress Chemical Co.,  Cha said.  </P> <P> Two hazardous-materials teams and a fire engine company were sent to the scene  to determine the type of chemicals involved and to contain the spill in the  business and light industrial area.  </P> <P> Cha said the fact that the spill occurred in an open area when there were no  winds helped firefighters quickly bring the situation under control.  </P> <P> Fire officials identified the ether-based substance as dipropylene glycol  monomethyl ether, a chemical that is used as a solvent and in the manufacture  of hydraulic brake fluids. It is moderately toxic and hazardous if absorbed  through the skin or inhaled in large quantities, they said.  </P> <P> Fire officials advised businesses to shut off air conditioners and close  windows and doors to prevent fumes from entering buildings. No injuries were  reported.  </P> <P> Workers were allowed to return to their buildings about 1 p.m. and the  intersection was reopened about 4 p.m. GEORGE BUNDY SMITH  </P></p>

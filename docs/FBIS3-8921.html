"I ask that the Security Council conduct an investigation of  the situation in Kosova at the earliest possible time, and I  repeat the appeals of the Albanian Government for a discussion  as soon as possible of measures that might be taken in order to  prevent further conflict in Kosova," writes Ambassador Kulla.    The Albanian ambassador asks for the immediate discussion of  the sending of United Nations troops to Kosova in order to  prevent the spread of the conflict from Bosnia-Herzegovina in  Kosova and asks at the same time that his letter be circulated  as an official document of the Security Council.    On the subject of ethnic cleansing against the Albanians in  Kosova, the ambassador writes that "hundreds of Albanian homes  have been raided and 3,400 Albanians have suffered from Serbian  police violence, and most of them have been imprisoned. In many  cases, the Serbian police have ordered Albanian families, under  the threat of death, to leave their homes and emigrate from  Kosova.    Mr. Kulla also condemns the political trials against  Albanians, stressing that "defendants have been tortured,  serious procedural errors have been committed, and sentences  have been excessive."</p>

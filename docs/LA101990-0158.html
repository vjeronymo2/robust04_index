			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> DECLINING NUMBER OF BUILDING PERMITS LOOKS LIKE BAD SIGN FOR O.C. ECONOMY  </P> <P> The number of building permits issued to developers each month is a prime  indicator of the direction in which the economy is heading.  </P> <P> That number has been going down in Orange County for several months now, and it  looks as if the decline won't stop any time soon.  </P> <P> In July, builders were issued permits for 569 units in the county, down from  about 1,450 in July 1989. In August, the total dropped to 489 units from 1,255  a year earlier.  </P> <P> The county's 28 cities usually account for about half the total. Permits issued  for unincorporated areas -- which include traditional building hot spots such  as Rancho Santa Margarita, Foothill Ranch and Aliso Viejo -- make up the other  half.  </P> <P> The county's share fell to about 18% of the total in August, with permits  issued for just 86 units. September permit information for the cities isn't  available yet, but county officials say they issued permits for a mere 40  residential units in unincorporated areas last month.  </P> <P> If that's half the total for all of Orange County, the bottom really has  dropped out. And even if it is only 10%, that still would make September --  with about 400 units -- the worst month since the real estate depression of  1981.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JANN BROWNE TAKES CROWD AROUND A COUNTRY BLOCK  </P> <P> Playing a milestone show for her home-county fans, Jann Browne gave them a tour  through her real neighborhood -- the precincts of traditional country music --  with the assurance of someone who knows her way around every corner on the  block.  </P> <P> Browne's two shows Monday night at the Crazy Horse Steak House marked the  opening of her first national tour as a headliner in her own right (the Laguna  Hills singer did two years of road work with Asleep at the Wheel in the early  1980s). The occasion also marked a rite of passage of sorts: Browne's first  time headlining in one of the weekly slots that Orange County's highest-profile  honky-tonk reserves for touring attractions.  </P> <P> With her debut album, "Tell Me Why," having spent more than two months on the  country charts (two singles have hit the Top 20), Browne has finally gone  national after more than a decade of dues-paying on the Southern California  scene. From the intensity of the cheers, a good many fans at the upscale Crazy  Horse show were longtime partisans who had seen her in grass-roots bars like  the Swallows Inn in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> Browne wasn't about to let the evening drift away on a wave of graduation-night  sentimentality, though. Instead, she played a direct, unpretentious show  (Browne's lone frill was a fancy, tight-fitting black velvet stage suit),  thanking the home fans for giving her a foundation, but correctly reasoning  that she could reward them best with songs instead of extensive reminiscing.  </P> <P> Browne's material and performing style don't, at this point, herald a singer  able to put a thoroughly individual stamp on traditional country music. Even  performers who relish tradition need to have a healthy willingness to turn it  on its head once in a while, or to make old traditions serve new themes and  tales. But Browne's 70-minute early show established that she is a rounded,  seasoned, confident talent with first-rate ability. She was like a  well-trained, superbly conditioned Olympic diver or gymnast who can handle each  compulsory maneuver with aplomb. The set ranged through just about every  classic subgenre in the country tradition, showing a knowing way with each of  them.  </P> <P> There were aching ballads, made vivid with a controlled, ever-so-slight crack  in the voice and a keening climactic cry. There was wry honky-tonk, where  lyrics about heartbreaks bounce along over jaunty rhythms as if to say all  those sad affairs are just a part of the human comedy. There were clattering  train-rhythms, chunky rocking country, a prettily sighing country-Mex  combination and a strong, quick-stepping bluegrass tune.  </P> <P> In each setting, Browne's backup group was a sharp, interlocking unit. The key  soloists were guitarist Rick MacDonald and jack-of-all-strings Dennis  Caplinger, who wove lovely fiddle, mandolin and lap-slide guitar accents into  the music, and plunked a bit of banjo to boot. Rhythm guitarist Lonnie Allen's  clear, chiming tone also played a prominent part in the mix. Drummer Rhys  Clark, a transplanted New Zealander living in Huntington Beach, gave every song  sure definition, while bassist Don Whaley shaded Browne's singing with good  harmony vocals.  </P> <P> Aside from her material's too-close adherence to traditional conventions, there  was little to quarrel with in Browne's performance. One might argue with the  emotional cast she gave "Louisville," an original song in which a woman travels  two-thirds of the way across the country to make a new life with a lover, only  to be stood up and left stranded and broke. Browne sang it with plaintive, hurt  restraint, when the situation seems to call for the most outraged, withering  kiss-off a singer could muster.  </P> <P> She finished her set hot and strong with a new song, "Blue Heart in Memphis."  It rocked authoritatively as Browne's voice conveyed the sense of risk and  abandon with which people follow their dreams in a music mecca -- even after  their initial hopes have foundered.  </P> <P> But that was only a warm-up for the encore rendition of "Will the Circle Be  Unbroken?" Browne and her band made the hoary bluegrass-gospel warhorse sound  coltish again. The band goosed it with rockabilly rhythms, then veered into  gleeful Western swing. Browne, meanwhile, swung right along, wailing in a black  soul-gospel voice as playful and irreverent as a moonshine party in the church  basement. It ended the show with a big exclamation point and hinted at what  Browne might be able to do if she will try to twist and contort country  traditions once in a while instead of retracing the music's classic outlines.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO Respectfully Informs the </F> Readers"]    [Text] Since the release of the news that ZHONGGUO LUSHI  BAO [CHINA LAWYERS' NEWSPAPER] will be published next year, we  have continued to receive letters and phone calls from readers  across the country, who ask how they could subscribe to ZHONGGUO  LUSHI BAO and complain that local post offices do not accept  subscriptions. We want to respectfully inform our readers:    1. ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO is run by the Ministry of Justice of  the PRC, and accepts subscriptions through post offices  throughout the country. The postal issuance code is 1-198.    2. Because ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO was founded relatively  recently, it has not been listed in the nationwide newspapers  and journals subscription catalogue. For this reason, the  Publication Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications in Beijing has sent telegrams to the  publication bureaus of post offices in provinces and  municipalities throughout the country, asking them to accept  subscriptions on behalf of ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO. Therefore,  various post offices and stations please perform subscription  formalities for readers according to the above-mentioned notice.    3. According to information, at present, there are readers  in quite a lot of places who still cannot subscribe to ZHONGGUO  LUSHI BAO at post offices. In order to promptly solve this  problem, apart from requesting post offices to actively accept  subscriptions, ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO will accept direct  subscriptions from readers. The specific method is: A reader  may send subscription money (6.6 yuan for a quarter, 26.4 yuan  for a year) directly to the distribution department of ZHONGGUO  LUSHI BAO before 31 December 1993 (do not send remittance by  wire). Using the name and address on the remittance notice, the  distribution department will send newspapers to the reader once  every two issues.    4. ZHONGGUO LUSHI BAO will also publish bound volumes. One  volume will be published every six months, the price is 30 yuan;  a total of two volumes will be published every year, and the  price is 60 yuan (including postage). Those who are interested  please remit money to the distribution department of ZHONGGUO  LUSHI BAO, and write "bound volume" on the remittance notice.

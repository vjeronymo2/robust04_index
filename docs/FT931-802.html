			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Fashion: Division of medical opinion over the 'feel-better' factor - The secret codes of the white coats / Dressing for the Professions, The Doctor MEDICINE IS a middle brow profession, too serious for its head to be turned by the vagaries of fashion, too disinterested to notice that fashions change. Most doctors think the correct dress code should be a boring and worthy one - 'neat and unostentatious.' This is certainly the impression one gets surveying the dining-room in the Royal Society of Medicine at the bottom of London's Wimpole Street, an agreeable gossip parlour for the hundreds of doctors who have their rooms nearby. No evidence here of made-to-measure suits or shoes from Lobbs, no power dressing Joan Collins-style. Rather, there is a vista of nondescript blues and greys, plain shirts and sober ties interspersed with the sensible shoes and tweed skirts of women doctors. There are two exceptions. Heart surgeons dress more expensively because, as Dr Tom Stuttaford says: 'This gives off a hidden signal that they are rich and successful, which is bound to boost a patient's confidence.' Paediatricians, believing that being jokey and cheerful helps break the ice with their young patients, favour brightly coloured shirts and bow ties. Still, within the 'neat and unostentatious' range there is room for subtle variations which reflect the personality types that are attracted to the different specialities: surgeons, as practical men of a conservative bent, favour pinstripes; male obstetricians are not averse to flashy ties and fashionable footwear; geriatricians - the idealists in medicine - wear cheap shiny suits. It was not always thus. When a doctor's income was dependent on private patients, there was a conscious attempt to follow the advice of the 16th century physician of Salerno that 'a doctor who dresses poorly will attract poor patients'. Those who could afford to drove a Rolls-Royce and dressed in a morning suit, top hat and even spats. But medicine in those days was more theatrical because the best hope of success was to convince patients they would indeed get better. So Sir Ralph Bloomfield-Bonington, in Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma, 'radiated an enormous self-satisfaction, healing by the mere incompatibility of disease or anxiety with his welcome presence. Even broken bones, it is said, have been known to unite at the sound of his voice.' In the more anonymous setting of the hospital, medical dress changes. When hospital doctors slip into white coats at the start of the day, they cease to be private citizens and assume the persona of their profession: clinical, conscientious and authoritative. The white coat legitimises requests to perfect strangers to remove their clothes and let themselves be bullied; it reinforces the reliability of diagnoses and the efficacy of remedies. The white coat is more than hospital doctors' uniform. It is intrinsic to the successful practice of their skills. Among doctors it is a subtle signifier of position in the hierarchy. Medical students' lowly status is advertised by their coats being truncated just below the waist. The overworked housemen are identified by pockets bulging with the notebooks in which they record the many investigations to be performed on their patients. The registrar is not so encumbered, but as the hospital management has decreed that junior staff may only change their coats once a week, it is usually dirtier than the outfit worn by senior registrars who are allowed to change every day. At the top, consultants distinguish themselves by not wearing a white coat at all. When doctors at London St Mary's Hospital were asked in a questionnaire their reasons for wearing a white coat, 'easy recognition by colleagues' was the dominant response. The white coat also has the symbolic meaning of purity. It represents innocence of purpose and the absence of malice as well as superhuman power and goodness - the saints who have triumphed over death are robed in white. White coats are also what scientists wear. It is no coincidence that they first became popular in hospitals in the 1930s at the time of the introduction of the first antibiotics, when it became clear that the future of medicine would lie in discoveries made in laboratories. Dr Joseph Kriss, of Stanford Medical Centre, says: 'It is symbolic of an attitude which conveys to even the most anxious patients, a sense of seriousness of purpose,' - although recently the white coat has come under attack for 'inhibiting the doctor-patient relationship.' Similar sentiments have led to the adoption of a casual style of dress in general practice. Dr Jenny Law, from an inner city practice in Vauxhall, south London, finds formal clothes 'uncomfortable for myself and off-putting particularly for children. I know my patients well and they know me and frankly I think they could not care less what I wear.' This too was the opinion of Dr Brian McKinstry, a GP in West Lothian, until he investigated patients' attitudes by showing them five photographs of differently attired male and female doctors. 'I expected they would favour the smart, casual look of cardigan and sports shirt - but I was wrong,' he says. The doctor in the smart suit proved much the most popular followed by one wearing a tweed jacket. The female doctor in slacks scored lowest of all. 'It is hard to be sure how important this is when compared to a doctor's kindness or willingness to listen,' he says, 'but if patients do have more confidence in a well-dressed doctor, then it would seem logical for doctors to dress in that way.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- Japan is considering  lowering the limit on the amount of yen travelers to North Korea  may carry if the United Nations imposes sanctions against the  North over its refusal to allow inspections of its suspect  nuclear program, officials said Wednesday [15 June].    The Foreign Exchange Law sets the limit of the amount of yen  a traveler can carry abroad at 5 million yen, regardless of  their destination, but Finance Ministry officials said North  Korea could be an exception.    "It's possible (to lower the ceiling on yen to be carried by  travelers to North Korea) with an interpretation of the law. It  could only be (done) with a notice by the finance minister,"  said an official at the ministry's International Finance Bureau.    "We are afraid of being told by the United States and others  that the current ceiling hampers the effect of economic  sanctions," the official said on condition of anonymity.    But an official at the ministry's Customs and Tariff Bureau  acknowledged that people going to North Korea via third  countries, such as China, could thwart the special measure.    Some ministry officials said the impact of lowering such a  ceiling will be limited because customs officials estimate the  amount of yen a traveler to North Korea carries at about 200,000  to 300,000 yen.    Most travelers from Japan to North Korea are among some  250,000 North Koreans living in Japan, many of whom are  Japan-born descendants of forced laborers brought over when the  Korean peninsula was under Japanese rule between the early 1900s  and 1945.    The U.S. has asked Japan to stop the remittance of any money  to North Korea.    Although it is not known how much money is actually sent to  North Korea from Japan, trade and banking sources estimate the  sum at 60 billion yen a year, including trade bills.    In a related development, Japanese commercial banks have  stopped remitting U.S. dollars to North Korea, although they  have not halted sending cash in other currencies. Bankers say  the move is in line with a U.S. law that prohibits U.S. banks  from remitting dollars to North Korea.</p>

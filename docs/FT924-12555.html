			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Skanska faces significant shortfall SKANSKA, Scandinavia's largest construction and property company, will make a substantial loss this year after yesterday reporting a 77 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to SKr438m (Dollars 78.67m) for the first eight months. The group was hit by heavy losses on financial operations, but the full-year result will also reflect an estimated SKr1.5 to SKr2bn in property write-downs and a SKr400m loss caused by the surge in Swedish short-term interest rates in September. Mr Lars-Ove Hakansson recently stepped down as group chairman because of the currency and interest rate losses and was replaced by Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive of Asea Brown-Boveri. Before property write-downs and taxes, Skanska will make a full-year profit of SKr200m compared with a SKr2.2bn profit last year. This puts it on course for a 1992 loss of more than SKr1bn after inclusion of these items. The profits deterioration in the first first eight months was almost entirely due to losses on financial operations as operating income was largely unchanged at SKr1.7bn. The group suffered an extraordinary SKr518m loss following foreign currency deals which resulted in the dismissal of the head of its finance subsidiary, Skanska Kapitalforvaltning, last August. It also incurred a SKr500m loss after adjusting its money market portfolio to market levels. Since the end of the reporting period, the group has scaled back this portfolio substantially, to less than SKr5bn in mid-October compared with SKr13bn a month earlier. For the full year, the group estimates that negative net financial items will total SKr1.6bn, double last year's level, excluding the extraordinary foreign exchange loss. Group revenues for the eight months fell to SKr19.97bn from SKr22.92bn, with a prediction that the total for the year would drop to SKr30.3bn from SKr34.6bn. Skanska said the downturn in the Swedish construction market accelerated in the latest period, with new residential construction expected to fall by 25 per cent during 1992. Skanska and Volvo also announced they would bid for full control of the investment groups Custos and Protorp which will cost the two companies around SKr450m each. If they succeed, they aim to sell all the assets in the companies and dissolve them.</p>

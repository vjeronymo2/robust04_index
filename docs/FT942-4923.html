			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / World Commodities Prices: Tea The Tea Broker's Association reports strong demand. Bright East Africans were often dearer while mediums and plainer Central Africans remained fully firm. Ceylons met good competition but prices were barely steady. Bright Zimbabwes sold well and gained 5 to 10 pence, others were unchanged. Ceylons met selective enquiry at irregularly easier rates. Quotations best available, 230p/kg nom, good 160p/kg, good medium 138p/kg, medium 118p/kg, low medium 85p/kg. The highest price realised this week was 231p for a Rwanda pf. 1</p>

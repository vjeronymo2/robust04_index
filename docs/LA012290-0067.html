			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> IMAGE = FACT: According to "The Lifestyle Market Analyst," Orange County's  image as well-to-do and trendy is fully justified. . . . People here are 64%  more likely to invest in real estate, 63% more likely to ski frequently and 62%  more likely to travel overseas than the average American. . . . We drink fine  wines, play tennis, own personal computers, ride bicycles, eat health foods and  take vitamins far above the national average. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

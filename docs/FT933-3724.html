			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Books: 'This is a damn silly country' - Autumn Fiction THE LOVE SONGS OF NATHAN J SWIRSKY by Christopher Hope Macmillan Pounds 13.99, 190 pages ON THE CONTRARY by Andre Brink Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 376 pages HOME by Ronald HarwoodWeidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, Pounds 14.99, 346 pages THE POINT scarcely needs to be made again, that White South Africa, particularly the English-speaking element, has produced a remarkable number of distinguished writers in proportion to its small population. Three of the country's best contemporary novelists are on parade this month: Christopher Hope, expatriate for many years but still returning frequently to his roots; Ronald Harwood, also expatriate, better known for his work in the theatre; and Andre Brink, based today in Cape Town, who has come over from the Afrikaners. Christopher Hope has produced, in The Love Songs of Nathan J Swirsky, a sequence of stories set in 1951 in the new Johannesburg suburb of 'Badminton'. Some of them have been read by the author on Radio 4, and listeners will already know that their charm and brilliance lie in Hope's trick of showing life in this absurd and utterly realistic apartheid community through the eyes of the children - a very different perspective on that reality. The surface detail is lovingly nostalgic. The appalling mother who can only think in racist euphemism; her long-suffering husband, tempted by more liberal values: 'We try to treat our servants as part of the family . . . At Christmas and Easter the servants are always included. We don't have to do it. We choose to do it'; the Indian topsoil man and the unmentionable African nightsoil gangs; the Torch Commando of ex-servicemen, chasing burglars in the blue-gums and cursing the National Party government: 'This is a damn silly country. I went off to fight the Nazis and I came back to find that the place was being run by dyed-in-the-wool fascists. Thanks for nothing]'; Bobby Locke; Tootal rayon shirts; 'Which twin has the Toni?'; and, at the heart of it, Nathan J Swirsky, the newly-arrived Jewish pharmacist, loved by the kids because he is 'grown-up but . . . not grown-old'. This is a wonderfully funny book, and I am happy to offer the phrase for the dust jacket, but the copywriters must add that this is tragi-comedy. For you begin to realise that Hope is crafting a metaphor of South Africa: there is the dynamite factory down the road, which the children fear will blow up one day; there is the Old Age Home for Jews from Europe; there is the black servant, laughing at them all, and soon to give Mrs van Reenen a bun in the oven; and in the end Swirsky joins the Black Zionists. The publisher compares it with the Lake Wobegon books, but that underestimates the achievement. It has the makings of a small classic. Andre Brink has never hesitated to use his novels to tackle the Big Themes of South African history and society; it must also be granted that he has always spoken out courageously and, as an Afrikaner, has been in a more exposed position than the Gordimers and the Hopes. His latest novel, On The Contrary, is powerfully ambitious and is drawn from a little-known historical rebellion in the 1730s Cape of Good Hope against the corrupt Dutch rule of the East India Company. Its leader was a French adventurer called Estienne Barbier. This narrator and anti-hero was a rogue, a con-man, a fantasist, a coward, a seducer, a murderer, a complete villain - but, imagines Brink, before his ghastly execution he came to understand what the Whites were inflicting on Africa, to feel shame, to accept responsibility. This is a long way from the gentle subject matter of Miss Brookner and Francis King and most new novels, and Brink does not hesitate to use every trick of his trade, from Derrida to magical realism, from Cervantes to a Scheherezade slave girl and the accompanying shade of Jeanne d'Arc. One of many difficulties is, I suspect, that Brink's usual readers are not accustomed to the experimental and will be baffled by the ingenuity of his constructions: the constant switch from historical saga to inflated fantasy (eg the leap from the careful detail of Company administration to Barbier's visions of unicorn and hippogriff) can be testing for those who preferred Looking on Darkness or A Dry White Season to Brink's latest, The First Life of Adamastor. My own hesitation is different. I am one of those who have always thought there was something crude about Brink's imagination: there is a near-uncontrolled lasciviousness and violence about so many of his books - particularly here - which is worrying in a highly successful international writer. And, if you press me, I shall add that I think this is a deeply pretentious novel. But many reviewers will disagree. Ronald Harwood has made his career as a dramatist - The Dresser, Another Time, etc. - but he is also a novelist who, 20 years ago, wrote a long historical saga about South Africa, called Articles of Faith. Now he has done something similar in Home, which includes a South African section but is wider in its geographical range. He traces the story of four families across this century so as to bring together, at the end, a couple who are respectively 'the descendant of Catherine the Great' and 'the descendant of wandering Jews'. The autobiographical element is not denied. It starts with a flight from the pogroms in 1911 and goes on to Hamburg, Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, London, Cape Town, Paris, Chesterfield  - you name it. Zionism, Nazism, Communism all feature. The Jewish protagonists are 'the eternal expatriate'; the moral is to remember Voltaire's warning against 'the madness of those who are certain'. As you would expect of a playwright, the dialogue reads better than the descriptive narrative.</p>

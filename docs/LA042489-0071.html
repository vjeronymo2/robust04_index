			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEWS OF TODAY'S AFI FILM FEST  </P> <P> Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film  Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century  Plaza Cinemas:  </P> <P> 'Illusory Thoughts' and 'The Money Juggler'  </P> <P> United States, 1988, 131 minutes  </P> <P> 8:45 p.m.  </P> <P>  One good, one not-so. The weaker entry, "Illusory Thoughts," shows  writer-director-star Patrick Chu, a Hong Kong-born choreographer, as the  pensive Nam, wandering around Manhattan, ruminating ruefully on how ephemeral  life is, while various women fight over him. Leo Rubinfein's "The Money  Juggler" is a well-acted, well-shot, intelligent adaptation of a Louis  Auchincloss short story.MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Engen looks unlikely to invest in fuel project ENGEN, the energy arm of South Africa's Gencor group, yesterday said it was unlikely to exercise its rights to acquire a 30 per cent stake in the controversial R12bn (Dollars 3.8bn) Mossgas synthetic fuels project. Mr Bernard Smith, chairman, said it 'looks as if we will be making a negative decision on Mossgas'. Engen has until the end of 1993 to decide. He said the investment did not appear commercially sensible because Mossgas would not be viable without a considerable state subsidy. Earnings at Engen, meanwhile, rose by 10 per cent in the first half to the end of February. However, Mr Rob Angel, managing director, said the results were not what the company had hoped for. He predicted that Engen would achieve real earnings growth for the full year. Turnover rose by 10.4 per cent to R3.56bn from R3.23bn, and operating income advanced 42 per cent to R270m from R190m thanks to a better wholesale margin and cost containment. These gains were offset by a fall in net financing income to R13m from R67m, leaving net income 10.7 per cent higher at R228m compared with R206m. Earnings per share rose by 10.1 per cent to 147 cents from 134 cents and the dividend was increased by 10 per cent to 55 cents a share from 50 cents. Mr Angel said sales had been flat - below expectations of 3 to 4 per cent growth. He attributed this to South Africa's economic climate, a hiatus in the name change from Mobil to Engen and problems with various township sights. The refinery, he said, had had a 'very disappointing' first half. Teething problems following an upgrade were exacerbated by frequent power failures. Crude volumes through the refinery were thus about 20 per cent below forecast.</p>

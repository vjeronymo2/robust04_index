			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO / INDUSTRY NOTES: HOMEFED LAYS OFF 183 WORKERS IN WAKE OF 2ND-QUARTER  LOSS  </P> <P> HomeFed Bank has laid off 183 employees, or 3.7% of its work force, over the  last two weeks in efforts to trim expenses in the wake of its $108-million  second-quarter loss.  </P> <P> The savings and loan said 100 of the layoffs were a direct result of plans to  scale back single-family loan originations.  </P> <P> Another 60 of the layoffs were due to HomeFed's closing its 12-office escrow  division and another 23 due to cutbacks in its commercial banking operation.  </P> <P> HomeFed would not rule out further layoffs but said none are now planned.  </P> <P> HomeFed President Robert Adelizzi said the cutbacks were linked to HomeFed's  plan to "trim down the volume of our loan originations. . . . Instead of $6  billion in total loan originations, it may be closer to $3 billion" next year,  Adelizzi said.  </P> <P> Adelizzi also said HomeFed intends to control its growth, keeping its asset  level stable at the existing $19-billion level.  </P> <P> HomeFed's second-quarter loss last month caused a significant reduction in its  capital, the cushion that protects it against losses. As a result, the thrift  announced plans to close its out-of-state loan offices, to stop making  commercial real estate loans and to trim expenses. CHRIS KRAUL  </P></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Pacific BBA buys Indonesian stake Pacific BBA, the plastics and automotive supplies group which became Australian-owned after the UK-based BBA Group sold its 57 per cent interest last year, is buying a minority stake in Dynaplast, an Indonesian plastics company, as part of a plan to move into the Indonesian market, writes Nikki Tait. BBA said it had been working with Dynaplast, which is listed on the Jakarta stock exchange, for the past 18 months, and plans had been agreed for the introduction of BBA products into that area. BBA said its position as a shareholder in Dynaplast 'confirms ongoing support and the availability of . . . technology for Dynaplast'.

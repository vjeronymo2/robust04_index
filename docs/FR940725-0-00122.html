			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At SESAC's meeting of April 25&hyph;26, 1990, the Committee recommended that the scope of the proposed shipyard standard on vessels and vessel sections be expanded to include all confined and enclosed space operations within the shipyard (Tr. 102, 4/25/90). The committee also recommended that the title of the subpart, originally called ``Explosive and Dangerous Atmospheres in Vessels and Vessel Sections,'' be changed to clarify that this standard addresses all confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres encountered in shipyard employment. Additionally, SESAC recommended that several provisions similar to those proposed for general industry be added to subpart B to make it a comprehensive standard for shipyard employment. The provisions they recommended included a paragraph covering training requirements and duties of confined space entrants; a new paragraph on self-rescue and rescue teams; and a new paragraph addressing the duties of employers with respect to on-site contractors. As recommended by SESAC, the additional provisions would make subpart B a comprehensive set of requirements applicable to the hazards posed by confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres encountered throughout shipyard employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to issues raised in various comments submitted to the docket concerning the general industry permit-required confined spaces proposal and to enable OSHA to place the SESAC recommendations into the subpart B rulemaking record, the Agency reopened the subpart B record for additional comment (57 FR 28152). In the notice reopening the record, which was published on June 24, 1992, OSHA invited public comment on seven issues. These issues were:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Whether or not land-side confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres should be treated separately from spaces in vessels and vessel sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) What kind of training should shipyard confined space workers receive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Whether or not subpart B should require attendants for shipyard confined spaces.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) What should be a shipyard employer's duty with respect to rescue services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) What should be a shipyard employer's duty with respect to contractors and other employers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Whether or not hot work permits should be required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) What are the costs associated with applying requirements from the generic confined spaces standard to shipyards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons were given until September 22, 1992, to submit comments. OSHA received 53 comments in response to the notice reopening the record on the revision of subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule on general industry permit-required confined spaces was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 14, 1993 (58 FR 4462). Shipyards were omitted from the scope of the final general industry standard because the Agency felt that it would be more appropriate to address them in the revision of subpart B of part 1915. The relationship between subpart B and &sect;1910.146 and OSHA's reasons for adopting a separate rule in subpart B are presented in the summary and explanation discussion of the scope and application section for subpart B (&sect;1915.11).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information OSHA relied upon to prepare the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), comments received in response to the (NPRM), to the notice of the reopening of the record, and the exhibits (including the written transcripts of relevant SESAC meetings) submitted during the period allowed for such submissions, constitute the rulemaking record for this proceeding. The entire record was carefully considered in the preparation of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Significant Risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has determined that there is a significant risk to the health and safety of workers who enter confined spaces in shipyards. According to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), SIC 3731 (Ship building and Repairing) has the highest lost workday case incidence rate for injuries of any industry (``Occupational Injuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry, 1991,'' Bureau of Labor Statistics, May, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The industry as a whole therefore poses the highest risk of injury from all hazards for its employees in the U.S. Within shipyards, confined space operations are one of the riskiest activities, which is why the industry developed its own effective confined space procedures that were adopted by OSHA as subpart B in 29 CFR part 1915 in the early 1970s.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the present time, work in confined spaces on vessels is covered by the current shipyard confined space regulations in subpart B of part 1915, but work in ``land-side'' confined spaces is not. This work on land-side operations is therefore not currently addressed by a specific OSHA regulation. These operations were originally included in the scope of the proposed general industry confined space rule (&sect;1910.146) but were omitted in the final rule. In the preamble to that final rule, the Agency noted its intention to cover confined spaces, both on vessels and on land, in its revision of subpart B of part 1915.

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FHP INTERNATIONAL SHOWS A SURGE IN EARNINGS  </P> <P> FHP International Corp., a Fountain Valley-based health maintenance  organization, reported strong earnings growth Wednesday for fiscal 1989 and the  fourth quarter ended June 30, largely on the strength of growing membership,  higher rates and containment of costs.  </P> <P> The company reported net income of $7.7 million for its fourth quarter, up  26.2% from $6.1 million for the same period a year ago. FHP's revenue for the  fourth quarter ended June 30 increased 37% to $199.3 million from $145.1  million for the fourth quarter of 1988.  </P> <P> For all of fiscal 1989, the company's net income was $22 million, up 33.3% from  $16.5 million a year ago, and revenue rose to $699.1 million from $503.5  million in fiscal 1988.  </P> <P> Industry analysts say that while the HMO industry over the last 12 months has  been recovering from a financial depression, FHP continues to do better than  its competitors because of more efficient cost controls and its success in  developing a program for Medicare recipients.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Dr. Robert Gumbiner, chairman and chief executive  officer at FHP, said the company's revenue and income growth "were driven by  robust membership growth, continued cost-effective management of medical  resources, rate increases from commercial groups and the federal government and  increased interest income."  </P> <P> He added that during the year, the company opened or expanded nine medical  centers in four states and moved into six new market areas in Southern  California. In June, the company also acquired its first skilled nursing  facility.  </P> <P> FHP's enrollment expanded 24.9% in fiscal 1989 to 466,000 members from 373,000,  an achievement that industry analysts and company officials attribute in part  to an exodus from traditional indemnity insurance by employers unwilling to pay  skyrocketing rates.  </P> <P> Also, FHP picked up some former Maxicare members when that Los Angeles-based  HMO filed last March for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy  Code.  </P> <P> A nationwide reduction in the number of HMOs and indemnity health insurance  plans, analysts say, has taken the steam out of a price war that formerly raged  in the industry.  </P> <P> "There is a consolidation under way in the industry, and those who are  surviving are benefiting from price raises," said Lucy Olwell, health care  analyst with Merrill Lynch Research in New York.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, FHP prices are attractive to subscribers because they have not  risen as high as the cost of traditional indemnity health insurance. "The  insurance companies have set a pricing umbrella for us, and we have come in  under that umbrella," said FHP spokeswoman Anna Marie Dunlap.  </P></p>

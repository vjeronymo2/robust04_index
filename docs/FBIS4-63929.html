			<p>BFN     [Text] President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan has expressed  satisfaction over the course of talks on two offshore oil  projects in the Caspian Sea between the Azeri Government and a  consortium of Western companies.    At a meeting with consortium representatives in Baku on  Tuesday, the president spoke of Baku's willingness to strike a  fair deal which would mark a new stage in the development of the  country's oil industry.    The consortium includes British Petroleum, Statoil of  Norway,  Turkish Petroleum Corporation and U.S. Amoco, Pennzoil, McDermot  and Unocal. Also attending was a representative of Russia's  LUKoil company which was awarded a 10 percent stake of  Azerbaijan's share of some 30 percent.    Aliyev described as a success the latest round of talks  which  ended in Istanbul (Turkey) on May 20. He said the negotiations  would resume in a month.    On taxes and oil tariffs, Aliyev said these technicalities  were subject to negotiation.    He tried to allay fears about the uncertainty of the Caspian  Sea's status, saying Azerbaijan was firmly in control of its  territorial waters.</p>

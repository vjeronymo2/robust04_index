			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Agriculture faces the menace of environmentalism - Post Earth Summit conference in the Netherlands THE US government will shortly acknowledge that a number of prohibited products ought never to have been banned as carcinogens, according to former US secretary of state for agriculture Mr John Block, now president of America's wholesale grocers' association. Addressing a post-Earth Summit conference in the Netherlands this week Mr Block accused many critics of agriculture of irresponsible distortion of scientific evidence. The conference, on how environmental issues could affect farm trade, was organised by the International Policy Council on Agriculture and Trade and the Dutch Government. Few of the representatives from 34 countries disputed an assertion of the former secretary-general of the Brundtland Commission, Mr Jim MacNeill, that the 1990s would see a major increase in unilaterally enacted national laws imposing restrictions on a wide range of products failing to meet environmental - including welfare as well as human, animal or plant health - requirements. Nor did speakers doubt that these restrictions might be used as covert protectionist devices to an extent that could nullify advances made through negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade towards reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers. The increasingly dominating role that well organised environmentalism was already playing in industry generally, especially those sectors related to welfare, pharmaceuticals and food, clearly worried speakers from many countries. But of particular concern were fears that ill-informed prejudice would supersede scientific consensus to restrict trade, raise manufacturing costs and impose unwarranted burdens on food producers. One example was the European Community's maximum permissible nitrate levels in drinking water, the strict enforcement of which, according to Mr Peter Johnson, chief executive of Booker Countryside and an unabashed apologist for British agribusiness, would end internationally-competitive farming in England's bread-basket, even though the rule was in direct conflict with scientific findings. Likewise the 'emotional and altogether hasty banning of Alar', a crop protection chemical applied to apples, had had a serious effect on apple sales. 'It does not take long for five supermarket owners supplying over one third of the UK's food to withdraw an item about which they have doubts' warned Mr Johnson. The welfare issue was another oft-quoted example. Everyone sympathised with the US for being rebuffed by the Gatt panel that had examined the legitimacy of the US ban on tuna fish caught in circumstances hazardous to dolphins. Most nevertheless endorsed the Gatt view that the governments cannot be allowed to act unilaterally: there must be international agreement. There was more than a hint, however, that US consumers would tolerate no such rebuff. By operating a consumer boycott, they could achieve overnight what ponderous international mechanisms would have taken years to accomplish. Mr Michael Smith, a leading environmental expert and a former Gatt ambassador, warned that the environment was the trade issue of the decade, and traders would ignore it at their peril. Only by a narrow margin had Californians rejected proposition 65, which effectively would have left scientific judgments on the merits of legislation in the hands of such authorities as Jane Fonda. But Mr Kenneth Cook, chief author of the conservation and environmental provisions of US Farm Bills, warned that public fears would not be assuaged by being told there was nothing to worry about. Every time there was a scare, the credibility of scientific assurances was reduced, he said.</p>

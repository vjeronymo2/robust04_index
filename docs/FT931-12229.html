			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: Nintendo issues health warning - Worth Watching Nintendo, the unparalleled king of the video games market, has been forced to admit what many beleaguered parents of young games fanatics had suspected for a long time: that excessive playing of these electronic toys can be hazardous to your health. But this is only if you have a rare kind of epilepsy, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. The warnings also say that in some rare cases people may momentarily suffer convulsions or lose consciousness when they see flashing lights or images on the screen. The decision to attach the warning was prompted by recent publicity in the UK and Japan which suggested that video game playing could trigger epileptic fits.</p>

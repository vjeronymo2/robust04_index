			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP NOW IN BUSINESS WITH CARD MAKER HE SUED  </P> <P> Developer Donald J. Trump, whose lawyers often are busy fighting unauthorized  attempts to use his name, has agreed to endorse a line of photographic business  cards made by a small Georgia company that he had sued for calling the product  "Trump Cards."  </P> <P> Under an out-of-court settlement announced Wednesday, Trump was given the  rights to the "Trump Cards" trademark and will license Positive Concepts Ltd.  of Lithia Springs, Ga., to market the product.  </P> <P> Trump will receive a monthly royalty.  </P> <P> Trump agreed to drop his suit against PCL, a suburban Atlanta company that  began making the cards in 1983. The company, whose trademark application last  year prompted Trump's lawsuit, contends that it named its product for the  high-ranking suit in a card game.  </P> <P> PCL President Edward A. Zito said Wednesday that the settlement was good for  both sides. He said his company avoided a potentially lengthy and expensive  court battle and got an unusual endorsement from Trump that should boost the  fortunes of his business.  </P> <P> Advertisements featuring Trump's endorsement will begin appearing in national  business magazines this spring, Zito said.  </P> <P> Neither Zito nor Joe Silver, a spokesman for the Trump Organization in New  York, would say how much money Trump would receive in royalties.  </P> <P> Zito said the path to the settlement began last summer when he called Trump to  discuss the suit.  </P> <P> "He was cordial but stood his ground," Zito said. "I said, 'You know, we didn't  try to steal your name from you. In 1983, nobody knew of you.' "  </P> <P> Zito said he sent Trump a sample of the cards and suggested that the issue be  settled out of court. Trump liked the cards, Zito said, and negotiations began.  </P></p>

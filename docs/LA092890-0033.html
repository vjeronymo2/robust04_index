			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'TEXASVILLE': MIDLIFE CRISES;  </P> <P> FILM: IN THE SEQUEL TO 'THE LAST PICTURE SHOW,' DIRECTOR PETER BOGDANOVICH'S  HOMECOMING IS A BOON AND A BUST.  </P> <P> In the opening of "Texasville" (selected theaters), Jeff Bridges' Duane  Jackson, in his hot tub, is shooting indifferently at his new two-story  doghouse with a .44 Magnum. Lord knows Duane's got acreage enough so that he  won't hit anything he doesn't mean to, but it's a signal that all is not well  in Anarene, Tex.  </P> <P> There's very little right -- or even comprehensible -- with other "Texasville"  characters either, many of whom audiences will remember from "The Last Picture  Show" which traced their lives some 30 years earlier.  </P> <P> Between then and "Texasville's" 1984, the oil boom and bust have hit Anarene.  Both cataclysmic events have spawned some pretty peculiar behavior. Ordinary  townspeople who'd expected to live "more or less orderly, more or less  responsible lives," can be found whirling in and out of each other's beds or  pickup trucks, on the edge of what seems to be widespread nervous collapse.  </P> <P> Underneath all this irrational behavior is oil-driven anxiety; more than half  the town is bankrupt, the other half expects to be before sundown.  Unfortunately, that was far clearer -- and funnier -- in Larry McMurtry's book  than in Peter Bogdanovich's film. Director-screenwriter Bogdanovich has crowded  the screen with so much activity and so many auxiliary characters that we're  pushed well past the point of keeping track of them -- or caring.  </P> <P> We want to know about Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd), back home to heal her  soul. Has she got Duane in her sights again or is she simply exercising her  talent for lazy flirtation? What should we make of her instant closeness with  Karla (Annie Potts), Duane's terrific wife of 20 years?  </P> <P> To find out, we have to fight our way through a welter of glossy Texas women  who are sleeping with either Duane or his 19-year-old son Dickie (William  McNamara), or with both. And there are these women's gun-totin' husbands. If  you think of them as gnats, you'll have an easier time of it.  </P> <P> For audiences too young to remember the 1971 "Picture Show," Bogdanovich may  have skimped on some needed refreshers, especially about Sonny (Timothy  Bottoms), whose performance doesn't really register. Over these 30 years, Duane  has become a husband, a father, a millionaire and a very young grandfather. But  we meet him $12 million in debt and unsettled by that idea, by middle age and  by the behavior of every woman around him, including his wife's.  </P> <P> Jacy, Duane's capricious high-school sweetheart, has gone on to become a minor  movie star. She's come back to Anarene from Italy where she's been living,  wracked by a death in her family. Bachelor Sonny Crawford, Duane's best buddy  and rival for Jacy in high school, is fraying at the seams; as Duane says,  "Sonny's a little tired in his mind."  </P> <P> Lester Marlow (Randy Quaid), now an overstressed bank president and Genevieve  Morgan (Eileen Brennan) are on screen only briefly. Only Ruth Popper (Cloris  Leachman, particularly fine) seems to have traversed the time-span  successfully. Once the older woman in an adulterous affair with Sonny, she's  been widowed for years and Duane's secretary through thick and thin.  </P> <P> "Texasville's" problem isn't that its tone is darker and more reflective. It's  that unhappiness and inertia aren't particularly dramatic and mindless  partner-swapping isn't particularly engaging. "The Last Picture Show's"  high-schoolers, facing the Korean War, were groping for sex as avidly as these  adults; they were also groping for tenderness and human contact. "Texasville's"  adults seem to be simply groping, although not in ways that warrant the film's  R rating.  </P> <P> The movie's grace rests with the performances of Bridges, Potts and Shepherd.  Thirty pounds pudgier for the part, Bridges' Duane, like most McMurtry men, is  baffled and buffaloed by the tart-tongued women around him. The sight of Jacy  and his wife -- mysterious and allied -- with their heads together, most likely  comparing notes about his defects, makes Duane real edgy.  </P> <P> Potts' Karla, mother of four hell-raising kids, is a pistol. Karla's been  putting her feisty messages to the world -- "You Can't Be First -- But You Can  Be Next" -- where the world can't fail to notice them, on her black, sprayed-on  T-shirts. Duane's desultory affairs don't thrill her, but she's in for the long  haul, clearly Duane's match and the motor of their marriage.  </P> <P> Burnished by time and the loss she's suffered, Shepherd's Jacy is still a  heartbreaker, wicked enough to seduce Duane's very own dog away from him. Her  devastating closing scene, watching Duane and Karla's twins simply being kids,  is an announcement of how far Jacy -- and Shepherd -- have come.  </P> <P> In contrast, the movie's big set-piece, the Old Texasville Centennial, which  should contain a certain visual irony about the New West, is endless and  cartoony. Like Sonny's moving pictures in his mind, Bogdanovich sees things we  can't; when we can join him -- in moments of family and connectedness --  "Texasville" is touching. Most other times it's the darndest mess you ever saw.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / City Challenge to be given further Pounds 750m MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, environment secretary, took the election campaign to Labour's heartlands yesterday when he pledged Pounds 750m for urban renewal to 20 inner-city areas under the second phase of the government's City Challenge scheme. All of England's 57 urban priority areas (UPAs) - including the 11 which were successful in last year's pilot competition - are free to bid for the funds. Each winner will receive Pounds 37.5m spread over five years from 1993-94. The 57 areas - with average unemployment rates of more than 12.5 per cent - are concentrated in London, the north, the north-west and the Yorkshire and Humberside region. Bids for funds must include a scheme from councils for improving a run-down area in partnership with local businesses, voluntary groups and community organisations. The Pounds 750m is not new money. As with the Pounds 412m allocated in the first phase, it will be taken from the government's existing urban programmes. Funding for the two phases combined will consume about a fifth of the budget allocation for the four main urban programmes - with serious implications for councils unsuccessful in the bidding. Mr Heseltine said: 'City Challenge is about vision, quality, partnership and expecting local authorities to lead their communities.' To be successful, bids would need to exhibit 'flair and imagination', and the capacity to attract private-sector investment, he added. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said the government was 'playing games' with inner cities. 'Those authorities who lose will have wasted time and very scarce resources,' he said. Mr Jeremy Beecham, leader of Newcastle upon Tyne City Council and chairman of the Labour-led Association of Metropolitan Authorities, condemned the principle of bidding, but was 'pleased that all UPAs will be able to compete'. In addition to yesterday's launch in London, ministers are planning 'regional seminars' to publicise City Challenge. Councils must declare their intention to bid for second-phase funding by the end of the month. They must then submit a full proposal by April 22. If the government is re-elected, it intends to pick the winners by the end of July. If Labour takes office, Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, has pledged that it will meet funding commitments already agreed, but will then integrate City Challenge into a single urban programme to be distributed on the basis of need.</p>

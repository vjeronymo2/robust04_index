Mikhaylov by </F> Vladimir Gubarev; place and date not given: "Enthusiastic  Uranium Deals. Clinton Has 'Donated' $12 Billion to Russia"]    [Text] The Moscow meeting between the presidents of the  United States, Russia, and Ukraine has prompted a number of  rumors. In Kiev Kravchuk's opponents are claiming that Russia  "did well out of the uranium deal" whereas the Ukrainian  president was "sold short." Some people in the United States  are saying that Clinton "gave away" $12 billion to Russia --  this is the amount it is proposed to pay for uranium destined  for U.S. nuclear electric power stations, which will be obtained  from our nuclear warheads. Finally, "joyous" hopes have arisen  in the Russian Government: The word there is that U.S. dollars  will now come flooding into our country....    I was keen to ask the following questions in an interview  with Russian Atomic Energy Minister V. Mikhaylov:    [Gubarev] How did Ukraine lose out by this deal?    [Mikhaylov] The level of Ukraine's security has increased --  so in fact Ukraine has benefited. Some of the reprocessed  uranium from the nuclear weapons will go back to Ukraine in the  form of fuel rods for the reactors of nuclear power stations.  You must bear in mind that an extremely critical situation has  developed in Ukraine regarding weapons and their storage and  servicing. The weapons which have been delivered to us are very  dangerous -- scheduled maintenance has not been carried out, nor  have they been serviced. I will not beat about the bush, I am  very worried by the weapons situation there -- you simply cannot  play around with nuclear warheads! It must be clearly  understood: Ukraine cannot be a nuclear power -- neither the  technical nor any other conditions exist there. Moreover, if  Russia were not a nuclear power, in present conditions we too  would be unable to build weapons or to service them at the  appropriate level.... Quite honestly, I do not understand how  people can play political games with nuclear weapons. I am  convinced that the agreement signed in Moscow has saved Ukraine  from new "Chernobyls."    [Gubarev] What have the Americans gained?    [Mikhaylov] They have made several billion dollars on this  contract. Basically, U.S. uranium-235 enrichment plants are  defective. Compared with our plants, they are obsolete and the  technology is substandard. Their enrichment plants are about 20  times less efficient than ours in terms of electricity  consumption. Therefore the Americans are closing down their  enterprises and our fuel is going to their nuclear electric  power stations. Incidentally, there are approximately 100  reactor units in the United States. The government is basically  a "middleman" now, it is reselling our fuel for nuclear electric  power stations. I think it will make about $3 billion on this  contract.    [Gubarev] What about Russia?    [Mikhaylov] The contract benefits us. But not in the  financial sense. First, the process of dismantling weapons is  very expensive -- according to expert estimates, it works out at  $30,000-100,000. The arithmetic is simple, and therefore you  can see that "fat profits" will not be coming our way.... But  for me the important thing lies elsewhere: This contract  enables us to maintain Russia's nuclear industry, retain our  cadres, and keep our scientific centers. In addition, the world  will become a safer place: There are currently too many weapons  at nuclear storage facilities. I am telling you this in all  seriousness, since all my life I have been involved in  developing nuclear weapons.... But I would like to reassure our  fellow citizens: There is quite enough uranium in Russia to  fully ensure supply to our nuclear power industry and weapons  complex for many decades to come.</p>

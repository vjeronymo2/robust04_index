			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Four European airlines set 1997 target for combined operations KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Scandinavian Airlines System, Swissair and Austrian Airlines are considering merging in four years to create Europe's largest airline group. Mr Leo van Weigk, one of the three board members of KLM, confirmed yesterday that the four medium-sized European airlines were studying full integration of their operations by 1997. The four are seeking to create what they call a 'fourth force' in the European airline industry to compete against the big three European carriers  -British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa of Germany. Although the four carriers are considering a full merger, this is likely to take several years to complete because of the airlines' complicated shareholding structures and problems over their respective international landing rights. The four carriers have set up 16 working parties to study various aspects of co-operation leading eventually to a possible merger. Their conclusions are expected to be put to the boards of the airlines in two weeks. KLM said yesterday that the four boards were expected to reach a decision on future co-operation and a possible merger next month. Before any final proposal is decided it would have to be reviewed by the European Commission, the shareholders and unions of the four airlines, as well as by the north American anti-trust authorities. This process could take a further six months, KLM suggested. If successful, this could lead to closer collaboration between the four airlines through a joint management group next year. The joint operation could combine the sales, computer reservation systems and fleet maintenance of the four airlines. The concept at this stage would be to provide the benefits of a merger without a full merger. The combined operations of the four carriers would create one of Europe's biggest airline groups, with a fleet of more than 270 aircraft carrying 30m passengers a year and employing around 80,000 people.</p>

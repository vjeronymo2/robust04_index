			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Allowance exceeded I AM A married woman with no earned income. A large part of my unearned income has been paid gross by virtue of me completing the relevant R85 forms. I now find I have exceeded my personal allowance for the present tax year by about Pounds 125. Am I liable for tax on this Pounds 125 or on all of my gross income? You must, of course, tell each bank or building society that you are not, in fact, entitled to receive interest without deduction of tax (although you thought that you would be, when you signed the R85s). When your tax position comes to be sorted out, after the end of the tax year, you will only actually end up bearing tax (at 20 per cent) on the excess over your personal allowance. Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR10 (A guide for people with savings); this is a new version of IR110 (with a new title), and supersedes pamphlets IR111 and IR112 as well. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Food manufacturing Strange forces are fast reshaping the UK's food industry and the stock market seems confused about what to make of them. For the first time in a long while, it rates food manufacturers' earnings more highly than those produced by food retailers. And while the retailers have underperformed the market by 34 per cent this year, the manufacturers have shown a more modest 11 per cent decline. That would either suggest food retailing stocks have been oversold or that manufacturers have a lot further to fall. The recent warning from Northern Foods has only reinforced the latter view. Yet there are several reasons for the divergence in relative performance. Retailers were previously rated more highly and have had more room to fall. But food manufacturers may also prove more defensive. The bigger companies, such as Unilever and Cadbury Schweppes, have strongly-growing businesses outside the UK. Moreover, producers have made great efficiency gains in recent years, largely under the cosh of the retailers. Nevertheless, big restructuring charges may emerge as a feature of the manufacturing sector as companies try to drive down costs. US consumer products companies, such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Philip Morris, have perhaps set the trend. It will certainly be a brave investor who ventured back into either food sector at present. Both sectors, though, may find some comfort from dividend yields touching 4 per cent.</p>

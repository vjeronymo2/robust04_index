			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 29 TASS -- Reinforced police squads  will patrol Moscow streets during the May Day celebrations,  taking into account the last year's deplorable experience,  Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS  here on Friday.    According to the mayor, he is more worried over "terrorist  acts rather than organised actions by gunmen". Luzhkov stressed  that "no matter how the situation changes in the capital, the  townhall is fully prepared to counter extremists".    The Moscow mayor plans to spend all four off-days at his  office.</p>

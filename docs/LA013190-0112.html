			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> FIRE DEPARTMENT FEE SETUP GAINS GROUND  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors cleared the way Tuesday for the Orange County Fire  Department to begin charging fees next year for paramedic and other services.  </P> <P> The fee program, part of a major restructuring of the Fire Department, has been  held up for several weeks because of concerns expressed to supervisors by  senior citizens.  </P> <P> Residents in Leisure World in Laguna Hills, in particular, were upset about the  prospect of having to pay a yearly subscription rate for paramedic service of  between $30 and $45 -- or face $150 to $250 charges each time paramedics were  dispatched to their homes.  </P> <P> But a compromise was worked out with the assistance of Supervisor Thomas F.  Riley, whose district includes Leisure World. Under the plan adopted Tuesday,  the Fire Department was instructed to develop a new fee schedule that takes  into consideration discounts for senior citizens, the ability to pay and  communitywide subscription incentives.  </P> <P> The proposed fees must be approved by the board and by the city councils of the  Fire Department's contract cities before they are implemented next year.  </P> <P> The Fire Department provides services to Cypress, Dana Point, Irvine, La Palma,  Los Alamitos, Mission Viejo, Placentia, San Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach,  Stanton, Tustin, Villa Park and Yorba Linda.

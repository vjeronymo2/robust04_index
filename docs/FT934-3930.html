			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Bring on the angels - Richard Gourlay on how the Budget might help Spotless Lighting to expand into Europe Gordon Growmore was already feeling a warm glow from Kenneth Clarke's UK Budget speech last Tuesday when the telephone rang on his cluttered desk. 'Hi Gordon,' said the excited voice of Bill Watson. 'You must have heard the chancellor's plans to get investors to put equity into unquoted companies. It's just the break I said I needed before coming in with you. We must talk about that expansion into Germany you're always bending my ear about.' Since taking over from his father as chief executive of Spotless Lighting, Growmore had taken his Solihull company about as far as the UK market in car lighting systems would allow. Recession had produced a taut sales force that responded quickly to customers' wishes. And Spotless had done so much training that staff seemed to discuss nothing but total quality management and benchmarking. Gordon knew this was the way forward, even though sales had remained stubbornly at about Pounds 15m. But what really fired him was the prospect of pushing Spotless into Europe, and in particular into Germany, where car makers had been driven by recession and a strong currency to seek cheaper foreign suppliers. The trouble was, a German export drive was going to cost about Pounds 300,000 over two years, a sum the banks would not lend to a company with sales of only Pounds 15m. Growmore had successfully defused his father's initial suspicion of outside equity. But, try as he may, even investors who believed in his German export deal said they could not justify the risk in such an unfavourable tax environment. Now the chancellor had opened the door to two immediate sources of capital. Investors could sell quoted investments and pay no capital gains tax when they re-invested in companies like Spotless; and the new Enterprise Investment Scheme allowed any losses to be written off against income or CGT in the event that Spotless failed in its overseas drive. But Growmore was even more excited by the prospect of tapping Watson's knowledge of the German car market. Watson had always said that he, like other business angels, was as keen to play a non-executive management role as he was to invest money. Struggling to contain his excitement, Growmore slipped into the office of finance director Jenny Beancounter. She was fuming at the Budget. 'Six months' work getting pay rises paid by the tax payer and one flick of the chancellor's hush puppies kicks my profit-related pay scheme into touch. And Gordon, no more gold bullion bonuses this year - he closed that loophole too.' Growmore had never understood how Beancounter and the accountants had swung a PRP scheme in which staff took a salary sacrifice in return for a guaranteed tax-free profits bonus, thereby leaving the workforce better off and Spotless with an unchanged wage bill. As for the practice of taking a bonus in bullion to avoid national insurance contributions, he knew that could not last. 'Forget about all that,' said Growmore. 'We have some real engineering to do. Dust off those plans drawn up with Frank Harris at Kidsons Impey in Birmingham. We're going into Germany.' Beancounter immediately perked up. Spotless was going to need Pounds 500,000. After the Budget this could be raised from five investors in return for a quarter of the company. The company would need help drawing up a prospectus. And there was a need for a shareholder agreement which clearly established how the angels could exit from their investment. But any agreement would have to take account of the company's tax situation. The chancellor had raised the threshold for the 25 per cent small company corporation tax rate from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 300,000. But Spotlight was in danger of slipping above this level and paying a marginal rate of 35 per cent. Beancounter had spent long hours with Kidsons Impey discussing how to bring tax below this 35 per cent rate. An increased dividend was one way. But Kidsons Impey had recently shown that Spotlight was better off - and the management no worse off - by giving a bonus, even after paying employer's national insurance contributions. With outside investors likely to be wary if management siphoned off large bonuses  -even if they were tax efficient for the company - Beancounter said there was a need for the properly drawn-up service contracts that they had previously eschewed. As Beancounter ran through this myriad of problems, Growmore wondered why any investor would want to get involved. Granted there was the 20 per cent front-end tax break from investing through an EIS in unquoted companies. And, should Spotlight fail, Watson would be entitled to relief against CGT or income tax equal to 40 per cent of his net Pounds 80,000 investment. But what had probably swung him was the innovation that investors could become paid non-executives without losing their tax breaks. Watson would be a welcome addition to the board, particularly in the two years it would take to establish the German operation. Here again there were tax considerations. Spotlight planned to export directly but would start with a branch operation. This way, Beancounter said, Spotlight would get UK tax relief on the start-up costs of the German branch. The same tax losses could be carried forward for relief against future branch profits in Germany. Once the tax losses were fully absorbed by profits at the German branch, a German limited liability company - Spotlight GmbH - would be formed. That way Spotlight would benefit twice as it would have had tax relief on the same losses in both the UK and Germany. Spotlight would also consider forming a special exporting subsidiary in the UK to enable it to reclaim VAT on a monthly basis rather than quarterly as did the main company. Feeling increasingly smug, Growmore returned to a favourite theme of his. 'Tell me Jenny, what about this new legislation to give a right to interest on the late payment of debt?' She replied: 'Don't hold your breath pal. The chancellor said he is only looking at legislation. Anyway, the right to interest is a red herring, although I grant you we might get General Engine to pay earlier if legislation makes later payers look like pariahs. 'And one other thing. You do realise our earlier plans for Germany were based on the new plant we need being eligible for an enhanced first year capital allowance of 40 per cent. Your so-called champion of small business has thrown a real spanner in the works by cutting that allowance back to 25 per cent. Where does that leave us?'</p>

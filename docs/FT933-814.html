			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / International Company News: Travelers to double asset disposals to Dollars 2bn TRAVELERS, the US insurer which agreed to a bid last week from Mr Sanford Weill's financial services group Primerica, will double the pace of its property disposals by shedding more than Dollars 2bn of troubled assets next year. Mr Weill said he plans to reduce the insurer's distressed property portfolio to Dollars 2bn or less by the end of 1994, from Dollars 4.3bn now, a move that would mark an early rehabilitation for one of the US's biggest composite insurers. Referring to the plan, he said: 'If that happens, the problems will be behind us.' Mr Weill was speaking at the end of last week, shortly after the Travelers' board accepted an all-paper bid from Primerica worth Dollars 4.2bn for the remaining 73 per cent of the company it does not already own. Travelers expects to sell Dollars 1bn of distressed property assets in all this year. The acceleration of this programme reflects the greater capital resources available through the takeover by Primerica. In anticipation of the benefits from the takeover, the main US credit rating agencies last week said they would consider upgrading the insurer's credit ratings. The stockmarket also responded positively to the news, pushing up the combined market value of the two companies by the end of last week to Dollars 17.2bn, roughly the same as American Express, the US's biggest financial services group. Mr Weill, who has sat on Travelers' board since completing the purchase of 27 per cent of its shares at the beginning of this year, suggested there would be little overlap between the insurance company and the rest of the group. 'We didn't buy Travelers because of the synergies, but because it will be a good business in its own right,' he said. He added, though, that a review was under way to see whether any of Travelers' investment products could be sold through the 10,500-strong retail brokerage network run by Smith Barney Shearson, also part of Primerica. The takeover was more likely to boost revenues by improving Travelers' credit ratings, Mr Weill said. A stronger credit rating would help to attract substantially more life insurance business, since customers tended to be drawn to insurance companies which looked as though they would survive long into the future, he said. Mr Weill also suggested that the Travelers takeover would mark the culmination of his plans to create a diversified financial services group. 'We have no thoughts of any significant acquisitions at this stage,' he said, pointing to the spread of the proposed new group's earnings. He also added that, although each unit within the new group will be run independently, there were big cultural differences between the operations which would take time to overcome. Besides Travelers and Smith Barney Shearson, the US's second biggest retail stockbroker, the new group would have Dollars 140bn under management, making it the fifth biggest fund manager in the US.</p>

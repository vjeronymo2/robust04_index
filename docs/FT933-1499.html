			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: GIB aims to cut 3,300 jobs GIB GROUP, the retailer which is Belgium's biggest private-sector employer, is to cut 3,300 full-time jobs in its nationwide supermarket chain over the next three years. The GIB news came as the Belgian government, unions and employers prepared for talks aimed at restoring the competitiveness of Belgian companies. If the talks fail, the country's fragile centre-left coalition could fall. GIB blamed increased competition and high wage costs for putting the chain's future in jeopardy, in spite of cost-cutting over the last three years. GIB employs 70,000 people including franchises. Automobiles Peugeot, also confirmed yesterday it would cut 4,023 jobs. The past week has seen the announcement of more than 15,000 European job losses, prompting Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, to urge restraint on the part of industry.</p>

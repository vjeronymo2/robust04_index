			<p>BFN     [Text] In its statement today the Chechen opposition  categorically rejects terrorism as a way of achieving political  aims and urged the Chechen people to remain calm and not to  react to similar provocations. The statement was circulated  following the recent assassination attempt against Chechen  President Dzhokhar Dudayev.    In Chechnya any terrorist act may trigger off civil war with  unpredictable consequences, the statement underlined.    The opposition described the assassination attempt as a  result of the criminal policy of the Chechen leadership from the  very beginning aimed at linking up with criminal structures.    This proves that the leadership can exercise no real  influence on the situation which encourages different armed  groups seeking power. As a rule, such groups have no social  support and resort to terrorism, the statement said.</p>

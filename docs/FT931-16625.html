			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Punt remains slightly above its floor levels The punt remained slightly above its floor levels against the Belgian franc and D-Mark in thin trading in Ireland yesterday, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. Money market interest rates eased from their high levels on Monday. The one-month Dublin interbank rate fell to 19 per cent, having peaked at 43 per cent on Monday. Dealers said the market remained short of cash especially in one-month funds, mostly used by non-residents for speculative purposes. 'Interest rate protection of the punt has become an effective replacement of exchange controls,' one added. The central bank, in threatening to raise short-term interest rates from their present overnight level of 14 per cent, has forced the banks to show caution in lending large sums to non-residents. Further turmoil is expected at the end of the week, if tomorrow's Bundesbank meeting fails to cut German interest rates. Consensus is growing in Dublin that commercial interest rates could be forced up again in the next two weeks. The government revealed yesterday it overran its exchequer borrowing target of IPounds 590m by IPounds 123m in 1992. It is estimating a deficit of about IPounds 900m assuming no policy changes.</p>

Both before and since the enactment of the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435), the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) has actively promoted service to homeless and migrant populations. Further, particular attention has long been focused in the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended (42 U.S.C. 1771  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), on the needs of special populations, e.g. migrants and Native Americans. Section 17(f)(19) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1786(F)(19), requires that not less than nine-tenths of 1 percent of the sums appropriated any fiscal year for special supplemental food programs be available for services to eligible members of migrant populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an interim and a final rule on participation of homeless individuals in WIC, published in December 1989 and August 1992, respectively, the Department defined the term ``homeless individual'' based upon the definition provided legislatively in section 212(a) of the Hunger Prevention Act, Public Law 100&hyph;435 (42 U.S.C. 1786(b)(15)). This term identifies those otherwise eligible residents of specified overnight facilities who must be granted access to WIC when caseload is available, provided such facilities meet conditions insuring that residents, and not the facilities, benefit from the WIC Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The August 1992 final rule, 57 FR 34500 (August 5, 1992), amended the WIC regulations to require State agencies to include in their State Plans of Program Operation and Administration a description of how they will provide Program benefits to and meet the special nutrition education needs of homeless individuals (7 CFR 246.4(a) (6) and (9), respectively) and disseminate information about program availability and eligibility to organizations serving the homeless (7 CFR 246.4(a)(7)). The August 1992 final rule amended 7 CFR 246.10(f)(1) to allow States, upon approval by FNS, to make substitutions for foods normally required in the food package in order to accommodate the special circumstances of the homeless. Further, the August 1992 final rule amended 7 CFR 246.10(f) (2) and (3) to require that competent professional authorities take into account the special needs and problems of homeless individuals when prescribing supplemental foods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FNS has also shared with State WIC agencies successful initiatives and targeting strategies employed by other States to facilitate participation of homeless and migrant persons in the WIC Program. A number of State agencies have established local agency clinics and WIC certification offices in hotels and facilities which house homeless and migrant families. Other States have held statewide training sessions for their local WIC agencies to educate them about the special problems most frequently encountered by homeless individuals, and how WIC can help to alleviate some of these problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

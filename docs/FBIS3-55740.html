In a regular Monday radio interview he said that a  country which cannot instill law and order on its own did not  deserve independence.    This was his response to the statement made by parliament  speaker Vakhtang Goguadze Sunday that law and order could not  prevail in Georgia unless Russian troops were called in and  Georgia entered the ruble zone.    Nevertheless, Shevardnadze admitted that there could be no  law and order in Abkhazia and North Ossetia without Russian help.    Shevardnadze noted that entry into the ruble zone should be  given serious thought. In his words, the introduction of a  national currency in Georgia was an erroneous and premature  action. "The state and every family had to pay dearly for  this," he emphasized.    Shevardnadze said that during his visits to Turkey, France,  and the U.S., and talks with the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund, he might seek advice of foreign  statesmen on entry into the ruble zone.</p>

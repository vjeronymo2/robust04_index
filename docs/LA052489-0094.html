No  clashes were reported. Student groups had called for a week of protests in the  capital of Seoul and other cities to demand withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.  troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. Radical leaders say  the United States props up authoritarian rule in South Korea. Troops conducted  spot checks on many streets, questioning and searching people and taking away  suspects.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No DOC. /IP/94/381: "TACIS Continues To </F> Support the Improvement of Security of Nuclear Facilities in  NIS"]    [Text] TACIS, the European Union's programme of assistance  to the republics of the former Soviet Union, is working with the  partner countries to reinforce the security of the existing  reactors and other civilian nuclear facilities and to strengthen  the responsible supervisory bodies in this area. TACIS is by  far the largest donor in the world working with the new  independent states to improve nuclear safety.    TACIS has recently launched a number of new projects in  nuclear safety within the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Some  of these projects build on initial work carried out under  earlier TACIS projects, and prepare the way for continued TACIS  support.    At the Kalinin NPP [nuclear power plant], for instance,  TACIS  experts have been working for some time with the operators of  the plant to supervise the purchase of urgently needed  safety-related equipment. The Kalinin NPP will receive  laboratory analysis equipment within the coming weeks. A second  phase of the programme has recently been launched to install and  test the equipment and to train the relevant personnel in its  operation.    In addition, TACIS experts will remain on-site for the next  18 months to work with the plant operators on all aspects of  operation and maintenance and prepare technical specifications  for the purchase of additional safety equipment. Russian  experts will also travel to the EU member states to study the  operation of EU NPPs.    At the Kola NPP, TACIS experts are working to prepare for  the  installation of the new digital system to control the reactor  core. This system will significantly improve the safety level of  the reactor. The work of the TACIS experts involves defining  the current system, producing a detailed technical specification  and financial proposal for upgrading the system and an  implementation and testing schedule.    Tube cleaning and debris filter equipment for the Balakovo  NPP is being constructed, and will be sent to the plant in  August 1994.    The on-site component will be continued and widened with the  inclusion of a ninth site, the Zaporozhe NPP in Ukraine.  Projects will be carried out at the site, with equipment needs  met for up to 40 percent of the budget. Urgently needed spare  parts in large quantities are also being delivered to other  Ukrainian NPPs (Rovno and South Ukraine).    In another project, TACIS experts are making a detailed  study  of the degradation of the irradiated areas of reactor pressure  vessels. This study will provide an important insight into the  current state of irradiated vessels and the effectiveness of  maintenance procedures adopted to date.  <H5>  Studies </H5>   Some feasibility studies are already available, including  those for a vver-230 simulator and for an early warning system  (Ukraine and Belarus). The results of the latter are currently  being applied in a pilot project. A team of training personnel  at the main training centre in Russia is exchanging know-how  with the beneficiary, and a number of studies carried out at  various Russian NPPs cover subjects such as accident analysis,  vessel embrittlement, and quality assurance.    At the Chernobyl NPP in Ukraine, European Union experts have  carried out fire protection training and a decontamination  project for plant personnel. There is a separate  decontamination project for the area 30 km around Chernobyl,  plus a regional programme to provide social and economic  assistance to those who have suffered from the fall-out in  Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. The EU's Ukraine nuclear safety  programme has committed over 80 Mecu from 1992 to 1994 to  Ukraine.  <H5>  Safety Authorities </H5>   The enhancement of regulatory regimes responsible for the  safety of national nuclear installations was identified as a  priority under the TACIS nuclear safety programme. Assisstance  efforts aim to support the development of independent, legally  and technically competent regulatory authorities.    After several exploratory missions, two large projects were  launched in December 1993, for the benefit of Russian and  Ukrainian regulators. EU safety authorities have established a  detailed programme to assist in the development of a strong  legal and technical basis for the national regulators and their  support organisations. This includes the transfer of codes,  guidelines, and licensing procedures. The EU is also procuring  the infrastructure of the equipment, to be delivered in the  coming months, to improve the infrastructure of the regulators,  including the vital link between headquarters, regional offices,  and inspection centres.    At the Rovno NPP, Ukraine, a large-scale safety evaluation  of  vver-type reactors is currently nearing completion.  <H5>  Nuclear Safety Account </H5>   The EU has committed 20 Mecu to the nuclear safety account  fund, which will finance actions concentrating on urgent  upgrading for the least safe reactors in the CIS (rbmk and  vver-230). The decision has been taken so far to finance  upgrading projects at NPPs in Bulgaria and Lithuania, and  projects are being prepared to be carried out in Russia and  Ukraine.    International Science and Technology Centre (ISTC)    The union has committed 20 Mecu to the ISTC, designed to  develop and finance specific projects which aim to redirect the  skills of NIS weapons specialists towards civilian sectors and  therefore to reduce the risk of proliferation. The centre  became operational in March 1994, and a large series of  nuclear-related projects has been launched.</p>

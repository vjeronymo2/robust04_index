			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Steady growth eases pressure on Clarke to cut rates PRESSURE on Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to cut interest rates ahead of next month's Budget eased yesterday with the release of figures showing that the UK recovery did not falter in the third quarter. Contrary to the expectations of many economists who were forecasting a slight slowdown in the pace of recovery, the economy expanded steadily in July-September, growing 0.6 per cent on the previous three months. However, the figures show the recovery depends heavily on consumer spending and energy output rather than manufacturing, which declined over the quarter. The 0.6 per cent seasonally adjusted rise in gross domestic product in the third quarter left output 2 per cent up year on year. The quarterly rise was the same as the improvement between the first and second quarters of the year. Output excluding oil and gas production slowed, rising a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in the three months to September compared with increases of 0.6 per cent and 0.5 per cent in the first two quarters of the year. Compared with a year ago, non-oil GDP in the third quarter was 1.8 per cent higher. The economy has now expanded in five successive quarters. The growth compares favourably with other European Community countries, many of which remain in recession. But the latest figures show that energy production - boosted by a cool summer - and the services sector, are spearheading the recovery. The Central Statistical Office figures, which are provisional and incomplete, show that output from service industries rose 0.5 per cent on the previous quarter, and was up 2.7 per cent year on year. Manufacturing output, however, has been declining. Although no September figure is available, earlier CSO statistics showed that manufacturing output fell 0.7 per cent in the three months to August, as recession in continental Europe hit exports. In the service sector, distribution, hotels and catering grew 0.8 per cent quarter on quarter to stand 2.9 per cent up on a year ago. There were no figures for the other service sectors, but the CSO said transport sector output was up about 0.5 per cent while banking and financial services growth was 'robust'. Earlier this year, many economists described the recovery as 'perfect' with manufacturing output buoyant, inflation subdued and consumer activity relatively restrained. However, the recent drop in manufacturing output in the three months to August, three successive monthly rises in inflation and the latest provisional estimates of GDP suggest the pattern of demand has shifted.

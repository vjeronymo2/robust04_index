			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Montreux-Vevey Festival Have the organisers of the Montreux-Vevey Festival suddenly become aware that if they do not hurry, the 20th century will be over? After 47 years of existence the festival has acquired an image more solid than adventurous. It is stuffed with the names of well-known soloists and conductors likely to attract wealthy residents of that lotus-land and visitors who can afford the big hotels. However, this year most of the works came from the first half of this century, with a weekend of chamber music stretching as far as Stockhausen, Glass and Adams, also a new work commissioned in memory of Messiaen. The Franco-Swiss Honegger apart (this is his centenary year) native composers were hard to find. When it comes to outward-aimed cultural relations the Swiss appear to treat their own music as a more or less guilty secret, to be kept hidden from prying ears. The festival's final week brought an opportunity to visit one of Switzerland's shrines of culture. The Theatre du Jorat in the village of Mezieres near Lausanne has been described before on this page. This great barn, in its conversion an ancestor of the Maltings at Snape, was transformed early this century by the writer Rene Morax into a simple, roomy theatre with about 1,000 places, principally intended for drama but adaptable for concerts and occasional opera. Honegger's King David had its first performance there in 1921. The place is bare, but like most wooden buildings, friendly. On this evening it housed the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra under Emmanuel Joel, with Jean-Francois Antonioli as solo pianist. There were two works by Honegger, the concertino for piano and the second symphony (strings and trumpet). The concertino is an agreeable lightweight, somewhere between neo-classical Stravinsky and Ravel in his jazz mood. The first two movements of the second symphony with their soberly expressed grief suited the surroundings perfectly - as in the Maltings, strings sound beautifully natural. The busy finale, culminating navely but effectively in a chorale pealing out on the trumpet, can hardly fail to work. The soloist, Gerard Metrailler, also played Jolivet's first trumpet concerto (with piano obbligato), a Conservatoire test piece whose lumpy textures I find disagreeable. Earlier we heard the six 'little symphonies' of the year's other centenarian, Milhaud; pungent miniatures written over a period of six years from 1917. They were not intended for performance together: each 'symphony' uses a different chamber combination of strings and wind with, in the sixth, a vocal quartet. Thumbnail capriccios, by no means as casual as they seem at first, playing with styles as far apart as Brazil and Vienna, ranging in mood from blue melancholy to piquant mordancy, turning everything to personal use. This is the kind of experience one hopes for at a festival. There were some empty seats. Perhaps they would have been full if the organisers had laid on transport - Mezieres is not easily reached from Montreux and presumably even in this prosperous region not every music-lover has a car. Democracy is a house with many mansions but even so, for a village enterprise intended above all to be 'popular', it is surprising to have top seat prices at about Pounds 37 (SFr80) - in a Spartan, unheated building with bare benches. Montreux itself has been forced to make do with a provisional concert hall in the Congress Centre by the lake - a large, rectangular, low-ceilinged, one-level chamber which inflates and muddles orchestral sound. This was deafeningly demonstrated by the Suisse Romande Orchestra's concert under the regular conductor, Armin Jordan. In more senses than one a smashing programme - Roussel's third symphony, Ravel's left-hand piano concerto with Leon Fleisher as a commanding soloist, Janacek's sinfonietta - it could have been designed to show off the hall's bad points. And this was the same orchestra and conductor who made such sweet sounds for Louise in Geneva a few nights previously. Fortunately, the new Auditorium Stravinsky (the composer lived nearby for some years) is rising on an adjacent site and will soon be ready.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, April 3: The Federal Government was  looking out for around 200 Arab nationals whose visas were  cancelled in January. These Arab nationals were working with  NGO's [non- governmental organizations] involved in the welfare  and rehabilitation of the displaced Afghans.    Most of these people, stationed in Peshawar and engaged in  relief and rehabilitation activities were asked by the  government to leave the country by January 31. However, even  after the expiry of January 31 deadline the government knows  nothing about their whereabouts.    Out of these 200 around 150 are Egyptian nationals, 40  Tunisians and 8 from Algeria, says a report prepared by the  Federal Government.    The Egyptian authorities are convinced that the  assassination  attempt on President Hosni Mubarak was sponsored by the Egyptian  dissidents residing in Pakistan. President Mubarak had  personally conveyed this concern to former Prime Minister,  Muhammad Nawaz Sharif. The then Pakistani PM had explained that  his country had nothing to do with the terrorists and would  extradite the Arab nationals from its soil.    "It is presumed that these people had left the country, says  a high level government official in Islamabad. But to which  country they have gone the government is not sure.    The Government of Pakistan, the officials said, was very  clear on the subject. Since the Afghan Jehad has ended all the  foreign nationals involved in the activity must leave the  country, the official said.    "There will be no visa extension for them and those granted  extensions should consider them void," said the officials. The  government he said was determined to clear itself of the  allegations that Pakistan was sponsoring terrorist activities.  The Pakistani soil would not be allowed for any activities  against any other state against any other state, he said.    Following the cancellation of visas of these Arab nationals,  several reminders were sent to the NWFP government asking for  report on the implementation of the federal government's  directive for the extradition of the Arab nationals. The  provincial government, however, had so far failed to reply to  any of these directives.    The officials were of the view that the government of  Pakistan had no desire to keep such people in the country as  they could be dangerous for the country's security too."    However, the Government of Pakistan cannot hand over the  culprits to the Governments of Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia.  Pakistan is making efforts to hammer out extradition treaties  with at least three of the Arab countries including Saudi  Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The signing of the  treaties will facilitate exchange of criminals.    Officials, however, could not confirm that Pakistan, during  1993, had extradited 3,000 Arab nationals as stated by Federal  Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider.</p>

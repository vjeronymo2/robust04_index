According to information  allegedly received from people around the president, Boris  Yeltsin has a serious pneumonia, which called for hemodialysis  [gemodializ], rather than a slight cold as the president's press  service maintains. According to experts, these rumors were  provoked by U.S. President Bill Clinton's statement about a  "technical impossibility" of contacting the Russian Federation  president.</p>

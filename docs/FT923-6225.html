			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / D-Mark at new highs as bonds and equities fall: Concern over European union adds to rate rise fears CONCERN that the move towards European economic and monetary union may grind to a halt sent the D-Mark to fresh highs yesterday and triggered another large fall in bonds and equities across Europe. The stronger D-Mark led to new strains on the dollar and weaker currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, increasing expectations of interest rate rises in Europe, particularly the UK and Italy. A senior US official said in Washington that action by Germany was necessary to end the instability in the currency markets. He said US policy had been 'consistent for months' in urging the Bundesbank to reduce its high short-term interest rates, which had encouraged more funds into the D-Mark. The instability on world markets will be discussed tomorrow in Paris at a meeting of finance ministry officials from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations - US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, UK and Canada. A French opinion poll yesterday indicated a No vote in next month's referendum on ratification of the Maastricht treaty, which would block moves towards EMU and undermine investor confidence in the European exchange rate mechanism. This could lead to large selling of fragile currencies such as the pound and the Italian lira. At one stage yesterday, sterling dropped to within half a pfennig of its ERM floor of DM2.778. It finished in London at its lowest ERM close, at DM2.7875, down 1 1/4 pfennigs. The lira brushed its floor against the German currency, before closing at L764.3. In New York, sterling was trading at DM2.788 at the close, while the lira was quoted at L764. Early today sterling was trading at DM2.79 shortly after Japanese markets opened, with the lira at L764.15. Mr John Major, the prime minister, and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, discussed the pound's weakness at a one-hour meeting. Officials said the government would continue to defend the pound by whatever means were necessary. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, repeated Labour's call for government action. Speaking after a meeting of senior shadow ministers at Mr John Smith's Edinburgh home, he said the government had failed to raise confidence or convince the country of an early revival in the economy. 'The government is doing nothing because it doesn't know what to do,' he said. Fears that European currencies will need to be supported by a rise in interest rates again took a toll on equity markets. In London, the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares came back from a 50-point fall to close 30.1 down at 2,281.0. This followed a 54-point decline on Monday. The fall in London prices reflected concern on the money markets that a rise in base rates, now at 10 per cent, was imminent. Sterling cash dealers priced in a one-point rise in base rates. Two-month forward contracts in sterling were offered at the same price as the currency's ERM floor. Gloom about the economy was not confined to London. In Frankfurt, the DAX index fell 2 per cent to its lowest close since February last year. In Paris, prices fell 1.3 per cent, to an eight-month low, while bond markets also suffered with UK gilts losing about half a point. The dollar held its ground in early US trading, but fell sharply after reports of lower-than-expected confidence among US consumers. The US currency fell to a low of DM1.3940, but recovered to close at DM1.4000 in London and DM1.40225 in New York. It opened in Tokyo today at DM1.40325. In Washington, a senior US official said the dollar was not 'in a crisis situation'. He refused to rule out further large intervention by the world's central banks to prop up the dollar, following five such actions in the past month. He said: 'We have weapons at our disposal, but the market is a very significant force.' The official sounded a note of optimism on the possibility of an easing in German monetary policy. 'At some point, we're going to get there,' he said, noting the slowing of the German economy and the recent cuts in inflation.

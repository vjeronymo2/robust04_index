			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal contains information collection requirements in &sect;&sect;75.312, 75.342, 75.360, 75.363, 75.364 and 75.382. These paperwork requirements have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The respondents would be mine operators. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.312 includes the time to record any fan monitoring system malfunctions, electrical or mechanical deficiencies in the monitoring system and any sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure, the time for recording main mine fan defects that are corrected and for the mine foreman and mine superintendent to countersign the record. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.342 includes the time to develop a written maintenance program, to record the calibration tests and to file the record. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.360 includes the expanded examination time and the time for the mine superintendent to countersign the records. The burden hour estimates for &sect;75.362 includes the expanded examination time. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.363 includes the time for recording the hazard, the corrective action taken, the certified person initialing the record, the mine foreman and mine superintendent countersigning the record and for filing the record. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.364 includes the time for the mine superintendent to countersign the records. The burden hour estimate for &sect;75.382 includes the time for recording the results of the examination, for the mine foreman and the mine superintendent to countersign the record, and for filing the record. The information collected would be used by MSHA to assess compliance with the proposed requirements. The information collection requirements contained in the proposal are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;75.312(g)(1) would require that the records of all defects found during the daily fan examination be made by the end of the shift on which the examination is made. The record would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (g)(2)(i) would require that the certified copies of data produced by the fan monitoring systems be maintained separate from other computer generated reports or data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (g)(2)(ii) would require that a record be made of any fan monitoring system malfunction, electrical or mechanical deficiency in the monitoring system and any sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure. The record would be made by the end of the shift on which the review of the data is completed and would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (g)(3) would require that at mines permitted to shut down main mine fans under &sect;75.311, if a pressure recording device is not used, a record be made of the time and fan pressure immediately before the fan is stopped, and after the fan is restarted and the fan pressure stabilizes. The record would be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (g)(4) would require that a record of the results of the tests be made by the end of the shift on which the monthly test of the automatic fan signal device or the automatic closing doors is completed. Persons making these tests would record the results of the tests in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (g)(5) would require that the records required under paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(4) be countersigned by the mine foreman, and the mine superintendent, mine manager, or other mine official to whom the mine foreman is directly accountable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA estimates that it would take about 4 minutes for the mine foreman and mine superintendent to countersign the records and would take an additional 5 minutes to record main mine fan defects corrected and an additional 10 minutes to record any fan monitoring system malfunctions, electrical or mechanical deficiencies in the monitoring system and any sudden increase or loss in mine ventilating pressure. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected mines would be 29,608 hours of which large mines would incur 9,657 hours and small mines would incur 19,951 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph &sect;75.342(a)(4)(ii) would require mine operators to develop and adopt a written maintenance program that would have to be made available for inspection by authorized representatives of the Secretary and the representative of miners. MSHA estimates that it would take about 1 hour to develop a written maintenance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (a)(4)(iii) would require that a record of all calibration tests of methane monitors be made in a state-approved book or in a bound book with sequential machine-numbered pages.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (a)(4)(iv) would require the record of the calibration tests to be kept for one year from the date of the test and to be retained at a surface location at the mine and made available for inspection by authorized representatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Secretary and the representative of miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A record of calibration tests would be required to be made monthly at all mines. MSHA estimates that it would take about 5 minutes to complete a record. The total estimated recordkeeping burden for all affected mines that concerns developing a written maintenance program and maintaining a record of tests would be 2,910 hours of which large mines would incur 1,464 hours and small mines would incur 1,446 hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

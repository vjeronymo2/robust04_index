			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RULES AGAINST MAIN DEFENSE CLAIM OF ANTI-ABORTIONISTS  </P> <P> In a setback for anti-abortion activists, a Municipal Court judge ruled Tuesday  that Operation Rescue leaders cannot attempt to justify their March 25 blockade  of a women's clinic by claiming that they were preventing "murder."  </P> <P> "There is no way it can be shown that abortions were stopped that day," Judge  Richard A. Paez told Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry and four  co-defendants, all of whom face trial on misdemeanor counts of trespass and  conspiracy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Blocks Use of Defense  </P> <P> Paez's ruling blocked use of the so-called "defense of necessity," which holds  that laws can be broken in the interest of preventing greater harm, and cleared  the way for the trial to begin. Jury selection started Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Terry and the four others are the first of 539 anti-abortionists who face  trial. The charges stem from a sit-in staged at Family Planning Associates on  Westmoreland Avenue last March in which hundreds of Operation Rescue supporters  blocked entrances at the clinic in an effort to disrupt services. The  demonstration, part of a "Holy Week" crusade against abortion, resulted in the  arrest of about 780 people.  </P> <P> Even if abortions had been prevented that day, Paez said, the law then and now  is clear: women in California have a right to an abortion during the first 24  weeks of pregnancy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rules Out Some Witnesses  </P> <P> "This is a case of trespass, of conspiracy to trespass, of obstruction of a  lawful business," Paez said. He said he would not permit the defense to call as  witnesses "experts" on whether life starts with conception, nor to display  photos of fetuses on the counsel table.  </P> <P> Terry reacted angrily to the judge's ruling. Claiming that his defense had been  "gutted" even before it began, he accused the judiciary of becoming the "lap  dog of the death industry."  </P> <P> "Can pro-lifers get a fair trial anywhere in this country?" he asked a crowd of  reporters outside the courtroom.  </P> <P> Tuesday's proceedings were without the placard-waving anti-abortion  demonstrators who prayed and sang at the Los Angeles County Courthouse on  Monday. Only a handful of supporters joined Terry on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Prosecutors from the city attorney's office had asked for Paez's ruling as a  way to prevent the trial from being turned into an arena of debate over  abortion. They conceded, however, that the abortion issue will continue to play  a part in the proceedings.  </P> <P> Paez said he will allow the defendants to explain why they staged the  demonstration at the clinic, and the defense attorneys said they will  capitalize on that opening to present their views on abortion.  </P> <P> "We'll put on a defense of why they were there," said Cyrus Zal, one of the  defense attorneys. "They'll know what the issue is."  </P> <P> With the necessity-defense issue aside, prosecutors turned to other matters.  Deputy City Atty. Lara Bloomquist asked the judge to prohibit Zal from praying  at "strategic moments" in the trial, such as when the prosecution makes its  arguments, and from prominently displaying a Bible.  </P> <P> Zal objected: "The Bible is my first book of reference, for law and for my  personal life."  </P> <P> Paez said that while he would not order Zal to put away the Bible, the defense  attorney will have to refrain from "flashing" it to the jurors.  </P> <P> Facing trial with Terry are Jeff White, 31, of Santa Cruz, Andrew Eppink, 41,  of Palmdale, Donald Bennette, 36, of Mission Viejo and Michael McMonagle, 36,  of Philadelphia. Terry, 30, of Binghamton, N.Y., is representing himself, as  are White and McMonagle.  </P> <P> The defendants, who earlier pleaded not guilty, are charged with trespassing,  resisting arrest, blocking a sidewalk, failure to disperse, violating court  orders and criminal conspiracy. The maximum penalty is $10,000 and one year in  jail.  </P> <P> In an effort to strengthen their hand, defense attorneys had argued that the  Family Planning Associates clinic was engaged in unlawful activity, claiming  that it performs abortions after the 20-week period, in violation of a ban set  forth in the 1967 California Therapeutic Abortion Act. That law, however, was  rendered moot by the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on Roe vs. Wade that  grants a woman's right to an abortion.  </P> <P> The defense then sought to argue that the court's July 7 decision on Webster  vs. Missouri should be used to revive the California Therapeutic Abortion Act  because it allows states to ban late-trimester abortions based on the possible  "viability" of the fetus.  </P> <P> But Paez was not swayed. The Webster ruling has had no impact on California, he  said, and it would be up to the state Legislature, not the courts, to introduce  viability as a criterion for abortions. Furthermore, the Operation Rescue  demonstrations occurred long before the Webster decision was handed down.  </P> <P> The court drama is being played out against the backdrop of what anti-abortion  activists claim is a resurgence of their crusade. Operation Rescue has  announced a weeklong series of activities for Los Angeles and Southern  California, culminating in another demonstration planned for an undisclosed  clinic on Saturday.  </P> <P> Several dozen anti-abortion protesters on Tuesday gathered at a "funeral" in  the Odd Fellows Cemetery on Whittier Boulevard. Placed in a child's casket and  buried in a grave was what spokesmen identified as a 16-week-old aborted fetus.  </P> <P> Operation Rescue also denounced what it described as vandalism at a Long Beach  church where members have held meetings. Clothes hangers and pro-choice slogans  had been painted in red on the church's walls. No one has been arrested in  connection with the vandalism.  </P></p>

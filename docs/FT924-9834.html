			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Iberdrola hopes for 10% rise in group profits MR INIGO Oriol, the chairman of Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, said he was hopeful 1992 group profits would rise about 10 per cent. In 1991, pre-tax profit rose 40 per cent to Pta96.12bn (Dollars 863.6m), Reuter reports from Madrid. He said last month's peseta devaluation should not have any adverse effect providing provisions could be spread out over several years. Otherwise he saw a Pta8bn provision next year. Mr Oriol spoke after a shareholders' meeting to approve terms for completing a merger between Iberdrola I and Iberdrola II, which will create Spain's largest private sector utility. He said profits rose about 9 per cent in the first nine months.</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Books: Family sagas through slices of history - Fiction MOTHER RUSSIA by Bernice Rubens Chapmans Pounds 14.99, 443 pages THE PRECIOUS GIFT by John Bowen Sinclair-Stevenson Pounds 14.95, 188 pages A DUBIOUS LEGACY by Mary Wesley Bantam Prress Pounds 14.99, 270 pages FLYING INTO LOVE by D M Thomas Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 261 pages THE CHANGING rhythms of history mark each of these novels: the colour and horror of 20th century Russia and America for Rubens and Thomas; the turnabout in social mores and morals from post-war to contemporary Britain for Bowen and Wesley. Mother Russia traces the fates of two families, one aristocratic, the other peasant, from the same Russian village, through war, revolution, Stalinism and glasnost. In both families, there is the revolutionary brother and the reactionary one, and their inevitable role reversals as victim and aggressor; and then the youngest children, Sasha and Anna, born on the same day in 1900 and suckled together by the peasant mother, one a poet, the other his muse, who marry across class boundaries and continue to stand for love against ideology and brutal conviction. They live in a heightened state of terror yet hysterical hope; separated for years, they search Russia, by train, on foot, for one another; ending up at the home of protective brother Ivan, they watch him turn from revolutionary spirit to KGB torturer. Epic in conception, unflagging in moral energy, the scope of Bernice Rubens' novel commands only admiration. Old Rubens themes light up here in a new constellation: the need for faith, the effect of apocalyptic movements on individuals and families. There is her tender-rigorous prose; the purring way she enhances her shocks ('the noose laced his neck', 'the rage comforted and clothed him', 'a ragged regiment of thugs . . . coagulated by a raving lunatic'); her ability to draw minor characters - the revolutionary idealist Pavlenkov, losing faith and weeping for his wife as he is hung, the old Jewish printer Chernov, stumbling into the hands of Tsarist police while others escape - with whom we shiver, fear, melt at the knees. But this is a fatally uneven work. Halfway through, Rubens' grip slackens, precisely tuned detail gives way to a glib encapsulation of recent history. Climax follows climax; rape, decapitation, torture, Nazi spying and shootings occur within a few pages; parallels between families are forced; the story becomes a history lesson ('There are other causes beside the revolution. The making of poetry is one of them'). We get schematic writing instead of surprise, explanation instead of authenticity - and without a setting which is the very essence of the tale, which feels as deeply and instantly Russian as Nadine Gordimer's novels are South African or Bashevis Singer's Polish, Mother Russia ceases to be a serious historical novel and ends an upmarket blockbuster. John Bowen's The Precious Gift is a thriller which is that and much more. Sarah, a young mother in retreat from London, finds the skeleton of a pregnant woman in her Warwickshire garden. If this was murder, it happened 40 years ago and the police give it a low priority, but Sarah becomes obsessed with the victim, and in playing detective she unleashes a small torrent of fear, resentment and panicky concealment in the local village. As in Bowen's last novel, Fighting Back, sudden rural violence is seamlessly incorporated into what appears to be a quiet story of English village life. The mood, crossing social realism and class satire with film noir and a touch of Arsenic and Old Lace, is all Bowen's own; the language is deadpan, authoritative, stylish. A psychologist as acute on the frustrated schoolteacher and vicar's wife of the 1940s as on the 1990s desperate professional or yuppy housewife, he manages to sketch alliances across half a century without ever letting characters degenerate into mere types. Fulfilment, independence, the imaginative versus the actual life, women's roles and options are his wider themes, sensitively handled and with always a hint that dark fantasies - any character's wildest dreams - could just tip over into the reality of murder. Horror in Mary Wesley's novels is of the comfortable Gothic sort: here a mad wife causes havoc from the bedroom of a country mansion and an eccentric cockatoo troubles guests at dinner. A Dubious Legacy is the story of wealthy Henry, who has inherited house, spouse and bird, and his relationship from the 1950s to the 1980s with his friends' wives Antonia and Barbara, as they grow over the decades from innocence to worldliness. Ms Wesley breezes along with customary grace and nonchalance, sniping maliciously at her characters while giving them a more or less good time, chuckling in the face of disaster, smartening up a skimpy plot with comic turns or a spot of torture for the wretched cockatoo whenever predictability threatens to settle in. Ms Wesley belongs to the stiff upper lip school of fiction; her chin only wobbles at the thought of all those weekend extravaganzas and Chelsea afternoons that peal like bells through her pages. Her hero Henry tries to recreate his parents' pre-war lifestyle; Ms Wesley seems to me to yearn for the guileful elegance of Coward or Maugham and to reconstitute set-piece English marital comedy in a near-contemporary environment: brittle, amusing but seldom staying in the mind. Finally, back to international history and DM Thomas's look at Kennedy's assassination through the dreams and reveries of a nun who has shaken hands with him, of Lee Harvey Oswald, and of JFK himself. Ten thousand dreams a night, a Dallas psychologist tells Sister Agnes in Flying Into Love, are dreamt about Kennedy's murder. Thomas, slicing in and out of a Texas convent and the triple underpass in Dealy Plaza through which Kennedy's motorcade dashed to hospital, shunting between 1963 and 1992, tries to create a meaningful melange of these illusions and fantasies, but the result is a messy pudding of aimless episodes and overblown dramas. Flying Into Love has neither narrative power nor a particularised vision; Thomas's skill as a vivid scene-maker sometimes shines through, but here his energy is wasted in empty showmanship.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Congressman Frank McCloskey is visiting  Sarajevo. The U.S. visitor was today received by Presidency  member and President of the Serbian Civic Council Mirko  Pejanovic.    In the course of the meeting the topic most discussed was  the  possibility of the Serbs joining the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Federation. Moreover, the work of the Serbian Consultative  Council and the Serbian Civic Council was also discussed, as  were the possibilities for the return of Bosnian Serb refugees.  Mirko Pejanovic acquainted the distinguished visitor with the  new wave of ethnic cleansing that Karadzic's Serbs are carrying  out in the areas of Banja Luka, Prijedor, and other places that  are under their control. He asked McCloskey to strive for the  United States' increased engagement in the region, because this  great [word indistinct] is well-known precisely for the  protection of human rights and liberties. If we fail in halting  the Serbian fascism, I am not sure that we will be able to stop  other fascism in these areas, said Pejanovic, and once again  appealed to McCloskey to influence the United States' increased  engagement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. McCloskey promised to do  everything in his power to achieve -- through the consultative  bodies of the U.S. Congress -- an increased U.S. presence in the  solution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis.    The distinguished U.S. visitor was also received by the  Chief  of General Staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Supreme Command  Rasim Delic. On this occasion, Mr. McCloskey showed interest in  the progress of the implementation of the signed agreement  between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the Croatian Defense  Council [HVO] and the implementation of the UN Security Council  resolutions adopted so far. He also showed interest in the  situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts, particularly in the  situation in Gorazde after the Serbian aggressor's latest  offensive. General Delic informed Mr. McCloskey about the  situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts with special stress  on the situation in Gorazde and Bihac. He reiterated that all  that was happening in Gorazde and Bihac is yet another  expression of the Serbian aggressor's defiance of the  international community. General Delic also explained the  Bosnia- Herzegovina Army's position regarding the situation in  Sarajevo and regarding many other details important for grasping  the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

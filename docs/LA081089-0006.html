			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> START OF TRIALS DELAYED FOR ABORTION PROTESTERS  </P> <P> The mass trials of some of more than 200 abortion protesters didn't begin as  scheduled Wednesday because of two last-minute deals, including one that seemed  likely to settle about half the cases, lawyers on both sides said.  </P> <P> Talks in connection with a second batch of cases did not produce a settlement,  however, so the first trials in those cases are scheduled to begin next week,  the lawyers said.  </P> <P> The first group of cases involves those activists charged with infractions. The  second bloc involves more-serious misdemeanors. The protesters face charges in  connection with arrests April 8, April 29 and June 10 at San Diego-area  clinics.  </P> <P> The infraction cases appeared to be resolved because the two sides agreed to a  defense proposal first made Wednesday morning, said James M. Bishop, head  deputy city attorney.  </P> <P> In exchange for a plea of no contest to the infraction -- primarily a trespass  charge -- prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence to San Diego Municipal  Judge John M. Thompson of one-day's community service, Bishop and defense  attorney Timothy C. Rutherford said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Performed Through Agencies  </P> <P> Thompson said from the bench at a hearing Wednesday morning, confirming the  bargain, that the service would be performed through agencies already on a  court eligibility list. Although the protesters will not be able to suggest  appropriate service, he said, that service will not conflict with their  anti-abortion stance.  </P> <P> To make the deal final, Rutherford said, he and lead defense lawyer Gregory J.  Anthony need to get approval from each of the protesters involved in the about  110 infraction charges. But he said it was "very likely to go down."  </P> <P> The activists facing misdemeanor charges, meanwhile, agreed Wednesday to waive  their right to a speedy trial. In return, prosecutors agreed to try them in  groups of five.  </P> <P> Originally, prosecutors had been prepared to try the protesters in four sets,  one of 66, the others of 41, 19 and eight.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Take a Year  </P> <P> Thompson said that, given the scheduling flexibility, the 20 or so trials will  begin next Wednesday and run one after another. The whole process might take  more than a year, he said.  </P> <P> Thompson set a pretrial hearing for Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's still going to clog the system, but it won't have the massive effect  trying them in groups of 60 might have," Bishop said.  </P> <P> After agreeing to trials in groups of five, prosecutors and defense lawyers  could not agree in talks that took all of Wednesday afternoon about how to  settle the misdemeanor cases.  </P> <P> "It's been the same problem all along," Bishop said. "The defense does not want  any probation whatsoever, and we naturally want probation to ensure that we and  the police and the citizens are not put through this again."  </P> <P> Prosecutors insist that a condition of the probation include a directive that  the protesters not engage in similar activity, Bishop said.  </P> <P> The misdemeanor charges include trespass, failure to disperse, resisting arrest  and eight charges of conspiracy, Bishop said. Some of the protesters face  multiple charges.  </P> <P> More than 220 people were arrested in the three protests, but some chose to  forfeit bail and had their cases dismissed.  </P> <P> Prosecutors revealed Wednesday that a deputy assigned to the cases had received  telephone threats. In addition, Bishop said, other deputies had received "lots  of hate mail."  </P></p>

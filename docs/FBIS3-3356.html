The protesters, including now elderly victims of Japan's  wartime aggression, were taken into custody Friday on the eve of  Hosokawa's arrival in Beijing for an official visit to China.    Many of the elderly came to the Chinese capital by train  from  Hebei and Jiangsu Provinces, the sources said, adding they will  be turned over to the Beijing offices of their home provinces.    The sources said Tong Zeng, leader of the unofficial victims  of Japanese War Crimes Reparations Committee, was still in  police custody Sunday. He was arrested Friday morning.    They said a petition drive to win Tong's freedom is under  way  among Chinese intellectuals in Beijing.    In a welcoming banquet speech on Saturday, Prime Minister  Hosokawa called on China to improve its human rights record,  saying human rights are a universally accepted value.    The Chinese Government has been sensitive about demanding  war  compensation for civilian casualties from Japan reportedly  because it is afraid it could damage favorable official ties  that include as much as 1.2 trillion yen in loans.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia can implement a comprehensive program to  advance its fuel and energy complex, to secure an energy surplus  and, in the long run, enable Russia to stay an industrialized  country, the Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik  has declared in an interview with the Oil Information Agency.    The fuel and energy complex will, in his words, be developed  by supporting big integrated companies and by encouraging  investment in viable oil and gas, coal, and energy enterprises.  In his opinion, the Russian government's major achievement has  been its policy to consolidate the Russian fuel and energy  complex's positions world wide and its promotion of economic  cooperation with the neighboring states."    He recalled in this connection that Russia and Ukraine had  agreed to turn the Lisichan oil refinery in Ukraine into a  joint-stock company with Russia to share up to 60 percent of its  stock. He also recalled that Russia and Belarus had agreed to  share the stock of the Mozyrskiy oil refinery. Russian oil  companies will take part in oil and gas projects in  Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan.    One of the biggest Russian oil companies Lookoil has signed  with the Azerbaijani government an agreement on a 10 percent  participation of the company in a major international project to  develop the Azeri and Charak deposits. Besides, Lookoil and  Ajip of Italy intend to boost oil extraction in Tunisia.  According to Lookoil experts, oil gushed out of the first well  drilled by Russian specialists in Tunisia. Russian specialists  will also prospect for oil and develop oil fields in Nigeria.    Shafranik described as a contract of strategic importance  the  agreement signed by Russia, Kazakhstan, Oman and the American  Chevron company to set up a Caspian pipe-line consortium. Such  a consortium has come into being and has worked out a project to  lay a long-distance oil pipe line from Tengiz to Novorossiysk  via Komsomolskaya and Tikhoretsk to transport up to 62 million  tonnes of oil a year. The plan also provides for building an  oil terminal at Novorosiysk with an annual capacity of 15  million tonnes.    "This is the only project to ship oil from Kazakhstan within  the coming 20-30 years. Quite autonomous terminals of our  industry have already provided for 25 percent of export there.  We have also managed to keep and stabilize oil extraction in  Vietnam. We have secured an agreement on a Sakhalin-2 tender,  have sped up work on Sakhalin-1, have made Sakhalin-3 and  Sakhalin-4 tenders possible, which is a tremendous success since  a bonus to the tender sponsors alone will fetch $130 million,"  Shafranik reported.</p>

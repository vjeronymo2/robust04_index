			<p>CSO     [Text] Abulaidi Amudurexiti and Amudun Niyaz, Xinjiang  Autonomous Region leaders, give high regards to a letter sent by  peasants from the village of Bohetaikeli in Shufu county to  resolve the matter of a lack of rural peasant funds to repair  rural roads during this people's congress session.    The village of Bohetaikeli in Shufu county has been known  far  and wide since 1952 when Chairman Mao responded to a letter from  its peasants. In January 1994 General Secretary Jiang Zemin  wrote another letter in reply to the peasants there. Abulaidi  Amudurexiti and Amudun Niyaz made a special trip to the village  to read out General Secretary Zemin 's response, making the  village a focal hot spot. In recent years, endless streams of  people have gone there to visit, travel, or do business. To  accelerate the economic growth of the entire village, in 1993  the peasants there collected funds to repair a rural road which  requires a total of 680,000 yuan. Beyond the 400,000 yuan which  the peasants collected, another 280,000 yuan is needed. During  this people's congress, Abulaidi Amudurexiti will take the  village peasants' reply letter to the communications office of  the autonomous region for the chairman. After the leadership of  the office studies it and comes to a decision, it will disburse  to the village 280,000 yuan to help the peasants repair the road  as soon as possible.</p>

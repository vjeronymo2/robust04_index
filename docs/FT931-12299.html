			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Nortel chief goes in 'orderly transition' DR PAUL Stern is stepping down as chief executive officer of Northern Telecom, just two days after the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker unveiled unexpectedly strong 1992 earnings. The company stressed yesterday that the initiative came from Dr Stern and did not fit the pattern set by the string of executives who have been forced from the top jobs of troubled North American companies. A spokesman said that the move marked 'an orderly transition of a financially-strong company'. With a background in the telecommunications and computer industries, Dr Stern's name is bound to surface as a potential candidate to replace Mr John Akers as chief executive of IBM. Mr Akers announced earlier this week that he would be stepping down once the computer giant has chosen a successor. Prior to joining Nortel, Dr Stern held a senior position at Unisys, the US computer group. Despite Nortel's strong financial performance, signs of tensions in the executive suite surfaced last year when Mr Jean Monty, head of its sister company, Bell Canada, was named president and chief operating officer. The move has been widely interpreted as an effort by BCE, the Montreal-based conglomerate which owns 53 per cent of Nortel, to rein in Dr Stern. Mr Monty will take over as Nortel's chief executive on March 1. Dr Stern will remain as non-executive chairman. He will also become a visiting professor at the Wharton business school and pursue other unspecified interests. Known for his strong-willed and opinionated management style, Dr Stern, aged 54, spearheaded a strategy to expand Nortel's business outside North America. Northern reported 1992 earnings of USDollars 536m, up from Dollars 497m in 1991. See Management page</p>

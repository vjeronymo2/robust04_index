			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed CV/LL/SH: "Lucerne: End of Investigation </F> Into a Drug Trafficking Network--14 Arrested"]    [Text] Lucerne, 8 Jun (ATS) -- The Lucerne police forces  have concluded an investigation into a drug trafficking network.  A total of 14 individuals have been arrested since February  thanks to the cooperation between the Swiss and foreign police  forces. The investigators disclosed on Wednesday [8 June] that  2.4 kg of cocaine had been seized. However, the real "heads" of  the network have not been unmasked. One of them lived in  Lucerne. He received supplies of cocaine from Brazil through  different channels. The drug was meant mainly for the "markets"  of Lucerne and Zurich, the police said. Since February, 12  individuals have been apprehended in Switzerland and two others  abroad. During the investigation, the police seized several  Brazilian passports that had been stolen or bought on the black  market. Moreover, cars have been confiscated as well as 180,000  francs.    Unfortunately, it has proved impossible to locate the  headquarters of the network. According to the chief of the  criminal police of Lucerne, the traffickers were partly  "financed by a Middle Eastern country."</p>

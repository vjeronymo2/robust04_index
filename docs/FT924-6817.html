			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Land Securities feels pressure - Rise to Pounds 116m midway, but rental market deteriorates LAND SECURITIES, the UK's biggest property company, yesterday announced a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 112m to Pounds 116m for the six months to September 30. The improvement, in the face of a sharp decline in the property market, reflected the stability of Land Securities' portfolio, three quarters of which is secured by leases that expire after the year 2000, with upwards-only rent reviews. However, profits growth is coming under pressure from the further deterioration in the rental market and the impact of interest rate cuts on earnings from cash deposits. Mr Peter Hunt, chairman, warned that the slowdown in profits growth, highlighted by a comparison of these results with the Pounds 115.7m earned in the second half of last year, indicated 'a flattening trend which will continue until such time as rental growth returns.' The board said it was concentrating on maintaining and wherever possible increasing rental income and minimising voids, irrecoverable outgoings and other costs. Outgoings it could not recover on empty properties have risen to 3 per cent of the annual rent roll. The rental value of unlet premises within the development and refurbishment programme is now Pounds 10m, compared with over Pounds 12m in May. Other voids, excluding vacant properties held for future development or refurbishment, had increased slightly to just over 2.5 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 14.85p to 15.43p. The interim dividend is increased from 6p to 6.3p. COMMENT The defensive qualities that protected Land Securities' investors since the start of the property crash have stood them in less good stead over the last month. The shares underperformed the sector as the attractions of conservative management and relatively low gearing dulled in favour of cheaper and more interest rate sensitive stocks. Indeed, interest rate cuts have been positively harmful to Land Securities, which has fixed-rate debt and a substantial cash balance. This is one among several pressures on the company's income - diminishing reversionary growth, increased outgoings on empty properties and impending lease expiries, especially in the London market. But the security of the company's dividend is reassuring at a time of widespread dividend cuts in the sector - even though this dividend increase is the first below 10 per cent for the past 14 years. A prospective dividend yield of 7 3/4 per cent provides support for the shares, although on the basis of full-year net asset forecasts of between Pounds 4.70 and Pounds 5, the shares at 423p are on a tight discount.</p>

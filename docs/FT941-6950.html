			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Property: Sales figures suggest a January thaw - Cadogan's Place January figures from the Corporate Estate Agents property index, based on a survey of 4,200 offices making up about half the UK estate agency market, show a good start to 1994. Net completed sales, at 31,100, were 118 per cent up on December 1993, if marginally down on January 1993, and gross sales (those which have been agreed and should be proceeding) were 67 per cent up on December 1993. Both figures reflect buyers' increasing optimism. * * * In London's Docklands, Savills has sold the last apartment at New Crane Wharf, E1. Marketing of the 142 flats began almost six years ago at the top of the market and the final one went for Pounds 260,000, with two other buyers chasing it. The price in May 1988 was more than Pounds 500,000. Information from Winkworth in St John's Wood, north London, shows how the market is turning. Over the past year, the firm has sold three three-bedroom, two-bathroom flats on the Queensmead Estate, NW8, which are almost identical in size, layout and condition. One, for which the asking price in February 1993 was Pounds 275,000, went for Pounds 250,000. The second sold in August for Pounds 280,000 (asking price Pounds 295,000) and the third earlier this month for Pounds 315,000 (asking price Pounds 310,000). * * * The black and white Cruck House in Eardisley, 15 miles from Hereford, was built around 1400 and is the ideal of a country cottage which its owners - Weekend FT readers David and Margaret Gorvett - are selling themselves. The price is Pounds 118,500 (call: 0544-327- 529). Last year, Eardisley started its own night patrols against burglars, who have vanished. * * * Three unusual properties are on offer. Jackson-Stops in York (0904-625-033) has a converted Norman chapel with an 18th century brick tower. It is St Oswald's Hall, now a three-bedroom house, in Fulford, 1 1/2 miles from the centre of York, and it costs Pounds 185,000. The churchyard has become the garden. At Church Cove, on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall, GA Property Services (0326-316-362) is selling three buildings that were used as a lifeboat station between 1885-99. The Boat House, the Winch House and the Round House are priced from Pounds 59,000 to Pounds 75,000 - which looks spectacular value for being beside the sea. For those not averse to going underground, there is Mole Manor at Westonbirt, Gloucestershire. As its name suggests, it is burrowed into the ground ('earth-sheltered' is the technical term). The core of the building is a round, domed atrium lit by natural light. Noise insulation is excellent, energy use is low and the house stays dry and warm; indeed, it cannot freeze. Cluttons in Bath (0225-469 - 511) is asking Pounds 250,000 for this rare creation, built in 1987. The owners so enjoy the hibernatory life that they intend to build another like it. * * * The Land Registry and the Department of the Environment have produced a pamphlet called 'Public Information about Land and Property - and Where to Find It.' It deals with information on houses and property held by public bodies (excluding local authorities) in England and Wales. It is available at public libraries, citizens' advice bureaux and district land registries or from Alan Pemberton, HM Land Registry, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3PH.</p>

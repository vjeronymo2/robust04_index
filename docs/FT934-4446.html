			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Pricing of 160p puts Pounds 50.7m tag on Telspec Shares in Telspec, the elect-ronic telecommunications equipment manufacturer which is coming to market through a placing with institutional investors, were priced at 160p yesterday, valuing the Rochester-based group at Pounds 50.7m. The group designs and manufactures advanced equipment which enables its customers such as British Telecommunications, Telecom Australia and Deutsche Telekom, to improve the efficiency of their networks and reduces the cost of installing, expanding or extending local telephone services. Telspec said it expected pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 3.3m in the year to December 31. Last year it made profits of Pounds 3.36m before tax on sales of Pounds 18.2m. The flotation price represents a multiple of 20.1 times forecast earnings per share for the current year; the notional gross dividend yield is 2 per cent. The 12.65m share placing was completed by Credit Lyonnais Laing and will raise about Pounds 20.2m, including Pounds 5m net of expenses, which will be used to fund increased capital expenditure and expand overseas service and support facilities. Mr Frank Hackett-Jones, Telspec's founder and chairman, retains a 60.1 per cent interest in the group. He said the company had just won a Pounds 7m order for advanced digital telecommunications equipment from Deutsche Telekom.</p>

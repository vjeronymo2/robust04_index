			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] PLO leaders in the Gaza Strip and the Peace Now  movement this morning issued a joint statement in which they  called for bringing forward the implementation of the withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho. Peace Now activists also met with Fatah  leaders in Hebron for the first time since the massacre in the  Cave of the Patriarchs. Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar  reports:    [Begin recording] [El'azar] Dozens of Fatah members from  Hebron tensely waited for the Peace Now activists in Bayt Jala,  south of Jerusalem. Contacts between Fatah's leadership in  Hebron and the Israeli peace camp were ruptured in the aftermath  of the massacre. However, Peace Now leaders arrived at the  meeting location today with a message of dialogue. Mustafa  al-Natshah, the former mayor of Hebron, told them: The desire  for peace has survived the massacre.    [Al-Natshah, in English] Nobody says I don't want peace.  But, in order to have a just peace and a long-lasting one you  need to have the ground paved for this peace. Settlements,  settlers, and peace are contradictions.    [El'azar translates the above and continues] Come back to  the negotiating table and cooperate with the state commission of  inquiry, Peace Now activists asked the Palestinians. Gavri  Bar-Gil, Peace Now's secretary general, said the demand to  eliminate the settlements was definitely justified. [passage  omitted]    The sides parted without reaching any agreement. Behind the  scenes, however, Peace Now today scored an achievement. In a  closed meeting held this morning in the PLO's offices in Gaza,  Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, the PLO coordinator in the Gaza Strip, said  that the Palestinians were prepared to return to the negotiating  table. The Fatah leadership in the Gaza Strip and Peace Now  issued a joint statement proposing to bring forward the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks recede after brief upturn Wall Street After a brief upturn, US stocks back-pedalled yesterday amid conflicting interpretations of August employment data which seemed favourable at first glance, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 15.86 lower at 3,885.88, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 2.18 at 470.99. The secondary indices managed to hold on to slim gains, with the American SE composite up 1.52 at 455.54 and the Nasdaq composite adding 0.28 to 759.23. With the approach of the long Labor Day weekend, volume was light, with only 211m shares traded on the Big Board. The thin trading conditions were also partly reflected in the market's unsure response to the day's economic news. The headline figure was clearly positive for equities. The Labor Department reported that non-farm payrolls had increased by 179,000, much less than analysts had anticipated. The slow growth reinforced the view that monetary policy was on hold at least until November. As a result, stocks made solid progress in the early going. But the tide quickly turned as a nit-picking bond market focused on elements of the reports which suggested growing constraints on manufacturing capacity, which could lead to inflation. A weaker dollar was no help, either. Soon bonds reversed their early gains and slipped into negative territory. Equity investors needed no further excuse to lock in profits after the market's recent surge. Blue chip stocks were showing shallow losses by early afternoon, but the damage worsened in the final hours. Caterpillar fared badly, retreating Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 113 1/4 . IBM slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 67 while the rest of the technology sector attempted to regroup after a broad-based pull-back the previous session. The hardest-hit issues improved marginally. AST Research, which had triggered the sell-off with a profits warning, inched Dollars  3/16 ahead to Dollars 13 1/4 . Compaq Computer regained Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 35 1/8 after dropping sharply on Thursday on suggestions that it was reducing orders from its suppliers. In semiconductors, Applied Materials bounced back on the Nasdaq, gaining Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/4 , but Texas Instruments dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 75 3/4 . Most software stocks floundered. Microsoft receded Dollars  1/16 to Dollars 56. Nextel dropped a further Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 22 1/2 . The downturn followed a decision by MCI to withdraw from talks aimed at resurrecting a plan to develop a national wireless communications network. Motorola, a third company involved in the scheme, lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 3/4 . But MCI added Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 24 1/4 . Canada Toronto prices closed little changed in moderate dealings ahead of the Labor Day long weekend. The TSE-300 composite index fell 0.12 points to close at 4,344.22. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 382 to 315. Volume was 62.46m shares down from 76.40m, and trading value fell to CDollars 640.3m from CDollars 862.3m. On the week, the index rose about 40 points. Taiga Forest Products jumped CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 10 3/4 . The company said Berjaya Group (Cayman) Ltd. offered to purchase up to 60 per cent of Taiga's shares for CDollars 13.50 a share. Cott Corp. jumped another CDollars 2 3/8 to CDollars 19 1/8 , after a rise of CDollars 1 7/8 yesterday. The stock has been on the rise since Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities issued an initial rating of 'buy' on the stock early yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE;  </P> <P> COUNTY'S LARGEST ARCHITECTURAL FIRM TO MERGE WITH SACRAMENTO COMPANY  </P> <P> Orange-based Leason Pomeroy Associates, the largest architectural firm in  Orange County, is merging with Foothill Design Group in Sacramento.  </P> <P> The marriage isn't surprising: Lynn S. Pomeroy, brother of Leason Pomeroy, was  one of the founders of Foothill in 1976. Leason Pomeroy already does a lot of  business in Sacramento.  </P> <P> For Lynn Pomeroy, the choice was one of growing internally or merging with  another firm to compete with the big, outside firms now doing business in  Sacramento, he says.  </P> <P> Leason Pomeroy Associates -- corporate name: LPA Inc. -- was founded in 1965  and says with 160 architects it's the fourth-largest architects' firm based in  California. Foothill has 35 architects.  </P></p>

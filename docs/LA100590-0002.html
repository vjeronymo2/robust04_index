			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIR AMERICA AND DRUGS IN LAOS  </P> <P> "Air America" is an addlebrained aerial comedy that sets out to malign the  reputations of the former pilots, and crews, of the real Air America, a CIA  proprietary cargo hauling airline that flew missions, often under combat  conditions, in Laos during the protracted Indochina conflict.  </P> <P> Cockburn's article charges, by dredging up a book written 18 years ago, that  Air America was involved in transporting opium out of Laos for distribution in  the United States.  </P> <P> Moreover, he claims to be the sole keeper of the "truth" brave enough to expose  Air America's purported involvement in drug-running to the public. In reality,  Cockburn's charges are nothing more than blatant fabrications that have been  investigated many times over the years and found to be bogus.  </P> <P> I am a retired CIA official, and during my long tenure with the agency I served  for several years in Laos. During my tour in Laos, I flew on many operational  missions with Air America pilots, and they demonstrated to me that they were  highly professional and honorable men.  </P> <P> JACK F.

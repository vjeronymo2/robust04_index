			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Clara Ines Rueda G.] </F>   [Text] The traditional disagreement between neoliberals and  ECLA [Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]  members has become a thing of the past. ECLA, which also  promoted protectionism and questioned economic opening, is now  speaking the language of deregulation that all Latin American  countries now use.    Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos said this during  the closing of ECLA's 25th period of sessions in Cartagena.  According to Santos, "today ECLA regains its relevance by  tuning into contemporary trends and tackling issues that are  part of the economic and political agenda in each and everyone  of our countries."    In the official's opinion, ECLA thus regained its influence  over Latin America during the Cartagena meeting. "In grasping  the urgency of incorporating our countries into major  contemporary trends of commerce and heading with renewed energy  into the struggle against poverty, ECLA is again feeling the  heartbeat of major Latin American issues," he said.    In his opinion, the new ECLA faces the challenge of  establishing economic guidelines in order to avoid at all costs  continuing conditions that could foster violent social  confrontations. The minister indicated that there are three  priority topics on the agenda of all the Latin American and  Caribbean countries: begin integration and productive  modernization, and forge links between all social topics and  policies.    He thinks that the region now faces the challenge of  emerging  from a dangerous dilemma: it cannot compete with high production  in terms of its labor force (like China, India, and Pakistan),  neither can it compete in terms of the sophistication of its  products, since it lacks design and high tech capabilities.    "If we do not overcome this dilemma, we will continue to  lose  importance in the world market," Santos noted in disclosing that  Latin America's participation in total worldwide exports has  gone from 7.7 percent in 1960 to 5.5 percent in 1985 and 3.7  percent in 1992. This is a matter of raising the countries'  productivity by incorporating the most advanced processes and  systems. Once greater value-added status is achieved, the  economy becomes less vulnerable to the fluctuations of  international markets.    "We cannot choose a strategy of competing with low wages at  the expense of the impoverishment of our peoples or at the  expense of artificially stimulating an undervalued exchange  rate, which ultimately constitutes another reflection of the  same impoverishment," the foreign trade minister indicated.    Santos feels that to achieve modernization it is necessary  to  have policies within companies and through government action to  create the adequate infrastructure, in addition to seeking  greater efficiency in the financial market and making a big  effort in education and training projects for the labor force.  Area countries also have to strive to make multilateral  agreements adjust to the idea of establishing a hemispheric free  trade zone.    Santos reported that at the end of the incumbent  government's  term Colombia will have free trade agreements with 22 countries.  He pointed to the open integration approach through which they  have been reached, namely, allowing other countries to join.    "The Free Trade Agreement (TLC) can become a tool for  regional integration," Santos indicated, referring to its  characteristic as a broad agreement that includes topics other  than commercial ones and that allows new countries to join. The  big task of the area countries is to include social topics in  the processes of economic opening and modernization.    "The challenge that emerges in this process of change is  establishing this new relation with the rest of the world in  order to become a true source for growth and well-being," Santos  noted. The idea is for the benefits of the new economic model  to be distributed equitably.    According to the foreign trade minister, "ECLA's overall  approach, which establishes that it is impossible to separate  economic and social policies, and its insistence on the  importance of the concept of equity when discussing economic  transformation, is precisely the kind of balance we want to  reach in Colombia."</p>

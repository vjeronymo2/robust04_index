			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Warsaw exchange opens with bubbly and braces THE ADVICE came from France but the bubbly was Californian, and the Polish brokers wore bright red braces supplied by consultants Arthur Andersen as Warsaw yesterday re-opened its stock exchange after 50 years. To underline the point that capitalism is back in favour in Poland, the exchange is housed in the monolithic building which used to be home to the Polish communist party central committee. The volume of trading in shares of the first five recently privatised companies to come to the market was modest to say the least. But the assembled officials, putative capitalists and confused onlookers appeared relieved that a start had at last been made. Even more relieved no doubt were the 100,000 or so shareholders who invested in the first public offer last autumn. They finally learned that the value of their original investment had grown by between 10 per cent and 60 per cent. Mr Janusz Lewandowski, privatisation minister, welcomed the opening of an institution which he said provided 'the most subtle form of contact between supply and demand'. The first five quoted companies were all privatised along UK lines with intensive help from British merchant banks, accountants and lawyers and finance from the British government's 'knowhow fund'. Future privatisation is likely to take place on much less structured lines. Mr Lewandowski, one of a team of private enterprise-oriented technocrats in the government headed by Mr Jan Bielecki, the prime minister, is co-author of a mass privatisation scheme effected through vouchers and unit trusts. This is designed to speed up the transfer of state assets to private ownership. With thousands of companies to be liquidated and privatised, flotations such as those used for UK privatisations are seen as too slow and expensive. The exchange will operate only once a week until June. It is based on the French model where offers to buy and sell are matched to fix a price without any active market - making by brokers. It is modelled on the Lyons bourse and Poles have been advised by the French Societe des Bourses and Eurogroup Consultants. The matching of offers gave Exbud, the Kielce-based construction company, the best result with a 33 per cent rise on its original price of Zl 112,000 (Pounds 6.58), although a mere 10 shares were actually bought and sold. The Krosno glass works, whose exports have been hit by the zloty's appreciation against the dollar and other hard currencies over the past 15 months of fixed exchange rates, showed the poorest performance. It fell 8.5 per cent from its original price of Zl 65,000 on offers to sell 17 shares and buy six. Even in Krosno's case, yesterday's price gave a 10 per cent nominal profit to shareholders who in most cases bought shares with government privatisation bonds which allowed buyers a 20 per cent discount on the purchase price. The next two companies to be sold through a public share offer will be Swarzedz, a furniture manufacturer from Poznan, and Wolczanka, a textile producer. The government has told the International Monetary Fund that it plans to sell the shares of between 40 and 50 companies this year.</p>

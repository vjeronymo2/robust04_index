			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (9): Short cuts to a happy visit - Practical hints on the art of surviving Expo How long to stay? The organisers say that the conscientious Expo '92 visitor will need 100 hours to 'do' it properly. Promoters of such events are honour bound to make such claims. But in the case of this Universal Exposition, the biggest ever staged, the boast is not so wild. There is a truly daunting amount to see and sample. A total of 110 nations are taking part. The previous Universal Exposition was set by Osaka, Japan, in 1970 when there were 77 participating countries. Those who are painstakingly thorough should therefore take out a Pta30,000 (Dollars 300) season ticket for the show's six-month duration and spread their visit. By the end they might never want to be within a 100-hour radius of anything that calls itself a multi-media experience or that mentions the word 'discovery' in its promotional blurb. Others will find the three-day Pta10,000 pass more than sufficient. Only the 'if it's Tuesday it must be Seville, Spain' brigade will want to go for the one-day Pta4,000 ticket. Over-65s and children aged five-14 will pay Pta1,500 for a day ticket and the under-fives get in free. Those who just want to party in Seville during the coming months should note that a Pta1,000 Expo Noche ticket will give them the run of the exhibition zone between 8pm and 4am. They will also have two hours in which to see some of the pavilions before these close at 10pm. A Pta10,000 Expo Noche season ticket will keep the the ravers fiesta-ing after-hours from April to October. They, too, might never want to hear flamenco hand clapping, salsa or Caribbean steel bands for a very long time. Choice of accommodation: Seville's hotel prices have gone through the roof. Travel agents will normally be booking for their clients through an Expo organisation called Coral which controls most of the hotel beds in the city. The cost is quite exorbitant. Those not prepared to be fleeced by a three-star hotel which has doubled its rates to charge Dollars 200 a night should head for the Costa del Sol, drive inland from Seville to the neighbouring city of Cordoba, or get out of Spain altogether and into Portugal's far more reasonably priced Algarve resorts. There is plenty of accommodation within, at most, a 2 1/2 -hour drive from Expo. Coral has also organised a bed-and-breakfast network in Seville private homes and acts as a clearing agency for local camping sites. What must not be missed: The must exhibits are the theme pavilions. One of them, which was dubbed Expo's Time Machine and dealt with discoveries over the past 500 years, was gutted by fire in February. But four remain to take visitors from a pre-renaissance and pre-Columbus world to a space travel future. In the middle of it all there is a recreation of Seville's 16th century harbour, the port that monopolised the yellow brick road to El Dorado. Anything between 10,000 to 20,000 souls are expected at the theme pavilions every day. They will encounter a combination of light and sound, of laser projections and films, of humans and robots, of interactive things to play with and things to look at, of objects and artefacts that will be both genuine and reproduced. The organisers promise a 'new exhibiting philosophy' that is described as 'a far cry from traditional museum norms'. The emphasis is on 'atmosphere and metaphor', on 'communication and participation'. Those who shy away from such venues should find solace in the adjoining botanical and tropical gardens where the electronic world will be noticeable by its absence. These gardens contain 1,000 plant species, nearly half of them from Latin America Certain national pavilions, undoubtedly Japan, Italy and Spain, will draw the big crowds. But the undervisited pavilions will also offer unexpected rewards. Those who bypass the Swiss pavilion, for example, for fear of gnomes and cuckoo clocks, will miss a restaurant created by Swiss artist Daniel Spoerri who was a friend of Andy Warhol. It has remnants of food glued on to the walls (hygienically lacquered over), tables covered by half finished meals hanging from the ceiling and a central fountain made out of 100 meat grinders. The decor may be very un-Swiss but the food is of the safe fondu variety. There are contrasts aplenty at Expo. Monaco's pavilion is mostly a walkthrough aquarium and Saudi Arabia's is furnished by desert sands. Haiti has brought to Seville the anchor that belonged to Columbus's flag ship, the Santa Maria. Some 60 security guards will be guarding an original American Bill of Rights in the US pavilion. One part of the Expo spectacle is the architectural bravado of the site and the imaginative use of cooling fountains, water channels and luxuriously hanging gardens. The other is the non-stop open-air entertainment provided by street theatre groups and bands. As dusk falls a daily cavalcade starts up and nightfall is marked by fireworks and more laser beams in yet another multi-media show, a gigantic one this time that is staged over the site's main lake. Then, with Expo Noche, the night-time knees-up gets underway. After-hours events include film shows of the silver screen's greats for those who are incapable of moving another inch. Among the more mind-boggling of Expo's steady stream of statistics is the promise of 55,000 live performances of one kind or another, the vast majority of them free, over its six months duration. Some performances are not free but very much worth paying serious money for. When Expo is over and done with, Seville should seriously consider renewing annually the arts festival that it has created in the shadow of the high-tech extravaganza. The best time to go: Avoid July and August. These are the months when Spaniards, like most people, take their holidays and they for certain will be making a bee-line for Expo. Seville's temperatures in those months will be anything between 36 deg C (97 deg F) and 44C (111F). Even if the bioclimatic cooling features of the exhibition zone are all they are cracked out to be, it will still be incredibly hot. May and September are Expo's best months from the weather point of view. The trouble is that a lot of people know that. June is on balance the best bet. Once in Seville there is no problem reaching Expo for it lies on an island in the Guadalquivir river that girds the city. Visitors may enter by river boat, picking up a launch at the Torre del Oro in downtown Seville, by train on a commuter link with the city's railway station, and by cable cars which depart directly opposite the Exposition zone and whisk across the river into the centre of Expo. Visitors can also walk across one of three stylish new pedestrian bridges thrown across the Guadalquivir to the island and which are served by the city's buses. A slower stroller starting from Seville's cathedral can make the first of the bridges in less than half an hour. All entrances to Expo should be approached with reserves of energy, light clothing and a high degree of tolerance for excitable crowds.</p>

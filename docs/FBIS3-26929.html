A series of  regulatory and control measures has been implemented, and grain  prices have now stabilized.    But what does this unanticipated round of grain price  fluctuations mean? What lessons and experiences can we learn  from the situation? People have not stopped pondering these  questions since the grain prices stopped fluctuating.  <H5>  The Problems Exposed by the Grain Price Fluctuations </H5>   Last year, after restrictions on grain prices were lifted in  the country, the peasants, who had experienced "difficulties in  selling grain" for years, hoped that grain prices would increase  but also feared that they could not be able to sell their grain.  When the summer grain purchasing season arrived, the advantages  to peasants brought about by the lifting of restrictions on  grain prices and by the provision of many channels for  purchasing grain became immediately apparent and peasants no  longer worried about grain selling difficulties. Under these  conditions, many peasants compared the prices offered by several  purchasers and sold their grain to the one who offered the  highest price. Particularly after the early crop witnessed a  drop in output, the peasants became more reluctant to sell their  grain at low prices. In this way, state-owned grain enterprises  experienced "difficulties in purchasing grain," and this to some  extent led to the illusion of a grain shortage.    State-owned grain enterprises contributed to the problem  because they failed to adapt to the new situation when the  restrictions on the grain market were lifted, and the number of  loss-makers among them increased dramatically. The situation  was exacerbated by the fact that many local governments cut  financial subsidies to grain enterprises, and, therefore, grain  enterprises also hoped to see an increase in grain prices in the  market.    In addition, because the areas under grain cultivation in  the  coastal region in south China have decreased substantially, the  market areas in the coastal region have approached the producing  areas in central China to purchase grain and are competing with  the grain-purchasing departments there, leading to an upsurge of  prices in the grain market.    Experts pointed out that, following the lifting of the  restrictions on the grain market, a moderate increase in grain  prices is understandable and is also good for the development of  grain production. In a bumper harvest year and during the  autumn grain purchasing season, however, it is abnormal to see a  great increase in grain prices, which even skyrocketed in some  localities. The state has decided to increase the purchase price  of grain this year, and a sharp increases in grain prices would  be very unfavorable to stabilizing prices throughout the  country. If the government still does not come out to intervene  in the market at this time, the interests of the consumers will  be badly harmed, and social stability and the overall situation  of deepening reform will be affected.    When we reflect on the situation, the main motive forces  behind thoroughly lifting the restrictions on the grain market  last year were: Lifting the restrictions on selling prices in  cities, changing the situation whereby purchasing prices were  higher than selling prices, reducing the government's financial  burden, and, through developing the market's role in regulating  production, to arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for producing  grain and increase grain supply for all of society. This  original plan of "killing two birds with one stone" was not  wrong. The problem was that, after the restrictions on the  grain market were lifted, we failed to respond to the situation  by quickly building a new protection system ensuring stability  in grain supply and demand.    State-owned grain enterprises have been slow in changing  their operational mechanisms, and they have been facing  operational difficulties since the lifting of restrictions on  the market. In many cities, the business volume of state-owned  grain enterprises accounts for only one-third of grain supply in  society. In the rural areas, being restrained by the system and  certain policies, state-owned grain-purchasing departments also  cannot compete with other grain purchasers who are operating  within other channels. Following the lifting of restrictions on  the grain market, this stripped the government of a "handle" on  macro regulation and control.    On the government side, for various reasons, the money  originally used as subsidies could not be transformed into risk  funds as people have expected, and, therefore, some  administrative means have been taken unavoidably.    Speaking in a certain sense, the price fluctuations in the  grain market during a bumper harvest year have revealed the  shortcomings of the grain market system and have pointed out the  direction in which the reform of grain system should be deepened  further.  <H3>  "Cheap Grain Hurts the Peasants" and "Expensive Rice Hurts  the People" </H3>   What is noteworthy is that, within the government's  regulation and control of the grain market, handling relations  between the producers and the consumers is the most difficult  problem.    "Cheap grain hurts the peasants," and this has been known to  the people since ancient times. Throughout the history of China  we can see the authorities resorting to a regulatory method in  which they buy rice when its market price is too low and sell  rice when its price has increased. We are currently reforming  the centralized system for purchasing and selling grain and are  marketizing grain production and operation. One of the major  reasons for doing this is to increase returns from grain  production and operation through the establishment of a new  system in order to arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for  production.    Generally speaking, at a time when the market is regulating  the economy, production elements will usually flow toward the  sectors which have high profit rates, whereas grain production  has a relatively low profit, and grain supply can be ensured  only when certain protection is given to the producers. Grain  is not an ordinary commodity, and changes in the relations  between supply and demand have a direct bearing on social  stability; as the most basic necessity of life, grain is a  strategic commodity which ensures the country's security.  Therefore, even in developed countries, grain production and  operation is not purely marketized. To a big country such as  ours -- which has 1.1 billion people, 200 million peasant  households, and a comparatively weak agricultural production  foundation -- the degree of difficulty in marketization of grain  production and operation will be even greater.    Experts maintain that the government's regulation and  control  over grain, which is a special commodity, is difficult because  it cannot just "take care of one aspect." When grain prices in  the market are low and "cheap grain hurts the peasants," it will  eventually lead to inadequate production and a rapid increase in  grain prices; when grain prices in the market are too high and  are breaking the consumers' backbones, not only will there be a  cobweb effect in the market and social instability, but the  sharp increase and decrease will distort market signals, lead to  an unbalanced agricultural production structure, create new  "difficulties in selling grain," and eventually bring  disadvantages to producers.    Therefore, after restrictions have been lifted from the  grain  market, we must build a forceful, authoritative, and keenly  responsive system as quickly as possible to exercise  macroregulation and control over the market, and to carry out  flexible regulation at any time depending on fluctuations of  grain prices in the market; this is the correct way to properly  handle the relations among producers, operators, and consumers  on the premise of protecting the peasants' enthusiasm for  growing grain.  <H5>  The Market Calls for a New Regulatory and Control System </H5>   After analyzing the fluctuations of grain prices this time  and the experience of the 15 years of reform, economists have  pointed out that, in a big country such as China, in order to  ensure the stability of the grain market, the government must  build a regulatory and control system which is forceful,  authoritative, and responsive to changes in the market  situation. In particular, attention must be paid to properly  protecting the interests of producers. Because, from a  long-term perspective, the shortage of grain supply will be the  main contradiction; in the short term, relative and regional  surpluses will be a secondary contradiction. In concrete  terms, in the areas of grain purchasing, grain selling, and  market regulation and control, the government must build a whole  set of systems which adapt to the new situation and are in line  with the country's conditions.    Experts have pointed out that, following the lifting of  restrictions on the market, the government's purchasing behavior  -- how much it purchases and at what price -- will have a direct  impact on the economic behavior and economic interests of the  main body of the market. Therefore, the government will still  be the most crucial factor contributing to market stability.  Whereas the building of a reserve system is the core of the  building of a grain system as well as an important means by  which the government can regulate, control, and intervene in the  market.    A complete state grain reserve system should at least  include  the following aspects: A price protection system, a grain risk  fund system, a grain reserve system participating in  international grain trade system, and a system of targeted  subsidies.    The price protection system is the government's most  important tool for protecting peasants and regulating the  interests of various quarters of the market. After the lifting  of restrictions on the market, there will be fluctuations in the  market every year, and the government's duty is to buy the  peasants' grain at protected prices when market prices are too  low to protect the interest of the producers; when market prices  are too high, the government will release to the market grain  that was purchased at protected prices, to check the upsurge of  grain prices and protect the interest of the consumers. The  price protection system must be supported by the grain risk fund  system. The size of the fund determines the government's  ability to give protection. Furthermore, the system of macro  regulation and control over grain must have the right to  participate in the international grain trade. With such a  right, when the country has bumper harvests for several  consecutive years, the reserve system can resort to export as a  form of regulation in order to solve the difficulties in  purchasing and storing grain, and vice versa. An understanding  of the international market can be seen as a necessary condition  which must be acquired by an open macroregulation and control  system.    A system of targeted subsidies should also be considered  while we are building a new system. Under the system of state  monopoly for the purchase and sale of grain, what our country  has implemented is a policy of subsidizing the whole people. At  present, within the wages of each and every urban worker there  is nearly 20 yuan in food subsidies. When the income gap among  urban residents widens, there will be no need for the government  to continue subsidizing the portion of population which earns a  lot of money; it should, however, concentrate its financial  strength on subsidizing the low-income population. Experts  maintain that effective procedures to implement this idea should  be formulated, such as opening some state grain shops selling  ordinary government-subsidized food at low prices, to ensure  that "people are fed but not with quality food."  <H5>  Separation of Government and Enterprises </H5>   After the lifting of the restrictions on the market, another  urgent reform is to change operational mechanisms within  state-owned grain enterprises and establish a new system in  which a policy-based grain regulation and control system  coexists with an enterprise-like grain operation system.    At present, state-owned grain enterprises have their own  economic interests, but at the same time they perform a  regulatory function of a policy nature. The consequence is  that, during actual practice, it is easy to have contradictions  between enterprise behavior and government behavior, to the  extent that government regulation and control cannot be really  implemented, or even that market contradictions are intensified.  This point has become very clear during the several rounds of  fluctuations in the grain market over the past 15 years of  reform. Therefore, economists maintain that the crucial link in  the new system is to solve the problem of mingling government  and enterprises in state-owned grain departments, that is, to  separate grain of a policy nature from grain of an operational  nature, so that at the same time when state-owned grain  enterprises truly walk toward the market, the government  acquires a means of macro regulation and control which can  discharge government functions and duties independently.    After the lifting of restrictions on the market, another big  thing the government must do is to establish a number of  regional grain wholesale markets and a series of corresponding  market regulations to enable the flow of grain to have a channel  through which the state can conveniently exercise control.    At present, our country has already established a large  number of grain wholesale markets, as well as several futures  markets. But a market order has not been formed, and there are  enthusiastic transactions outside the market and unenthusiastic  transactions within the market. According to experts, the state  should stipulate that interprovincial grain regulation should be  traded in the large-scale wholesale markets established by the  state. Only in this way can we form a new pattern in which the  state regulates and controls the market, the market guides  enterprises in operation as well as guiding the flow of grain of  producers.    A special policy must be adopted for a special commodity and  a special market. This is an enlightenment with profound  contents which has been left to the people by this round of  grain price fluctuations.</p>

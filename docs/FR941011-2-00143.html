			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 14(a) of the Act generally requires investment companies to have $100,000 of net worth prior to making a public offering. Rule 14a&hyph;3 thereunder exempts unit investment trusts from this provision if certain conditions are complied with, one of which is that the trust invest only in ``eligible trust securities'' as defined in the rule. The Trust may not rely on this rule because equity securities are not eligible trust securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Sponsor will deposit substantially more than $100,000 of equity securities or zero coupon obligations and equity securities in each Trust Series. However, applicants acknowledge that the SEC has interpreted section 14(a) as requiring that the initial capital investment in an investment company be made without any intention to dispose of the investment. Under this interpretation, a Trust Series would not satisfy section 14(a) because of the Sponsor's intention to sell all the Units thereof. Accordingly, applicants request an exemption from section 14(a). Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3, except that the Trust will not restrict its portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 19(b) and rule 19b&hyph;1 thereunder provide that no registered investment company may distribute long-term gains more than once every twelve months. Applicants state that these provisions were designed to remove the temptation to realize capital gains on a frequent and regular basis, and to eliminate attempts by investment advisers to time distributions to be advantageous to shareholders. Applicants also indicate that there was concern that investors would be confused by a failure to distinguish between regular distributions of capital gains and distributions of investment income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Rule 19b&hyph;1(c), under certain circumstances, excepts a unit investment trust investing in ``eligible trust securities'' as defined in rule 14a&hyph;3(b) from the requirements of rule 19b&hyph;1. Applicants believe that this exception recognizes the danger of making manipulative capital gains distributions that would be to the detriment of Unitholders is largely eliminated for unit investment trusts, as the conditions under which capital gains are realized are beyond the control of the Sponsor, and capital gains are clearly identifiable. However, the Trust does not qualify for the exemption in rule 19b&hyph;1(c) because it does not limit its investments to ``eligible trust securities.'' Applicants therefore request an exemption from rule 19b&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit capital gains earned in connection with the sale of equity securities to be distributed to Unitholders along with the Trust's regular distributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants assert that the dangers that section 19(b) and rule 19b&hyph;1 are designed to prevent do not exist in the Trust. Any gains from the sale of equity securities would be triggered by the need to meet Trust expenses or by requests to redeem Units, events over which the Sponsor and the Trust have no control. Applicants state that the Sponsor has control over the actual redemption of Units to the extent it makes a market in Units. However, applicants also state that the Sponsor has no incentive to redeem or permit the redemption of Units in order to generate capital gains for the purpose section 19(b) or rule 19b&hyph;1 were designed to protect against. Aside from the fact that the Sponsor intends to maintain a secondary market and that the current realization and distribution of gains is not an objective of the Trust, applicants believe that cash generated from the sale of equity securities will be used to pay expenses and meet redemptions and will not generate distributions to Unitholders. Moreover, applicants state that since principal distributions are clearly indicated in accompanying reports to Unitholders as a return of principal and are relatively small in comparison to normal distributions, there is little danger of confusion from failure to differentiate among distributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants believe that the requested exemption is consistent with the purposes and policies of the Act, and would be in the best interests of the Unitholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Condition <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree to the following as a condition to the granting of the requested relief: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants will comply in all respects with the requirements of rule 14a&hyph;3, except that the Trust will not restrict its portfolio investments to ``eligible trust securities.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

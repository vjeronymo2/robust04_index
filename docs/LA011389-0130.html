			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LIGHTS! CAMERAS! LASER!;  </P> <P> BOA IS A PUSSYCAT AT MEDIA CIRCUS  </P> <P> The doctors said Sid Vicious, the snake, was a perfect patient. But dealing  with the news media, they said, was a zoo.  </P> <P> Sid Vicious, an 8-foot boa constrictor owned by Mission Viejo High School,  underwent laser treatment at UC Irvine on Thursday afternoon for cancer of the  mouth. Laser specialists and veterinarians working on the snake proclaimed the  therapy a success.  </P> <P> But "the flash cameras in the operating room were driving me crazy," one  veterinarian said.  </P> <P> Journalists from four television stations, one independent network and assorted  newspapers converged on the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic at UCI.  Because the operating room was small, the university set up a pool arrangement  for television. Still photographers and print reporters got to stay inside,  where they literally stepped on each other while documenting Sid's 12-minute  treatment.  </P> <P> Sid had little privacy. Immediately before the laser treatment, Dr. Scott  Weldy, a veterinarian, held up the sleepy-looking boa. Weldy noted that Sid had  been given a mild anesthetic: "He's beginning to look a little stupid now."  Lights flashed and TV cameras whirred.  </P> <P> Then the specialists took Sid into the operating room and stretched him out on  the table.  </P> <P> "Why aren't we getting this?" yelled a TV reporter to a harried assistant. "I  want this to go on the air." The agitated reporter demanded that the  patient-entry scene be repeated. The doctors good-naturedly complied. They  removed Sid from the operating table, hauled him out, then made another  entrance.  </P> <P> Sid, meanwhile, looked zonked out under the surgical lights. Then the lights  were turned off, and the intense red laser was focused on Sid's mouth.  </P> <P> Sid began moving restlessly on the table. "I think the camera flashes are  bothering his eyes," Weldy said. He and assistants taped cotton over the  snake's eyes. Then the laser therapy continued.  </P> <P> In the hall, a television reporter said: "Oprah should think about getting this  act on her show."  </P> <P> Emmett Carlson, the Mission Viejo High biology teacher whose classroom is Sid's  home, said students "noticed something on Sid's lip a few weeks ago, and we  later found it was cancer. We hope the treatment is successful and Sid  survives. He's a great favorite of the students."  </P> <P> Michael Berns, director of the Beckman Laser Institute, said, "This is the  first time in the world that this type of operation on a snake is being done.  We're using a new drug that has potential for use with human cancer patients."  </P> <P> The new drug, chloro-aluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine, was injected into Sid  and concentrated in his tumor. The laser reacted with the chemical, burning off  the destructive cancer cells.  </P> <P> Human patients who are treated with other drugs and laser therapy report an  itching sensation when the laser succeeds in burning cancer cells. Sid's  movements, Berns said, indicated that the treatment was working.  </P> <P> "It went very successfully," Weldy said.  </P> <P> Afterward, Weldy, Berns and Carlson held a press conference at which even Sid  Vicious was present. Weldy had placed the sleeping snake in a pillowcase.  </P> <P> "He needs to get away from the cameras for a while," Weldy explained. "He's  getting a little photosensitive."  </P></p>

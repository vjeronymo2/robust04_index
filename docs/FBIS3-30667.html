			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 7 (CTK) -- In today's independent Czech  daily LIDOVE NOVINY, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus returns  to issues discussed at the World Economic Forum in Davos,  Switzerland, at the close of January.    "Europe -- its present, its so-called `expansion' and its  future -- were high on the agenda of the forum," says Klaus. "I  must admit that I had to oppose a bit the ideas regarding the  expansion since I am convinced that no one can ever extend (or  narrow) it (Europe)."    "Our experience says that Europe's success (or failure) does  not depend so much on the existence, extent and activities of  multilateral European institutions, but to a much greater degree  on the type and structure of the political, social, and economic  systems that exist in European countries," Klaus says.    He notes that "we know very well that the reason we lag  behind (Western Europe) and for our not quite happy life in the  past four decades was not the existence of the (now defunct)  Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (COMECON), but the  communist regime (toppled in Czechoslovakia in November 1989).  Symmetrically, this is true also in the opposite direction:  Western Europe's success did not depend on institutions of the  European Community but on a free society, private ownership, and  a free market," Klaus says. He adds that "this was true in the  past, is true now, and will be true in the future, too."    "These days, it is being decided whether or not Eastern  Europe will preserve this system and will not let it degenerate  into a new form of collectivism.... The success of Europe is  dependent on the degree of freedom of the individual, free  market and trade, on the ability to get rid of the state's  useless interference in the lives of people and their economic  activities, on the elimination of bureaucratic manipulation with  all of us, on our resolve and courage to suppress the strength  of the powerful ... lobbying groups and on our ability to put  in order fundamental economic attributes, especially our work  with awards which we get for it," Klaus says.    "In these attributes it is necessary to carefully specify  the  conditions of a potential favorable impact of multilateral  European institutions on our future," Klaus says. However, he  fears that "the careful formulating of these conditions is being  forgotten due to the simplified and a priori accepted argument  that without Europe's unity we shall be 'small' and 'weak' and  'unable to compete' with other regions in the world."    "The Czech Republic claims that Czech lands have always been  part of Europe and therefore they do not want to be deprived of  various advantages ensuing from partnership in European  institutions. We wish to be an 'equal partner' who does not  only seek to obtain something, but we are also ready to give,"  Klaus says.</p>

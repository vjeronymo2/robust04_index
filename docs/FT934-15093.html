			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (9): Fourth generation retains control / Company profile of Barilla THE three sons of Pietro Barilla, Italy's pasta king who died last month, have acted swiftly in an attempt to dispel any doubts about the succession to control of the family-owned group. The strategy remains the same, they pledge: to concentrate on two businesses  -pasta and bakery products; remain the market leader within Italy in the face of stiff foreign competition; and attack aggressively to increase pasta sales in the rest of Europe. Barilla's pasta market share in the whole of Europe is 22 per cent. But which son is the first among princes? They are all equal, they insist, and as token of their parity and solidarity they have decided to rotate the chairmanship. First it is the turn of Guido Maria, the oldest at 35 and the only married son, who has worked in the business for 11 years. Then the baton will pass to Luca, at present deputy chairman, and in turn to Paolo, a former Formula One racing driver who has been made a director. The term of each chairmanship has not been specified but will probably run for five years, in line with the company's five-year plan which gets renewed each year. So in the medium term at any rate the Parma-based group remains in the hands of the family, now in its fourth generation as pasta makers. Pietro Barilla did sell the company in 1968 to W R Grace, the US multinational, but immediately regretted selling his birthright. After lengthy negotiations he bought the company back 11 years later. 'It is possible that in the long term other roads may have to be followed,' says Mr Albino Ivardi Ganapini, who is assistant to the chairman. He dismisses suggestions that a triumvirate might be a source of weakness and says rotating the chairmanship is not an attempt to patch up difficulties. 'The brothers get on well together,' says Mr Ivardi Ganapini. Visitors to the fortress-like Barilla headquarters at Pedrignano, on the edge of Parma, pass through two security gates before reaching reception where they key in personal details on a newly-installed electronic visitors' book. Somewhere on the site, the size of a small town and dominated by a 15-floor tower, are paintings by De Chirico and Picasso - the late Pietro Barilla was an art lover. Despite the security, en route from town a taxi driver speaks warmly of Pietro, a noted philanthropist whose funeral brought out the entire town in mourning. 'He was a capitalist like all the others but good to his workers,' is the driver's verdict. An engineering faculty for the University of Parma was just one of his gifts. Pietro's legacy was to build up Barilla into Italy's largest privately-owned foods group with more than 8,000 workers. Recession has had only a moderate effect on foodstuffs sales in the country and Barilla forecasts that the group's turnover this year will be L3,700bn, compared with L3,327bn for 1992. After-tax profits are expected to be at the same level as the L140bn last year. Before turning his attention fully on expansion in Europe in 1990, Pietro Barilla's strategy was first to take a strong hold on the domestic market. Barilla now has 35 per cent of the domestic pasta market; well above the 8 per cent cornered by BSN, the French foods group. BSN is also trailing in second place in bakery products, with 7 per cent of the Italian market compared with Barilla's 36 per cent share. Barilla made a big advance in this sector last year when it took majority control of Pavesi, the biscuit manufacturer, from SME, the state-owned foods group. In January, it acquired 100 per cent. Mr Ivardi Ganapini does not rule out further acquisitions to consolidate the domestic presence but these would only be in bakery products or in pasta. The threat from multinationals, Barilla believes, is best kept at bay by concentrating narrowly on these products. After Pavesi, then, Barilla would appear to have no more interest in privatisations. As Mr Ivardi Ganapini says, however, 'resources are not infinite'. Barilla's current focus is on increasing its presence in the rest of Europe in the growing market for pasta and ready-made sauces - but with a different strategy for northern Europe and the Mediterranean countries respectively. In Greece and Spain, Barilla's approach has been to make acquisitions and produce pasta - selling it under Greek and Spanish brand names. Barilla now has 9 per cent of the Spanish pasta market and is the leader in Greece with 35 per cent. In northern Europe, the strategy is to use the selling point of 'made in Italy' and thus to sell Barilla brand names, exporting pasta from Parma. The main assault so far has been in Germany and France - Barilla hopes to have cornered 10 per cent of each country's pasta sales by 1997 - and in Sweden. Steffi Graf, Gerard Depardieu and Stefan Edberg have all been recruited to spearhead advertising in their respective countries. Mr Ivardi Ganapini says Barilla is confident that the Parma plant, midway between Milan and Bologna and the largest pasta factory in the world, can keep its export markets supplied. Parma produces 45 per cent of the total output from Barilla's eight pasta plants in Italy but the company is investing in a new plant at Foggia, in the south, which will be used to supply central Italy. Foggia is also near the raw material supply of durum wheat in Puglia. Mr Ivardi Ganapini concedes that a potential threat to Barilla's ambitions lies in financing investment because the family has always eschewed stock markets, preferring not to risk a clash with shareholders. 'But our strategy is in proportion to our resources,' says Mr Ivardi Ganapini. 'Pietro Barilla developed the company strongly with his own resources and we think we can do the same in the future.'</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): Arab dispute Gulf Air president Salim bin Ali Assiyabi on Monday criticised Arab carriers, including newly-born airlines in the region, for competing in a limited market by offering lower prices. Mr Assiyabi, whose airline has faced increasing competition in the Gulf, contrasted the 'appropriate' European framework for regulating the air transport industry with the lack of a proper regulatory framework in the Arab world. He did not give names but both Qatar and Oman, which together with Bahrain and Abu Dhabi own Gulf Air, recently set up separate airlines that compete with Gulf Air on some of its routes. Dubai, also in the UAE, has in addition set up the thriving Emirates airline.</p>

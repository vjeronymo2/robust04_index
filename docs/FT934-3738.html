			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Franco-German telecom link aims for global market The French and German state telecommunications companies announced a strategic alliance yesterday, intensifying the battle between the world's leading telecoms groups to become global 'super carriers'. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, the second and third largest international operators after AT&amp;T of the US, will establish an Ecu1bn (Pounds 762m) joint venture to provide data and other advanced services to multinational companies. The venture will be the first stage of formal collaboration, which could lead to exchanges of equity stakes between the two state-owned companies if proposed changes to their legal status are carried through. The heart of the alliance will be a state-of-the-art European 'backbone network' providing companies with international private networks and high-capacity data communications across the continent from early 1995. The companies expect their venture, to be based in Brussels, to generate revenue of Ecu1.5bn in its first year, and grow 'quickly' to 4,000 employees. Mr Marcel Roulet, chairman of France Telecom, said: 'Europe needs a global player in this area and we aim to provide it.' The venture was seen by many analysts as a defensive move by the two companies in the face of alliances formed this summer by AT&amp;T with Asia-Pacific operators, and by British Telecommunications with MCI, AT&amp;T's main US rival. Although the Franco-German alliance is clearly in opposition to BT, it has a more open attitude to AT&amp;T, itself anxious to establish a close relationship with a European operator other than BT. Mr Helmut Ricke, Deutsche Telekom chairman, said: 'We absolutely need an American partner to provide a broad range of services,' adding it was 'obvious' AT&amp;T was the best qualified. He said negotiations were proceeding. The alliance has strong backing from the French and German governments, which are ready to resist calls from BT for competition between European operators to be introduced before the 1998 deadline agreed by the European Union in June. The joint venture falls short of merging the public 'voice' networks of the operators. Mr Ricke stressed that all the proposed joint services were already deregulated within the European Union, and that the two companies combined had only about 10 per cent of the European market between them. By restricting the immediate scope of the venture, the companies hope the European Commission will clear it by next Easter. Mr Ricke expressed concern at the slow pace of privatisation in Germany, but he said that its achievement was 'not a prerequisite' for a possible future equity swap between the two companies. Any pooling of the French and German 'voice' services using the public network would be highly controversial as a potential block to pan-European competition. However, France Telecom indicated that no such move was likely until public networks were open to full competition in 1998. Mr Ricke said the companies were helping to 'secure Europe's position within global industrial competition'. Background, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 23 Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Unitary tax ruling ends 17-year battle: But implications of court decision on California method are unclear The US Supreme Court's decision yesterday in favour of California ends a 17-year legal battle by Barclays Bank and a host of other foreign multinationals and governments against the state's worldwide unitary method for assessing corporate income taxes. The decision, by a 7-2 majority of the nine-member court, removes an immediate cloud from California's overcast fiscal horizon: the state will not have to refund more than Dollars 1.4bn it has already collected under unitary assessments, and is likely to be able to collect another Dollars 500m next fiscal year in assessments that have been frozen for the last 10 years because of the litigation. That is no small windfall for California, which has yet to pass a budget for the fiscal year that begins next week. But the implications for the future of the unitary method of taxation are less clear. Although the Supreme Court decision apparently leaves the way clear for states to adopt the method, practical politics are likely to deter most from accepting the invitation. Last year, the British government set its wheels in motion for retaliation against Californian companies by the denial of a tax credit, a move which was partly responsible for the state's decision to change its tax law in a way that essentially gives foreign companies the right to opt out of unitary assessments. The UK legislation authorising retaliation remains in effect. 'The state of California should be under no illusion,' said Mr Peter Welch, who heads the unitary tax campaign, a UK business coalition that has battled the tax for years, 'that if British business should be penalised in the future or if any other state should damage the interests of British companies by the imposition of worldwide unitary tax, then there will be a tidal wave of pressure upon the UK government immediately to institute effective retaliatory measures.' There are, in fact, many cases where foreign companies can benefit from unitary assessments, if their profitability in California is higher than elsewhere. This is particularly true under the current California system, which allows taxpayers to choose between unitary assessment and a method called 'water's edge', which assesses only income within the borders of the US and which comes close in its effect to the arm's-length method embraced in all international tax treaties. 'What we now have is what I call the Burger King system of international tax accounting: Have it your way,' said Mr Brad Sherman, chairman of the State Board of Equalisation, California's tax authority. Several multinationals operating in California choose the water's edge method on principle, even though it costs them more, because of their objections to unitary assessment. The arm's-length method is based on the simple principle that only income earned in a particular country or state should be taxed by that government. Companies are required to account for movements of goods and services between their subsidiaries at arm's-length transfer prices - the same as they would charge to an unrelated company. Its practical application, however, can be very complicated. Many governments fear that multinational companies can change the amount of tax they pay within a particular country by manipulating transfer prices. Several US states have found the unitary method appealing because it is easier for the collecting agency to assess: a company's taxable income inside the state is calculated by multiplying its total worldwide income by a factor based on the proportion of its property, payroll and sales located inside the state. But because it conflicts with the arm's-length principle used everywhere else, unitary assessments can lead to double taxation, as a company may not be able to deduct from its taxable income in its home country the unitary tax assessed on it by a US state. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas, in dissenting from yesterday's decision, cited the risk of double taxation. The Supreme Court had already ruled in 1983, in the Container Corporation case, that California's unitary system was legal when applied to US companies, but expressly set aside the question of whether it could be applied to foreign businesses. The essence of Barclays' case was that unitary taxation, because it conflicts with the arm's-length principle preferred in international tax treaties, interferes with the federal government's right to speak for the US with a single voice on matters of international commerce, and is therefore unconstitutional. But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the court, said that the federal government had had the opportunity to prevent states from using the worldwide unitary method, but had not done so. 'Congress has focused its attention on this issue, but has refrained from exercising its authority,' Mrs Ginsburg wrote. Colgate-Palmolive's case, heard in tandem with that of Barclays, was that to exempt foreign but not domestic companies from unitary taxation would be unfair. To win, it would have had to persuade the Supreme Court to contradict its earlier Container decision, the sort of reversal that the justices only rarely contemplate.</p>

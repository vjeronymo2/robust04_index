			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for gold at record levels Demand for gold from regional markets in the Middle East, India, South-east Asia and China was at record levels again last year, helping to digest the highest level of central bank sales since 1968, Mr Timothy Green, chief consultant to Gold Fields Mineral Services, told the conference. In the first quarter of this year, with gold around Dollars 330 a troy ounce, demand was soaring to even higher levels. 'The price simply had to get to a higher trading range to cool the physical demand,' he said. 'In my view we would otherwise have been heading for global demand of not far short of 4,000 tonnes this year on mine output of about 2,200 tonnes.' The regional markets were price sensitive so the demand would not be sustained, he said. Nevertheless, they provided a genuine floor, and indicated when people in many currencies regarded gold as cheap.</p>

			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT UPHOLDS ACCESS OF STATE TO PAYROLL DATA  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court, upholding the power of state regulatory agencies,  ruled Monday that an employer's payroll records may be obtained by labor  investigators and used against him in a criminal prosecution.  </P> <P> In a 4-3 decision, the court, sharply divided on constitutional issues,  rejected contentions that an employer may prevent use of such information as a  violation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  </P> <P> An employer has no reasonable expectation of privacy in documents -- such as  time and wage records -- that the law requires the employer to keep, the court  said in a majority opinion by Justice David N. Eagleson.  </P> <P> An administrative subpoena may be issued for such data when it promotes a  "legitimate regulatory aim," is not directed at inherently criminal activity  and requires only "minimal disclosure" of information customarily kept by  business, Eagleson said.  </P> <P> The justices overturned a state appeals court decision in February, 1988, that  struck down as unconstitutional an administrative subpoena issued by the state  Division of Labor Standards Enforcement seeking records from a Seal Beach man  suspected of failing to pay overtime to attendants he employed to care for an  ailing relative.  </P> <P> State labor officials, appealing to the high court, warned that the appellate  ruling could seriously impede investigations by numerous state regulatory  agencies and have a "disastrous effect" on their ability to enforce the law.  </P> <P> The ruling was welcomed by H. Thomas Cadell, chief counsel for the state  Department of Industrial Relations, as affirming the ability of regulatory  agencies to gain vital information from employers.  </P></p>

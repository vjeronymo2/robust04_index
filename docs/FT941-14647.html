			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Profits tumble at Thyssen Industrie Pre-tax profits at Thyssen Industrie, the capital goods division of west Germany's biggest steel and engineering conglomerate, fell to DM104m (Dollars 59m) for the fiscal year ending September 30 1993, against DM460m the previous year. The company said that while foreign business, especially in the US, was booming, the continued slump in domestic orders was hampering profits. Turnover for the year fell by 7 per cent to DM8.1bn. Foreign sales, which represent 40 per cent of turnover, climbed by 19 per cent but sales in Germany were down 13 per cent, the company said. The sharpest drop was in the vehicle spare parts divisions, which represent about a fourth of the group's turnover. Other divisions, including engineering products for the energy sector and chemicals, remained in the black although they also recorded declining profits. Orders for the whole group dropped by 9 per cent to DM7.7bn. In Germany, orders were down 16 per cent against a 21 per cent rise abroad. The company said it would continue to reduce its workforce in 1994, with a further 2,400 redundancies planned in Germany. Nearly 4,000 people were laid off the previous year, bringing the payroll in Germany to 32,430. The group employs 44,867 people world-wide.</p>

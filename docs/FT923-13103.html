			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Banks report sharp rise in police alerts BANKS and other UK financial institutions are alerting the police about an increasing number of transactions by their depositors, according to figures released yesterday by the British Bankers Association. The association said details of an estimated 12,000 suspicious transactions or depositors would be passed this year to the police National Criminal Intelligence Service. This compares with the 6,000 last year and 3,000 in 1990. Mrs Sue Thornhill, assistant secretary of the BBA responsible for security and fraud, said the growth in the number of reports reflected a heightened awareness on the part of banks of the need to report any suspicion of criminal activity. Detailed guidelines for banks and building societies on reporting suspicions of money laundering were drawn up by the BBA three years ago after the House of Commons Home Affairs select committee criticised the Bank of England for doing too little in advising financial institutions about their responsibilities under the law. The guidelines were issued to cover disclosure requirements under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986, the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 1989. The Criminal Justice Act contains provisions protecting banks from potential breaches in client confidentiality. While money laundering is still not in itself an offence the drug trafficking and terrorism legislation made it illegal to launder or to assist in the laundering of the proceeds of terrorism and drugs. Banks formerly reported to the National Drugs Intelligence Unit, which was absorbed in April into the NCIS, the police group responsible for collating intelligence on all serious and organised crime. Direct reporting to the NCIS gives the police access to all suspicious banking transactions coming through the BBA-organised system. Mrs Thornhill said counter staff were encouraged under the guidelines to report unusual or suspicious transactions within their banks. These reports were filtered through in-house fraud departments or officers and only if suspicions still remained were they passed on to the police. The new reporting requirements had brought changes to the banks. Mrs Thornhill said: 'The banks have never wanted crooks on their books. In the past when something suspicious has happened they have looked at an account and closed it down. Now they have to report the account.' Under existing laws, only individuals can be prosecuted for money laundering offences but institutions themselves will soon become liable under an EC directive on money laundering which must be implemented by all member states by January 1 1993.</p>

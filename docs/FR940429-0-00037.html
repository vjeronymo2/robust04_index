Indian tribes, tribal organizations and Indian Housing Authorities created under Tribal Law are excluded from coverage under Section 319. A common rule governing the restrictions on lobbying was published by the Department of Agriculture at 7 CFR part 3018 and by the Department of Housing and Urban Development at 24 CFR part 87. The rule requires applicants, grantees, and subgrantees of assistance exceeding $100,000 in budget authority to certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. The rule also requires disclosures from applicants, among others, if nonappropriated funds have been spent or committed for lobbying activities if those activities would be prohibited if paid with appropriated funds. The law provides substantial monetary penalties for failure to file the required certification or disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Debarred or suspended contractors. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provisions of 24 CFR part 24 and 7 CFR part 3017 apply to the employment, engagement of services, awarding of contracts, or funding of any contractors or subcontractors during any period of debarment, suspension, or placement in ineligibility status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Conflict of interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to the conflict of interest requirements in OMB Circular A&hyph;87 and 24 CFR part 85, no person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected or appointed official of the applicant, and who exercises or has exercised any function or responsibilities with respect to activities assisted with congregate housing services program grant funds, or who is in a position to participate in a decision-making process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a personal or financial interest or benefit from the activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract, or agreement with respect thereto, or any proceeds thereunder, either for himself or herself or for those with whom he or she has family or business ties during his or her tenure, or for one year thereafter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disclosures required by Reform Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 102(c) of the HUD Reform Act of 1989, Public Law 101&hyph;235 (December 15,1980) requires disclosure concerning other government assistance to be made available with respect to the program and parties with a pecuniary interest in the Congregate Housing Services Program and submission of a report on expected sources and uses of funds to be made available for CHSP.

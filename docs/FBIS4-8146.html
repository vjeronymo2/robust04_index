			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 11 (AFP) -- A U.S. jet fighter  apparently destroyed three tanks Monday [11 April] during the  second NATO attack in less than 24 hours on Serb positions  around the mainly Moslem town of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  NATO said here. Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said a single U.S. FA-18A jet  fighter carried out the strike.    "We have only first pilot reports, which say that three  tanks  seem to have been destroyed but that is not confirmed," he said  in a statement. The attack occurred at 1224 GMT.    On Sunday [10 April] two U.S. F-16 aircraft dropped five  bombs on a Serb artillery position outside Gorazde, a Moslem  enclave being besieged by Serb forces which is under United  Nations protection as an officially-designated safe area.    The operation was officially launched in support of UN  personnel at Goradze. Bosnian Serbs fired more shells on the  town on Monday, reportedly injuring 200 people at a refugee  centre. Woerner said: "Serbs had resumed shelling from the  south and UN personnel trapped in the area were in some danger."    On Sunday, after the first strike, U.S. President Bill  Clinton warned that U.S. warplanes would strike again in Bosnia  if UN authorities asked for military support. Sunday's attack  was the first by NATO warplanes on Serb ground positions since  the civil war in Bosnia began two years ago.</p>

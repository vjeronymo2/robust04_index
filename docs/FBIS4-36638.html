			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nadim Kawash] </F>   [Text] Abu Dhabi, June 12 (AFP) -- The French Giat  Industries is pressing ahead with a major offset weapons deal  with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and local officials said it  will reap benefits for their oil-reliant economy.    Officials at the Giat Offset in Abu Dhabi said the  multi-billion- dollar tank deal signed with the UAE last year  was proceeding without hurdles and several projects would be set  up in the Gulf state.    "There are no problems at all. We are going ahead with the  deal and there will be several civilian projects here," one  official said.    He declined to elaborate but UAE offset officials said the  projects covered farming, banking, industry and other sectors.  They said they would be set up jointly with national investors.    Giat won the tank deal after strong competition from US and  British companies participating in an international defence show  in Abu Dhabi in 1993.    Under the deal, worth between three billion and four billion  dollars, it will supply 436 Leclerc main battle tanks from the  start of 1995.    Experts said Giat was awarded the contract after it made a  more attractive offset offer, including investments yielding  nearly 60 percent of the deal's value. It was the UAE's biggest  ever offset deal.    Giat President Pierre Chiquet said after the deal was signed  that projects in the UAE would generate more than two billion  dollars in 10 years and their turnover in the long run could  exceed the value of contract.    Early this year, the semi official daily Emirates News said  Giat had decided to restructure its offset programmes in the  UAE, revising some projects and cancelling a contract with the  French Offset Partners to supervise projects in the UAE because  of contractual disagreements.    "The deal is going smoothly and there is no doubt it will  have a positive impact on the economy," a UAE offset official  said. "It will help us in our efforts to obtain technology and  diversify the economy."    Giat has already launched a project under the offset deal, a  gas- powered central air-conditioning fabrication facility.    Quoting Giat sources, the UAE daily Khaleej Times said on  Sunday the company would soon embark on a project to build a  residential complex in Abu Dhabi to accommodate Giat offset  staff and their families.    A Giat spokesman refused to comment on the report, which  said  the UAE authorities had agreed to allot a plot of land for the  project.    "The project includes 80 villas to house 300 French families  expected to come to the country from June next year," Khaleej  Times said. "They will live in the UAE during the entire  duration of the deal -- 10 years."    It said some of them would be assigned to carry out military  programmes, including training, maintenance and logistic follow  up while the others will join the offset members already sent to  oversee civilian projects.    France is the UAE's top arms supplier, which has joined  other  wealthy Gulf Arab states in bolstering their armed forces  following the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.    Officials said the UAE would likely sign military deals  worth  one billion dollars a year until 2000.    "They all will be on an offset basis," one official said. "I  think many companies will be interested because our offset  programme is flexible."    The UAE introduced offset programmes five years ago in a bid  to attract technology needed for its drive to build an  industrial base to lessen reliance on unstable oil earnings.  The programme stipulates that arms suppliers re-invest in  projects that should yield up to 60 percent of the deal's value.</p>

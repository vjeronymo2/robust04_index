			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Conglomerate's Dollars 3.2bn gamble pays off - How the Quantum deal has proved to be a smart Hanson move When Hanson acquired Quantum Chemical in a Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 1.95bn) agreed deal last year most analysts on both sides of the Atlantic gave it a cautious welcome. Some described it as a risky Dollars 3.2bn punt on the chemicals cycle, which only underlined the challenge Hanson faced in finding good acquisitions. A year later, even those who dismissed it as a punt now admit it has paid off handsomely. Supporters point to it as evidence that Hanson can still strike deals big and cheap enough to make a real difference. Quantum is the biggest US deal Hanson has done, including the Dollars 2.5bn of debt which came with the company. While the returns are unlikely to match those generated by SCM, the chemicals group bought by Hanson in 1985 and subsequently broken up, Quantum is already paying off. Some analysts say it could rank as one of Hanson's most successful. The timing of some of Hanson's recent deals has been far from perfect. With Quantum, however, it was spot on. It bought the company just as it had completed a heavy investment programme and was planning to rationalise. More important, it pounced just as the price cycle for Quantum's products had bottomed. 'It was miraculous,' says Mr David Clarke, chief executive of the US arm, Hanson Industries. 'Almost on the day we completed prices of Quantum's products began picking up.' Five price rises later Quantum is making good money out of polyethylene, the plastic used in a wide range of packaging. Operating profits in the chemicals business soared toPounds 122m with Suburban Propane, the gas distributor that came with the deal, adding a further Pounds 54m. In 1993 the two combined made just Pounds 35m. By refinancing Quantum's expensive junk debt Hanson almost halved its interest bill, leaving a Pounds 100m contribution to pre-tax profits. After allowing for the shares issued in exchange for Quantum's equity, the deal enhanced Hanson's earnings per share by 3 per cent, more than expected at the time of the deal. Apart from the price recovery and debt refinancing Quantum appears to have responded to a process of 'Hansonisation'. It has strengthened the management while retaining most of the principal executives, advanced the rationalisation programme already in train, and identified new cost savings. In line with the new emphasis on internally generated growth, Hanson has turned on the capital spending tap. Mr Clarke last month announced a Dollars 438m investment programme for the chemicals division, of which Dollars 289m is earmarked for Quantum. This will increase polyethylene capacity by almost a fifth and ethylene capacity by nearly a quarter. Mr Clarke believes that, with a lower cost base and higher capacity, Quantum can surpass its previous record profits of Dollars 711m in 1988. Mr David Ireland, analyst at Hanson's brokers Hoare Govett, thinks the chemical business could make Dollars 750m in 1997. Other observers are not as bullish and point to the likelihood of prices softening in the middle of next year as new capacity comes on stream. But with demand for polypropylene increasing at twice the rate of economic growth that capacity should be absorbed quickly. Mr Clarke says he is 'very optimistic' about the long-term prospects for Quantum and is convinced there will be similar deals. 'They are there. It is just a question of finding them,' he says.</p>

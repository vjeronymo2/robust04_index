			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Russian envoys start Baghdad talks: They bring a Yeltsin-approved plan urging patience in waiting for sanctions to ease Two senior Russian diplomats began talks with Iraqi leaders apparently carrying a plan approved by Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russian president, aimed at defusing tensions on the Iraq-Kuwait border, while telling Iraq it must be more patient in awaiting an easing of sanctions. Mr Igor Ivanov, first deputy foreign minister, and Mr Viktor Posuvalyuk, director of the ministry's Middle East department, arrived after an overnight road journey from Amman early yesterday for what diplomats in Baghdad called a 'hastily arranged and developing programme of meetings' with Iraqi officials. Russian officials would not comment on the envoys' proposals, or confirm whether the two men would travel on to Kuwait for further talks, as Moscow officials had suggested earlier this week. Diplomats said the two men were expected to discourage Iraq from taking what one called 'absurd steps' in the attempt to press the UN Security Council into an early lifting of the four-year-old oil embargo. They said Iraq still hoped such moves could follow the Security Council's approval of the report by Mr Rolf Ekeus, UN special envoy, that long-term weapons monitoring systems were 'provisionally operational' in Iraq and ready for a test period. Iraq believes it should be given a clear period for this test, after which sanctions would be lifted; diplomats said Baghdad has been insisting the Security Council set specific dates. The Russian envoys are expected to encourage Iraq to wait out a six-month test period for long-term monitoring, a period understood to be acceptable to most Security Council members as a fair test of Iraqi compliance. They are expected to tell the Iraqis Russia would reward such patience by arguing strongly after the six months for immediate moves to ease sanctions. Support for such a scheme from France and China, along with Russia, had been gaining ground before President Saddam Hussein's troop movements towards Kuwait provoked the present stand-off. Most UN diplomats believe Mr Saddam's actions have succeeded only in reversing the diplomatic momentum Iraq had been winning. There was no let-up in Iraq's verbal attacks on the UN or the US, with both officials and media continuing to lambast both, for what Babel, the newspaper owned by Saddam's son Uday, called a 'rancorous scheme against Iraq'. General Amer Mohammed Rasheed, director of Iraq's military industrial commission, attacked Mr Ekeus' report as 'rife with ignorance of Iraq's co-operation' with the UN. Al-Thawra, official paper of the ruling Ba'ath party, accused the west of 'propagating fuss.' Diplomats said Iraq was continuing to move its troops north of Basra yesterday, and that both the Chinese and Russian military attaches in Iraq were yesterday in the south of the country to confirm the withdrawals. In Baghdad, few signs remained that the past days' tensions had affected the city. Market traders said inflated prices for food and other basic goods had risen in the past few days, only to return to 'normal' inflationary levels yesterday.</p>

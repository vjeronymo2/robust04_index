			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Soaps in US customs lather - Legal briefs EFFORTS by US manufacturers to block the importation of 'grey market' goods  -goods made under licence abroad and re-imported - received a boost recently following a ruling by the District of Columbia Federal Appeals Court. The court upheld a US Customs ban on two 'grey' Lever Brothers soaps, Shield and Sunlight, on the grounds that although made under a valid licence in Britain by a Lever Bros affiliate, they violated US trademark legislation because they differed physically from the same brand of goods manufactured in the US under a US trademark. The Court found that the US version of Shield 'lathers more' than the UK version and that British Sunlight 'produces less suds'. The Lever case has already been cited by the First US Circuit Court of Appeals in a case involving the import of 'grey' Perugina chocolates. The First Circuit court said that the imported chocolates produced outside the US under a valid licence infringed the US trademark because differences between the imports and the US products were likely to confuse consumers.</p>

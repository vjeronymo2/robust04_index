			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Kim Chae-muk from New York] </F>   [Excerpt] The UN Security Council [UNSC], which has been  discussing measures on the North Korean nuclear issue, began an  unofficial meeting on the afternoon of 30 March (morning of 31  March Korean time) in preparation for the plenary meeting to be  held on the afternoon of 31 March (morning of 1 April Korean  time).    The ROK and the United States agreed to a resolution clearly  stating the deadline for additional inspections on North Korean  nuclear facilities and discussion for additional measures.    Thusfar, the PRC has insisted on replacing the format with a  UNSC presidential statement and on not including "binding  articles" in the content. However, it is noteworthy that the  PRC expressed its position in unofficial negotiations that it  might partially accept the demand of the ROK and the United  States if the format of a presidential statement is accepted.    Particularly, the PRC implied that rather than "oppose" the  moves by the ROK and the United States, it may abstain if the  issue proceeds to a vote thus expressing that they "do not  support" the measure.

Kim has  standing invitations from both Moscow and Tokyo, and a trip to  Russia is possible in the first half of the year since President  Boris Yeltsin is expected to name his new cabinet next week.    "Even considering the necessary preparation time after that,  the Russian visit is possible within the first six months," one  official said.    A tour of Malaysia, Singapore and other members of the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will be arranged  more matter-of-factly around Kim's attendance at the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Indonesia in  November. His trip to Japan will be scheduled between the  Russian and ASEAN visits, anytime from July to September, the  official said.    Kim will receive a visit by either Jiang or Prime Minister  Li  Peng, who will return the call by Kim's predecessor, No Tae-u.    Kim, to show his priority on domestic affairs, left the  country just once during his first 10 months in office, for the  APEC meeting in Seattle followed by a summit with U.S. President  Bill Clinton.</p>

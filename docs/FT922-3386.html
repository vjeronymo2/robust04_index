			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Pond Life 'This is the best summer of my life - I wish I had it all on videocassette.' With these words Pond Life, a new play by Richard Cameron, begins. The seven characters are just kids, and their talk is just kids' talk. The first scene gets nowhere slowly, and the play seems a drab example of garden-shed theatre - except that it hardly seems to be a play. Then the tone changes with successive scenes, and the play becomes absorbing, funny and moving - except that it hardly seems to be a play. Pond Life, a play about adolescence, is extraordinarily real, and it is beautifully heightened by a young cast who are mainly still of school age. (From the programmes biographies; 'Isobel was a member of the Actors' Workshop in Halifax, and is currently sitting her A levels . . . She has the option of working at the National Theatre of Namibia, before applying to Drama School.') You don't expect teenage actors to be able to catch the minor and major pangs of teenage existence as vividly as this. That they do must be thanks to superb direction from Simon Usher. Anthony Lamble's designs miraculously create four large and contrasting locales out of the tiny Bush stage. The play exists on some surprising cusp between The Three Sisters and The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. A critic's job is to report; but to describe most of what goes on here would be to break its spell. Five of the seven characters are interested in fishing: hence the title. You see one slightly retarded girl, Pogo, going through an astonishing mad scene, you see bullying and flirtation and heartbreak, and yet the climax occurs when three characters catch a carp. Pogo, by far the hardest role, is the only part which makes you aware of acting. Though Joanna Robinson catches the fluctuations and pace of the character's behaviour with perfect naturalness, she slightly overdoes the wide-eyed ingenuousness and high white voice of innocence. Other players include Lyndon Davies, remembered as a child actor in The Singing Detective on TV and as two young Plantagenet princes with the RSC in 1988-89; here he is a Yorkshire scamp fascinated by all the usual things - girls, boys, masturbation, teasing and, yes, fishing. Joe Duttine achieves the plays's most hilarious moment on his first entrance. A pretty young thug with a tattoo and an earring, he comes in sourly with his girlfriend, lies down importantly on some concrete - and then says 'Think I'm gonna get me 'air cut.' The play leaves you wanting to know more about him and Cassie (Isobel Raine). They are the two who are so caught up in important adult things that they don't have time for fishing; and you come to feel that is their loss. As Trevor, the chief fisherman and most adult character, Richard Standing is moving in the play's simplest moments. Bush Theatre, London W12</p>

			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN AIR FORCE JETS COLLIDE OVER W. GERMANY; 1 KILLED  </P> <P> Two Canadian air force jets on a training mission collided in midair over a  West German city Tuesday, killing one pilot and showering the area with flaming  debris, officials said.  </P> <P> Police and defense officials said the two Hornet F-18 fighter jets were flying  at an altitude of about 1,000 feet when they collided about 4 p.m. over the  central city of Karlsruhe.  </P> <P> Canadian military sources said the planes, called CF-18s in Canada and slightly  modified for the country's air force, had been flying at 10,000 feet, not 1,000  feet.  </P> <P> One pilot was killed. The other, who parachuted onto a highway, was severely  wounded, as was a civilian in Karlsruhe, officials said.  </P> <P> They said the burning wreckage of the one-seater jets set several downtown  buildings on fire but that fire brigades managed to put out the flames within  an hour of the crash.  </P> <P> The crash is bound to rekindle a debate over the dozens of military training  flights crisscrossing West Germany's skies each day.  </P> <P> The debate picked up steam after a series of deadly crashes in 1988. More  recently, West Germans have said they would like to see the training missions  sharply curtailed as East-West relations improve.  </P></p>

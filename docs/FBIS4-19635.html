			<p>BFN     [Text] Addressing the German parliament's Economic Affairs  Committee in Bonn today, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto urged the  German parliament members to play their role to resolve the  Kashmir issue so that the amount expended for arms and  ammunition can be spent on development. The prime minister said  if a settlement to the Kashmir dispute is achieved, all other  issues between Pakistan and India will also be resolved.  Referring to the 20-percent increase in the Indian defense  budget, the prime minister said it is basically aimed at  crushing the freedom movement in occupied Kashmir.  Nevertheless, this increase has also put pressure on Pakistan  to take appropriate steps to deal with any threat to its  security. The prime minister said Pakistan had made several  proposals to India for mutual reduction of forces, for reducing  defense expenditure, for preventing nuclear proliferation and an  arms race, and for resolving the Kashmir dispute, but India has  not demonstrated any positive reaction to any of these issues.    Referring to internal affairs, the prime minister said her  government has granted several concessions that ensure extensive  opportunities to foreign investors in Pakistan. She said all  foreign investors are totally safe in Pakistan, as the benefit  of nationalizing institutions in the current age of market  economy has ended. German investors can play a dominant role in  Pakistan's development. The prime minister said Pakistan's  territory is extremely attractive and profitable for investors  as its economy is progressing toward stability. The country is  replete with natural resources and the best business  opportunities are available here due to its location in an  important region of the world.</p>

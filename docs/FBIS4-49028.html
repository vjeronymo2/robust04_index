			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 30 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing  Association for Promoting Overseas Friendship has become a  bridge for increasing exchanges between China's capital and Hong  Kong, Macao, Taiwan and countries overseas.    An association official said that since 1992 his association  has helped local companies sign six cooperation contracts with  overseas firms, bringing in 31.5 million U.S. dollars in total  foreign investment.    One cooperation project is the Beijing Dajing  Telecommunications Cable Company, which will involve a total  investment of 30 million U.S. dollars, with the overseas  partners contributing 65 percent.    Another cooperation project is a Muslim building in downtown  Beijing, which will be rebuilt at a cost of 20 U.S. million  dollars. The Chinese and foreign partners each will contribute  50 percent of the total investment.    The official said that since its establishment six years  ago,  his association has received 560,000 U.S. dollars donated by  residents in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as Overseas  Chinese and foreigners of Chinese origin.    The donations have been used to aid the development of such  sectors as science, culture and education in Beijing, he added.    Since 1992 the association has received 862 visitors from  Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas, he said.    It has established cooperative relations with 26  associations  and societies overseas, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by Kalina Stancheva from the Council of </F> Ministers building in Sofia -- live]    [Excerpts] At the start of today's cabinet meeting, Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov telephoned from the Lozenets Hospital to  order a glass of cognac for the cabinet members to mark the  success of the Bulgarian delegation in Paris. The cabinet  members broke into applause and the news of the result achieved  by their colleague Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov.    The first member of the government to comment on the news in  an interview for national radio was Deputy Finance Minister  Svetoslav Gavriyski. He interpreted what he called this logical  result by saying: From now on the ball is in our court; it is  our job to implement the remaining elements presented in the  government program so as to get the money. According to Deputy  Minister Gavriyski, after the expected foreign financing is  received and added to our foreign currency reserves, the country  will have about 2 billion dollars at his disposal, which will be  sufficient to service the deal with the London Club and to  stabilize the country's balance of payments. We may expect  Bulgaria to be treated more favorably within the frameworks of  the bilateral treaties with the member countries of the Paris  Club, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov added as his own  comment on the news. From the upcoming visit this evening of  his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel he expects to find solutions  to the topical problems recently under discussion, such as the  balance of the former GDR [German Democratic Republic]. Minister  Daskalov also expects that during this visit Germany will  demonstrate a greater commitment to encouraging investments in  Bulgaria and to opening up the European markets for Bulgaria.  [passage omitted on other matters discussed at cabinet meeting]    The team of consultants treating Prime Minister Berov is  expected to meet at 1300 today. After examining the results of  the laboratory analysis, the consultants are expected to make a  final diagnosis on the Prime Minister Berov's state of health.  Everything else is whistling in the wind, Health Minister Tancho  Gugalov said regarding the various stories being circulated by  certain media. In the health minister's words, this morning's  information indicates that the clinical picture is returning to  normal extremely rapidly and that the patient has no typical  symptoms of hepatitis. We expect that the health minister and  chief doctor will give a news briefing this afternoon.</p>

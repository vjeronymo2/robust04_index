			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SENNA GAINS ON PROST WITH WIN IN SPAIN  </P> <P> Defending world champion Ayrton Senna of Brazil has had a less than spectacular  season on the Formula One circuit this season.  </P> <P> But suddenly he is contending to defend his championship by winning the Spanish  Grand Prix at Jerez de la Frontera Sunday.  </P> <P> Senna, in a McLaren-Honda, completed 72 laps of the 2.62-mile circuit in 1 hour  47 minutes 48.264 seconds.  </P> <P> Austria's Gerhard Berger, who trailed Senna from the start, was second, 27.051  seconds behind.  </P> <P> Alain Prost, Senna's French teammate and main rival for the world drivers'  title, was third, 53.788 seconds behind the winner.  </P> <P> After Sunday's victory, Senna has 60 points, closing on Prost, who leads the  overall standings with 76.  </P> <P> Senna must win both remaining races in Japan and Australia to win the title.  </P> <P> Senna got a clean start and went ahead of Berger going into the first bend.  </P> <P> And although the lanky Austrian virtually tailgated the McLaren-Honda for the  first 30 laps, Senna did not seem to be challenged en route to his 20th Grand  Prix victory.  </P> <P> "Obviously I'm very happy, although I had a few gearbox and brake problems . .  . I got the win, that was the goal," Senna said.  </P> <P> France's Jean Alesi made an impressive showing finishing fourth, ahead of  Riccardo Patrese.  </P> <P> The Lola-Lamborghini team secured its first championship point with Frenchman  Philippe Alliot's sixth-place finish.  </P> <P> Prost drove a safe race, lagging behind the leaders and never challenging  Berger, whose Ferrari engine started smoking in the 52nd lap.  </P> <P> But the third-place finish was enough to keep the pressure on Senna for the  last two races.  </P> <P> "I was having serious gearbox problems and it was impossible o overtake Gerhard  or Senna on this circuit," Prost said. "I would be happy if the championship  had been decided today but as it hasn't, I have to go to Japan and Australia to  win."  </P> <P> Jaguar driver Price Cobb worked his way through a pileup and held off division  leader Chip Robinson to win the GTE World Challenge in Tampa, Fla.  </P> <P> After a caution period ended with six laps left in the 117-lap race, Robinson,  the leader at the time, built up speed coming out of the final corner before  the finish line.  </P> <P> But Robinson spun in the turn. Jaguar driver Jan Lammers, running second,  crashed into the tire barriers trying to avoid the pileup and was forced out of  the race.  </P> <P> Cobb took the lead under a caution flag. Robinson's car was undamaged and he  rejoined the field in fourth place, but sixth in line behind two lapped cars.  </P> <P> When the race restarted with one lap left, Robinson shot through the pits at  full speed and came out behind Cobb.  </P> <P> Cobb finished less than a car-length in front of Robinson, but after the race  Robinson's second-place finish was negated because he passed under the yellow  flag and violated IMSA's conduct code in the pits.  </P> <P> Dick LaHaie spoiled an impressive performance by Shirley Muldowney in winning  the top fuel honors in a National Hot Rod Assn. race at Topeka, Kan.  </P> <P> LaHaie completed the course in 5.076 seconds at 278.29 miles per hour in  defeating Muldowney's quicker time of 5.072, 272.97 m.p.h.  </P> <P> In the funny car category, Mark Oswald of Cincinnati defeated Ed McCulloch of  Hemet.  </P></p>

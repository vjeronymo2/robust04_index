			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / EC road hauliers weigh new regime: FT writers assess a Community-wide deregulation of the transport industry ROAD hauliers throughout the European Community yesterday began digesting the implications of what could prove to be one of the most far-reaching changes yet to take place in their industry. Late on Saturday night, after months of wrangling, EC transport ministers thrashed out a deal that will lead to a total deregulation of the Community's road haulage market in 1998. At present, EC road hauliers are not allowed to ply for hire in countries other than their own except under a restrictive licensing system. But after reaching agreement on the related issue of charging lorries for using EC motorways, EC ministers decided the licensing regime should gradually be relaxed until, on July 1, 1998, EC hauliers would be free to pick up or deliver goods between any two points in the community. One reason the move is significant is that it means more efficient use can be made of the one-in-three lorries returning empty after delivering their loads in other EC countries. But it also makes it possible for hauliers to start touting for business in other EC member states or to expand geographically by setting up branches or depots in neighbouring territories. In theory, therefore, the door has been opened to an intensification of the competition in what is already a highly competitive market. But what will only slowly become clear is who will gain from the move, and who will lose. Among the potential gainers, two of the best placed countries could be Britain and the Netherlands. Britain deregulated its domestic road haulage 25 years ago, long before other European countries started to dismantle their quantitative systems under which licences were rationed, so its hauliers have long since made the adjustment to a competitive environment. Even so, Ms Ivy Penman, head of international planning for the UK distribution company Exel Logistics, said companies were more likely to expand by acquisition than by spreading existing operations into neighbouring countries. 'We have found that if you want credibility in a country, you need to acquire local management,' she said. There was also some scepticism about the degree to which smaller independent hauliers would ply for hire in other countries. Mr Dick Denby, owner of Lincoln-based international hauliers Denby Transport, said it was unlikely that a company wanting its goods transported would prefer an unknown foreign operator to a well-known local haulier. And Mr John Guttridge, head of external affairs at the Freight Transport Association, thought it equally unlikely that many continental hauliers would seek work in the UK. 'There are enough UK hauliers queueing up outside customers' premises as it is,' he said. In the Netherlands, a common approach to European road transport is important because the country's trucking industry accounts for 25 per cent of cross-border road freight traffic in Europe. Dutch road hauliers have traditionally made full use of the international haulage licences available under the existing system, and for them, total deregulation cannot come too soon. The Dutch hauliers hope the agreement will enable them to build on their strong European market share to capture a proportion of the domestic markets in other countries. They believe that competitors in the centre of the EC such as France will feel less compelled to seek out this kind of new business. Nedlloyd, the Netherlands' largest transport group which has expanded strongly in Germany in recent years, said: 'Anything which breaks down barriers in Europe is good for us.' Other countries seem less enthusiastic about the changes. In France, for example, Mr Bernard Bosson, France's transport minister, was yesterday seeking to reassure the French road haulage industry that the five-year transition period would give them plenty of time to adjust to unbridled competition. Mr Bosson said it was essential that 'liberalisation should be not brutal, but should be very progressive and contained', and called for parallel harmonisation of 'social and technical' standards in the EC to protect French lorry drivers from unfair competition. In Germany, which secured the right to introduce motorway charges for foreign lorries in return for its agreement to deregulation, the German road haulage industry yesterday gave a cautious welcome to the Luxembourg decision. 'Anything which reduces the competitive disadvantage of the German road hauliers must be welcomed,' said Mr Viktor Kettler of Interdean, the international removals company. Mr Herbert Nickenig, responsible for the road haulage section of the federation of haulage contractors, said the deal could still mean a competitive advantage for rival national industries, above all the Dutch. But as more than one European haulier pointed out yesterday, with Germany vowing to plough the proceeds of its motorway charges into restructuring Deutsche Bundesbahn, the biggest gainer from the Luxembourg agreement might not be the road haulage industry at all, but German railways.

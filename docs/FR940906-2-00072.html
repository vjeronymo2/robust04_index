Copeland, M.D.; Revocation of Registration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 9, 1992, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to John W. Copeland, M.D. (Respondent), of Antioch, California, proposing to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, AC8638085, and to deny any pending applications for registration as a practitioner under 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a). The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4) and that Respondent was convicted of a felony under State law relating to controlled substances, as set forth in 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2). Specifically, the Order to Show Cause alleged that between December 1987 and October 1989, Respondent dispensed Ritalin, a Schedule II controlled substance, to ten individuals for other than legitimate medical purposes and outside the scope of his professional practice; between January 1988 and October 1989, Respondent dispensed anabolic steroids, Schedule III controlled substances under applicable state law, to fifteen individuals for other than legitimate medical purposes and outside the scope of his professional practice; and on May 30, 1991, Respondent was convicted in the State of California of six felony counts of prescribing controlled substances to addicts or habitual users of controlled substances and such prescriptions were not issued as part of an authorized methadone program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent, through counsel, timely filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised in the Order to Show Cause and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. Following prehearing procedures, a hearing was held, beginning on June 29, 1993, in San Francisco, California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 21, 1994, Judge Bittner issued her opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusions of law and decision, recommending that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. Respondent filed exceptions to the administrative law judge's decision pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.66, and attached a Stipulation, Decision and Order of the Medical Board of California (MBC), dated March 30, 1994, which allowed Respondent to retain all controlled substance privileges except that Respondent was prohibited from handling anabolic steroids and was allowed to use Schedule II controlled substances only in a hospital setting. The MBC order also placed Respondent's medical license on probation for five years with various other conditions. The Government filed a response to Respondent's exceptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 23, 1994, Judge Bittner transmitted the record of the proceedings, including the Respondent's exceptions and the Government's response thereto, to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the record and adopts the opinion and recommended decision of the administrative law judge in its entirety. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, the Deputy Administrator hereby issues his final order in this matter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator finds that Respondent has had a solo practice in family and emergency medicine since 1967. For a short time in 1969 to 1971, he volunteered as a treating physician in a drug addiction clinic. Sometime after this clinic closed in 1971, Respondent continued to treat some of the former patients of this clinic in the course of his general practice. At no time did Respondent ever posses a DEA registration to operate a narcotic treatment program as required by 21 U.S.C. 823(g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent's treatment of drug addiction was not the subject of any law enforcement investigation until 1988, when one of his patients was arrested and found with prescription vials for Tylenol with codeine, a Schedule III controlled substance, and Valium, a Schedule IV controlled substance. The prescribing physician was Respondent. When asked about these prescriptions, Respondent stated that they were issued to treat the patient for heroin addiction. As a result, the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement (BNE) commenced an investigation of Respondent's medical practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In April 1988, a BNE undercover operative made her first visit to Respondent's office and informed him that she was addicted to Ritalin and that she also abused methamphetamine, a Schedule II controlled substance. Respondent issued her a prescription for 60 dosage units of Ritalin. She returned to Respondent's office three weeks later, seeking a refill before her first Ritalin prescription should have expired. Respondent complied by issuing her another prescription for 60 dosage units of Ritalin. She made two more visits to Respondent's office (about a month apart) and each time Respondent issued her another Ritalin prescription, one for 50 dosage units and the other for 60 dosage units. She did not return to Respondent's office until May of 1989, at which time she saw Respondent's associate physician who prescribed her only 8 dosage units of Ritalin to hold her until she could see Respondent. Three days later, when she saw Respondent, he decided not to reissue her a Ritalin prescription. Respondent, however, suggested that she ``quit speed'' and use marijuana, a Schedule I controlled substance, instead. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A patient who had been treated by Respondent with controlled substances for drug addiction since 1974 agreed to act as an undercover operative along with a police detective who posed as her boyfriend. During their visit in April 1989, Respondent admonished the female undercover operative for missing a prior appointment by stating, ``Where are you going to find a doctor doing what I am doing?'' Respondent did not issue her a Valium prescription as she requested, but issued her a prescription for 40 dosage units of Restoril, a Schedule IV controlled substance. Her medical bill indicated that the prescription was issued for drug withdrawal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

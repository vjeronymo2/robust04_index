			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Observer: Thirsty work If you have tried booking one of the 56 seats at The Gate Theatre in London's Notting Hill, then you will know that it needs expanding. The theatre, housed on the first floor above the Prince Albert pub, has won a string of theatrical prizes - most recently London Weekend TV's Live Plays award - and is run on such a small budget that even its actors don't get paid. The theatre is keen to enlarge its seating capacity to 126 by using spare space in the pub, owned by Allied-Lyons. The hope is that Allied will put up Pounds 55,000 and private donors contribute a further Pounds 34,000. Is this an offer that Allied can afford to turn down? It would be sponsoring the most prestigious small theatre in London. There would be a plaque in the theatre to say so, a note of acknowledgement in all future programmes and perhaps an Allied-Lyons opening season. And if Allied's accountants won't wear this, then they might be persuaded by the promise of increased supping by thirsty theatregoers in the downstairs pub. The man behind the bar says they already spend Pounds 1,000 on drinks before, during and after the show.</p>

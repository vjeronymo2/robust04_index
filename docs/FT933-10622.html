			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Scheme for LUI subsidiaries PROVISIONAL liquidators of the insurance subsidiaries of London United Investments are expected to publish a scheme of arrangement before the end of this month. LUI, the insurance to property conglomerate, collapsed early in 1990. Its subsidiaries, Kingscroft Insurance, Walbrook Insurance, El Paso Insurance, Lime Street Insurance and Mutual Reinsurance - collectively referred to as the KWELM companies - have outstanding liabilities to policyholders amounting to some Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn). The business underwritten by the KWELM companies consisted mainly of general and product liability insurance for North American companies, together with pro-fessional indemnity insurance for accountants, architects, engineers and lawyers, and medical malpractice ins-rance for doctors and hos-pitals. Most of the business was written through HS Weavers (Underwriting) Agencies between 1972 and 1990. Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Ian Bond, both partners in Coopers &amp; Lybrand, will seek creditors' approval for a scheme of arrangement rather than a straight liquidation. They believe a scheme of arrangement offers the best prospects for the 100,000 plus actual or potential creditors of the companies. The provisional liquidators have recovered or secured more than Dollars 280m since their appointment. They are attempting to recover further insurance assets from more than 600 reinsurers worldwide.</p>

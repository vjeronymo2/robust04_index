			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Ahmad Muwaf faq Zaydan] </F>   [Excerpt] Peshawar--Informed Afghan sources told AL-HAYAH  yesterday that a deepseated difference of opinion had broken out  between President Borhanoddin Rabbani and his foreign minister,  Hedayat Amin Arsala, after the latter refused to respond to  presidential instructions that recalled him to Kabul on 21  March. The foreign minister visited the Central Asian republics  last week on what Rabbani described as "a personal visit that  does not represent the state."    This difference of opinion resulted from statements made by  Seyyed Ahmad Gilani, the leader of the Mahaz-e Melli-ye Eslami  [National Islamic Front], to which Arsala belongs. Gilani, in  his statements, criticized Rabbani's steps to extend his  administration, which ends in June according to the Islamabad  agreement and the Mecca pact between the mojahedin groups.    The relationship between Rabbani and Gilani became more  tepid  after the latter received a delegation of the coordination  council opposed to Rabbani's rule in light of news about  attempts by the opposition side to convince Gilani to join its  ranks.    The opposition, led by Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar,  seized the opportunity at rapprochement with Gilani after the  president's steps to dismiss the Afghan ambassador in Islamabad,  Dr. Mohammad Roshan. It is well known that Roshan also belongs  to Gilani's front.    Sadeq Tashkari, the Afghan president's aide, told AL-HAYAH  that Engineer Mokhtar is the ambassador's charge d'affaires.  However, Roshan has not left the embassy and has refused to  answer Rabbani's demand for his recall to Kabul in order to  appoint him to the post of director of consular affairs in the  Foreign Ministry. The opinion of observers is that if Gilani  secedes from the Rabbani alliance, the latter may suffer a major  blow since it would not leave anyone in his alliance other than  the Ettehad-e Eslami led by 'Abd-Rabb Rasul Sayyaf, with some  remaining neutral and the rest in the ranks of the opposition.    Mas'ud Khalili, one of the commanders of the Jam'iat-e  Eslami  (led by President Rabbani) who lives in Kabul, comment on the  subject. He told journalists, "This is a strange situation. It  is up to the Gilani group to define its position. Is it still in  the alliance or has it left?" Khalili did not comment on whether  Kabul had appointed a new foreign minister or not.    In addition, artillery battles continued between the  opposition and government forces in the Afghan capital yesterday  in which 70 people were wounded. [passage omitted]</p>

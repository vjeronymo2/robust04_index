General Ventilation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General ventilation can be used for several purposes, including diluting and removing contaminated air, controlling airflow patterns within rooms, and controlling the direction of airflow throughout a facility. Information on these topics is contained in the following sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Dilution and Removal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To reduce the concentration of contaminants in the air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General ventilation maintains air quality by two processes: dilution and removal of airborne contaminants. Uncontaminated supply (i.e., incoming) air mixes with the contaminated room air (i.e., dilution), which is subsequently removed from the room by the exhaust system (i.e., removal). These processes reduce the concentration of droplet nuclei in the room air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Types of general ventilation systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two types of general ventilation systems can be used for dilution and removal of contaminated air: the single-pass system and the recirculating system. In a single-pass system, the supply air is either outside air that has been appropriately heated and cooled or air from a central system that supplies a number of areas. After air passes through the room (or area), 100% of that air is exhausted to the outside. The single-pass system is the preferred choice in areas where infectious airborne droplet nuclei are known to be present (e.g., TB isolation rooms or treatment rooms) because it prevents contaminated air from being recirculated to other areas of the facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a recirculating system, a small portion of the exhaust air is discharged to the outside and is replaced with fresh outside air, which mixes with the portion of exhaust air that was not discharged to the outside. The resulting mixture, which can contain a large proportion of contaminated air, is then recirculated to the areas serviced by the system. This air mixture could be recirculated into the general ventilation, in which case contaminants may be carried from contaminated areas to uncontaminated areas. Alternatively, the air mixture could also be recirculated within a specific room or area, in which case other areas of the facility will not be affected (Suppl. 3, Section II.C.3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Ventilation rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommended general ventilation rates for health-care facilities are usually expressed in number of ACH. This number is the ratio of the volume of air entering the room per hour to the room volume and is equal to the exhaust airflow (Q [cubic feet per minute]) divided by the room volume (V [cubic feet]) multiplied by 60 (i.e., ACH = Q  <!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->  V &times; 60).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The feasibility of achieving specific ventilation rates depends on the construction and operational requirements of the ventilation system (e.g., the energy requirements to move and to heat or cool the air). The feasibility of achieving specific ventilation rates may also be different for retrofitted facilities and newly constructed facilities. The expense and effort of achieving specific higher ventilation rates for new construction may be reasonable, whereas retrofitting an existing facility to achieve similar ventilation rates may be more difficult. However, achieving higher ventilation rates by using auxiliary methods (e.g., room-air recirculation) in addition to exhaust ventilation may be feasible in existing facilities (Suppl. 3, Section II.C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Airflow Patterns Within Rooms (Air Mixing)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To provide optimum airflow patterns and prevent both stagnation and short-circuiting of air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General ventilation systems should be designed to provide optimal patterns of airflow within rooms and prevent air stagnation or short-circuiting of air from the supply to the exhaust (i.e., passage of air directly from the air supply to the air exhaust). To provide optimal airflow patterns, the air supply and exhaust should be located such that clean air first flows to parts of the room where HCWs are likely to work, and then flows across the infectious source and into the exhaust. In this way, the HCW is not positioned between the infectious source and the exhaust location. Although this configuration may not always be possible, it should be used whenever feasible. One way to achieve this airflow pattern is to supply air at the side of the room opposite the patient and exhaust it from the side where the patient is located. Another method, which is most effective when the supply air is cooler than the room air, is to supply air near the ceiling and exhaust it near the floor (Figure S3&hyph;2). Airflow patterns are affected by large air temperature differentials, the precise location of the supply and exhausts, the location of furniture, the movement of HCWs and patients, and the physical configuration of the space. Smoke tubes can be used to visualize airflow patterns in a manner similar to that described for estimating room air mixing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,d373 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEN28OC94.005 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Capital &amp; Regional back in the black CAPITAL &amp; Regional Properties, the USM-quoted company which last week said it was to float off its US property interests as a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust, moved into the black in the six months to June 24. In the first half of what Mr Martin Barber, chairman, described as 'a milestone year for the group', pre- and post-tax profits emerged at Pounds 151,000, compared to losses of Pounds 137,000 last time. Mr Barber said that in the past 18 months the group's portfolio had doubled in monetary terms - it had stood at Pounds 25m in the balance sheet at the year-end - as a result of the group's 'intensive efforts'. In the period under review, C&amp;R made acquisitions which totalled Pounds 25.7m. Mr Barber said that there were more UK acquisitions 'in the pipeline' and that the REIT was set to have Dollars 200m (Pounds 130m) worth of property, up from about Dollars 85m now. Mr Barber said that the acquisitions had been well timed, adding that the window for the buying of investment property was 'still open'. 'Although yields have come down, the opportunities still look pretty good.' Shareholders had indicated that they would not be averse to a further expansion of the equity base. Rental and management fee income rose to Pounds 4.13m (Pounds 2.96m) and again there was no tax charge. Mr Barber explained that the UK property interests worked through at about break-even, with the US 'making lots in UK accounting terms, which you can then depreciate, leaving those profits tax-free'. Although the increased interim dividend of 0.5p (0.3p) is uncovered at this stage by earnings of 0.21p (losses 1.48p) per share, Mr Barber said that the first-half acquisitions would 'contribute to considerably higher profits being reported in the second half'.</p>

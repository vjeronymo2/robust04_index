			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Blank tape prices may rise if EU supports levy plan Prices of blank video and audio cassettes and of recording equipment may rise as the result of a European Commission proposal to protect copyright through a Europe-wide levy. The draft directive suggests a levy of Ecu0.15 (11p) per hour on audio tapes, and the equivalent of 19p per hour on video tapes, Pounds 1.57 per unit of audio equipment and Pounds 7.87 per unit of video equipment. The UK government, which in 1988 dropped plans to introduce a levy on audio tapes, will strongly oppose the move. The Commission wants to harmonise levies currently used in most member states to reimburse copyright holders, such as production companies and musicians, who suffer from home copying of their works. Only the UK, Ireland and Luxembourg have no levy. The UK says the proposals, which will be discussed by the Commission next month, will be bureaucratic and penalise disadvantaged people such as the blind, who rely heavily on taped material. It will also punish ordinary consumers. If the Commission proceeds with the idea, it will require the backing of a qualified majority of EU states for it to be implemented. The UK and other opposed countries may argue, however, that the levy is a tax, in which case the decision has to be taken unanimously. The Commission says it is coming under pressure from copyright holders and member states to harmonise legislation because the levies vary widely between countries, causing distortions in the market. 'Everybody says there is a need to act - even the tape producers who do not like the levy but say that since it exists we should harmonise,' said a Commission official. 'We will try to do so at a level that is not too exaggerated.' The current levies, fixed according to the length of tapes, are highest in Denmark and France but lowest in Germany.</p>

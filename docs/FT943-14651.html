			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Watchdog reprimands Theodoulou Mr Raymond Theodoulou, the former chief executive of Standard Chartered Securities, has been reprimanded by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, for failing to exercise proper management of the company. The SFC said yesterday that Mr Theodoulou had voluntarily surrendered his dealer and investment adviser registrations and undertaken not to apply for re-registration until the beginning of 1995. Late last month, the SFC sternly criticised Standard Chartered for funding illegal share support operations in Hong Kong at the time of initial public offerings (IPOs) in which it or its merchant bank was adviser. It banned the securities company from participating in IPOs until April next year. In a statement yesterday, the SFC said Mr Theodoulou had failed to 'exercise proper management, supervision and control' over the securities company. In mitigation, however, the SFC said he did not join Standard Chartered until April 1992 and was therefore chief executive for only the latter half of the period covered by the SFC's investigation, which ran from July 1991 until March 1993. The SFC admitted that the activities for which he was reprimanded were already 'well established' at Standard Chartered and that Mr Theodoulou made 'a material contribution to the control and compliance environment' of the securities company.</p>

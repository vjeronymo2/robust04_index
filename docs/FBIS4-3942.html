			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 26 KYODO -- The Chinese Province of  Sichuan has decided to sell 33 national enterprises with good  business performance to overseas bidders, according to a CHINA  NEWS SERVICE report.    The news agency said the corporations to be sold to bolster  them with foreign capital include large-scale firms and belong  to various industries such as machinery, electronics, metallurgy  and pharmaceuticals.    The 33 companies, with a combined workforce of 77,000, hold  fixed assets worth 3.6 billion yuan (about 43 billion yen), the  agency said.    Foreign bidders will be allowed to purchase them outright,  partially or through acquisition of equity shares, the agency  said.    Provincial authorities offered 16 deficit-ridden enterprises  for sale to Hong Kong bidders last year but none was purchased.</p>

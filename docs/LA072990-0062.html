			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LIFE DOESN'T IMITATE ART: BOY 'SUPER-HERO' RESCUED  </P> <P> On television and in the movie, the wildly popular Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  rescue people in distress every day.  </P> <P> But on Friday night, it was firefighters who saved one of the super-heroes.  </P> <P> Actually, they rescued a 13-year-old boy, dressed like one of the mutated  humanoid turtles, who got wedged 15 feet down a neighbor's chimney in the 5600  block of Wilhelmina Avenue in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> "The kid was playing a Ninja Turtle game," Los Angeles Police Sgt. Craig Aliano  said. "I haven't the slightest idea what that is."  </P> <P> The rescuers worked about 30 minutes before freeing the boy, who was not hurt,  Firefighter Pat Marek said.  </P> <P> They extended a ladder over the chimney and threw a rope attached to straps to  the youth.  </P> <P> When the boy, covered with soot, emerged from the chimney, he explained that he  was playing a game with some other children.  </P> <P> He wore goggles and a ski mask -- both turtle trademarks.  </P> <P> Actually, Ninja Turtles prefer sewers over chimneys.  </P> <P> The turtles, named after classical artists, eat pizzas in their sewer digs and  spend their days rescuing people.  </P> <P> The turtles appear on one of television's hottest cartoon programs, and they  recently starred in their own hit movie.  </P> <P> The wanna-be teen-age turtle was taken to a police station but was quickly  released to his parents.  </P> <P> "The kid was just playing," Aliano said.  </P> <P> "It's a nothing for us."  </P></p>

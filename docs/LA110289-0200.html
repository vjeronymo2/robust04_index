			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHRYSLER MARKETER RECRUITED TO AID MAZDA'S U.S. IMAGE  </P> <P> As part of a campaign to improve its image in the United States, Mazda Motor of  America said Wednesday that it has hired Chrysler's marketing manager to be  senior vice president and general manager.  </P> <P> Clark J. Vitulli, 43, has spent the last 20 years with Chrysler Corp. in varied  sales and marketing positions. He was California regional sales manager when he  was chosen in September, 1987, to head national marketing and advertising for  Chrysler vehicles.  </P> <P> Yoshi Taura, president of Mazda Motor of America -- whose headquarters is in  Irvine -- said that Vitulli was hired to bring in "a fresh outside perspective"  and that Mazda is especially interested in Vitulli's experience in marketing  Chrysler's luxury line.  </P> <P> In September, Mazda appointed a panel to study establishing a separate luxury  brand in the United States, as Nissan, Toyota and Honda have done with their  Infiniti, Lexus and Acura lines.  </P> <P> The Chrysler marque has not been the star of Chrysler Corp.'s stable; that has  been the Jeeps and minivans of the company's Plymouth and Dodge divisions. But  industry analysts said Vitulli did a good job with the product he was given.  </P> <P> "Chrysler has struggled in the upper end of the market against General Motors'  Cadillac and Ford's Lincoln and Lincoln Town Car . . . without changing its  product often enough," said Arvid Jouppi, automotive analyst for Keane  Securities.  </P> <P> Jouppi said Vitulli "has a good reputation but is just not part of the  (Chrysler Chairman) Lee Iacocca inner circle."  </P> <P> As senior vice president and general manager, Vitulli will become the senior  American official at Mazda. The position has existed in Mazda's management  charts since the Japanese auto maker formed its U.S. subsidiary 16 months ago,  but this is the first time that it has been filled.  </P> <P> Vitulli, who could not be reached for comment, starts work Friday.  </P> <P> Mazda recently began a five-year campaign to build name recognition and upgrade  its image among U.S. consumers by emphasizing the quality of its product rather  than its price.  </P> <P> Mazda, which boosted its U.S. ad budget to more than $200 million from last  year's $150 million, ranks fourth among the Japanese auto makers and is not  nearly as well known as Nissan, Toyota and Honda, company spokesman Al Goldberg  said.  </P> <P> Even the tremendous success of the new Miata sports car has failed to give the  Mazda name a big push among consumers. George McCabe, recently promoted to vice  president of Mazda Motor America's newly formed operations group, presided  earlier this year over the introduction of the Miata.  </P> <P> "Everyone knows Miata, but a lot of people don't put Mazda together with it,"  Goldberg said.  </P> <P> To bolster its image and name identification, Mazda needs a major marketing  push, which is Vitulli's forte.  </P> <P> "The company has done little to build any kind of an image until this year,"  said Jim Hillson, senior analyst with Phase One, a Los Angeles-based automotive  ad research firm.  </P> <P> "All of the Japanese companies seem to be chasing the Germans, and it looks  like they all will be clustering in that luxury-car niche," he said.  </P></p>

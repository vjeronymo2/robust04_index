			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Naf-Naf in FFr198m flotation NAF-NAF, the French clothing company, is going public by floating 13 per cent of its capital, worth FFr198m (Dollars 36.3m), on the Paris second market as a precursor to a larger issue next year. The Naf-Naf issue, which follows little more than a week after that of Hermes, the luxury goods group, is seen as a test of the Paris market in the run-up to the new centre-right government's privatisation programme. The market has been sluggish so far this year, but the successful Hermes issue was 33 times over-subscribed. The bulk of the privatisations should start in September but the government plans to sell a FFr5bn stake in the Credit Local de France banking group by the end of this month. Naf-Naf is taking a cautious approach to life on the stock market by staging an introduction of 791,668 new shares at FFr250 each on to the second market. The issue is intended to raise capital to finance the group's international expansion plans. After the introduction the founding Pariente family will still control Naf-Naf with 66.6 per cent of the shares and 79.9 per cent of the votes. Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, will hold 9.5 per cent and Banque Nationale de Paris 5.95 per cent. Naf-Naf, which specialises in casual clothes for children and young adults, is one of the best known clothing brands in France. It was founded 20 years ago in Sentier, the 'rag trade' district of Paris, and now owns 120 shops in France, 13 elsewhere in Europe and sells to 3,500 retail customers. The group made net profits of FFr90m on sales of FFr1.03bn in 1992. It expects profits to rise by at least 20 per cent to FFr110m this year on sales up by 15 per cent to over FFr1.19bn.</p>

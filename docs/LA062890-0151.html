			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTIES ISSUE CAR DECALS IN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL CRUISING  </P> <P> In the latest effort to control local cruising, Pico Rivera has started issuing  stick-on automobile decals to residents and workers who must drive through the  Whittier Boulevard area when cruising restrictions are in force. As of last  Friday, eight days into the program, the city had issued nearly 1,000 decals.  </P> <P> The fluorescent decals are to help sheriff's deputies recognize motorists who  need to get through traffic-control barriers. During periods of heavy cruising,  deputies will often set up barriers blocking residential streets or limit main  thoroughfares to one-way traffic.  </P> <P> Cruising typically peaks on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, said Mayor  Alberto Natividad. He added that the city spent about $300,000 last year on the  problem.  </P> <P> During a recent week, the Sheriff's Department reported as many as 10,000  cruisers, City Manager Dennis Courtemarche said.  </P> <P> The free decals can be obtained from the public works counter at City Hall  during business hours. Lost decals will cost $10 to replace.  </P></p>

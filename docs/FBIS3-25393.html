Hundreds of demonstrators, mostly young people, swarmed into  the large avenues of Dakar after a public meeting organized by  five political parties (including the main opposition party, the  Senegalese Democratic Party of Abdoulaye Wade) to denounce the  high cost of living after the devaluation of the CFA franc by 50  percent last January.    On their route, they destroyed shops, and burned or  destroyed  vehicles and fuel stations, chanting slogans hostile to  President Abdou Diouf. Policemen who tried to intervene were  roughed up. According to witnesses, some were seriously wounded.    Despite intervention by members of the security forces, who  used tear gas in dispersing them, the demonstrators suceeded in  reaching the surroundings of the Presidential Palace. They then  took the adjacent streets, destroying several parked vehicles.    Equally violent demonstrations took place almost at the same  time in several localities in the suburb of Dakar, where  witnesses reported extensive damage.    These demonstrations came in the month of Ramadan, on the  opening day of salary negotiations between the government and  trade unions.    Yesterday, demonstrators organized by the opposition were  dispersed by security forces, who arrested about 10 people.    Early this evening, security measures were reinforced at  Plateau, an administrative and business district of Dakar, as  the demonstrators returned to their respective popular districts.    [At 2109 GMT on 16 February, AFP adds: "Five persons -- four  members of the security forces and one civilian -- were killed  during a violent demonstration today in Dakar, according to an  official casualty report. In a communique issued this evening,  the Senegalese Government `strongly condemned these acts of  vandalism which cannot in any way destabilize the institutions.'  It affirmed that those responsible for these acts will be  hunted down, arrested, and punished according to the law"]</p>

In a letter addressed to president Kim Il-Song through the  North Korean ambassador in Amman, the IAF denounced U.S.  attempts to conduct inspections on North Korea's nuclear  programme at a time when Washington continues to provide  unlimited assistance to the Jewish state by helping it to build  up its own nuclear arsenal.    The Americans continue to supply military assistance to the  Israelis who continue to occupy Palestinian land and cause the  dispersion of Palestinians throughout the world, said the letter.    American threats levelled against North Korea remind us of  the tragedy and the sufferings of the Iraqi people who continue  to endure the consequences of the unjust war waged on them and  the results of the embargo on its children and women, the letter  continued.    At the same time, it said, the Americans continue to pursue  a  policy aimed at humiliating the Iraqi people and devastating  their potentials in order to prevent them from building for  future generations.    American threats levelled against North Korea, which refuses  to succumb to Washington's hegemony, they said, also remind them  of Washington's threats against Sudan, whose people suffer as a  result of an embargo imposed since the emergence of an Islamic  regime in the country, said the letter.    In conjunction with the sanctions on Sudan is American  continued support for the separatist movement in the South of  the country a move which, the letter said, is designed to weaken  the Sudanese people and keep them subjected and under American  control.    "While we express our total astonishment at the U.S.  administration's insistence on conducting inspections on your  nuclear programme through the help of the U.N. Security Council,  which has become a tool in Washington's hands, we also note that  the United States administration protects and enhances Israel's  nuclear programme and an arsenal of hundreds of nuclear heads  that perpetually threaten the Arab region's security," said the  IAF.    Such practices, concluded the letter, provide a stark  evidence of the United States double standard policies.</p>

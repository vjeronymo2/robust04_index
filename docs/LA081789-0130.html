			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: MATCHMAKER FOR MODEMS, PHONES  </P> <P> Telephones are getting smarter all the time, but that can be a curse.  </P> <P> The trouble with a lot of fancy new telephone systems is that they don't  connect very well with computer modems. A modem is an electronic gadget that  gives a computer a monotone voice of sorts, allowing it to communicate with  other computers over ordinary telephone lines.  </P> <P> It seems ironic that just about the time that modem manufacturers perfected the  autodial modem, which lets a computer automatically place calls, the telephone  system manufacturers invented products that those modems could not control.  </P> <P> Until quite recently, telephones were basic electrical devices hooked into a  sophisticated switching system maintained by the telephone companies.  </P> <P> Now most of the telephones installed at businesses and hotels, and even some  pay telephones, are really special-purpose computer terminals disguised to look  like telephones. Sure, you can talk into them, but when you punch their buttons  to place or answer calls, you actually are entering keyboard commands into a  computer system generically called a "digital switch."  </P> <P> Such systems typically offer their owners many advantages over traditional  phones, such as built-in message recording, multiple lines tied to a single  number and control over telephone usage including time of day limitations and  area code and exchange restrictions.  </P> <P> A computer modem is easy to connect to a standard household telephone (where  computerized phone systems haven't struck yet). One simply unplugs the  telephone wire from the telephone wall jack and plugs it into a matching jack  on the back of the modem. A second wire from the modem is plugged into the wall  jack.  </P> <P> When the computer modem is working, it takes over the line from the telephone.  When the modem is not in use, voice signals from the telephone simply pass  through it to the wall jack unhampered.  </P> <P> The most common problem using a modem with the new computerized telephone  systems is that it won't connect. The jack into which the telephone wire is  plugged is the wrong size to accept the modem wire. And even if you could mate  the modem wire and phone jack, the electrical signals are mismatched.  </P> <P> Fortunately, a San Diego electronics engineer, Howard Gutzmer, has grappled  with this problem for a couple of years and has perfected a virtually universal  solution.  </P> <P> It is a small plastic box festooned with switches, jacks and a short wire that  allow any direct-connect style modem to be attached to a phone through the  telephone handset jack instead of the wall jack.  </P> <P> Called "Konexx," this $99 device lets you set the switches to match the kind of  telephone, be it old-fashioned analog or the latest digital design. The Konexx  is useful for hooking up with standard telephones that are hard-wired to the  wall, as in many hotels and motels, but have a detachable handset. (There is  also a special $124 version for fax machines that taps the electrical current  available in a telephone line that the fax machine needs.)  </P> <P> Once the connection is made and the switches are set properly (which may  require a little trial and error), most modems can autodial through most  telephones. In the worst cases, you'll have to dial manually with the  telephone, but the modem will be able to establish a connection.  </P> <P> The Konexx Model 106 is available from Gutzmer's firm, Unlimited Systems  Automated, 9225 Chesapeake Drive, Suite 3, San Diego, Calif. 92123. Phone:  (619) 277-3300. Gutzmer also makes private label versions for Traveling  Software (it's called the Mo-Fone), Digital Systems (Black Jack II) and  Computer Products Plus (CP+ Connection). All come with an alligator-clip wiring  adapter that also allows them to be connected to the microphone in a handset if  the mouthpiece is removable.  </P> <P> Computer Products Plus packages its unit with telephone cable, adapter jacks,  screwdriver and lighted magnifying glass in a handy zipper pack that it calls  the "Road Warrior Toolkit" and sells for $140. The company is at 16321 Gothard  St., Huntington Beach, Calif. 92647. Phone: (714) 847-1799.  </P> <P> Gutzmer said he is working on another much needed gadget, a 2400-baud modem  with acoustic couplers that can be used with pay phones and hard-wired hotel  and motel phones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KONEXX: The Specs: A device used to connect modems to hard-wired or electronic  telephones that are incompatible with computers.  </P> <P> Features: Connects through the telephone handset or mouthpiece. Has switch  settings for most analog and electronic telephone systems.  </P> <P> Requirements: Any direct-connect modem.  </P> <P> Manufacturer: Unlimited Systems Automated, 9225 Chesapeake Drive, Suite 3, San  Diego, Calif. 92123. Phone: (619) 277-3300. $99. Private-label versions made  for Traveling Software, Digital Systems and Computer Products Plus. There is  also a $124 fax version that passes needed electrical current from telephone  line to a fax machine.  </P></p>

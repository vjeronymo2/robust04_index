			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY BIAS ALLEGED IN REMAP CASE;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: SUPERVISORS ACCUSED OF 'RACIAL GERRYMANDERING' IN REDISTRICTING  LAWSUIT.  </P> <P> In a "greedy act" of self-preservation, Los Angeles County supervisors secretly  fashioned a redistricting plan that diluted Latino voting strength in order to  protect their own political bases, the U.S. Justice Department and two civil  rights groups charged Wednesday at the opening of a historic trial.  </P> <P> "This is an old-fashioned case about racial gerrymandering," said Mark  Rosenbaum, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of  Southern California, one of the plaintiffs in the case.  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors has been accused in a suit filed by the Justice  Department, the ACLU and the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational  Fund of dividing many of the county's 2 million Latinos among three districts,  thereby weakening their political clout in violation of the federal Voting  Rights Act.  </P> <P> During opening arguments, Rosenbaum called the board "the most powerful and  enduring all-white club" in the nation. "Since 1875 -- for 115 years -- no  person of Spanish surname has ever served on the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors," he said.  </P> <P> But John McDermott, a private attorney hired by the county, denied that the  supervisors discriminated against Latinos.  </P> <P> For the plaintiffs to win, he said, "the court is going to have to make legal  and political decisions that no court in a voting rights case has ever made."  </P> <P> The plaintiffs are seeking to consolidate the heavily Latino neighborhoods  encompassing East Los Angeles and growing immigrant neighborhoods in the San  Gabriel Valley into one district in order to help a Latino win a seat on the  five-member county board. The ACLU and MALDEF also have asked the court to  consider expanding the board to seven members.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum said Wednesday that testimony will show the supervisors carried out  the 1981 redistricting in "back rooms, by covert compacts among factions of the  board, by private revolving-door meetings" of two supervisors at a time to  sidestep a state law requiring that discussions involving three or more  supervisors be conducted in public.  </P> <P> The remapping, Rosenbaum argued, was the subject of a "fierce partisan"  political struggle between the board's conservative majority of Mike  Antonovich, Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum and liberal Supervisors Ed Edelman  and Kenneth Hahn.  </P> <P> "For each bloc, the county's Hispanic community was treated as the means to an  end of either enlarging or maintaining the partisan balance of power," the ACLU  attorney said.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum said conservative board members only wanted to increase the Latino  makeup in a district represented by the liberal Edelman -- and liberal board  members only wanted to shift Latinos to conservative Schabarum's district.  </P> <P> "Where the Republican majority sought to send their Hispanics packing, so as to  strengthen their long-term holds on their districts and their majority status,  the Democrats wanted their Hispanics spread thin, so as to remain in a  supporting roles and to pose an eventual challenge in Schabarum's district,"  the attorney said.  </P> <P> Neither faction had the four votes necessary to add Latinos to the other's  district. "It was in each incumbent's political self-interest to leave the  Hispanic community divided and weak," Rosenbaum said.  </P> <P> County lawyer McDermott said that during the 1981 redistricting, Antonovich and  Dana pressed for a district with more Latinos. "That hardly bespeaks of  discriminatory purpose," he said.  </P> <P> McDermott said Edelman opposed the plan, "not because he was anti-Hispanic, but  (because he) felt Hispanics could be better served if not packed into one  district." He said Edelman believed Latinos would have more influence if  represented by more than one supervisor.  </P> <P> McDermott pointed out that a Latino group, Californios for Fair Representation,  also spoke out in 1981 against putting all the Latinos in a single district  because "they said that would be tokenism."  </P> <P> The supervisors, who have paid nearly $1 million to private lawyers on the  case, contend it was not possible to create a district with a majority of  Latino voters, using 1980 Census figures.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs argue that such a district can be created, using the county's  own 1987 population estimates. But county attorneys counter that they are only  obliged to use the 1980 Census data.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon said he wants the trial to take no more  than 120 hours, which could span roughly six weeks.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs plan to call each of the five supervisors to testify on their  discussions leading up to adoption of the redistricting plan.  </P> <P> The trial was delayed for several weeks when both sides sought unsuccessfully  to reach an out-of-court settlement. Kenyon said Tuesday that once the trial  began, no settlement would be allowed.  </P> <P> Both parties appeared close to a settlement last month when the supervisors  agreed to put Schabarum in a new, predominantly Latino district. The compromise  fell apart, however, when a counterproposal to increase Latino voters in  Schabarum's district was rejected by the board.  </P> <P> The last chance for an out-of-court settlement appeared lost Tuesday when the  board voted down a proposal to expand from five to seven members.  </P></p>

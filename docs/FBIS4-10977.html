			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 13 Apr (PL) -- Today's issue of GRANMA said  that the coming "Nation and Emigration" conference will be a  historic starting point for the good of all and a homeland's  gesture toward those Cubans who neither became citizens nor were  assimilated into other countries.    In a lengthy full-page article under the heading "Migration,  Exile, and Political Manipulation: A Unique Case in History,"  the newspaper says it is logical for those sectors to want to be  under the country's protection when it comes to constructing a  better society and creating an integrated citizen. The author  of the commentary, Felix Pita Astudillo, added: These Cubans  living abroad concern themselves with improving their relations  with their island roots because they "are proud of their Cuban  citizenship or feel the nostalgia of those who live faraway and  wish the best for their dear ones, here or there.    "If they consider anything necessary, it is the need to  tighten the relationship between the nation and the exiles,  struggle for the free flow of citizens, improve postal and  telecommunications services, regulate remittances to families,  clean up migration statutes, abolish those laws that are still  in force, but that date back to times of tension and Cold War,  and revoke other proposals that surely will be made."    Pita Astudillo makes a necessary distinction between Cubans  who work and live abroad and those who "became U.S. nationals  and today are U.S. citizens on the payrolls of foundations,  platforms, and other such monsters, in order to live off their  fellow men." He underlines as one of the differences between  these emigres and other communities the fact that the so-called  Cuban lobby lacks a strategic rearguard or a nation to support  it, except U.S. offices and agencies. "They demand the right to  represent Cuba, but, by their own choice, Jorge Mas Canosa  became a U.S. citizen, Jorge Montaner became a Spanish citizen,  and Diaz Balart, Ros, and Menendez took up other citizenships,  because that is an essential requirement for being a member of  the U.S. legislative body," the GRANMA article adds.    Among the mirages that this group attempts to portray as  real  fact is the Cuban vote in Florida, which does not exist, Pita  Astudillo says, because in that state it is necessary to be a  U.S. citizen to vote. In addition, they have exaggerated  support from authorities, a support that other communities, such  as the Mexican community (which outnumbers the Cuban community  five to one, according to official figures) have not obtained.  All of this translates into overrepresentation through more  mayors, municipal councilmen, state legislators, and Federal  congressmen than any other group, the newspaper adds.    "Despite such a controversial position, they demand the  right  to be part of a national reconciliation in Cuba as Cubans, but  neither lobbyists, professional politicians, nor voters are in a  position to demand that they be identified with those of us who  once were their countrymen," Pita Astudillo says.    The commentator says that the presence in Havana of more  than  200 representatives of the exiles on 22, 23, and 24 April will  destroy the myth that nation and emigration are centrifugal  forces by definition. Any possible analysis "must face the  basic cause of the conflict between the two sides: the age-old  disagreement between the United States and Cuba." Later, the  article points out that this disagreement started when  Washington started to covet the then Spanish colony, continued  down to our time, was aggravated in the past 35 years and became  particularly bitter with the end of the bipolar world and the  renewal of the United States' hegemonic aspirations.    Regarding the phenomenon of emigration, the newspaper points  out that in the past this was a basically economic occurrence,  linked to the independence movement, and was ideologized and  turned into a political activity contrary to the revolution. It  is for all these reasons, Pita Astudillo adds, that emigration,  which became political exile to accommodate different U.S.  administrations, has now become a unique, unrepeatable  occurrence in the world's history.</p>

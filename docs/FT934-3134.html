			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Offers invited for four pits British Coal is inviting private-sector companies to operate four of the eight pits where it has recently ceased production and is considering arrangements for the others. Potential licensees have been asked to register interest in Calverton and Rufford, Nottinghamshire; Bentley, Yorkshire; and Wearmouth, Tyne and Wear. The corporation is considering tenders to resume mining at six pits: Betws, south Wales; Rossington and Markham Main, Yorkshire; Clipstone, Nottinghamshire; Trentham, Staffordshire; and Coventry, west Midlands. It will today announce that 180 jobs are to go at Ellington colliery, Northumberland - north-east England's last pit. A government decision rejecting plans for an open-cast coal mine near Hadrian's Wall was upheld in the High Court. Coal Contractors, based in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, wanted to mine on a site near Corbridge, Northumberland.</p>

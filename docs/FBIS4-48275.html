			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] has  protested at shots fired by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] at  former French minister for humanitarian affairs Bernard Kouchner  and the convoy bringing him back from a meeting with officials  from the other side. [passage omitted]    Bernard Kouchner is in Kigali. That is where Christophe  Boisbouvier contacted him:    [Begin recording] [Kouchner] There are refugees everywhere:  Some are hidden, some are out in the open, and they are in a  very difficult and dangerous position. There are 2 million  refugees in the country, between 1 and 2 million, and there are  some who are in particular danger in Kigali.    Do I have any hope? If I didn't have any hope I wouldn't be  going on, but nothing has yet been achieved. Let me remind you  that, in cooperation with the United Nations, with the UN forces  led by General Dallaire, we want to open the humanitarian  corridors that they themselves tried to open long ago, and to  protect those in danger, especially inside the town.    [Boisbouvier] Do you hope to be able to get the refugees out  of the town to the airport, in particular the ones in the Hotel  des Mille Collines, the Amahoro stadium, and the church of the  Holy Family?    [Kouchner] We hope to start a symbolic evacuation that will  make it possible to open up these corridors and to continue  their protectection by the UN forces. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Fishing: Hampshire pilgrimage 'All the way to Canterbury,' the lady with the lurcher shouted across the river, as the dog pursued some scent through the undergrowth. Unwittingly I was on the Pilgrims' Way. And from every shire in England, to Canterbury they used to wend. Of course, Chaucer's pilgrims journeyed from Southwark rather than beside the Itchen, just beyond Winchester's city walls. My own quest was of a rather different, less spiritual nature. So, having strolled a little way through the water meadows which lie upstream from where King Alfred's remains were lain to rest in Hyde Abbey, I cut north from the Pilgrims' Way, and bid farewell to the Itchen. I missed the little church of St Swithun at Headborne Worthy, and found myself on a lane, with the A34 to Newbury a field away to keep me company. Left to itself, this part of Hampshire - with its open slopes and unremarkable inclines - must always have been a trifle dull. The activities of the road builders have wrecked it utterly. Between them, half a dozen mighty highways have sliced the landscape into noise-ravaged segments. I hurried on. My plan was to commune with rivers, my immediate intention to reach Longparish on the Test for a leisurely lunch. But I was some way short when my stomach told me it was time to eat, and the map told me that, among Barton Stacey's straggle of thatched, timbered cottages was a pub. And so there was, The Swan, and it was shut. I pressed on, and a little way beyond Barton Stacey crossed a tributary of the Test called the Dever, which I had heard of but never seen. Lovely it was, small, crystal-clear, bursting with weed, a fine haven for trout. There was a sign by the bridge proclaiming that the fishing was in the hands of the Ministry of Defence. Enviously, I pictured the generals and colonels, fly rods in their hands. Just beyond the stream is Dever Springs, a still water open to all ranks, which is stocked with enormous rainbow trout. It was circled by fishermen in baseball caps, battling with a gusty wind. Hungry, I came to a signpost which said Longparish one mile. I lengthened my stride, covered a good half mile, then came to another signpost which said the same as the previous one. I trudged on, rehearsing sarcastic observations to Hampshire county council's signpost department. But when I came to the Test, I noted dispassionately that the water was temptation itself, and that the village was as pretty as you could wish. What I needed, however, was a pub. And there, on the Andover road, it was. The Plough, fondly remembered. A crab salad and three pints of Boddingtons later, I could appreciate Longparish. I could well understand how Colonel Peter Hawker - the early 19th century author of Instructions to Young Sportmen and a prodigious slayer of Test trout - should have so loved it. I lingered in the bar, beneath a faded photograph of the England cricket team, led by WG Grace, which faced Australia in 1884. With the afternoon now advanced, I followed what had been, the Stockbridge to Whitchurch branch line of the Great Western Railway; now a dark, bramble-infested trench. It brought me, with a diversion or two, to the tiny Bourne; which Harry Plunket Greene celebrated in his Where The Bright Waters Meet. I peered over the bridge and spied a big trout which sped off towards the creeper-clad church at Hurstbourne Priors. Then I did what no true walker should do. I thumbed a lift, and blessed the man in the red Sierra who hastened me through St Mary Bourne and Hurstbourne Tarrant. I regret having missed the two villages, and particularly being able to check whether Cobbet's initials are still carved into the gatepost outside Mr Blount's farmhouse by the bridge in Hurstbourne Tarrant. But the alternative - for I had sadly misjudged either the distance or my own speed  -was to arrive at my night's destination in the dark. As it was, no more than a gentle stroll took me up the hill from the valley of the Bourne, past a pair of old painted gipsy wagons, through a poppy-strewn meadow, and up a path which cut through gloomy Faccombe Wood. By seven I was in the pub in Faccombe, drinking more beer, and considering my blisters. I was high in the downs of north Hampshire and, in the morning, I limped higher still, before descending a great, green, tree-thick bowl to the tiny hidden hamlet of Combe. Almost a century ago, that superb writer and naturalist, WH Hudson, bicycled this way, was given lunch by the parson, and was shown the little church. The parson told Hudson that a visitor from London, who had come intending to stay a while, had found the silence so oppressive that he had fled back to the city. That quality of silence remains, even though the church - ever-open in Hudson's day - is now locked. There was no sound, no movement, as I took the steep road to the great, smooth, grassed ridge from which may be obtained one of the great views of southern England; and on which stands one of its more curious landmarks, Combe Gibbet. Hudson tells the grim tale: of a widow of Combe with two sons, and a lover from the far side of the ridge; how he, in his passion, murdered his wife by thrusting her into a hornets' nest; how the lovers were found out, and executed before a crowd at this windswept spot on a gallows carefully placed on the boundary between Combe and Inkpen, for there was a dispute between the parishes as to who should pay. A successor to that old gibbet still stands atop the ridge, gaunt and sinister; though with no indication as to what it is doing there. The vista is astonishing: to the south, a sweep of hill and dell, with Winchester and the sea beyond; the north, a great, flat plain, with the Savernake Forest to the left, and Newbury to the right. All this I saw, then - having misread my map - made a precipitous descent into Inkpen, largely on my bottom. Revived by a brief stop at The Swan - an open Swan, thank goodness - I hurried across the flat fields towards Kintbury. At Kintbury I found my last river, the Kennet. I watched a man cast ineptly for a trout. Then, outside the pub by the canal, I saw tiny fry burst from the surface as a pike went after its evening meal. It was dusk when the train came to take me back to the noisy world.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Upturn 'pre-dates ERM exit' BRITAIN's economic recovery pre-dates its exit from the European exchange rate mechanism - and sterling's devaluation is not the only reason for growth returning, Mr John Major said yesterday. 'Anyone who argues that leaving the ERM was the sole cause of recovery should inform themselves by looking at the facts,' the prime minister told the Newspaper Society in London. As well as underlining the government's increasing conviction that recovery is underway, his remarks revealed a determination to take on Euro-sceptics' opposition to a fixed exchange rate regime. 'Interest rates had been cut from 15 to 10 per cent before last September. Gross domestic product had stabilised before September and started growing again in the second half of last year. 'It's now clear that retail sales, industrial production and manufacturing investment all started to recover from around the middle of last year,' Mr Major said. Recovery was still 'in its infancy but it's growing daily,' Mr Major said. He warned that the continuing recession in Europe would affect Britain's growth performance. The prime minister used his speech to set out the two themes for the Commons' legislative programme starting in the autumn: tackling crime and de-regulation. He said much of the progress that the government has made over the last year had been obscured by debate over the economy and Maastricht. 'We have already fulfilled rather more than a third of the commitments we made in the (1992 election) manifesto. In fact, more manifesto pledges have been honoured in the parliamentary year since the 1992 election than was achieved after the elections of 1979, 1983 and 1987.'</p>

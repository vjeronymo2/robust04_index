			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / NEC looks to US or Britain for Dollars 1bn computer chip plant NEC, the Japanese electronics group, is considering a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) investment in a new semiconductor plant in either the UK or the US. The company believes its latest semiconductor plant, to be opened soon in Kyushu, southern Japan, will be unlikely to meet rising global demand. A new plant would substantially boost NEC's capacity outside Japan and could create up to 1,000 jobs. Recent projections from company annual reports estimate that Japan's six leading electronics companies plan to increase investment in semiconductor capacity by 15.3 per cent to a combined Y461bn over the next nine months, in response to a surge in demand for personal computers in the US and Japan. NEC, the second-largest semiconductor manufacturer after Intel of the US, said it was likely to decide on the investment before the end of the year. Production would be likely to start in 1996. The company has substantial facilities in both the US and UK. It employs 1,800 people in the UK, including 900 in a semiconductor plant in Livingston, Scotland, and 600 in a mobile phone facility in Telford, Shropshire. In the US, it has a large semiconductor plant in Roseville, California, employing 1,900. NEC said neither country had been chosen as favourite and no specific sites had been considered. The Kyushu plant will manufacture 16-megabit dynamic random access memories (drams). The new plant would manufacture 16-megabit chips, and a new range of 60 and 64-megabit chips. Demand for chips is already beyond projected capacity, and the soaring yen is making an overseas investment particularly attractive. 'Building another plant in Japan is not considered an option,' the company said. Earlier this year NEC announced plans to boost drams production at Roseville from tens of thousands a month to 1.5 million. It also pledged a Pounds 28m investment to increase output at Livingston, and an expansion of semiconductor production in Ireland and Singapore. NEC's semiconductor sales rose 8 per cent last year. It is projecting an increase of at least 10 per cent this year. The UK and the US governments will lobby hard for new facilities. NEC was one of several Japanese groups attracted to the UK in the 1980s by development incentives and Britain's position as a point of entry into the EU market. The electronics industry now accounts for 40 per cent of Scotland's exports, but has not expanded markedly since 1989. NEC's choice of Telford in 1987 followed intensive government efforts to persuade the company not to go to Hanover in Germany.</p>

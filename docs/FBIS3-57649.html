This was the decision  adopted by the party's third convention held in Moscow on  January 26.    The political resolution of the convention says that the  party will back the president if the government policy "gives  priority to financial stabilization, tangible support for  entrepreneurship, reduction of taxes and taxation reform and  providing the right climate for economic restructuring."    The party thinks that the situation in the country "may  culminate in increased social tension and economic hardships."  Still, President Yeltsin is said to have a real potential to  prevent this development if he "forms a government of reforms  rather than a coalition government sheltering behind reformist  phraseology."    "As things stand in Russia today, the president must not  agree to the role of an arbiter some would impose on him," the  political resolution runs.    The party will take an active part in regional and local  elections. "It is on success in these elections that the party's  future will largely depend," the party chairman Konstantin  Borovoy said at a news conference Wednesday. He also said that  the Economic Freedom Party intended to interact with democratic  and reform forces and would work for a broad democratic  coalition in parliament.</p>

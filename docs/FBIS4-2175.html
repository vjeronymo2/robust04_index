			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng held  talks with visiting Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho here this  afternoon. They exchanged views on bilateral ties, international  concerns and other issues of common interest.    During the talks, Li recalled his meeting with Aho in  Finland  in 1992, when he stopped over on his way back from the Rio  Conference on Environment and Development.    "I had a fruitful meeting with you," Li told Aho.    "Though the visit was short, it was very successful," Aho  said.    The two countries have cooperated well in political,  economic  and other fields in recent years, Aho said, and there remains  great potential for further economic and trade cooperation.    Li Peng agreed with this. He said that in recent years, the  bilateral ties have been developing smoothly and that the  economic and trade ties have scored relatively fast development  and the trade volume has been increasing at an average two  percent yearly.    And the number of scientific and technological cooperative  projects have reached some dozens, Li said, adding that the  majority of them perform well.    The two countries have also had good cooperation in the  fields of culture and education, Li said.    He noted that Finland has rich experience in forestry, wood  processing and environmental protection. There are lots of  opportunities for the two countries to cooperate in these  fields, he said.    The current visit here by many Finnish businessmen will help  promote the contacts and cooperation between the two countries'  enterprises, he said. He expressed the hope that more Finnish  entrepreneurs would come and participate in China's economic  construction.    Talking about the world situation, Aho noted that although  the Cold War is over, the new world order has not been  established and there still exist many regional problems in the  world. The United Nations should play an important role in  solution of these problems, he said.    Li said that although the world situation is moving toward  relaxing of tensions, there are still many unstable factors,  such as economic regression, national conflicts, and territorial  disputes.    A new world order should be built in which all nations,  whatever their ideologies, social systems or economic  development levels, can live in peace and make joint efforts to  tackle the peace and development issues facing today's world, Li  said.    During the meeting, Li also elaborated on China's stance on  human rights.    Li noted that the rights to survival and development are  crucial to developing countries, a proposition recorded in the  Vienna declaration and program on action.    When talking about human rights, differences in culture,  history, traditions and economic development levels in different  countries cannot be ignored, he said.    He noted that China is willing to conduct dialogues in this  respect with other countries on the basis of equality, mutual  respect and understanding.    Finland holds that the human rights issue should be  discussed  in a frank and friendly manner, rather than through criticizing  and censuring, Aho said.    Touching on China's domestic situation, Li said that  maintaining stability is an overwhelming task. Only with a  stable domestic political situation and peaceful international  environment can a country develop its economy and raise people's  living standard, Li stressed.    During the talks, Aho showed much interest in China's  economic performance. He told Li that the economy is growing  slowly in Europe and that Finnish businesses want to intensify  their cooperation with China and participate in its economic  construction. This is very important to Finland's economy, he  said.    Aho invited the Chinese premier to visit Finland at his  convenience. Li received the invitation.    After the talks, the two sides signed an agreement for a  cultural exchange program and a contract for the building of a  disaster reduction system along the Yellow River.    Among those participating in today's talks were Chinese  State  Councillor and Minister in Charge of the State Science and  Technology Commission Song Jian, Director of the Foreign Affairs  Office under the State Council Qi Huaiyuan and Finnish Minister  of Foreign Affairs Veli Sundback.    Aho arrived here this morning for a six-day official visit  to  China at Li's invitation.    Prior to the talks, Li hosted a welcoming ceremony in Aho's  honor.    After the talks, the two prime ministers met with Finnish  businessmen and press representatives.    Asked about the talks, Li and Aho both responded that the  talks were successful.</p>

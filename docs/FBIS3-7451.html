They declared that they would launch a widespread signature  campaign against "parliamentary ratification" of the farm market  opening.    The Citizens' Federation for Economic Justice on the same  day  published a statement condemning the Kim Yong-sam group for  widening the scope of the farm market opening.    That day, Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the opposition Democratic  Party, said they would fight in concert with broad dissident  forces against the expansion of the scope of the farm market  opening.    Meanwhile, an opinion poll conducted by the General Student  Council of Korea University in Seoul among nearly 8,000 students  on March 25 and 26, showed that nearly 90 percent of the  respondents opposed the rice market opening.</p>

			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> UNION PICKETS COLLEGE TRUSTEES' MEETING  </P> <P> Custodians, clerical workers and other members of the California School  Employee Assn. picketed the Saddleback Community College District Board meeting  Monday night to protest their lack of a contract.  </P> <P> Union members, who include 380 employees at the district's two colleges, also  planned to present a petition seeking higher wages and implementation of a new  job classification plan to district trustees, said Tamara Carnine, chief  negotiator for the workers. The employees, who have been without a contract  since June 30, are seeking a pay increase of 4% to 7% and implementation of the  job classification plan, which will include raises for many workers,  retroactive to July, 1988.  </P> <P> "They have offered increases but not fair and equitable increases," Carnine  said. "The reclassification plan is being held hostage."  </P> <P> District Chancellor Richard Sneed said he was surprised by the union's action,  since a mediator assisting in contract talks had "suggested to us we were very  close together."  </P> <P> Linda Jenson, head negotiator for the district, said the union workers have  been offered a 4.7% cost of living increase retroactive to last July. In  addition, she said, the district has agreed to implement the job  reclassification retroactive to the same time, but she said union officials may  object to the method the district proposes to use to determine resulting  raises.  </P> <P> The district is made up of Saddleback College in Mission Viejo and Irvine  Valley College in Irvine.  </P></p>

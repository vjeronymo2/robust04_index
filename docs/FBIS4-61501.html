			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Vlasov] </F>   [Text] Pskov May 5 TASS -- An expedition from the Russian  Federation's chief directorate for geology and cartography has  begun drawing the border line between Russia and Estonia near  Pskov "on the basis of old and new data, maps and official  documents".    During negotiations with Estonia, the Russian delegation  repeatedly called on the Estonian side to begin joint work to  demarcate the state border but heard refusals each time.    The Russian leadership decided to begin marking and  reinforcing the border unilaterally, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev announced during his visit to Pskov in April. He  stressed then that "the border must reinforced with technical  means but not with the bodies of Russian soldiers". The  minister was referring to the shooting of a Russian border  patrol by contrabandists specialising in arms trade.    The expedition will mark the border on the terrain in May  and  then the border guards will install special signs and protection  devices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The reactivation of an old power plant, the "Manuel  Julien," located in the historic sector of the city of Camaguey  is one of the responsibilities assigned to the province's  scientific hub. After being taken out of service a few years  ago, this plant is now undergoing modifications that will allow  it to burn solid fuels, mainly bagasse.    Seven groups made up of people from 11 provincial  organizations are working on the power plant, which began  operating in the 1920's. These people are responsible for  repairing the plant's boilers, cooling system, pipes, and water  treatment system. The plant is expected to be operational in  June, and to be capable of generating 10 megawatts, which is a  third of the city of Camaguey's demand.    This is a new responsibility that has been given to the  productive scientific hub, and reactivating the plant will allow  us to make it available during two periods, as well as  incorporate it into the power grid.</p>

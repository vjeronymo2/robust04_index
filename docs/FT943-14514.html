			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Survey of Merseyside (5): The 'drivers' of change - How the European funds are likely to be spent A five-point plan to regenerate Merseyside's lagging economy has been approved by the European Commission, it was announced yesterday. The six-year plan will be the basis for spending Merseyside's Pounds 628m of Objective 1 funds. UK public sector sources will match the sum. The combined Pounds 1.26bn is expected to lever in more from the private sector. Under the plan there will be five main 'drivers' of economic change:- The big-company sector. Projects will relate to preparing, servicing and accessing strategic sites for large companies and signif- icant inward investors. Infra- structure spending, marketing and improving the region's image will also be covered here. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) will be encouraged to grow, with EU money helping to fund training, services and advice through TECS and Business Links. There will be a Merseyside Special Investment Fund, set up by the clearing banks but with EU money used to subsidise interest rates for business loans. Knowledge-based industries will be encouraged, with special attention to technology transfer between Merseyside's two universities and industry, particularly SMEs. One idea is a graduate retention programme with local industry to keep more people in the area after qualifying. The arts, cultural and tourism sectors will be encouraged. People-based initiatives will concentrate on training and systematic development of human resources. Inner city and social problem areas, such as outer estates with high unemployment, will be especially targeted. Money will be cascaded into projects on a wholesale-retail basis. It will go in bulk to 'eligible bodies' - such as local authorities, the three TECs on Merseyside, or the universities. Other 'eligible' wholesalers include Merseytravel, English Partnerships and Merseyside Development Corporation, as well as voluntary sector and non-profit organisations, or other bodies acting in the public interest. English Partnerships (EP) is expected to play a leading role as the big-company driver. Mr David Taylor, the chief executive, says three main sites will be involved, headed by the Speke-Garston area near Liverpool Airport, where EP will commit Pounds 36m to develop what Mr Alan Chape, deputy chief executive of Liverpool city council, says will be a 21st century business park. A new link road is already being built to put Speke within a few minutes of the motorway network. Another EP investment site will be Parkside colliery in St Helens, which closed last year. It is well-placed, adjacent to the M6 near the Haydock interchange with the A580 East Lancashire road and the M62 cross-over. The third site is the Cammell Laird shipyard at Birkenhead, which its owner VSEL, the Barrow nuclear submarine builder, closed but has been reluctant to sell. Merseyside Development Corporation has compulsory purchase powers. A joint venture with EP and the private sector looks possible. Some SMEs have criticised the plans because under EU rules they cannot apply for Objective 1 funds directly, since these are for restructuring industry rather than subsidising individual businesses. However, Mr Tim Beer, who runs KPMG Peat Marwick's north-west services for owner-managed businesses, suggests: 'Companies might join together to draw down training and consultancy money to improve competitiveness. 'Many SMEs have still to tackle how to reduce costs. We need more mergers and acquisitions among them. I have seen a large number of companies that are fundamentally good but their individual market shares are too small to carry their costs and allow substantial growth. There is also a need for venture capital.' On this last point, Mr Ian Berry, chief executive of Liverpool chamber of commerce, hopes to set up an investment fund administered by a trust. It would work in the equity gap with private sector venture capital partners, down to as little as Pounds 50,000 invested. Due diligence - the costs of which make most deals below Pounds 500,000 uneconomic for the private sector  -would also be met by the fund. He also sees SMEs as being able to borrow from a fund that the banks would create, but at interest rates subsidised by Objective 1 money. In the tourism area, Objective 1 funds can be used to help build hotels. Mr Berry says Merseyside would also benefit from reviving Liverpool's largely dilapidated Chinatown, partly by building an underground station in the middle of it to improve access from Merseyrail's existing services. Many of the 'people' initiatives will try to target training to upskill the workforce in jobs, rather than just train unemployed people for stock. The three TECs - Merseyside in Liverpool, Cewtec in the Wirral and Qualitec in St Helens - will be the main wholesalers of funds. As Mr John Stoker, head of government offices on Merseyside, puts it: 'It's about jobs; it's about enabling. It's a tall order, but Objective 1 has got to address fundamentals and make things better.'</p>

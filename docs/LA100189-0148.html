			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE ORIOLES  </P> <P> At the breakfast counter in Waverly, almost within view of Memorial Stadium,  there was only one topic being discussed.  </P> <P> "I think we're going to sweep," said the guy in the suit.  </P> <P> "No way," said the man wearing the flowered tie. "Did you see where Toronto got  five runs in the ninth inning of their last game? They were telling us  something."  </P> <P> "We're not going to sweep 'em," said the guy in the white sweater, "but we'll  win. That's just the kind of year this has been."  </P> <P> "How we going to beat Toronto three out of four?" asked flowered tie.  </P> <P> "What are you talking about, three out of four?" said white sweater. "All we  got to do is win two out of three to tie."  </P> <P> "What about the playoff game here Monday?" flowered tie said. "If we lose that,  the weekend means nothing. We've got to win three out of four against a team  with better talent -- and two of those in their ballpark. If we lose this first  one tonight (Friday), we've got to win three straight. No way that's going to  happen."  </P> <P> Conversations like that are taking place all over Baltimore as the Orioles open  a three-game showdown series against the Blue Jays in Toronto Friday night.  Little else seems to have the attention of the masses.  </P> <P> All spring and summer, people have watched this phenomenon, wondering how long  it would last.  </P> <P> Can a team that lost 107 games last year actually stay in the race this year?  All the way?  </P> <P> The Orioles have done that now.  </P> <P> Thanks to the advent of the league championship series 20 years ago, Baltimore  can still win the pennant. If the old system were still in place, with all  American League clubs lumped together and the champion going on to the World  Series, there would be no excitement in Baltimore now.  </P> <P> The Orioles, with their 86-73 record and their .541 percentage, would be in  fifth place. Oakland, Kansas City, California and Toronto all have better  records. The Athletics would be representing the American League in the Series.  </P> <P> The lords of sports are often criticized for overextending seasons, for  creating phony playoffs and wild-card teams, all, of course, to make more money  for themselves.  </P> <P> Now, even with the other three division champions already crowned (Oakland A's,  Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants), pennant fever grips five cities.  </P> <P> In Baltimore, the tension is becoming unbearable. To put people's minds at  ease, a peek at the outcome is hereby offered.  </P> <P> Friday night -- Jeff Ballard wins No. 19, beating Todd Stottlemyre. The O's and  Jays are tied for first.  </P> <P> Saturday -- Jimmy Key beats Pete Harnisch. Blue Jays back on top by a game.  </P> <P> Sunday -- Bob Milacki beats Dave Stieb. Regular season ends with clubs  deadlocked with 87-74 records.  </P> <P> Monday -- Ballard, with only two days' rest, starts playoff game in Baltimore.  He runs out of gas early, is relieved by Dave Johnson. A slugfest ensues. With  a driving rain pelting the Memorial Stadium crowd of 50,000, Keith Moreland  hits a two-run pinch homer to win the game, 10-8. The Orioles scurry to catch a  bus to the airport for their flight to Oakland for Tuesday's opening game of  the American League Championship Series.  </P> <P> You don't believe Moreland will emerge the hero?  </P> <P> Don't worry. In a year like this, the year of the unlikely, Moreland is the  most likely hero. Bet you the homer is controversial, too -- foul or fair? --  and the call goes the Orioles' way, adding to the aura of inevitability.  </P> <P> Among many fans, there is still, after 159 games, a feeling of disbelief. Some  are saying they hope the O's don't go down feebly. It is as if a bunch of kids  has been sent to Toronto to do a man's job, and no one wants to see the  youngsters hurt or embarrassed.  </P></p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Indian companies cleared to return to euromarkets Indian companies, forced to postpone plans for euroissues following the failure of the Dollars 1bn offering by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), India's international telecommunications carrier, are preparing to return to the market. The finance ministry has given preliminary approval to 12 companies to tap the markets in the next three months. They include Telco, the lorry and bus maker belonging to the Tata industrial grouping, with a Dollars 300m deal; Bajaj Auto, the scooter and motorcycle manufacturer (Dollars 160m); JK Synthetics, a plastics company (Dollars 100m); and Straw Products, a paper and board manufacturer (Dollars 100m). These four groups alone aim to raise Dollars 660m, so the total for the three months could reach Dollars 1bn. Under guidelines announced this month, the ministry has powers to regulate the flow of companies going to the market. Would-be issuers must seek preliminary approval and then return to the ministry for final approval once terms are set. Investment bankers in Bombay said yesterday the prices of Global Depository Receipts issued by Indian companies, which had fallen heavily before VSNL's abortive issue, had recently recovered. As well as the 12 companies approved for the coming three months, several others which secured approval before the VSNL issue went to the market are expected to resume their attempts to raise funds. Among them is Ballarpur Paper, a papermaker and flagship company of the Delhi-based Thapar industrial grouping. Meanwhile, leading state-owned banks are about to secure permission to tap the capital markets for the first time. A parliamentary bill allowing these banks to raise private equity and dilute the government's 100 per cent stake is expected to receive the president's assent and become law in the next few days. About six banks are expected to try to raise between Rs2bn and Rs3bn (Dollars 95.7m) each in the next few months. They include some of the best-performing state-owned banks, notably Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda and Oriental Bank of Commerce. They will be following the State Bank of India, the largest publicly-owned bank, which last year raised Rs32bn in stocks and bonds. SBI was able to go to market without enabling legislation because its ownership structure was different. SBI cut the state's shareholding from 98 per cent to 66 per cent.</p>

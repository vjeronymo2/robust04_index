			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Observer: Dead end Another first for the City of London. It has plenty of streets, gates, hills and even ditches, but up to now never a road. However, it has just had to accept its first - the south-eastern tip of Goswell Road - and by all accounts the City elders are none too pleased. It's all the fault of the changes in local authority boundaries. 'The thing is, you don't need roads once you are in the City, because you have arrived,' says a City official. Barbara Newman, who heads the City's planning and transportation committee, is not optimistic about getting Islington's council to rename its highway, Goswell Street, just to suit the City. While Observer was always rather proud to live in a road as opposed to a street, Newman seems intent on maintaining the City's 'No Roads' policy. Sounds like a bit of gerrymandering is called for.</p>

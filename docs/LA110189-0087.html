			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Reebok Unveils $170 Shoe: At a New York City basketball court, Reebok unveiled  its new $170 inflatable basketball shoe called the Pump and said it planned to  spend an unusually large $15 million to advertise it. The high-topped shoes  have an orange button on the tongue that can be pressed to pump air into a  specially designed plastic bladder, forming a readily adjusted cushion around  the ankle, heel and instep. Reebok's main competitor, Nike Inc., said it is  already shipping similar shoes called Nike Air Pressure to retailers. Nike's  model costs $175.  </P></p>

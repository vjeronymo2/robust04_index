			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: JASON MINICI  </P> <P> School: Irvine High  </P> <P> Sport: Football  </P> <P> Position: Quarterback  </P> <P> Class: Junior  </P> <P> Irvine Coach Terry Henigan has decided that in order to win in the South Coast  League, the Vaqueros must pass effectively. Judging from the school records  Minici is setting, Henigan has found the right player for the job.  </P> <P> Minici, who started at quarterback last year as a sophomore at Adlai Stevenson  High School in suburban Chicago, had 18 completions to set a school single-game  record in his first game for Irvine this season. Friday, he completed 14 of 25  passes for 304 yards -- another school single-game record -- passed for two  touchdowns and ran for another in Irvine's 26-14 South Coast League victory  over Dana Hills. Minici, who also helped receiver Mark Huffman set the school  record for reception yards (201) in the game, transferred to Irvine last spring  and was the starting catcher for the baseball team. Henigan says Minici has  been helped by competition at quarterback from sophomore Aron Garcia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> Adrian Ioja, who caught two touchdown passes, recovered a fumble and returned  it 35 yards for another touchdown and kicked five extra points to lead Garden  Grove to a 35-7 victory over Los Amigos Friday.  </P> <P> Brandon Jessie, who caught four passes for 159 yards and two touchdowns in  Edison's 21-10 victory over Santa Ana Friday.  </P> <P> Daniel Niednagel, a Dana Hills cross-country runner who had the fastest time of  the day -- 15 minutes 17 seconds for three miles -- to win the invitational  race of the Orange Country Championships Saturday.  </P> <P> Greg Windle, who completed 16 of 18 passes for 255 yards and two touchdowns and  also scored two touchdowns on a couple of one-yard runs in Troy's 28-7 victory  over Sonora Friday.  </P></p>

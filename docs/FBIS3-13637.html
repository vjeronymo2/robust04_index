			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Egyptian authorities have decided that they will  allow only 2,000 Algerian pilgrims to cross their territory by  land this year on their way to the holy places. Last year,  nearly 24,000 pilgrims travelled by road to perform the annual  pilgrimage.    According to information available to us, the Egyptian  authorities have demanded that these Algerian pilgrims travel on  coaches laid on by tourist agencies and not by private  transport, as has been the practice so far. This decision,  which applies to all nationals from the Arab Maghreb, is  believed to be due to security considerations.</p>

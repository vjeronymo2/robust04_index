			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Japanese groups' capital spending likely to fall 4% CAPITAL spending by Japanese companies is likely to fall by 4 per cent next fiscal year, according to the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, whose gloomy forecast comes as some companies are hailing the end of the downturn. A surge in Tokyo stock prices has stirred debate on whether a recovery is imminent, but the LTCB's influential survey of corporate spending plans found little reason for optimism. The bank estimates capital spending will fall 3.9 per cent in the year ending tomorrow, and another 4 per cent next fiscal year, the biggest drop since 1970 and the first time that the bank has forecast two consecutive years of decline. 'Virtually all industries are trimming their investments, the only exceptions being mainly in the fields of electric power, gas and land transportation,' LTCB said. 'Many industries that have been slow to adjust to economic changes will finally begin cutting their investments in earnest during fiscal 1993.' The bank forecasts that investment in facilities and equipment by manufacturing industry will fall 12.9 per cent in the next year, following a 15.6 per cent drop this year. Steel makers told the bank that they will be cutting capital spending by 20.8 per cent. Meanwhile, officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are finalising details of an emergency economic package, likely to be unveiled on April 8. The LDP yesterday held talks with opposition parties on the spending proposals, which Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, wants to bring with him on a Washington visit on April 15. Opposition politicians yesterday demanded the package contain income tax cuts of Y4,260bn (Pounds 25bn), which have been strongly opposed by the finance ministry. The opposition argues the emphasis on infrastructure spending in a package last year had little effect on the weakened confidence of most consumers. Japan's labour office ruled yesterday that a supermarket attendant who died after working 360 days in a row was not a victim of karoshi or death from overwork, Reuter adds from Tokyo. Kyodo news service quoted Labour Standards Inspection officials in Yokohama as saying the man was not sick seven days before his death, so his family was not entitled to compensation. A claim filed by his widow said Yuji Iguchi, 43, worked 360 days during 1989. After taking the first three days off in 1990, he worked until February 10, 1990, when he collapsed, dying two days later. Japan's labour standards say a victim of karoshi must be sick or suffer injury one week before death.</p>

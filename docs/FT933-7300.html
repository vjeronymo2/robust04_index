			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / South Koreans drive a hard bargain to take the fast train: GEC Alsthom is leading the field THE South Koreans proved they can drive a hard bargain when they selected the Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV) as the preferred choice for the country's new high-speed train. GEC Alsthom, the manufacturer of the TGV, was forced to cut its initial bid by 35 per cent to Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.6bn) in order to defeat Siemens, with its newer and more technologically advanced Inter-city Express, and Mitsubishi's Shinkansen for the prestigious contract. Seoul knew it was in a strong position in demanding significant concessions from the competing bidders. The high-speed rail system, which will go into full operation in 2002 along the 420km route from Seoul to Pusan and cut travel time to 100 minutes from about four hours, is the first such network on the Asian mainland. Consequently, the company that won the contract would improve its chances of gaining more business in Asia and elsewhere. 'The Korean order is important because it will influence the selection of contractors for the proposed high-speed train projects in Taiwan and Canada,' said Mr Ambroise Cariou, director of GEC-Alsthom's Seoul office. In the longer term, China may also decide to build a high-speed rail network, while South Korea is likely to extend its system to North Korea and possibly China and Russia if Korean unification becomes reality. It was the promise of more orders accruing from the South Korean one that goaded France to launch an aggressive diplomatic campaign to support GEC Alsthom's bid. Several French officials, including Mrs Edith Cresson, the former prime minister, and Mr Alaine Juppe, the foreign minister, came to Seoul to lobby, and President Francois Mitterrand is scheduled to arrive in South Korea next month. When former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo visited France in 1991, a special trip on the TGV was arranged for him. The time and energy that the French devoted to winning the contract impressed the South Koreans. But Seoul will continue to put pressure on GEC Alsthom for more concessions as the company enters final contract negotiations with the Ministry of Transportation. Officially, GEC Alsthom has only been awarded priority in negotiating the contract, the implicit threat being that the government could switch its order to Siemens if GEC Alsthom fails to meet Korean demands on price and technology transfers. That is unlikely to happen, however, as GEC Alsthom appears to be accommodating Korean requests. Half of the TGV contract will be distributed to domestic subcontractors, which will assemble 44 of the trainsets in South Korea by 2001, while GEC Alsthom will completely build and supply the first two prototype units by 1997. Hyundai Precision and Industry, Daewoo Heavy Industry and Hanjin Heavy Industries, which make both rail and subway rolling stock, have formed a consortium to participate in the rail project as subcontractors. The contract also includes a signalling system, valued at Won400bn (Pounds 340m). Potential subcontractors include Samsung Electronic, Hyundai Electronic and Goldstar Industrial Systems. The government recently almost doubled the projected cost of the rail project to Won10,700bn from the 1989 estimate of Won5,840bn because of increases in wages, material and additional construction work. It also extended the deadline for construction work, which will total Won6,700bn, by three years to 2001. Construction planning is being conducted by Bechtel International of the US and Korea Power Engineering. The initial segment between Chonan and Taejon in central Korea is being built by 12 Korean companies, including Halla Construction, Ilsung Construction and Hyundai Engineering and Construction, and will be completed by 1997. The rail line will be extended to Seoul in 1999 and Pusan in 2001. As the costs of the project increased, the government demanded that the train suppliers substantially reduce their bid offers. GEC Alsthom cut its bid from the initial offer of Dollars 3.7bn made in May 1992 to Dollars 2.4bn last month. The reduction mainly reflected changes in the exchange rate between the French franc and the US dollar during this period, according to Mr Cariou. But it also had to trim Dollars 230m this summer as it engaged in a last-minute bidding war with Siemens. The tougher financial requirements forced Mitsubishi of Japan, which was offering the Shinkansen, to drop out of the competition in June. The project was criticised during last year's presidential election, when the opposition accused the government of President Roh Tae-woo of using the rail programme to reward business supporters with contracts. Mr Kim Young-sam, then the presidential candidate of the ruling party, persuaded the government to delay selection of the train contractor until his administration took office to reduce suspicions of bribery and kickbacks. The new president, who initially appeared cool to the rail project, is now eagerly promoting it as a means to stimulate the sluggish economy. The government predicts the project could boost economic growth by Won15,300bn and create almost 900,000 jobs. Few doubt that South Korean needs a high-speed rail system to relieve traffic congestion, particularly between Seoul and Pusan, the most heavily travelled route in the country. The south-eastern city of Pusan is the country's biggest port and second largest urban area. If the new train system carries 520,000 passengers a day, it would remove 33,000 cars and 8,000 buses from the Seoul-Pusan motorway, which now supports double the traffic levels of its planned capacity of 48,000 vehicles. It could also reduce population pressure in Seoul by encouraging people to move to Chonan and Taejon, which will be within half an hour's commuting distance of the capital.</p>

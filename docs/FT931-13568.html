			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Former Soviet republics try to avert trade collapse A SPECIAL bank to save trade from collapsing among former Soviet republics is the most pressing item on the agenda of today's CIS summit, but it is feared the plan will falter for lack of Russian support. The proposed Inter-State Bank would act as a multilateral clearing house for inter-republican trade, with sanctions for republics which exceed agreed levels of indebtedness. It also provides for co-ordinated monetary, credit, and budgetary policy as an additional option for those republics which decide to keep the rouble as their currency. The government of Russia, which has a trade surplus with virtually every republic, has undertaken to provide Rbs200bn to finance the bank. However, Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, central bank governor in Belarus, the republic hosting the summit, said he feared Russia would 'drag out the issue' because of disagreements between the Russian central bank and the government, and a reluctance to bankroll republics which 'will all owe it money'. The dilemma of Belarus, provides a stark illustration of what is at stake in a continuing collapse of trade between republics whose economies remain highly interdependent. One of the main problems has been the demise of a common currency as republics have either introduced their own currencies or continued to use the rouble without co-ordinating monetary and credit policy. By unilaterally switching trade to a 'bilateral clearing basis' to prevent republics from issuing roubles unbacked by goods, Moscow has made it impossible for Belarus and others to pay for Russian energy imports with anything other than roubles earned from exports to Russian enterprises. More than 80 per cent of Belarussian industrial output has traditionally been exported to other republics. Unlike, for example, Kazakhstan, which can export raw materials further afield for its currency, Belarus is 100 per cent dependent on cheap Russian energy supplies to run the manufacturing industry which is its main source of revenue. Even if a clearing system were established, it would still be unable to afford world prices for energy imports. This is why Belarussian leaders firmly believe the country's future depends on close co-operation with Russia. 'If Belarus were to pay world prices for energy it would cost it 2.5 times its hard currency export earnings,' agrees a diplomat at one of the newly-established foreign embassies which are the most tangible signs of the republic's reluctantly acquired independence. A central problem is that unlike Belarus, most republics do not want to trade some of their newly-won sovereignty - ceding some control over monetary and credit policy to Russia in order to maintain the rouble as a common currency. Attempts over the past couple of years to establish a central banking union to co-ordinate monetary policy has faltered because of most republics' insistence on one vote per republic. This scheme has been rejected by Russia which wants voting in a common banking system to be proportional to each republic's economic clout. The uncertainty has also provided Belarus with an excuse to freeze negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a reform programme to stabilise the country's finances and begin restructuring the economy. In the absence of reforms, production has fallen just 10 per cent instead of 25 per cent in Russia, and inexplicably its budget deficit has been smaller at just 5 per cent of gross domestic product last year. But inflation remains high at more than 1,000 per cent last year and the republic adopted a law on privatisation only three days ago. 'The IMF has given us an ultimatum: either we find an agreement with Russia or we get out (of the rouble zone) and introduce our own currency. After this, they are ready to provide us with financial support,' says Mr Bogdankevich. 'We are not ready to decide either way yet: we are making a final attempt to come to an arrangement with Russia.' One solution would be for the west to provide finance for an inter-state bank, just like the US financed a settlement system in post-war Europe. But such a proposal, backed for instance by Mr George Soros, the Hungarian-born philanthropist, is unlikely to make much headway until republics decide among themselves whether to give up the illusion of a common currency, or to make it a reality.</p>

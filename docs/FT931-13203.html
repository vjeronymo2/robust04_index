			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / O&amp;Y set to confront unsecured creditors OLYMPIA &amp; York is heading for a confrontation with a key group of unsecured creditors in Toronto this afternoon. The outcome could determine whether the ailing property developer can emerge from the court protection which it sought last May. According to lawyers for the lenders, O&amp;Y refused to agree during last-minute negotiations on Friday to at least one demand by the creditors for changes to its restructuring plan. By the end of last week, 22 out of 35 creditor groups had accepted O&amp;Y's proposals, while eight rejected them. All five remaining meetings are due to reconvene today after earlier adjournments. The plan covers about CDollars 8.5bn (Pounds 4.33bn) of O&amp;Y's CDollars 13.5bn debt. The groups which have so far turned down O&amp;Y's proposals are not expected to imperil the plan as a whole. But approval by the unsecured group, consisting mainly of North American, European and Japanese banks, is crucial to the restructuring effort. Unlike most of the lenders, whose claims are against specific O&amp;Y assets, the unsecured creditors have claims totalling about CDollars 4bn against the parent company, Olympia &amp; York Developments. The key remaining sticking point is understood to be O&amp;Y's demand that creditors grant every member of the Reichmann family, which owns O&amp;Y, a sweeping release from future legal claims. According to an O&amp;Y information circular posted to creditors last month, disputes or litigation later on 'would defeat the intent of the plan'. The lenders have so far insisted that the releases should be limited to specific transactions.</p>

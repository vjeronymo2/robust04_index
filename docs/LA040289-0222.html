			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IDENTITY OF BIRDS IN PHOTOS HARD TO SWALLOW  </P> <P> I wonder how many comments you will receive about your error in bird  identification (March 22)?  </P> <P> The foraging shore bird you pictured, identified as "tern" bears no resemblance  to a tern. Most likely it is an American avocet -- which, by strange  coincidence, you have pictured in the same edition, in the sports section.  </P> <P> Just wanted you to know we do read the paper carefully!  </P> <P> FRANK ELLIS  </P> <P> Los Alamitos  </P></p>

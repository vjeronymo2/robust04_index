			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 30-CENT STAMP PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Regarding the proposed increase by the U.S. Postal Service, I want to make the  following comments:  </P> <P> I believe the major portion of the deficit is due primarily to junk mail  delivered at "bargain basement prices." Think of the cost of extra staff  handling and delivering printed advertisements and soliciting letters!  </P> <P> When I told a mail carrier that 70% of my mail was junk mail, he replied that  junk mail was his job insurance.  </P> <P> PAUL BIERBRIER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

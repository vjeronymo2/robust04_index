"We believe that the potential for our company is enormous,"  Xu told a group of reporters at the Bank of New York, which has  been selected to act as the depositary for the sponsored level-1  ADRS of the Shanghai company.    The Bank of New York announced on March 21 that Shanghai  Chlor- Alkali Chemical Company's ADRS were effective and are  traded in the ratio of one ADR representing ten "B" shares  traded on Shanghai Stock Exchange.    They will trade on the over-the-counter market in the United  States.    The Shanghai company, a Sino-foreign joint stock company  established in July 1992, produces over 20 kinds of products  with over 40 different styles of four categories.    With the capacity to produce 350,000 tons of caustic soda  and  220,000 tons of PVC [polyvinyl chloride], the company's products  have been exported to over ten countries and regions, such as  Japan, the United States and Italy.    Shanghai Chlor-Alkali's B shares owned by foreign investors  now represent 34.9 percent of its total shares outstanding. In  1993, based on international accounting standards, the company's  total sales were 1.3 billion Chinese yuan and profit after tax  was 171 million yuan.    According to Wu Yalun, vice chairman of the Shanghai Stock  Exchange, Shanghai Chlor-Alkali now became the third Chinese  company to have ADRS traded at the U.S. market. He expected  that there would be more Chinese ADRS to enter the U.S. capital  market if they perform well.</p>

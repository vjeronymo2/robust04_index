			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Don't stop history at Los Angeles: America By a strange coincidence I finally got round to Francis Fukuyama's book The End of History* just as Los Angeles went up in flames. In 1989, Mr Fukuyama, then an obscure State Department official, sent shock waves through intellectual circles with a magazine article arguing that the US/western European brand of liberal democracy represents the end point of history. The book, published earlier this year, expands the original argument, explaining how science and human nature together drive societies inexorably towards democratic capitalism. He sees this as the final destination because it 'constitutes the best possible solution to the human problem.' Events in Los Angeles give pause for thought. The city erupted in violence following the acquittal of the white policemen videotaped beating Mr Rodney King, a black. The subsequent days of rioting saw some of the worst civil disorder in the nation's history: more than 50 people dead, thousands injured and almost 4,000 buildings destroyed  - a worse record than in most of the race riots of the 1960s. Is violence of this kind unavoidable at the end of history? Some will deny any connection between the horrific events in Los Angeles and the US's economic and political system. The apparent injustice of the all-white jury's decision in the King trial was bound to provoke a reaction. But the tension between blacks and whites, runs the argument, is not primarily economic in origin; it is rather the price that is being paid for the US's past failure to respect its own liberal principles. If there had been no suppression of blacks' civil rights, the two races would today be living in harmony. At any rate, they would rub along at least as well as whites and Asians or whites and Hispanics. Yet few Americans believe race is the whole story. It is ironic that just as the word 'class' is being banished from the political vocabulary of former communist countries, it is reappearing in the US. Fury at what seemed a racially-motivated travesty of justice was the trigger for last week's rioting. But the methodical destruction of property also reflected an urban underclass's frustration after years of economic and social deprivation. If every face in the Los Angeles ghettos were magically painted white tomorrow, the economic outlook would not be transformed. There would be less discrimination in job hiring and education but the ghetto dwellers would remain an economically depressed class. Problems have festered because federal government has looked the other way. The Bush administration believes the Great Society public sector programmes launched in the 1960s encouraged greater welfare dependency. It has thus failed to revive urban programmes cut drastically during the Reagan years. At the same time, however, President George Bush has lacked the courage vigorously to support an alternative approach to urban decay championed by conservatives such as Mr Jack Kemp, the housing secretary. They urge Thatcherite reforms such as tax breaks for inner city 'enterprise zones' and steps to give tenants ownership stakes in public housing. By failing to endorse the new approach, while rejecting the old, Mr Bush has ended up with no policy. The deeper question is whether periodic outbursts, such as the Los Angeles riot, are inevitable in capitalist societies even if social policies are more enlightened. Mr Fukuyama's analysis raises grounds for concern because the forces he sees moving societies towards free markets and democracy are different, and thus potentially in conflict. Scientific rationality leads to free markets: at some stage people recognise that this is the best way to achieve big gains in productivity. Societies tend towards democracy, however, because this is the best way to satisfy a deep human longing for 'recognition'  - or acknowledgment of human dignity and worth. Non democratic societies are unstable because the few can wield power only by trampling on the egos of the many. What relevance does this have for Los Angeles? The answer is to be found in the final section of Mr Fukuyama's book, which looks at the flaws in democratic capitalism  - his end point of history. He concludes that profound tensions are unavoidable. One reason is that while the rhetoric of democracy proclaims universal equality, the iron logic of the capitalist market strips away the dignity of those who do not succeed economically. 'Garbage men and busboys will always be treated with less respect than brain surgeons or football stars'. So long as income and wealth differentials are substantial, no level of material prosperity will prevent daily damage to the dignity of economic losers. The wanton destruction in Los Angeles was as much a cry for recognition from the economically powerless as a racial protest. The case for liberal capitalism is that all other systems are worse. But Los Angeles is a reminder that it rarely runs smoothly for long. For a more than a decade, the gap between rich and poor has steadily widened. It would be hard to imagine a clearer sign that a correction, involving a sharper focus on the problems of the underclass, would be prudent. *The End of History and the Last Man.

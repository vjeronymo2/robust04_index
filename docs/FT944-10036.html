			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Chiron in talks as shares soar Chiron, the US biotechnology company, said yesterday it was in talks which might lead to another, unnamed company taking a 'very substantial' minority stake. Its statement came in response to a surge of over 30 per cent in its share price, on very heavy volume. Market sources speculated the other party might be Ciba of Switzerland. Ciba said: 'As a matter of policy, we never comment on market rumour or speculation.' Chiron, America's third biggest biotechnology company by market value, makes a variety of products treating diseases from cancer to multiple sclerosis. At yesterday's peak price of Dollars 79, the group was valued at Dollars 2.6bn. The shares later fell back, closing at Dollars 71 1/2 for a net gain of Dollars 11 3/4 on the day. Chiron said its talks involved a potential strategic alliance, but cautioned 'no agreement has been reached and there is no assurance any transaction will result'.</p>

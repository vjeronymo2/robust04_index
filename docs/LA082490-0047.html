			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 'FAIR CONTRACT' URGED FOR POLICE  </P> <P> The continued freedom from the invasions of rampant crime and violence is at  stake in Torrance.  </P> <P> Few cities in Los Angeles County actually have the sense of security that we in  Torrance have.  </P> <P> However, these freedoms can be taken away quickly if we do not invest our  monies and resources in the people who protect this fine city and its liberty.  </P> <P> The men and women of the Torrance police force are directly responsible for the  high quality of life that we enjoy daily. They are willing to put their lives  on the line so that Torrance can be the haven that it is day after day. During  this time the police officers are negotiating with the city for a new pay and  benefit contract, I ask that the City Council in their wisdom will recognize  the commitment of these men and women and give them a fair and adequate  contract.  </P> <P> I want our city to pay the price it takes to ensure the freedoms we still have.  </P> <P> JONATHAN and ROXANNE  </P> <P> TRIMPER  </P> <P> Torrance  </P></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Yeltsin aide rejects liberal dream A SENIOR adviser to the Russian president has called for Russia to 'abandon the liberal approach' in both foreign and domestic policies, and to cease attempting to integrate itself into the western economies. Mr Sergei Stankevich, a state counsellor and a former deputy mayor of Moscow, yesterday called a press conference with the sole apparent aim of putting on the record his opposition to the 'liberal dream' of a market economy and democratic institutions - calling instead for the creation of a 'strong central power. . . to carry out reform'. Mr Stankevich is a prominent and still-young politician who has made his name as a radical democrat over the past five years. However, he has been moving steadily towards a more outspokenly authoritarian position under the impact of the worsening economic crisis and the fractious relations between Russia and the other former Soviet states, which expose Russians in these states to increasing tension. Figures published earlier this week by the Russian Statistical Committee showed sharp falls in every branch of production in the first half of the year - including 13 per cent in oil, 12 per cent in coal, 4 per cent to 13 per cent in chemicals and petrochemicals, 14 per cent in cement and building materials, and by more than 20 per cent in paper. The rouble, no longer supported by interventions of the central bank, has sunk to 150 to the dollar. Mr Stankevich, who insisted he was an individual voice, also admitted his ideas were close to those of General Alexander Rutskoi, the Russian vice-president. Gen Rutskoi's party, Free Russia, has formed the 'Civic Union' coalition with the Democratic party and the Union of Industrialists to create a powerful and increasingly vocal bloc espousing the kind of ideas publicised yesterday by Mr Stankevich. The state counsellor stressed the 'Russianness' of his ideas, saying that the country was now rejecting the notions of the westernisers who took power after the collapse of communism, in favour of a balance between east and west. In economic reform, he said, the government's ideas on market reform had been discredited, and should be replaced by 'active industrialism' - that is, 'capitalism with a very active oversight by the state'. Mr Stankevich drew a parallel here with the statesman Mr Pyotr Stolypin, whose reforms from 1905 until his assassination in 1911 laid the base for private farming under authoritarian Tsarist rule.</p>

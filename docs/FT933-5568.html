			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Ciba earnings slide 8% as chairman issues warning CIBA, the diversified Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, has reported an 8 per cent slide in net income from ordinary activities in the first half to SFr1.4bn (Dollars 946m). Mr Alex Krauer, chairman, said in his letter to shareholders: 'We knew that 1993 would not be an easy year.' He forecast the net income in the full year would be higher than last year's level, but warned that the growth would be limited 'by the present unfavourable conditions of our business environment'. The Ciba interim results were significantly weaker than those reported by its two Basle-based neighbours, Roche and Sandoz. To a large extent, this reflects the greater proportion of recession hit agricultural and industrial chemical businesses in Ciba than in the other two. Group sales were down 4 per cent to SFr11.85bn, with all divisions but the relatively small self-medication, diagnostics and optical businesses reporting declines. Operating profit fell 10 per cent to SFr1.9bn but an improved financial result meant the pre-tax profit was down only 6 per cent to SFr2.03bn. After an extraordinary SFr120m gain last year on the sale of an additives business, net income was flat. Sales in the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for about a quarter of total turnover, were down 6 per cent to SFr3.07bn, depressed by healthcare reforms in Germany and Italy and the prospect of reforms elsewhere. Also, the comparative figure was inflated by the spectacular introduction of the nicotine patch, Habitrol, in the US. Habitrol sales in the first half of last year were more than SFr400m, but settled to SFr40m in the first half of this year. Ciba is the world's largest producer of agricultural chemicals, and sales of its farm related businesses account for a further quarter of group turnover. These sales fell 7 per cent to SFr3.09bn in the first half, largely because of pressures on European Community farmers to grow less and to use fewer chemicals. The group's industrial companies - mainly involved in dyes, pigments and related chemicals - suffered a 5 per cent slide in sales to SFr4.4bn. Lex, Page 18</p>

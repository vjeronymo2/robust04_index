			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris (AA) -- French Defense Minister Francois  Leotard has that "his country will be Turkey's lawyer in Europe  for the latter's full membership in the European Union [EU]."    In a statement to AA [ANATOLIA], Leotard said that he left  Turkey with very "warm feelings" after his official visit last  year. He expressed the belief that France should grant  preferential status to Turkey. He said: "Together, we must  establish a policy of stability and peace in southern Europe and  the Mediterranean which we share with Turkey." He added that  the French Government wants to strengthen its ties with Turkey.    The French defense minister pointed out that Turkey should  maintain its preferential status within the Western European  Union.    Expressing his "feelings of friendship" toward the Turkish  people and the Turkish Government, Leotard stressed the  importance of the cultural and economic ties between the two  countries.    Leotard stated: "Turkey can depend on France and French  support regarding its full membership within the EU. In this  regard, France will be Turkey's lawyer." He added: "We have  shown the past that we can assume this role. We will continue  to do so. This point was stressed during Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe's last visit to Turkey. The defense ministers will make  similar contributions to this aim."    Leotard stressed that his country fully supports the  struggle  being waged against terrorism in Turkey, adding: "We believe  that terrorism is a threat for all democracies. It is a threat  for Turkey, for France, for Europe, and for the peoples of all  democratic countries. We strongly condemn terrorism."</p>

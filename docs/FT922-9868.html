			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on US jobs AFTER a week in which there was no firm indication about the scale of the US economic recovery, traders will again be closely analysing the economic numbers coming out of Washington, writes James Blitz. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will issue its 'beige book,' outlining the state of the economy in recent months. But dealers will mostly focus on the US employment report on Friday, which some economists expect to indicate a rise in employment by about 100,000. 'The employment figures will be the first indicator for a while on whether an economic upturn is really taking place,' says Mark Austin, chief economist of Hongkong Shanghai Bank. D-Mark traders will have their sights fixed on Thursday's Bundesbank Council meeting, amid speculation that the German central bank will increase interest rates. Analysts point out that the rates for overnight and 3-month money in the German interbank market are now hovering close to the Bundesbank's Lombard rate of 9.75 per cent, suggesting that the bank may have to put the Lombard rate up. A close watch will be kept on whether the Bundesbank chooses to raise rates on repurchasing agreements on Wednesday. With Japan enjoying two days of holiday on Monday and Tuesday, yen trading will only pick up later in the week. The market continues to focus on whether the Japanese authorities will produce a fiscal package to boost the economy without cutting interest rates. Traders will pay close attention to sterling today after the Bank of England reduced dealing rates at the long end of the UK discount market last week. The forex markets are generally expecting a  1/4 per cent cut in interest rates this week.</p>

			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Markets: Freeing trusts to roam the world - Serious Money The Securities and Investment Board's creeping overhaul of the unit trust industry's rulebook combines deregulation with improved disclosure. The British nanny mindset is giving way to the American idea that the investor can be expected to look out for himself provided he is given all the relevant information. This week's tinkering came from two directions. The SIB itself (the top watchdog) proposed changes to several aspects of the rulebook. And its offshoot, the Personal Investment Authority (concerned with products sold to the public) published its disclosure proposals for unit trusts. The PIA's disclosure proposals are discussed on page VII, where they get a 'beta minus': generally OK but the information on the effect of charges on your investment needs to be far more clearly set out. Charges on an average long- term investment in a unit trust have roughly trebled in the last 15 years. And although low charges cannot turn a dud fund into a star, they can drag a star down to earth. Would it not be helpful actually to illustrate the effect of such charges? The SIB's loosening of its controls on authorised trusts does three things: it allows unit trust managers the charging freedom already enjoyed by managers of unit trusts wrapped inside a Personal Equity Plan; it gives them greater freedom to decide where to invest; and it simplifies the price information which trusts are required to publish. The price simplification gets rid of the requirement to publish the cancellation price, and is part of 'moves to a more user-friendly terminology'. Fair enough, although the cancellation price was actually useful to the handful of unit trust investors who understood it. If the bid price (what you get when you sell your units) is the same as the cancellation price, it means you are getting the lowest possible price the managers are allowed to pay. When share prices are generally on the rise fund managers pay slightly more than the minimum when buying units  - so that they can also charge the maximum permissible when selling units. The relaxation in investment restrictions is in many ways the most interesting change - for it may allow managers of emerging markets funds to do a better job. At the moment authorised unit trusts have to keep 90 per cent of their money in markets on the SIB's rather staid 'approved' list. Only 10 per cent can go into unapproved markets. But most of the stockmarkets in south east Asia and South America are not on the list. So unit trust managers wanting a broad spread across markets in these areas have two choices: they can run the trust from an offshore centre such as Dublin or Luxembourg, which has different rules; or they can use circuitous (and probably costly) routes to get the same portfolio spread. The SIB change will push responsibility for deciding which markets are suitable on to the fund managers and their trustees. They will still be bound by the 90-safe; 10- hairy rule. But it will be up to them to define the boundaries. It is a welcome change, but, like all freedoms, capable of being abused. So keep a close eye on the lists of 'eligible markets' that many funds will start publishing later this year. Creative accountancy is like plastic surgery: it does not of itself delay the final reckonning; but it stops the outside world noticing mortal decay at work. And an appearance of youth may help the moribund to cut a few final capers. Indeed, in a company context, a hyperactive bid programme can sometimes be a sign that the company cannot afford to slow down. Take Coloroll. This acquisitive little conglomerate had a market value of just Pounds 37m when it was floated in 1985. Over the next four years it spent Pounds 400m on a raft of acquisitions, exploiting acquisition and merger accounting techniques in order to enhance profits to the detriment of its balance sheet.* Its most startling ploy was spending Pounds 213m on a textile company called Crowther, and promptly knocking Pounds 224m off its balance sheet value. The point of this masochistic-seeming manoeuvre was that these massive provisions were then available to absorb future costs, and so boost future profits. Fine, but eventually the grim reaper caught up with Coloroll: in 1990 the company went bust. This is one of the more lurid examples of the kind of abuse two new accounting standards outlaw. The standards from the Accounting Standards Board, catchily entitled FRS6 and FRS7, demand that provisions be charged against profits. Most investors can spot a charge against profits; they are less likely to notice balance sheet shenanigans. Critics argue that charging capital costs against revenue is as bad as sweeping revenue costs into the balance sheet. Maybe. But if that means that managers are forced to put clearer explanations into the annual report, that is all to the good. And if it stops them making silly acquisitions at all, that is even better. Creative accountancy is only necessary if the managers have something to hide. If they remain paragons of commonsense and long-term planning, they should have no qualms about showing all.

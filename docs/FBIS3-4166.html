Kim hopes to consult with Jiang and other Chinese leaders,  including Prime Minister Li Peng, on the North Korean nuclear  issue and ways to boost economic cooperation.    Kim will reportedly request that China, North Korea's only  major remaining ally, exercise its influence in persuading  Pyongyang to accept International Atomic Energy Agency  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    Failing that, Kim will ask the Chinese leaders not to oppose  any decision the United Nations Security Council makes on North  Korea.    Before going to Beijing on Sunday, Kim, accompanied by his  wife Son Myoung-sun, will visit the site of the former  government-in-exile during the Japanese colonial days.    He will also tour Luxun Park in Shanghai, where Korean  patriot Yun Pong-kil bombed Japanese dignitaries celebrating the  birthday of their emperor, killing Gen. Yoshimori Shirakawa on  April 29, 1932.</p>

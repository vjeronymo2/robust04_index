Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) staff to have AIDS tests, after several cases of the  disease were reported among U.N. forces.    Former foreign minister Zvonimir Separovic, who heads the  Croatian Victims Society, said he would make the request  officially to U.N. officials and the World Health Organization  (WHO) on Wednesday, World AIDS Day.    Separovic said that the U.N. operation has ``contributed,  among other misfortunes, to the extension of AIDS,'' in Croatia.  He said authorities had to ``protect everyone who could be  under threat, not only sick people.''    Zagreb said last month that four U.N. workers serving in  former Yugoslavia had died of the killer disease this year.    UNPROFOR spokeswoman Shannon Boyd declined to confirm the  figure, but said that a small number of cases had been  registered among the tens of thousands of U.N. forces in the  Balkan region.    According to official statistics, 53 people have been  registered as suffering from AIDS in Croatia since 1986, of whom  36 have died.,</p>

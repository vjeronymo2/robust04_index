			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / The Labour Party in Blackpool: Pledge on Irish unity diluted Labour's ruling national executive committee yesterday endorsed Mr Tony Blair's efforts to water down the party's 13-year-old commitment to campaign for Irish unity, Kevin Brown writes. In a statement after its last pre-conference meeting, the NEC explicitly accepted the right of Northern Ireland's majority population to veto constitutional change. The NEC also accepted a compromise resolution dropping much of the nationalist rhetoric in a series of motions submitted before the IRA had announced its ceasefire. But it bowed to the continuing strength of the party's nationalist wing by stressing that the 1981 commitment to Irish unity by consent remains a long-term goal. The statement brings the NEC into line with the neutral approach to Northern Ireland developed by Mr Blair. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, is to meet Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, on US television tomorrow night, Jurek Martin writes from Washington. The White House and British embassy both said yesterday that he was also likely to meet Ms Nancy Soderberg of the National Security Council staff at a social event tonight. It was not clear if he would meet Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser.</p>

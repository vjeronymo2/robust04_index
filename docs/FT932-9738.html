			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Home advantage from overseas experience - Japan's banks have accumulated expertise from European markets ALTHOUGH tough times at home are forcing Japanese financial institutions to curb overseas expansion, some banks admit they still have much to learn from western markets. Overseas securities subsidiaries are of increasing importance for Japanese banks, which are now able to set up domestic securities operations after the easing of barriers between the banking and securities industries last month. The Industrial Bank of Japan, one of the four banks being allowed to set up securities arms, says experience at lBJ International, its UK securities subsidiary, will give it an advantage in developing domestic operations. IBJI, which has been in London for 18 years, says the European capital markets have been a nurturing ground for the Japanese banks enabling them to accumulate expertise from the European capital markets. Japanese banks, which were previously banned from the securities business by article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law, set up overseas securities operations to gain exposure to the securities business. The country's long-term credit banks and Norinchukin, the central agricultural bank, will be the first to obtain access to the securities business. The banks' affiliates, however, will be kept from the lucrative stock market, and will only be able to underwrite corporate and equity-linked bonds, and deal in straight bonds. In spite of the disappointment of the banks at the tighter-than-expected restrictions by the ministry of finance, Japanese corporations hope that the banks will bring in more innovation and help develop the country's fledgling capital markets. IBJ is expected to set up a securities operation with Y30bn (Dollars 270m) in capital and 130 staff. Mr Toshiki Tobe, managing director at IBJI, says more than 10 people with experience at the London securities arm will be transferred to the new Japanese securities affiliate. He hopes the new domestic subsidiaries will change the closed and non-competitive nature of the domestic bond market, currently dominated by the 'Big Four' securities houses - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi. 'We want to bring in proper syndication methods into the Japanese market,' says Mr Tobe. In the past, underwriting responsibilities were usually divided between the big four, where relationships between the issuer played a larger part than competitive performance. The Tokyo arm of Morgan Stanley managed to become the first foreign leading underwriter for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone by introducing the fixed-price re-offering method. Japanese companies also hope that the newcomers will help the development of a liquid secondary market as in the Eurobond markets. Japanese institutional investors still see straight bonds as investments to be kept till maturity, and while US houses and leading domestic brokerages have started market making of major issues, the secondary market remains almost non-existent due to lack of interest among investors. Companies also hope the entrance of the banks' subsidiaries will help the development of a settlement system for the corporate bond market. Meanwhile, IBJI is keen to expand its operations in London, and expects the domestic securities business to bring in more European business opportunities, such as sales of Japanese bonds to European investors. Unlike most Japanese securities houses which have resorted to Japanese investors, IBJI is cultivating overseas investors, especially in Europe. The company wants to improve its credit information services on Japanese companies, especially those which issue government guaranteed bonds. This will be a core part of the business. Unlike the Japanese securities companies, which are cutting overseas overheads, Mr Tobe says IBJI will continue to expand in the City of London. The securities house aims to increase its current operation of 300 to 500 in the next four years by increasing sales, trading and support staff. Mr Tobe also dismisses suggestions that the recent bombs in the City of London will prompt an exodus of Japanese financial institutions. 'London is too important, especially as a learning ground,' he says.</p>

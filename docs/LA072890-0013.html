			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE, BUT MANY SAY HE STILL HAS A PLACE IN THE HALL  </P> <P> As big a fan as I am of both sports and the writing of Mike Downey, I found  myself incredibly angry after reading his comments about the Pete Rose  sentencing.  </P> <P> It doesn't matter that Pete Rose was a brilliant baseball player.  </P> <P> That's a given. It doesn't matter that his managerial talents are  extraordinary. I think he belongs in the Hall of Fame, because accomplishments  off the field, no matter how dubious, have nothing to do with what goes on with  the leather, the wood and the lineup card.  </P> <P> I struggle with enough take-home dollars to pay the bills, like most folks. I'd  love those deducted dollars back every week. But if I don't pay my taxes, I go  to jail. Just like Pete Rose. And to feel sorry in any way, shape or form for  his image or his situation is, in my opinion, just as big a crime.  </P> <P> TONY SHEPHERD  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of UN Secretary  General Dr. Butrus Ghali, left Sanaa at noon today at the end of  a two-day visit to our country. During the visit, he met with  Presidential Council Chairman brother Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, government officials, and leaders of political  parties and organizations.    In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency, SABA', the UN  envoy  said he thanks all those with whom he met and who made it easy  for him to carry out his mission in our country. He added that  his visit was a good beginning. He went on to say: However, we  aspire for much more. We aspire to see the problem that brought  us here solved.    Brother Lakhdar Brahimi thanked the brother officials in our  country for their abidance once again by the cease-fire that was  announced yesterday, and which made him optimistic. He said he  is disappointed because the cease-fire did not hold last night.    Brahimi went on to say: These issues are not easy. We are  determined to persist with our demand that the cease-fire hold.  God willing, we will see all sides, speak the same language,  and make the same demands.    In his statement, the UN envoy said he hoped that the  situation would end with dialogue, the acceptance of which was  announced by the officials of our country.    Brahimi added: It is only natural that each side has its own  principles, which it seeks to impose. He noted that he will  discuss this, and speak of conditions later.    The UN envoy reiterated the need to see the cease-fire  holding as soon as possible. He noted that he will continue  with his contacts to lay the grounds for the resumption of  dialogue between brothers.    In reply to a question on the moves that he intends to  discuss to achieve an effective cease-fire, the UN envoy said  that there are principles, and that the main principle to be  upheld is that it is always preferable to resolve such issues  between the concerned sides. If other issues are to be  examined, then such issues can be discussed at the appropriate  time.    The UN envoy was seen off at the airport by brother Ahmad  Dayfallah al-'Uzayz, Foreign Ministry under secretary for  political affairs; brother 'Abdallah al-Wahhabi, director of  protocol at the Foreign Ministry; representatives of protocol at  the Presidential Council; the ambassadors of Morocco, Algeria,  Tunisia, and Libya; brother 'Awni al-'Ani, resident UN  representative in Sanaa; and Ambassador Muhammad Hadi 'Awad,  head of the Arab Department at the Foreign Ministry.</p>

"The two sides adhere to the policy of partnership, value  their relations and think how to make them still more productive  and versatile in the future," Ryurikov said.    The U.S. commerce secretary led a delegation of prominent  representatives of the U.S. business community whose principal  aim is to "stimulate American private business' interest in  Russia".    "To all appearances, the delegation members saw for  themselves Russia's interest in cooperation, and the Russian  leadership's support for big projects and closer contacts",  Ryurikov pointed out.</p>

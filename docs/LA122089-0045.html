			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE;  </P> <P> MARJORIE LORD VOLK MAKES ROOM FOR BENEFITS  </P> <P> In 1976, actress Marjorie Lord Volk was wondering what she would do with her  life after marrying Harry Volk, the banker who helped finance the Music Center  and who is now chairman of the Weingart Foundation, which gives away millions  of dollars to Skid Row causes and the homeless.  </P> <P> "I thought -- you work, you earn money, you prove yourself," she said.  Immediately after her marriage, however, she found herself in demand, mostly  because of her husband's reputation, she thinks. "I did not have the respect  then that I do now for people who volunteer -- giving their time, their money  and their creativity. But I've met some wonderful friends. You know, the acting  world is very insular, and this (her marriage) has opened up new worlds that I  would not have sought after; I knew they were there, but I did not know they  were there for me."  </P> <P> This week, the actress, best known for the role of Kathy, the wife of Danny  Thomas in "Make Room for Daddy," will star as volunteer chairman of the Joffrey  Ballet's Patron Nights. The first one tonight celebrates the opening of the  Joffrey Ballet LA/NY winter season with "The Nutcracker" at the Dorothy  Chandler Pavilion. Volk will also chair the Patron Series opening night of the  spring season May 2 with a black-tie dinner-dance in the Grand Hall and the May  20 picnic supper with Gerald Arpino and the Joffrey Dancers preceding "Romeo  and Juliet."  </P> <P> Last year's Patron parties netted about $300,000. Volk hopes for as much, from  underwriters and from the patrons who will pay $1,000 each for the series. To  help her, she recruited Ruth Shannon, Peggy Parker and Lara Ladd for  assistants. "It takes a lot of thought and effort," she said.  </P> <P> "For me, the ballet is a labor of love. . . . In the world today, we are all so  busy feeding the poor and the hungry and sick, but we have to nourish their  souls with the arts and give them something to look forward to in life."  Through the financial support of Gary Winnick, she notes, the entire Pavilion  will be opened for a matinee next Wednesday for the underprivileged.  </P> <P> Volk also has made her mark in the city as chairman of a recent benefit for the  Friends of the USC Library and as a volunteer for Banning House's Floriade.  </P> <P> "There aren't enough hours in the day," she said. She's also co-writing a  script. Two years ago she did a TV film and a TV pilot. She also is following  the acting career of her daughter Anne Archer, who has completed two new films  and was nominated for an Oscar for her supporting role in "Fatal Attraction."  Says Volk: "She's a hard worker, and she was exposed to it through me."  </P> <P> Born and raised in San Francisco, Volk studied dance and acting from the age of  3. When she was 16, her family moved to New York, and she played the lead  ingenue on Broadway for four months in "The Old Maid" with Judith Anderson. She  then toured 10 months. She was married to Broadway actor John Archer for nine  years before they divorced and then 17 years to Randy Hale, an actor and son of  the prominent San Francisco retailing family.  </P> <P> As a widow, she met Harry Volk, a widower. Leaving the acting world, she says,  "is a little painful, because it is all I wanted and I struggled for, and I  never thought I would pull out of acting. But I wouldn't want to be struggling  as an older actress. I would rather retire graciously."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAO SAYS MEXICO GOT A SUBSIDY FROM BOND SALE;  </P> <P> FINANCE: THE WATCHDOG AGENCY SAYS THE LATIN NATION GOT A $192-MILLION BREAK IN  ITS DEBT. THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT DISPUTES THE CHARGE.  </P> <P> Congressional investigators Tuesday charged the Treasury Department with giving  Mexico a $192-million subsidy by selling it underpriced bonds to help it reduce  its foreign debt.  </P> <P> Treasury disputed the General Accounting Office allegation, saying that not  only did Mexico not receive a subsidized price but that the bonds actually went  for a premium.  </P> <P> David Mulford, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said the  zero-coupon 30-year bonds were sold at an interest rate of 8.05%, higher than  the 7.92% the Treasury was paying at the time to raise funds for the U.S.  government.  </P> <P> The bonds were used to partially guarantee debt that Mexico restructured under  Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's 1989 initiative to help ease developing  nations' debt burden. Mexico restructured about $50 billion in debt to foreign  banks, which had the option of reducing principal, reducing interest or  providing new loans. The country still has a $95-billion debt.  </P> <P> "Zeros" -- as they are commonly called -- pay interest and principal in one  transaction at maturity and thus are sold at deep discount from face value. The  higher the interest rate, the lower the initial cash cost.  </P> <P> According to the GAO, the Treasury had two interest rate options for pricing  the zeros: the market for "strips" and the market for 30-year Treasury coupon  bonds. The strip market was created by dealers who separate a Treasury bond's  interest payment from its principal payment and sell rights to those payments  separately.  </P> <P> Brady chose to base the zeros' price on the interest rate of the 30-year bond  market.  </P> <P> As a result, the Treasury on March 28 sold Mexico $30.2 billion in zero-coupon  bonds for $2.99 billion.  </P> <P> The Jan. 5 decision provided Mexico with a $192-million "effective subsidy" --  in the form of a lower price for the bonds, the GAO said. The interest rate,  based on the market for three days ending Jan. 5, was 7.925%, plus a fee of  0.125%.  </P> <P> If the zeros' price had been based on the 7.708% yield of the strips market,  Treasury would have received $192 million more for the bonds, the GAO charged.  </P> <P> The GAO's charges may influence negotiations between Venezuela and its bank  creditors since the South American country is expected to request Treasury  support for a debt-reduction package similar to that obtained by Mexico.  </P> <P> Allan Mendelowitz, a GAO director, told the House Banking Committee that while  Brady had the legal authority to provide Mexico with a subsidy, his decision  was "neither appropriate nor good public policy."  </P> <P> "There was no subsidy," Mendelowitz said.  </P></p>

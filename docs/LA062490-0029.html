			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: 'DICK TRACY' SCORE LEAVES DANNY ELFMAN BREATHLESS  </P> <P> Having a tough time figuring out which "Dick Tracy" album to buy? Or how many  you can afford?  </P> <P> Should it be the "Tracy" soundtrack, which is list-priced at $10.98 ($15.98 for  CDs) and features 16 songs (though six of 'em aren't even in the movie,  including Ice-T's "Dick Tracy")?  </P> <P> Or should it be Madonna's "I'm Breathless" album, which also costs a steep  $10.98 ($15.98 for CDs) and isn't officially a soundtrack, though it features  songs "from and inspired by" the movie? Or should you wait till July 10 -- and  buy the album with the original score (also $10.98/$15.98), which was penned by  Danny Elfman, the pop wiz behind Oingo Boingo who scored "Batman" last year?  </P> <P> If you can still afford to buy the score when it hits the stores, you're in for  a surprise. According to Elfman, the score has two original music cues that  were cut from the film during a very unusual last-minute editing session.  </P> <P> "I thought my score was finished, so I'd left to go out on the road and do  concert dates with Oingo Boingo," said Elfman, taking a break from his work on  a score for "Dark Man," a new film by horrormeister Sam Raimi. "Then I get this  emergency call that Disney had totally changed the concept of the opening of  the film. It was originally a long, long pan across the city, with my 'Tracy  and Tess' romantic theme underneath. But when it didn't test well, someone --  either Disney or Warren Beatty -- decided to move the beginning along a lot  quicker."  </P> <P> With Elfman unable to fly back to oversee the changes, Disney sent him a video  of the new opening credit sequence. Elfman then sat down in his hotel room and  composed a new title sequence, experimenting with two different tempos to see  which fit the new opening. After Disney received the changes, Elfman's  conductor, Shirley Walker, got an orchestra together and played the new piece  -- with Elfman listening to the entire performance, by phone, from his hotel  room in Milwaukee!  </P> <P> "As soon as our gig was over I rushed back to my hotel and listened to the  session, trying to figure out which tempo sounded best," he said. "I guess it's  a great story because now I'm hearing all these wild accounts, with people  saying I was demanding they add a first violin or complaining that the cellos  were too loud. That never happened. We had two different edits, so all I ever  did was shout once in a while, 'Let's try the faster version!' "  </P> <P> So what's it like working with Warren Beatty, a notorious perfectionist? "I  took the job knowing there would be difficulties, so knowing that, there  weren't many surprises," said Elfman. "Once you deliver the score, the composer  has no real control -- that's the aggravating and frustrating part of the  profession. The only thing that really kept Beatty and me apart was 'Batman.'  He was apprehensive having someone so closely associated with that movie  working on 'Tracy,' and I was worried about repeating myself.  </P> <P> "Once we got that out of the way, we got along OK. Some of my cues got buried,  but that happens a lot. I take it personally, but that's because I get so  wrapped up in my work." He laughed. "Some people think it's unhealthy, but I  don't know any other way to do it."  </P></p>

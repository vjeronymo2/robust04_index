			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. 310 IAC 12&hyph;4&hyph;16&blank;Performance Bond Release; Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subsection 16(c)(3)(A) is amended by deleting the word ``or'' and replacing that word with ``and.'' As amended, subsection 16(c)(3)(A) provides that Phase III bond may be released only after: (A) the operator has successfully completed all surface coal mining and reclamation activities required in IC 13&hyph;4.1, 310 IAC 12, ``and'' the permit. The Director finds this change to be no less stringent than SMCRA at sections 509(a) and 519(c)(3), and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145&blank;Prime Farmland; Special Performance Standards <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Indiana has deleted subsection 145(c) which was approved by OSM on August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41039). Deleted subsection 145(c) contained the following language: ``Soil reconstruction shall be carried out in accordance with the specifications of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture establishing prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications for Indiana.'' In its submittal of this amendment Indiana tated that the language quoted above was omitted because of ongoing litigation concerning the language of subsection 145(c). The litigation which Indiana referred to above is  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Indiana Coal Council, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> vs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Babbitt <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , No. IP93&hyph;1328&hyph;C (S.D. Ind. filed October 1, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.4(b) provide that the regulatory authority within each State shall use the soil-reconstruction specifications established by the SCS to carry out the State's responsibilities concerning prime farmland. Prior to the #93&hyph;1 program amendment Indiana had no counterpart to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.4(b). Indiana added a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) at 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) in amendment #93&hyph;1, and OSM approved the addition. In the #94&hyph;3 amendment, Indiana has removed the counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b), due to the lawsuit cited above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lawsuit cited above involves the following. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has held that the SCS's specifications for prime farmland soil reconstruction must be promulgated as ``rules'' under the Federal Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 551  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and must be subject to public comment prior to becoming effective.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation II <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , No. 79&hyph;1144 (D.D.C. October 1, 1984), slip. Op. pp. 23&hyph;24. The Indiana Coal Council, Inc. (ICC) contends that an Indiana counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) should not be approved by OSM until after the SCS has complied with the requirement to subject its ``specifications'' to public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM had required that Indiana promulgate a regulation addressing the requirements of 30 CFR 823.4(b). (57 FR 41873, September 14, 1992). When Indiana proposed 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) as the counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b), OSM removed the required amendment at 30 CFR 914.16(l). (58 FR 41042, August 2, 1993.) Since Indiana has now deleted 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c), the State's program again lacks a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b). Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) renders the Indiana program less effective than the Federal regulations. Consequently, the Director is requiring that Indiana amend its program to include a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) or to otherwise require that any prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications promulgated as rules for the State of Indiana by the SCS be incorporated by reference into the Indiana program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

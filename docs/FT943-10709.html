			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Company News: Qantas, BA boost route co-operation Qantas, the Australian airline, and British Airways, which holds a 25 per cent interest in the federally-owned carrier, have agreed to step up 'co-operation' on services between Australia and the UK. This effectively ends the companies' half-decade of competition on the 'Kangaroo route'. The airlines conceded yesterday the changes were partly designed 'to increase our return on assets'. While the route has been a flagship service for Qantas, it has rarely made money. The airlines said yesterday that, under the new arrangements, they would operate five daily services between Australia and Europe, three of which would be flown by Qantas and two by BA. Qantas will operate twice-daily services linking Sydney and Melbourne with London. Five times a week, it will also fly between Sydney and Frankfurt, extending to Paris on three days. Twice a week, it will fly between Sydney and Rome. BA will operate twice-daily services between London and Perth, and London-Sydney. Yesterday's announcement represents the most significant operational change instigated by the companies since BA acquired its stake in Qantas for ADollars 665m (USDollars 493m) last year. The plans require approval from Australia's Trade Practices Commission, the competition watchdog.</p>

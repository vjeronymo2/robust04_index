			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Telecommunications In Business (17): Prices of machines continue to tumble - Colour fax systems on the way IN little more than a decade, facsimile machines have become an integral part of most offices and a vital communications tool. Now they are appearing in homes, cars and even brief cases. Fax machines are also becoming faster and more sophisticated; and they are being integrated with other office equipment such as laser printers and desktop PCs, and new value-added communications services are being built around them. Equipment sales grew rapidly in the 1980s and, in spite of the recession, they have been buoyed more recently by the advent of plain paper fax machines and the emerging consumer market, targeted by the mainly Japanese hardware manufacturers. As prices continue to tumble, some analysts believe that by the mid-1990s, one in three fax machines sold will be for personal use. Many of these small, desktop machines combine the functions of telephone, answering machine, photocopier and facsimile and can switch between voice and fax and need only a single line. Today, there are an estimated 15-20m fax machines worldwide, a number which is expected to grow to over 30m by the end of 1993. Most are of the Group 3 industry standard and can send an A4 sheet across the world in seconds for the price of a telephone call. The biggest installed base is in the US, but according to the British Facsimile Industry Consultative Committee, which represents suppliers, there are more than 900,000 machines in the UK and two out of every three employees have access to a fax terminal. Fax-usage is also increasing. The UK market will be worth about Pounds 750m this year and is growing by about 30 per cent a year compared to five per cent for voice traffic. One reason for this rapid growth is that fax machines are relatively simple to operate. Nevertheless, there is a trend towards more sophisticated machines and features like number memories, one-touch and speed dialling, automatic paper-cutter and activity reports are increasingly regarded as standard, even on basic machines. Some machines can now store a fax for transmission later, others remember messages when they have run out of paper, can be operated remotely, or have the ability to 'broadcast' a fax to multiple destinations. A new machine from Yamaha can read a file from a PC floppy disk and then send it as a fax while others can read, send and store faxes from optical disks. Meanwhile, Sony will this month begin to market a 1.5kg battery operated portable fax in Japan which can be connected to a cellular,car or a pay phone, send an A4 sheet in 20 seconds and display incoming faxes on an LCD screen. Colour fax machines are also just around the corner. Several Japanese manufacturers have announced colour machines although Sharp is the only manufacturer to unveil a Group 3 desktop colour machine which will work on a standard telephone line. The Sharp FO9000, which will be available shortly in the UK, can transmit an A4 colour photograph in three minutes and print from a palette of 255 colours using a high quality dye-sublimation print engine. Colour machines are expected to meet a specialist need, rather than replace mono faxes, but plain paper faxes are gradually replacing the traditional thermal machine, with its rolls of expensive paper which crumple easily and eventually fade. Although they are generally more expensive than thermal machines, the price difference is narrowing and plain paper, like used in photocopiers and laser printers, is cheaper. Indeed, the distinctions between fax machines and other office equipment are becoming blurred. For example, Xerox and other manufacturers have recently launched plain paper fax machines that double as photocopiers and Fujitsu's Faxjet turns a LaserJet compatible printer into a fax receiver. Plug-in cards and external fax-modems are already providing portable computers, desktop PCs and networked PCs with the power to send and receive faxes. There is also growing demand for faster fax transmission to cut labour, time and phone costs. Some Group 3 machines already operate at 14,400 bits per second (14.4k bps) over the public switched telephone network and can receive or send an A4 page in about six seconds. There are also a few Group 4 faxes which were designed to operate on ISDN (integrated services digital network) circuits at 64k bps, transmitting an A4 page in 3-4 seconds. But although Group 4 faxes have been around since the mid-1980s the introduction of ISDN has been much slower than expected. In the meantime, the transmission speed of Group 3 machines has been further enhanced and an alternative 64k bps standard has emerged called either Group 3bis or G364. While its advocates are not suggesting that Group 3bis machines will be much cheaper than Group 4, they do argue that the Group 3bis approach will make it easier for faxes to work on both the ISDN and the public switched telephone network while offering the same speed,resolution and other improvements as Group 4 faxes. In another important area, that of error-free transmission,an industry standard was adopted in 1988. Machines complying with the standard automatically resend corrupted sections of a message, ensuring that users can be confident that a document will reach its destination ungarbled. Meanwhile, some telecommunications groups have seized the opportunity to generate additional income by offering value-added services to fax customers. For example in the UK, BT offers its voice-prompted FeatureFax service while in the US American Telephone and Telegraph offers a similar subscription service called EnhancedFAX which enables customers to broadcast a fax, virtually simultaneously, to as many as 10,000 fax machines via nodes in the US, Canada, the UK, Japan and Hong Kong. The service came to prominence during the Gulf war, when more than 1m messages were sent to troops in 'Operation Desert Fax.' In the UK, Vodafone's Vodata unit began offering an adjunct to its audiotex service a year ago called Vodastream Fax service. This facsimile-based information delivery system can either be used by people to call in by fax to a central number and receive back a fax from the information provider, or by the provider to send multiple fax copies to a list of recipients. The service is currently used by, among others, the Met Office for weather information for pilots and yachtsmen and by the Central statistical Office to distribute government information. The Vodastream service also has a fax mailbox facility where messages can be left and recalled later by the intended recipient using a fax machine from anywhere in the world. Mercury's managed fax service in the UK, called Surefax, is a particularly sophisticated set of value-added services aimed at multinational customers and launched by the Cable and Wireless group subsidiary in October. Mr Paul David, business development manager in Mercury's messaging division, says it was designed to provide cost effective solutions to many of the problems business customers complain about like busy and dropped fax lines, costly redials and paying unnecessary premium rates to send non-urgent faxes during peak periods. Mercury claims its Surefax switch is the largest in the world with a capacity to handle over 18,000 fax pages an hour. Eight months after its launch it is already handling about 3,000 fax messages a day, with an average length of 3.3 pages. Documents can be sent to the Surefax switch - a kind of automated fax exchange - from an ordinary fax machine via a special socket, or direct from a desktop PC, for passing onto single or multiple recipients either immediately, or sometime later. Among its other features, Surefax ensures 'a never-busy fax line' and will auto matically retry a recipient's line until the fax is sent. If transmission is lost or garbled, it will resend only those pages that are missing. One significant growth area targeted by the Surefax service is PC-generated faxes. It is estimated that in the UK about 80 per cent of all faxes begin life as a wordprocessor file on a PC. But the document is usually printed out before being loaded into a fax machine for delivery. Only two per cent of fax traffic is sent directly from PCs, but Mr Daniel says 'we are convinced this is going to change.' Eventually, he expects up to a quarter of all faxes to be sent directly from a PC or from a computer network.</p>

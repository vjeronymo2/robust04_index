			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> "Indiana Jones" star Harrison Ford will be visiting a different kind of temple  of doom this week as he observes murder trials in Detroit Recorder's Court to  prepare for a film role as a prosecutor. Ford has been cast as Rozat (Rusty)  Sabich, a chief assistant prosecutor accused of murder in "Presumed Innocent,"  a movie based on the Scott Turow novel of the same name. After Mirage  Productions chose Detroit as a location for the film's street scenes, the  Michigan Prosecutors' Assn. began mailing Ford training films. Chief Assistant  Prosecutor George Ward says of Ford's visit to Detroit this week: "I feel  lucky, that of all the chief assistants in the country, my job is being used as  a model."

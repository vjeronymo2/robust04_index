			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: IBM looks for marketing chief International Business Machines is understood to be looking for a top marketing executive from outside the group to run two of its units making consumer products. The executive will spearhead a much stronger drive into the consumer arena by IBM, which in the past has displayed some clumsiness in the field. The move follows the recent promotion of Mr James Cannavino to become IBM's top corporate strategist. He was previously in charge of four business units  -IBM PC, which makes personal computers; Power Personal Systems, which handles the company's new Power PC chip; the RS/6000 division, which makes sophisticated workstations; and the Personal Software Products Division, which sells the company's OS/2 operating software.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / People: Baglin to retire early from Abbey National Richard Baglin, one of Abbey National's three managing directors, has decided to break the Abbey habit at the relatively tender age of 49. His departure removes one of the obvious contenders for John Bayliss's job of running Abbey's core retail banking business. When Cambridge-educated Baglin joined Abbey in 1964, he was one of the very first graduates to be hired by the building society industry. He became a general manager in 1981 and has most recently been in charge of new business which included the group's loss-making estate agency business and its European operations. However, Abbey National stressed that his retirement - he leaves at the end of the year - was in no way linked to problems in the areas he was responsible for, such as Fico France, the group's French mortgage lender. He will remain with the group as a director of Abbey National's French and Italian subsidiaries. Baglin, who started a three-week holiday yesterday, was unavailable for comment. But it is understood that he wants to do something different while he is still young enough. Until now Abbey's top team, under chief executive Peter Birch, has been more stable than those of most big financial institutions. However, John Bayliss, managing director of retail operations, is expected to retire in the next year or two and a replacement has not been named for Baglin. One possibility is that Charles Villers, the former chairman of County NatWest and Abbey's current managing director of corporate development, may assume some of Baglin's tasks. However, the key appointment Abbey will have to make is finding a replacement for Bayliss. John Fry, 55, the group service director and another Abbey veteran, is one possibility, but Abbey could choose to leap a generation or look outside.</p>

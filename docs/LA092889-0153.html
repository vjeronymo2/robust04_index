			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL REGULATING JAILHOUSE SNITCHES SIGNED INTO LAW  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian signed into a law Wednesday a bill regulating the use of  jailhouse informants.  </P> <P> Key features of the bill include a requirement that judges routinely instruct  jurors to view jailhouse informants' testimony with caution, and a requirement  that prosecutors tell an informant's crime victim that he is being given  leniency in return for his testimony against another criminal defendant.  </P> <P> The legislation, which was drafted by defense lawyer groups and sponsored by  Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), also bars law enforcement from paying  an informant more than $50 "in return for an in-custody informant's testimony."  </P> <P> It also requires prosecutors who rely on the testimony of an informant to  disclose to the court any favors he has received.  </P> <P> "I think it will change the way prosecutors treat informants, (the way) juries  treat informants, and I think people will stop and think now before they use  these informants," said Los Angeles defense lawyer Gigi Gordon, who lobbied for  the measure on behalf of the Criminal Courts Bar Assn.  </P> <P> The legislation was an outgrowth of a demonstration last year by veteran  jailhouse informant Leslie Vernon White of how dangerous informant testimony  could be.  </P> <P> White showed Los Angeles County sheriff's officials that he could convincingly  fake the confession of a murder suspect he had never met. A glib robber and  kidnaper, White gathered inside information on the case by using a jail  telephone and posing as a law enforcement officer. Then he showed officials  that he could create a phony record that he shared a cell with a suspect.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Standards  </P> <P> White's demonstration prompted Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner to issue  tough new corroboration standards for use of informants and spawned an ongoing  grand jury investigation.  </P> <P> Similar corroboration standards were written into early drafts of the  legislation, but defense Bar lobbyists agreed to delete them in exchange for  support of the California District Attorneys Assn.  </P> <P> The association contends that tougher statutory standards are unnecessary  because the problem of jailhouse informants fabricating confessions is confined  to Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lloyds loses out to rivals ANNUAL profits from Lloyds Bank were at the top end of market forecasts, but an early spurt for the shares was staunched as buyers perceived more value in the high street clearer's rivals Barclays and National Westminster. Lloyds announced a headline profit of Pounds 801m, which appeared to be a sharp rise against the previous figure of Pounds 625m; there was also a hike in the dividend to 18.4p. The share price shot up by 22 initially, but the market then considered the pre-provisions figure and decided that the performance was less impressive. Also, speculation that Lloyds might make a bid for either TSB or Standard Chartered continued. It was felt that though a bid might not necessarily prompt a rights issue, it would put pressure on the share price. Lloyds was trimmed back to a net gain of 6 at 534p with 7.6m shares traded, while TSB eased 2 to 170p on profit-taking at the end of the current trading account; Standard Chartered rose 8 to 653p. Meanwhile, new-time buyers, investors trading for the account which officially begins on Monday, were looking at National Westminster, which announces its figures on February 23, and Barclays, which reports on March 4. Both have heavy debts and would be beneficiaries of a further interest rate cut, which was signalled by the latest inflation figure yesterday. NatWest rose 20 to 452p on turnover of 8.6m shares while Barclays lifted by the same amount to 435p on turnover of 6.8m. Asda recommended Food retailers rebounded from recent underperformance with Asda leading the charge as NatWest Securities put the stock on its list of 'top ten buys'. The house said Asda's fears of a small decline in sales in the first two months of the year in the face of stiff competition had not been realised. Instead, NatWest estimated that sales have risen some 2 per cent year-on-year, while the group also continued to reduce its debt mountain. NatWest said market profits forecasts for this year of around Pounds 130m to Pounds 135m might prove conservative and the shares have the potential to reach 80p by the early summer. Yesterday, the ordinaries climbed 2 to 60 1/2 p in turnover of 37m. The nil-paid also closed 2 ahead at 7p in volume of 26m. A trade press report that Kwik Save is considering a joint venture with Santego, the Spanish discount chain, caused little surprise to many in the market but excited enough interest to edge the shares forward 2 to 804p. Santego and Kwik Save have been linked before, chiefly because Kwik Save's largest shareholder, Dairy Crest, owns the Spanish group. The report said that the two were planning a new joint discount chain in Europe. Talk that Tesco would achieve a low pay settlement for its employees helped the shares, which gathered 13 to 243p. A figure of 3 per cent had been rumoured, but word leaking into the market was that a lower number was more likely. Hotel group Forte strengthened again with hints that a sizeable overseas purchase was being lined up and any consequent fund-raising exercise would banish doubts over whether the dividend would be maintained. Word in the market was that the group recently came close to paying Pounds 400m for Australian-based chain Southern Pacific. Forte shares added 2 to 192p. As expected, Unigate emerged as the buyer for Clifford Foods, sending shares in both companies racing forward. Unigate paid Pounds 50.4m for the family-owned dairy group in a move welcomed by food specialists in the market. Mr Carl Short at Nomura described the purchase as 'sensible rather than spectacular', adding that he expects further acquisitions as Unigate attempts to build up its milk and food business. Other analysts also said Unigate was casting around, although few candidates were forthcoming. Upgrades on the back of Clifford were generally in the Pounds 1m to 3m range. Unigate shares jumped 15 to 342p, and Clifford 50 to 573p. Pharmaceuticals stocks were firmer with Glaxo picking up 8 to 704p and Wellcome, helped initially by optimism over an article in a medical journal, improving 9 to 922p. Lehman Brothers recorded an active two-way pull in SmithKline Beecham. The house has been recommending that clients switch into Wellcome but there were also enough buyers to mop up the loose stock. Although the 'A's eased a penny to 465p, the Units firmed a penny to 410p. The takeover speculation that has surrounded Fisons faded with the account and the shares slid 1 1/2 to 241p. Conglomerate Hanson eased 2 1/2 to 255p ahead of first quarter profits on Tuesday. Dealers reported a stock overhang in IMI and the shares fell 7 to 261p. Ferranti had a busy session and turnover rose to 11.7m, double the daily average, as bid talk returned. There was also a suggestion that the company might have won a significant contract from Saudi Arabia. The shares closed unchanged at 13p. Another stock that has attracted bid talk is Vickers and the shares put on 3 to 134p. Among transport stocks, British Airways was a nervous market ahead of next Tuesday's third-quarter figures. The shares fell 5 to 283p, in trade of 5m. Trading in Trafalgar House was again busy following Thursday's rights issue. Volume reached 11m by the close and the shares eased  1/2 to 76p. The inflation figures proved to be good news for the stores sector as fresh speculation over interest rate cuts lifted sentiment. Boots surged 11 to 490p, Kingfisher 13 to 527p, Marks and Spencer 6 1/2 to 330p and WH Smith 4 to 422p. Perception that the US side of its business is performing well helped paper manufacturer Arjo Wiggins Appleton to increase a further 4 1/2 to 173p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (192).

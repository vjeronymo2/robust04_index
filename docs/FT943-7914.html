			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / 'Coalition' underlines US rift on healthcare A group of centrist Republican and Democratic senators met yesterday morning to try to hammer out a bundle of amendments to the US healthcare reform bill proposed by the Democratic leadership in Congress and backed by President Bill Clinton. The senators, who like to call themselves the 'mainstream coalition', have presented their work as the last serious chance to get a sensible, bipartisan healthcare reform bill this year. But their deliberations have merely underlined the deep divisions over the health issue. Senator John Breaux, a right-wing Democrat from Louisiana who is one of the group's leaders, acknowledged he and his colleagues had been unable to agree on a 'full-fledged health reform bill', and had had to limit themselves to a bundle of amendments to the bill proposed by Senate majority leader George Mitchell. But even that scaled-down effort had to be revised at the last minute when the independent Congressional Budget Office warned that their cost estimates were as much as Dollars 300bn (Pounds 193.5bn) off the mark. The frustrations that the senators have experienced in finding common ground may strengthen the hand of right-wing Republicans fighting against any healthcare reform. Some Democrats have concluded the exercise is so bogged down that there is now no realistic chance of achieving responsible reform this year.</p>

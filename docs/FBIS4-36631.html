			<p>BFN     [Text] The dispute between Hizballah Secretary General  Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has  intensified after Nasrallah backed the publication of a book  entitled Observations on Sayyid Fadlallah's  Method.The dispute has grown to include their entourages  and loyalists. Asked about this issue, Fadlallah declared: "I  do not trust any of Hizballah's leaders... without exception."    A dispute has likewise surfaced between Nasrallah and  Hizballah Consultative Council member Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik,  who is also director of Hizballah's religious school in  Ba'labakk. Nasrallah has been giving cover to Shaykh Yazbik's  rivals. One sign of the dispute was Nasrallah's insistence on  employing Shaykh As'ad Balluq at the school. Shaykh Yazbik  insisted on expelling Balluq.    Nasrallah realizes that he has lost all his religious  credentials and his credibility inside Hizballah and is giving  serious thought to his future after he leaves the secretary  general's post. He has established and will be director of the  Islamic Institute for Education, which supervises the Imam Mahdi  schools in several Lebanese areas. It should be noted that the  funds that Nasrallah is spending on this institution are  actually part of Hizballah's budget. He urges Hizballah members  to be economical and then diverts the party's funds to expand  his institution. Nasrallah refuses to employ any one in the  institution who is not blindly loyal and obedient to him.    Observers note that military operations carried out by the  Islamic Resistance have recently been few and feeble. The  reason is the secretary general's appropriation of funds for his  own institution. He is also using Hizballah media to make  publicity for the Imam Mahdi schools.    [A brief report on page 9 of the same issue of AL-SHIRA'  reads: "Recent organizational changes in Hizballah indicate that  former party secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli will  regain his influence over Hizballah's decisionmaking process."]    [AL-SHIRA' also reports on page 10: "The Zionist enemy's  criminal abduction of the Believers Resistance official Mustafa  al-Dirani from his house in Qasr Naba provided Hizballah  Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah with an opportunity to make a  grand entrance into al-Biqa' following recent negative attitudes  and resentment against him by area residents and party members.  Some of his few supporters in the area sought to invent  occasions for him to attend to give the impression that he is  still strong in al-Biqa'. The results were disappointing.  During the al-Ghadir Day poetry festival in Marjat Ra's al-'Ayn  in Ba'labakk, Nasrallah's loyalists did all they could to  mobilize a large party turnout but the area's ulema boycotted  the festival and only 18 out of 100 al-Biqa' scholars attended.  Hizballah Consultative Council member Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik  was also absent."]</p>

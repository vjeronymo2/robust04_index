			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / EC steel job cuts may top 100,000: Krupp-Hoesch chief warns his company may pull out of steelmaking WESTERN EUROPE'S steel industry may be forced to cut more than 100,000 jobs in its latest market crisis, more than double the estimate of the European Commission, according to the German steel federation. Social spending to ease the burden of redundancies would have to increase substantially, and protection from cheap eastern European imports ensured to enable the industry to restructure, Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the federation, said in an interview. At the same time, the head of Germany's second largest steel producer, Krupp-Hoesch, said he believed it was 'perfectly realistic' to consider quitting the steel industry altogether, if 'radical measures' were not taken to meet the crisis. Mr Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, which is in the process of merging the steelmaking operations of Krupp Stahl and Hoesch Stahl, told Der Spiegel magazine the country's leading steelmakers must co-operate to survive. He refused to predict which German steel companies would outlive the latest crisis, but said that even the three strongest - Thyssen, Krupp-Hoesch and Preussag - would enjoy long-term survival prospects only if 'all the opportunities are used for the best possible co-operation'. The grim forecast for the likely job losses in the entire European industry was made by Mr Vondran in a plea to Brussels to reconsider the funds available for social programmes. He said the European Commission's plan to spend Ecu240m (Pounds 198m) to ease the mass redundancies would be inadequate, with Germany alone facing job losses of 35,000-40,000 in both halves of the country. At the same time he urged a stern regime to limit state subsidies to loss-making producers, especially in Italy and Spain, and restrictions on cheap steel imports from eastern Europe. Mr Vondran rejected the Commission's proposal for agreed minimum prices for east European steel imports, to prevent steel dumping, believing it would be ineffective. He suggested an import ceiling on the most sensitive steel products of 1991 import levels, plus 20 per cent. EC industry ministers meet in Brussels this week when a rescue package will be presented by the Commission, calling for capacity cuts of up to 30m tonnes, in exchange for social spending, and some form of protection from imports. Asked in his interview whether the idea of pulling out of steel production altogether was 'thinkable' for Krupp-Hoesch, Mr Cromme said: 'That is a perfectly realistic idea. I do hope, however, that we will be able to avoid any such step by taking a series of radical measures.' Steel crisis plan, Page 2</p>

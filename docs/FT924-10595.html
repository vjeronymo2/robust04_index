			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Customs spending 'irregular' NEARLY A quarter of the funds allocated to headquarters divisions of Customs and Excise in a 'people money' scheme to improve the staff working environment was spent outside the scope of the scheme, a report from the National Audit Office disclosed yesterday. From Pounds 305,000 spent in 1991-92 in 11 headquarters divisions, much was 'outside both the terms of the scheme and the ambit of the vote and was therefore irregular', the NAO concludes. That included money spent on personal stereos, clothing, contact lenses, club subscriptions, meals, handbags, 'expensive pens' and personal organisers. Items were supposed to require prior management approval. The details come in the National Audit Office report on the 1991-92 revenue accounts for HM Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, which was released yesterday. Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, said the results of examinations of the accounts by his staff were 'satisfactory'. The review of Inland Revenue accounts showed that one division will be reviewing the accounts of 700 farmers involving suspected widespread cases of tax evasion involving undeclared cash transactions and secret bank accounts. Other Customs and Excise difficulties identified include Pounds 394m of VAT arrears more than a year old, of which Pounds 178m were more than two years old in November 1991. Those figures were reduced to Pounds 341m and Pounds 116m respectively by June 1992. No information is available on how far the reductions represent arrears as opposed to tax written-off. The NAO says Customs appears to have underestimated the amount of training and support required to help staff to convert from traditional methods of control to a systems-based approach. Customs staff identified 652 irregularities totalling Pounds 1.4m on export refunds related to the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Bank forces Isetan chief to quit THE PRESIDENT of Isetan, Japan's sixth-largest department store, yesterday became the latest in a growing list of senior executives who have been forced out of their posts by a leading bank. Mr Kuniyasu Kosuge, Isetan's president for nine years, is to become the group's honorary chairman. The reshuffle is thought to reflect Mitsubishi Bank's disenchantment with his performance. Mitsubishi is Isetan's main bank. Isetan, in common with other Japanese department stores, is suffering from the decline in consumer spending in Japan just as it is paying for ambitious expansion in the late 1980s. However, Isetan has also become embroiled in controversy over its ownership. Mr Kosuge's departure is thought to be the culmination of a long power struggle with Mitsubishi bank over Isetan's ownership. About 29 per cent of Isetan's stock is owned by Shuwa, a financially-troubled real estate company. Ito Yokado, a leading supermarket group, last year attempted to buy into Isetan through the purchase of the Shuwa stake. Such a deal would have broken the traditional divide between department stores and supermarkets in Japan. However, the sale fell through, thwarting plans to strengthen Isetan's balance sheet. The replacement of Mr Kosuge with Mr Kazumasa Koshiba is likely to clear the way for Mitsubishi bank to lead a consortium to finance the purchase by Isetan of the Shuwa stake.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Tiphook chief gains time Mr Robert Montague, chief executive of Tiphook, the container leasing group, yesterday staved off personal bankruptcy proceedings by winning a 28-day adjournment to the preliminary hearing due to begin today. Royal Bank of Scotland, which served a bankruptcy petition on Mr Montague last month, on debts totalling Pounds 2.3m, confirmed that his solicitors 'had made representations to the court and that an adjournment had been agreed while negotiations continue'. Mr Montague has personal debts put at more than Pounds 30m, some of which are secured on his 1,300-acre estate in Pusey, Oxfordshire, and others on a 139ft luxury yacht. There had been speculation prior to yesterday's move that Mr Montague would seek an individual voluntary agreement, a move which would require the agreement of three-quarters of his creditors. Prominent among these are Barclays and Commerzbank, the German banking group. An IVA would involve Mr Montague agreeing a repayment programme with his creditors, a move which would probably realise more than if he were forced into bankruptcy. However, the situation is complicated by the question of which debts are secured on particular assets. This has so far divided Mr Montague's creditors. Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday that it had received no notification from Mr Montague that he was seeking an IVA, although 'the adjournment period would allow time for further consultations between the parties.' It is understood that Mr Montague will return to court to seek an IVA at the end of the adjournment period.</p>

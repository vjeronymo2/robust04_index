H. L. &amp; W. Coal Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;100&hyph;C]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> H. L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.335 (construction of seals) to its H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner requests a modification of the standard to permit alternative methods of seal construction using wooden materials of moderate size and weight due to the difficulty in accessing previously driven headings and breasts containing inaccessible abandoned workings; to accept a design criterion in the 10 psi range; and to permit the water trap to be installed in the gangway seal and sampling tube in the monkey seal for seals installed in pairs. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.340 (underground electrical installations) to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. As an alternative to removing the batteries and transporting them in the gunboat to the surface for charging, the petitioner proposes to charge batteries on the mine's locomotive when all miners are out of the mine and to have the intake air which is used to ventilate the charging station continue through its normal route to the last open crosscut and into the monkey airway (return). The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. H. L. &amp; W.

L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.360 (preshift examination) to its H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during the preshift examination after an air quantity reading is taken inby the intake portal and to test for the quantity and quality of air at the intake air split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The petitioner proposes to physically examine the entire length of the slope once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. H. L. &amp; W. Coal Company  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;103&hyph;C]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> H. L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1), (4), and (5) (weekly examination) to its H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions and roof falls, certain areas of the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to examine these areas from the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1100&hyph;2(a)(2) (quantity and location of firefighting equipment) to its H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use only portable fire extinguishers to replace existing requirements where rock dust, water cars, and other water storage are not practical. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 6.

L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1200(d) &amp; (i) (mine map) to its H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use cross-sections instead of contour lines through the intake slope, at locations of rock tunnel connections between veins, and at 1,000 feet intervals of advance from the intake slope and to limit the mapping of mine workings above and below to those present within 100 feet of the vein being mined except when veins are interconnected to other veins beyond the 100 feet limit through rock tunnels. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 7.

L. &amp; W. Coal Company, 14 Maple Street, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania 17963 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1202&hyph;1(a) (temporary notations, revisions, and supplements) to its H. L. &amp; W. Slope No. 2 (I.D. No. 36&hyph;07269) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to revise and supplement mine maps on an annual basis instead of the required 6 month interval and to update maps daily by hand notations. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

Box 310, Huntington, Utah 84528 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.804(a) (underground high-voltage cables) to its Deer Creek Mine (I.D. No. 42&hyph;00121) located in Emery County, Utah. The petitioner requests a modification of the standard to allow the use of Anaconda Type SHD+GC, Piralli Type SHD-Center-GC, or Tiger Brand Type SHD-CGC MSHA-approved flame resistant cables with a flexible No. 16 A.W.G. ground check conductor for the ground continuity check circuit, on high-voltage longwall systems. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 9.

V. No. 3 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08405) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner requests a modification of the standard to permit alternative methods of seal construction using wooden materials of moderate size and weight due to the difficulty in accessing previously driven headings and breasts containing inaccessible abandoned workings; to accept a design criterion in the 10 psi range; and to permit the water trap to be installed in the gangway seal and sampling tube in the monkey seal for seals installed in pairs.

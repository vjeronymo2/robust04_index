			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> INDECISIVE LEONARD SHEDS TITLE  </P> <P> Sugar Ray Leonard is giving up his World Boxing Council super middleweight  title because he is uncertain whether he wants to defend it, his lawyer  announced today.  </P> <P> Leonard, 33, who successfully defended his title last month in an easy bout  against one of his great rivals, Roberto Duran, made the decision after coming  under pressure from the WBC to defend his title again, the office of lawyer  Mike Trainer said.  </P> <P> Trainer's office said word of the decision was sent to WBC President Jose  Sulaiman in a letter dated Jan. 17.  </P> <P> "Ray and I have had a chance to discuss his future, and he has indicated to me  that he has not made a final decision (about his career)," Trainer said in the  letter.  </P> <P> "However, he is aware that you are under pressure by fighters in his division  that want to fight for the title. Accordingly, he has authorized me to  relinquish, on his behalf, said title so that you can afford two worthy  fighters the opportunity to fight for his title."  </P></p>

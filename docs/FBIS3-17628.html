			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Leonid Kravchuk by Ukraine's State </F> Television and Radio Company correspondents on 25 March on the  27 March elections to the Supreme Council; place not given --  recorded; from poor reception]    [Text] [Announcer] President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk was  interviewed on 25 March by Ukraine's State Television and Radio  Company correspondents. The subject of the interview was a  package of issues concerning the forthcoming election to the  Supreme Council of Ukraine. We are offering a recording of the  conversation with the Ukrainian head of state made by our  correspondent Vitaliy Naumenko.    [Question indistinct]    [Kravchuk] I have a sickness called radiculitis, whereby I  am well, but not too well. That is why I am working at home  today. By the way I have everything I need to work here, the  relevant contacts and communications. At work, it is a bit  difficult, when I look like I swallowed a pole, and I have to  meet people, so in order not to inconvenience them and myself, I  am working at home.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct] What can you, as a  popularly elected president, wish the electorate?    [Kravchuk] Like the rest of the electorate, I too will take  part in the voting, and incidentally, I listen to candidates'  campaign speeches and I understand how difficult it will be for  the voters to make up their minds. Because the programs and  speeches are sometimes diametrically opposed, while the  candidates are too many to make one's choice. But still, [words  indistinct] because they will need judgement, courage and  foresight in order to make the right choice, otherwise we will  wind up in a tight corner. That is why I urge voters to come to  the polls on the 27th and make their choice. That is, elect  worthy and intelligent people to the parliament, who will start  a new stage in the political reform of our society, start a new  stage in the development of our entire society.    [Correspondent] How would you predict the political and  economic situation in the near future, if the Supreme Council is  not elected at the first attempt? [words indistinct]    [Kravchuk] This is a very serious question you are asking.  But I am prepared for it, and I drew for myself a picture of  possible options. First of all, I would like to say that,  regardless of what happens and how, we must consolidate the  political and non-political conditions necessary to reform our  society. This must happen irrespective of the election results.  And it is preconditioned by the fact that we, first of all,  have no alternative, and second of all, that we have created  very favorable foreign policy conditions for this course of  development, and we have to do it. Not to take advantage of it  now would spell further deterioration of the economic situation  and especially, a serious decline of our state's authority.  Therefore, we have to do it, and we probably have no other way.  But there are (?different) possible options. The first  option, for example: a new Supreme Council is not elected. That  is, there is not a sufficient number of deputies to make  constitutional decisions. In that case, whether you like it or  not, we must work together with the old Supreme Council. How?    [Correspondent interrupts, words indistinct]    [Kravchuk] Yes, and secondly, we already have the experience  of this kind of cooperation. At different times it was  inadequate, but on the whole it is extremely complicated, and it  was these complications that led to the deterioration of the  situation where it did not have to deteriorate. How could we  work with the old Supreme Council, and what is the picture I  have drawn for myself?    The president asks the Supreme Council to postpone, defer  the  election scheduled for June. There is every reason to do that,  as failure to elect a new Supreme Council already means that  there are problems that cannot be solved (?at once). This is  the first move. Second, the Supreme Council of the old  convocation, understanding the situation which has emerged and  which is actually very serious, assumes a number of powers.  These are: adopting the constitution and putting it to a  nation-wide referendum, and adopting permanent procedural rules.  The rest of the powers concerning the regulation of economic  relations and legal regulation of the fight against organized  crime and corruption are handed over by the Supreme Council to  the president. Thus, both the president and the Supreme Council  work. Afterwards, the finalized draft of the constitution is  put to an all-Ukrainian referendum, which is mandatory, because  you cannot entrust this Supreme Council, after the election,  with adopting a constitution. You understand what consequences  this would have. The referendum adopts a new constitution, then  respectively, laws are passed on elections to local power bodies  and their structure, and on presidential elections. After the  constitution is adopted, a new Supreme Council is elected, by  all means. Until the election of a new Supreme Council, the old  one is working, and everything is placed on a constitutional  basis. After this, a new Supreme Council is elected and gets  down to work. The constitution is there, the power structure is  there, and all these power structures are elected in a  constitutional way, a president is elected, and there is no  political crisis and no chaos in the society. This is the  option of cooperation with the Supreme Council.    But suppose the old Supreme Council does not agree. This  can happen, we know the difficulties the parliamentarians are  having, and the problems in the society: the lack of structure  in the society and in the Supreme Council itself. That is a  compromise solution, it is a normal solution, and if it is  rejected, the president is faced with complications. He cannot  watch society fall apart, chaos take over the political  structures, another struggle unleashed, which will result in  further deterioration of the political and economic situation,  and an end to reforms. The president must find a way and act  accordingly.    What way can it be? The president appeals to the newly  elected deputies. Suppose, there are 300 of them elected.    [Correspondent] That is a quorum.    [Kravchuk] It is, but it is not a full Supreme Council,  because there should be 450. That is, 150 deputies are missing,  and it is not a full parliament. There is a quorum for  decision-making, but there is no Supreme Council in the full  sense of the term. And that is a very important element, I do  not want people to think that if there are 300, it is a full  Supreme Council.    Together with the Supreme Council, which is not a full one  yet, he [the president] agrees the following actions: First, a  decision has to be made again on cancelling the local elections  in June 1994 and the presidential election, so as to prevent a  power vacuum, because these bodies would have no constitutional  status. Second, the president nominates a council, elected by  the leaders of this elected part of the new Supreme Council to  grant the president extra powers of legislative regulation.  This, one can say, would be a Supreme Council. But, as I said,  not in its full composition. [words indistinct]    Due to the lack of definition as to the duties of the  Supreme  Council and the level of its relations with the president and  the government, a number of problems emerge. Again, the number  one problem is adoption of a new constitution. But, as I said  before, there is no full Supreme Council. Therefore, we could  form a new, extended, constitutional commission, including  regional representatives, experts in constitutional law and  [word indistinct] and finalize the constitution, but not adopt  it, because the Supreme Council is not full, and the draft must  be put to a nation-wide referendum. For this, we need to work  out a draft law on an all-Ukrainian referendum on the  constitution, explaining how it should be adopted, and set a  date for an all-Ukrainian referendum. Next, after the  constitution is adopted in an all- Ukrainian referendum, the  door is open for elections to all power bodies, since the  constitution lays down the political system which is the subject  of a lot of talk today and solves other problems which need to  be laid down in the constitution. Then local power bodies are  elected, presidential elections are scheduled, and again, all  this is solved in a constitutional way, without any tug-of-war.  Such are the options.    But if a full Supreme Council is elected, then this full  Supreme Council will act in accordance with [word indistinct],  common sense and [words indistinct].    [Question indistinct]    [Kravchuk] The thing is that, according to my proposals, the  presidential and local elections should be taken off the agenda  and deferred, until after the constitution is adopted together  with the relevant laws on the power structure, etc. And in  those elections which will take place, it is clear that one will  have to make up one's mind and make a choice. If now, contrary  to sensible proposals... [pauses] and I do not see any problems  about them, you just need to think, take your head in your hands  and see that the period is a difficult one, a period of  transition, and nothing here (?happens the way one would like  to), but we are taking a constitutional path, that of adopting a  constitution and passing the laws, and only then start acting on  the basis of the constitution and the laws. Thus, legitimacy is  ensured. As for ambitions, they have nothing to do with  legitimacy. Everybody must understand this. Nobody wants to  grab the most. There is a situation, there are problems, and  there is Ukraine. And we must think in terms of the Ukrainian  state, of preserving it, of preventing a political chaos, taking  the economic situation into our hands, that is, preserve the  state and contain the situation. For this, we need to act  accordingly.    [Question indistinct]    [Kravchuk] Well, you see, whatever the high policy is,  however high-ranking one's position may be, it...    [Correspondent interrupts, question indistinct]    [Kravchuk] Well, I cannot talk about it now, I know one  thing: as long as there is no law on the power structure, and as  long as there is no law stipulating what kind of president with  what kind of powers should be elected, it is illogical. You  cannot put elections first and everything else second. This  leads to confrontation. That is why people see, first of all,  that this is missing. They, and I have met many, and many write  to me, are simply afraid that this may lead to political chaos,  electing just any kind administration over the economy and the  political structures, and we know what it can lead to. Some  may, riding on this wave, take a very irresponsible political  stand and provoke anything. And people are afraid, knowing what  it can lead to. That is why they are saying this. They feel  the situation there better than we do here in Kiev. And  secondly, they also write that the timing is bad, it is a time  of spring field work, and in some regions it is already harvest  time. And [words indistinct] they are working, while in the  meantime, such a political action as a presidential election and  election to all power bodies will again [word indistinct] all  regions, from the village council to the rayon center.    [Correspondent] Speaking of regions, Leonid Makarovych, and  elections in Crimea. Could you comment on the latest decisions  of President Meshkov as to how they will affect the election to  the new parliament.    [Kravchuk] I spoke about it several times, but will mention  one more aspect in connection with the election. What would I  like the Crimeans to understand? And not only the Crimeans. No  matter how good and promising the president's or anyone else's  actions may seem today, now matter how well they seem to accord  with the present situation, you still need to think about  tomorrow, about the future. And tomorrow, the future, is this:  Crimea is a constituent part of Ukraine, and Crimea will live  together with Ukraine. Perhaps someone may not welcome this  today, perhaps someone may have other plans. I am talking about  political forces, not the ordinary worker who is now thinking  only of peace and well-being, he does not have any other  aspirations. Another thing is when political storms are having  their effect. So if you think about tomorrow and the fact that  Crimea is part of Ukraine, you need to elect deputies to the  Ukrainian parliament, in order for them to defend Crimea's  interests. Incidentally, when this parliament was passing the  law on the division of powers and other documents concerning  Crimea directly or Ukraine in general, determining Crimea's  role, they were very active. It is true, and it is  understandable. Failure to elect deputies to the Ukrainian  parliament would be a great loss for Crimea. I do not know what  levers they could use then to affect the passage through the  Supreme Council of these or those documents directly concerning  Crimea. This is just one aspect.    I want to tell all our Ukrainian citizens at this complex  moment for Ukraine, at this time of difficulty, aggravated by  the election campaign and deputies' speeches, the campaign is  about to stop, and you have 24 hours to calm down, to grasp the  situation, sit down at the table come up to your children and  grandchildren, look into their eyes, and ask yourself one  question: Are they to live tomorrow in peace and harmony, or in  some other situation? And what do you need for that? Take  these thoughts to the polls and vote for the people who will  ensure peace, harmony and the development of an independent  Ukrainian state.</p>

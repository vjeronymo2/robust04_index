			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Benn publishes details of MPs' cash probe The House of Commons investigation into the so-called 'cash-for-questions' affair broke up in disarray last night after the veteran Labour MP Mr Tony Benn defied parliamentary rules and published details of the inquiry's private deliberations. The clash on the powerful privileges committee came as Mr Peter Preston, editor of The Guardian, faced an investigation by MPs into his newspaper's use of a doctored Commons letterhead during its inquiries into the payment of a Cabinet minister's hotel bill. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, yesterday cleared the way for an emergency Commons debate today, which is expected to lead to a decision that the newspaper should be the subject of a privileges committee probe. Her decision followed a direct attack on the Guardian editor by Mr John Major, the prime minister. He told the Commons: 'If it is commonly accepted in journalism that the end justifies any means, then I believe journalism will regret stooping to that particular standard.' Mr Preston, already facing a barrage of criticism from Tory MPs, last night announced he had resigned from the Press Complaints Commission, the self-regulatory organisation which adjudicates on complaints against newspapers. Mr Preston said he had decided 'the cleanest thing' he could do was to 'make the break' with the commission. He stressed in his letter to Lord McGregor, the commission's chairman, that his resignation was not an admission that his conduct deliberately flouted the code of practice. 'I do not believe it did and did not believe it last November when the events so copiously described took place,' he said. Hopes of a cross-party agreement at Westminster on the way in which the Commons should investigate charges against individual MPs suffered a severe setback when Mr Benn stuck to his insistence that the proceedings should be published. A statement released after the two-hour meeting of the privileges committee, which was due to investigate charges against two Tory MPs alleged to have accepted payment for tabling questions, said it could not interview witnesses without giving them 'the opportunity to consider . . . the position created by Mr Benn's statement'. Mr Benn, a former cabinet minister, published the committee's private deliberations last night as 'my own reports of its proceedings'. His six-page account of the meeting shows that the Conservative members argued strongly against interviewing the two MPs facing investigation - Mr Graham Riddick and Mr David Tredinnick - as long as he insisted on publication. Mr Benn now faces the threat of a Commons motion to order his expulsion from the privileges committee, a move unprecedented in recent times. The committee itself is not expected to meet again until after the opening of the new session of parliament on November 16. The meeting was attended by the committee's seven Labour members, who have been boycotting its deliberations over the government's insistence that hearings be held in private. Meanwhile Sir Paul Beresford, the housing minister who is the latest target of press allegations, denied any wrongdoing over combining government duties with part-time work as a dentist. Solicitors acting for Mr Mohamed Fayed, owner of Harrods, yesterday wrote to Mrs Barbara Mills, the director of public prosecutions, to call for an urgent decision on whether he would face criminal charges for his alleged attempts to 'blackmail' the government. Today's debate is expected to be on a motion calling for The Guardian to be investigated by the privileges committee. Announcing the debate to MPs yesterday, Miss Boothroyd said the 'essential' issue was: 'The alleged action of The Guardian newspaper in representing that a letter sent by it to the Ritz hotel in Paris was sent in the name of a member of this house.'</p>

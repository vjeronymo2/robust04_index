			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roman Zadunayskiy article under "Details" rubric: "Where </F> U.S. and Russian Missiles Are Targeted"]    [Text] In the past B. Yeltsin's words to the effect that  henceforth Russian ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads were  no longer targeted on U.S. cities were given quite a restrained  welcome by the Bush administration and did not meet with any  special desire on the part of the White House and the Pentagon  to take an analogous step. It now comes to light, however, that  the Russian military was also in no hurry to retarget the  missiles -- talks on this are proceeding only now both at the  highest level and directly between military chiefs.    Thus, Colonel General I. Sergeyev, commander of the  Strategic  Missile Forces, recently met in the United States (Omaha) with  Gen. L. Butler, chief of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, and  with high-ranking Pentagon representatives. It is too soon to  speak of the result of the talks but, according to available  information, they discussed precisely the retargeting of U.S.  and Russian ICBM's at deserted areas of the World Ocean.  According to U.S. data, 20 such regions have already been  identified.    The retargeting scheme itself is not complex: The  coordinates of targets in the Russian Federation and the United  States which had been entered into the missiles' computer  operational memory will be replaced by the coordinates of  regions in the ocean. These are the main targets, while the  reserve targets, also entered in the computer memory, will  remain untouched. In general, the coordinates of the main  targets have to be entered in the computer memory, since the  possibility that the missile will fall onto the territory from  which it was launched cannot be ruled out. The flight mission  -- the coordinates of the main target -- can be changed in 15  minutes, so retargeting is a symbolic, diplomatic step rather  than a military, operational-tactical one, and a demonstration  of the significant warming of Russian-U.S. relations.    At the same time there are several aspects which complicate  even this, at first sight simple and understandable diplomatic  maneuver. It is not clear, for example, how Ukraine, on whose  territory 176 missiles with 1,240 nuclear charges are stationed,  will react to this. In addition, 81 missiles (81 charges) are  on the territory of Belarus and 98 missiles (980 nuclear  charges) in Kazakhstan. Under interstate treaties all these  silo-housed ICBM's with their nuclear multiple reentry vehicles  belong to Russia, but the Ukrainian leadership is known to  dissent on this question. Therefore the possibility cannot be  ruled out that Kiev will once again show self-will and refuse to  retarget "its" missiles (which L. Kravchuk has transferred to  the jurisdiction of the 42d Missile Army of the republic's Armed  Forces), offended that the talks were held without involving the  Ukrainian military department.    The retargeting of ground-based ICBM's will reduce the  danger  of their unsanctioned launch and, thus, of a nuclear war arising  by accident. But similar missiles with nuclear warheads (Russia  has 788 of them with 2,652 charges) will remain on submarines of  both states, and there seems to be no question of retargeting  these. In addition, problems of inspection arise with regard to  where the missiles are actually targeted. It only remains for  us to take the Pentagon at its word that henceforth Russia will  not be the main target of the U.S. military, but only a reserve  target. States bordering on the regions of the World Ocean at  which the missiles will be retargeted and also Greenpeace will  be indignant. The possibility cannot be ruled out that the  retargeting of missiles at "abstract" targets will dampen the  ardor of missilemen and lessen their attention -- which could  lead to unsanctioned launches.    The most radical option for preventing an accidental  unleashing of nuclear war is to remove the nuclear warheads from  the carriers and store them. Incidentally, this simple solution  to the problem, proposed by Bruce Blair, a U.S. specialist in  questions of nuclear weapon command and control systems at the  Brookings Institution, as well as by some Russian specialists,  is categorically rejected by both Washington and Moscow. The  fact that, apart from the United States and Russia, which have  "become friends," other nuclear states exist in the world, and  the policies of some of these inspire real fear, serves as a  weighty argument.</p>

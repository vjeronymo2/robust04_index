			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US coal mine strike widens THE United Mine Workers of America intensified their three-week-old strike against US coal producers last night by extending the stoppage to Pennsylvania and West Virginia mines owned by Consol Energy, Inc., Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal Company, and CLI Corp. Consol, jointly owned by the German conglomerate Rheinbraun AG and the US chemical company, DuPont, is the second-largest US coal producer. Consol's president, Mr. Bobby Brown, is the lead negotiator for the Bituminous Coal Operator's Association's contract talks with the union. The union is seeking guarantees from BCOA companies that new mines will hire union workers.</p>

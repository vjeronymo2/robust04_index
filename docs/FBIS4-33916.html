			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman reported  yesterday on her participation in the 11th Nonaligned Movement  [NAM] Ministerial Conference held recently in Cairo, Egypt. She  explained that she had stopped the organization from accepting  inaccurate proposals that attempted to obtain statements of  support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize,  thus, ignoring the existence of the territorial dispute.    Confronted with such attempts, her delegation acted to  safeguard the country's interests and was able to get the NAM  Declaration to be more balanced, limiting it to calling upon  Belize and Guatemala to discuss and resolve the dispute, which  had not been achieved at this forum previously. She asserted  that the government agreed with the NAM statement because  Guatemala's position had not been omitted. To the benefit of  both parties, the declaration backed the negotiations and, by  not polarizing the situation, established the necessary climate  for it, she added.    She highlighted as special achievements her participation as  vice president of the conference and Colombia's selection to  chair the next NAM presidential summit of member countries to be  held in 1998. Above all, we managed to get a special  pronouncement in favor of Guatemala -- something that is  uncommon -- to support the efforts being made by De Leon Carpio  to further the democratization and peace processes, she  emphasized.    On ending, Vielman stated that the officials who attended  the  NAM Ministerial Conference had attempted to redefine the  movement's role in the new international context and had  reaffirmed its objective of furthering the developing countries'  struggle to advance.    The meeting was attended by 130 delegates, of which 109 were  from member countries. We took advantage of this situation and  held bilateral meetings with most of the representatives at the  meeting, she added.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Markets Report: US elections keep dollar in narrow trading range The dollar yesterday again traded in a narrow range as the market sat on its hands awaiting the result of the US mid-term congressional elections, writes Philip Gawith. Traders said, however, that next week's meeting of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee would be more important for the US currency. The dollar finished in London at DM1.5097, from DM1.5172, and at Y97.005, from Y97.31. It has slipped back over the past two days from the levels reached at the end of last week, in the wake of supportive intervention by the US Federal Reserve. It ended New York trading yesterday at DM1.5085 and Y97.10. With no important data releases, little comment of note, and the uncertainty of US elections and the impending FOMC meeting, foreign exchange activity was extremely subdued. In Europe, the D-Mark was stronger against most currencies, helped by political worries in countries such as France and Italy, and uncertainty surrounding European Union membership in Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. It finished at FFr3.436 against the French franc, from FFr3.427. The trade weighted sterling index ended at 80.5 from 80.6. The pound closed at DM2.4432, about a pfennig lower than a week ago. The general market view is that the congressional elections ought not to have too much impact on the dollar. Insofar as they do, it is likely to be negative. Mr Rob Hayward, economist at Bank of America in London, said the possibility of Republican gains leaving Mr Clinton a lame-duck president would be bad news for the dollar. Also damaging for the dollar is the growing perception that last week's intervention was politically motivated, designed only to ensure that the Democrats did not contest yesterday's election against the backdrop of a falling dollar. 'The market's view is that if the dollar weakens after the results, the Fed will be less inclined to intervene,' said Mr Hayward. There were already indications that the market was again testing the downside on the US currency. Mr Robert Thomas, currency strategist at NatWest Markets, commented: 'People are waiting for decisive action. It is not the elections that are going to be relevant. It is what the Fed does next week. 'The market has hyped itself into the view that it needs to get more than a 50 basis-point rise in rates, and it must be doubtful that it is going to get it. The Fed has got to do something dramatic, or the need to do something dramatic has to be seen not to be there. But the market is not prepared to give the Fed the benefit of the doubt.' Mr Thomas added that the potential upside for the dollar lay in US short-term rates rising above German short rates; 'historically that has always been good for the currency whose rates are rising'. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, said the presentation of a monetary tightening was probably as important as its scope. He added that the Fed's statement last time it raised rates, that another tightening would not be necessary for some time, may have undermined the effectiveness of higher rates. Probably the main mover on the day was the Philippines peso, which rose by 3 per cent to an intraday high of 23.52 pesos against the dollar, from Monday's close of 24.2 pesos. Mr John Davitte, emerging markets analyst at IDEA in London, said the peso had been buoyed by strong capital inflows into the stock market, and remittances from foreign based Filipino workers. Two other factors helping the peso recently have been less assertive central bank intervention, to curb the currency's rise, and strong economic fundamentals. Economic growth is expected to be 5 to 6 per cent this year. Mr Davitte issued a note of caution, however, saying that the central bank would be unlikely to allow the peso's rise, from around 26 pesos early last month, to continue unhindered. Indeed, President Fidel Ramos announced yesterday that forward foreign exchange cover on oil imports was being scrapped in an effort to halt the peso's rise. The Bank of England provided Pounds 680m late assistance, and Pounds 437m help at established rates, in its daily money market operations. The shortage was forecast at Pounds 1.15bn.</p>

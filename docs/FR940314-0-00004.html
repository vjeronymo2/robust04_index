			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In developing regulations for the implementation of locality-based comparability payments under 5 U.S.C. 5304, OPM determined that a special law enforcement adjusted rate of pay should not be based on a nationwide or worldwide special salary rate under 5 U.S.C. 5305. The final regulations for locality-based comparability payments published on December 30, 1993, [58 FR 69169] removed special rates of pay under 5 U.S.C. 5305 from the definition of ``scheduled annual rate of pay'' in &sect;531.301. It should be noted that special pay adjustments continue to be based on the special rates for law enforcement officers provided by section 403 of FEPCA. For law enforcement officers who were receiving special pay adjustments on top of special rates under 5 U.S.C. 5305, the regulations established a continued rate of pay equal to the rate received before this change became effective so that there would be no loss in pay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Miscellaneous <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget changed the title of the Boston CMSA to the Boston-Worcester-Lawrence, MA&hyph;NH&hyph;ME&hyph;CT CMSA, effective on June 30, 1993. (Although the title of the Boston CMSA changed, the geographic coverage did not change). Also, section 628 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;123, October 28, 1993), amended section 404 of FEPCA by striking ``Washington, DC&hyph;MD&hyph;VA Metropolitan Statistical Area'' and inserting in its place ``Washington-Baltimore, DC&hyph;MD&hyph;VA&hyph;WV Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area.'' This amendment became effective on October 28, 1993. Accordingly, OPM is revising the titles of the Boston and Washington metropolitan statistical areas in paragraph (a) of the definition of ``special pay adjustment area'' (&sect;531.301) and in the chart in &sect;531.302(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An individual called OPM staff by telephone and pointed out that an incorrect citation for the definition of ``law enforcement officer'' was used in 5 CFR 575.302. OPM is revising &sect;575.302 to substitute the correct reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM is taking this opportunity to make technical corrections to two additional regulatory sections to conform with changes in law. The Technical and Miscellaneous Civil Service Amendments Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;378, October 2, 1992) revised the divisor for computing overtime pay for certain prevailing rate employees (i.e., those employees whose pay is fixed on either a monthly or annual basis) from 2,080 to 2,087. The amendment became effective on the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after October 2, 1992. OPM is revising 5 CFR 550.113 accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, OPM is correcting erroneous citations in 5 CFR 531.205(a) (3) and (4) by removing the reference to ``5 U.S.C. 5305'' and inserting ``5 U.S.C. 5303.'' Prior to enactment of FEPCA, annual adjustments to pay schedules were covered under section 5305 of title 5, United States Code. As a result of the FEPCA amendments, annual adjustments are now covered under section 5303. The references in &sect;531.205(a) must be changed accordingly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they apply only to Federal agencies and employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 531 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government employees, Law enforcement officers, Wages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 532 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practices and procedures, Freedom of Information, Government employees, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Wages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 550 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practices and procedures, Claims, Government employees, Wages. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5 CFR Part 575 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government employees, Wages. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Office of Personnel Management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lorraine A.

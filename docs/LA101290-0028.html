			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: BRITT/BROWN QUINTET STILL FIDDLIN' AROUND  </P> <P> What started out as a six-week gig at a jazz brunch has turned out to be one of  the longest-running engagements in town for the Pat Britt-Wilbur Brown quintet.  Sunday, the fivesome celebrates its fifth year at the Cat and Fiddle Pub and  Restaurant in Hollywood.  </P> <P> "Actually, we started Oct. 10," said Britt, a tall alto saxophonist with a  resilient tone. "A friend, saxophonist Bo Svensson, was a chef there." He  brought Cat and Fiddle owners Kim and Paula Gardner over to the defunct North  Hollywood jazz room Donte's to hear the group, "and Kim hired us for this  brunch.  </P> <P> "We started outside on the patio, playing from 1-4 p.m. (The band nows plays  7-11 p.m.) It was supposed to be for six weeks, and when the weather got darker  and colder, Kim said, 'Instead of quitting, why don't you just move inside?' "  So Britt and Brown found a home: a small side room off the Cat and Fiddle's  main bar and dining room during the winter, and the establishment's pleasant  patio in warmer climes.  </P> <P> To celebrate the anniversary, Britt and Brown -- a house-rocking tenor  saxophonist who has played with jazz greats Kenny Dorham, Lionel Hampton and  the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra and R&amp;Ber Lloyd Price -- will  invite some friends in for a party. In addition to regular quintet members Pat  Senatore (bass), Dwight Dickerson (piano) and Clarence Johnston (drums), Britt  will enlist Svensson (baritone saxophone), Jerry Rusch (trumpet) and Dick Rinde  (trombone) to enliven the proceedings. "We'll be playing our usual stuff --  blues, ballads, be-bop -- but there'll just be a bigger sound."  </P> <P> One tune the band will definitely play is Miles Davis' "All Blues," which has  become a sort of anthem for the band: It's the tune that Kim Gardner, a rock  'n' roll bassist from Britain before he entered the restaurant trade, always  plays on. "One day we were playing it and he sat in, and it's become a weekly  tradition," said Britt.  </P> <P> Britt and Brown have known each other since the early '60s when Britt, an  up-and-coming Bay Area hornman, met Brown, an L.A. native who spent a good  portion of the '60s in New York City, at a session. "We just started hanging  out, and when he came down to this gig I had in San Mateo, he tore the place  apart," Britt said. "We didn't see each for about 15 years when he was in  Manhattan, but when we ran into each other again here in the '70s, we formed a  band on the spot."  </P> <P> Britt sees his partner as the high point of each week's performance. "I love  playing with Wilbur, learning from him," Britt said. "He can turn any  situation, no matter how glum, into something beautiful, musically."  </P> <P> LISTON BENEFIT: Earlier Sunday, the Britt-Brown quintet will join Randy Weston,  Cedar Walton, Buddy Collette, Harold Land, the Cunninghams and many others in a  benefit for trombonist-composer-arranger Melba Liston, the L.A. native who  spent a good deal of her career in New York City.  </P> <P> The affair for Liston, who has played with and/or written for Dizzy Gillespie,  Count Basie, Quincy Jones and the Supremes, will be held at the Proud Bird  Ballroom, 11022 Aviation Blvd., at 2 p.m. Proceeds will help purchase  computerized music composing and arranging equipment to aid Liston, who  suffered a stroke in January and has not fully regained the use of her hands,  as well as to offset her medical expenses. Minimum donation: $10. Information:  (213) 462-5207.  </P> <P> RIM SHOT: Rollickingly pianist Dorothy Donegan, plus saxman Teddy Edwards and  singer Lorez Alexandria, highlight a concert Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at Myron's  Ballroom, 1024 S. Grand Ave. Information: (213) 351-1595.  </P></p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Arts: 'Mandragola' opens new theatre Seeing a comedy by Niccolo Machiavelli (1467-1527) is like discovering John Stuart Mill was big in panto or George Eliot had a fizzy stand-up routine. Machiavelli's Mandragola (1522) is the old wine in the new bottle, since it inaugurates The Southwark Playhouse. First the theatre. The renovation cost under Pounds 10,000. This used to be a tea warehouse, engineering shop, and Filipino church; so trade, technology and religion have now ceded to entertainment. The pews for seats are an irony Machiavelli would have enjoyed, but the black or dark green walls would have reminded him of his spell in prison after the Medici lost control of Florence. There are a dozen spotlights, a small playing area, and a bar. The Southwark Playhouse fills a need for a studio space in this part of London and, on first acquaintance, looks good. Now the play. Machiavelli wrote Mandragola long after his political ambitions had been thwarted; it has a realist outlook and a comic execution. Like his Discoursi and Il Principe, it catalogues what men and women do rather than what they ought to do. The plot weaves around Lucrezia, the beautiful wife of an impotent Florentine, Messer Niccia. Hearing of her beauty, Calimacco has come from France to seduce her, and enlists the limber offices of Ligurio to gain entry to her bedchamber. First Calimacco pretends to be a medic prescribing mandrake root, but he diagnoses death to the first man who makes love to Lucrezia post-mandrake. He then takes on a second disguise as an expendable street urchin, ushered in by Ligurio and Messer Niccia for a night of pleasure with Lucrezia. She enjoys it, Calimacco declares his love, and they plot a future as doctor and patient. The church, in the form of a quiet, worldly friar, watches indulgently. The result is a cocktail of Up Pompeii and Les Liaisons Dangereuses, all trust and trysts, but laced with Machiavelli's sententia: 'Always weigh certain gain against uncertain loss' or 'it is the part of the wise man to choose the lesser of two evils.' There are philosophical debates waiting to happen; Ligurio, resplendent in pink socks, green suit and orange shirt, can still observe: 'I believe what satisfies the majority is itself good.' The Turkish director Mehmet Ergen, who has worked on Sam Shepherd and David Mamet, keeps the dialogue natural and relaxed; Peter Pacey as the slimy Ligurio and Clive Webster as the pragmatic Friar are particularly good, in love with the deliciousness of the plot, but nevertheless keeping the issues humane. Matthew Morrison as Calimacco is by turns libidinous and lurid as the chief seducer. It is surprising to find that Machiavelli works on stage. His maxims are most suited now not to politics (the thrust of Edward Pearce's recently published book Machiavelli's Children) but to organisations (the focus of Anthony Jay's Machiavelli &amp; Management), where it is much more secure to be feared than to be loved and where the reputation of power is power. Southwark Playhouse, Southwark Bridge Road, SE1 (071 620 3494) until November 27</p>

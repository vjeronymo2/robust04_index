			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Leeds board defeats bid by dissidents The board of Leeds Permanent building society yesterday defeated an attempt by dissident members to elect their own candidates to be involved in running the society. At the society's annual general meeting, the three board candidates who were standing for re-election were returned by substantial margins. Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, and his two colleagues achieved votes of 70,000-plus. The three other candidates attracted votes of over 26,000, suggesting that an element among the members is dissatisfied and wants greater recognition that the society is a mutual organisation. Leeds is the UK's fifth largest society, with total assets of Pounds 18bn. Last November, Leeds reported a rise in pre-tax profits of 22 per cent, taking its figure for the year to end-September to Pounds 186m. A special resolution put forward by Dr Ken Craven, one of the independent candidates, which would have made it easier to stand for election to the board, was also defeated. The meeting, attended by around 300 members, heard Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, say that he hoped to make an announcement within the next few months about the appointment of a new chief executive. The post has been vacant since the departure last February of Mr Mike Blackburn, now chief executive of Halifax, the UK's largest society. The Leeds' search has been prolonged by the merger talks with National &amp; Provincial. The deal, announced in August and abandoned in October, would have seen Mr David O'Brien, N&amp;P's chief executive, as chief executive for the merged society. Separately, Leeds confirmed yesterday that Mr Peter Green, head of its Treasury operation, is to leave the society to take up a job elsewhere. It hopes to announce a new appointment very shortly.</p>

			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Steady hand at the helm: Peter Norman sifts through Kenneth Clarke's in-tray It is a fair bet that Mr Kenneth Clarke will have left the Treasury last night after his first day as chancellor with nautical metaphors ringing in his ears. 'Don't rock the boat,' and 'steady as she goes' is the advice that the mandarins of Great George Street hope the new tenant of Number 11 Downing Street will take to heart as he wades through red boxes of briefing papers during next week's parliamentary recess. The timing of Mr Norman Lamont's departure - with the economy in recovery, and between this year's March and November Budgets - means that there is no immediate economic pressure on Mr Clarke to act. Although his appointment prompted some calls for a further cut in bank base rates from their present 6 per cent, the Treasury will have moved quickly to quash such an idea. Both the Treasury and Bank of England fear that lower interest rates could boost inflation and risk pushing the underlying inflation rate through the upper limit of the government's 1 to 4 per cent target range. More important, Mr Clarke will be told - politely, of course - that financial markets would take fright if a new chancellor with no previous economic policy experience started to throw his weight around. Timing and mood are everything in monetary policy. The financial markets already think too many base rate cuts over the past two and half years have been politically motivated. A brief spell of masterly inactivity might give Mr Clarke that air of gravitas needed for the successful conduct of monetary policy as well as time to swot up the jargon he will need to carry off his June 15 Mansion House Speech to the City with aplomb. The dossiers dealing with the UK's public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn, equivalent to 8 per cent of national output, will make for less comfortable reading. Here the new chancellor will be urged to plan decisive action. Mr Michael Portillo, the able chief secretary to the Treasury, warned 10 days ago that Britain's primary deficit - that is, the deficit excluding debt interest - is already the highest in the European Community. The choice facing Mr Clarke is to cut this by tax increases or spending reductions. The Treasury will probably urge him to focus on spending cuts, even though scare stories about proposed attacks on the welfare state have done much to unsettle the government over the past month. There is political as well as economic logic behind such a move. Mr Clarke's clear support for spending cuts would make an ally of Mr Portillo and assuage the Tory right wing, which would be hostile to tax increases. It would also win over the Treasury establishment to the new chancellor's side and strengthen the Treasury against the rest of Whitehall.</p>

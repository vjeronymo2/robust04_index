			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US chip maker leads drive for tougher tariffs A DRIVE for legislation to impose import tariffs on Japanese, European and Korean semiconductor chips as well as all electronics products containing such devices sold in the US is being led by Micron Technology, a US memory chip manufacturer. The proposal comes as US chip industry executives gather in Washington to decide their next moves in the long-running US semiconductor trade row with Japan. It reflects growing frustration at lack of progress on removing trade barriers in Europe and South Korea. Long a rebel in the US semiconductor industry, Micron was the first US chipmaker, in the mid-1980s, to file a dumping suit against its Japanese competitors. That proved a catalyst for broader US industry complaints, leading to the first US-Japan semiconductor trade pact in 1986. Last year, key elements of the first accord were renewed, promising foreign chipmakers 20 per cent of the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.3bn) Japanese semiconductor market. Now Micron, the tenth biggest US semiconductor producer with fiscal 1991 sales of Dollars 425m, is again breaking ranks by urging punitive steps against countries that have failed fully to open their markets to US chip products. Micron also alleges dumping by Japanese and South Korean memory chip makers. Mr Joseph Parkinson, Micron chief executive, is leading the call for tough action. In a letter circulated in the US industry, Micron asks executives to contact their congressmen 'in support of a bill proposing an immediate 14 per cent countervailing tariff. 'The tariff is justified against the Japanese on the basis of their failure to comply with the (1991) semiconductor agreement by dumping product, and their failure to provide the agreed 20 per cent market-share access,' Micron's letter says. Europe's enforcement of a 14 per cent tariff on chip imports, and South Korea's tariffs and lack of market access, are cited as reasons for crackthose countries. But Mr Parkinson's proposals are embarrassing the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), which has led the US industry's trade battles for 10 years. He is this year's chairman of the industry group, and as such the industry's official spokesman. Yet his proposal runs contrary to SIA opposition to import tariffs which it sees as a 'protectionist trade barrier'. Since import tariffs would raise chip prices in the US, Mr Parkinson's proposal threatens to undermine the SIA's tentative coalition with US computer makers who provide the US chipmakers with political firepower in Washington. But the SIA will consider Mr Parkinson's proposal, among others, at its board meeting today, Mr Andrew Procassini, SIA president, said. He stressed the SIA 'does not favour measures that would disadvantage its customers in world markets'. The SIA had been expected to raise the spectre of economic sanctions against Japan and issue a strong statement expressing dissatisfaction with the progress to lifting trade barriers in Europe. Faced with Micron's more radical proposal, the SIA may well move faster to seeking US government retaliation against Japan, Europe and Korea. Japan's electronics industry reacted angrily yesterday to a US semiconductor industry report saying a bilateral microchip pact was near failure and raising the prospect of sanctions if market access fails to improve, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'We are making every possible effort,' Mr Tamotsu Harada, a spokesman for the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), said. 'The outlook may be a bit grim right now, but to speak of retaliation is going too far. 'Are they saying it's all right for us to stop trying?'</p>

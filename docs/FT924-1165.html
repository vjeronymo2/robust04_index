			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Letter: Time to consider giving rather than just having a chuckle Sir, I was somewhat dismayed by the article in the Observer column ('Unseated', December 15) relating to the Barbican's donations to Providence Row. While it has a certain amusement value, it trivialises the true situation, which is a tragic one. The Barbican's director, Baroness O'Cathain, is helping Providence Row in a personal capacity, to raise funds for improved facilities currently under construction. Our work is needed now more than ever, as is demonstrated by the numbers we have to turn away, because we are full up and our resources are overstretched. Thanks to the Barbican we can at least provide adequate outdoor clothing to help protect those people who every night have literally nowhere to go. Rather than chuckle over the bizarre items of lost property mentioned by Observer, perhaps your readers might be encouraged to donate funds directly to Providence Row in order that we can complete our new buildings on schedule. Cheryl St Clair, director, Providence Row, 50 Crispin Street, London E1 6HQ</p>

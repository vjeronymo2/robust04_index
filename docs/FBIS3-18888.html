			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "The Twelve Call For UNPROFOR </F> Reinforcements"]    [Text] Brussels, 7 Mar (BELGA) -- European Union (EU)  foreign ministers stressed on Monday evening [7 March] the need  for reinforcements for the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus responding favorably to an appeal by  France.    They also stressed the importance of the more active role  now  played by the United States and Russia in bringing peace to  Bosnia-Herzegovina, while pointing out that the EU cannot allow  itself to be reduced to playing an "inferior role," in the words  of Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, whose country holds  the EU presidency until 30 June.    The Twelve gave their backing to French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe, who had called upon the Twelve and others, notably  the United States, to send UNPROFOR reinforcements to Bosnia.    Mr. Papoulias refused to say, however, if any of them had  indicated their willingness to participate in the effort deemed  necessary. His French colleague indicated that France, which  has the largest contingent of blue helmets in the area, had  "done its duty."    France also called upon its European partners to reintegrate  the Serbs in the peace process. "You cannot make peace between  two in a three-sided conflict," said Mr. Juppe, with reference  to the accord between the Croats and the Muslims on creating a  federation involving these two sides in Bosnia.    He went on to propose a meeting between the Europeans, the  Russians, and the Americans in order to achieve peace.    Mr. Papoulias went no further than to say that the Twelve  "were interested" in the role played by the United States and  Russia in the peace process, but still supported the EU's peace  plan.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Southend Property shows 56% advance Southend Property Holdings yesterday announced profits before tax ahead by 56 per cent, from Pounds 2.38m to Pounds 3.71m, in the year to end-March. The result was struck on turnover down from Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 81.1m, although rental income grew from Pounds 16.6m to Pounds 19.1m. Comparative figures have been restated to reflect a provision of Pounds 743,000 against the amount due from the employee share ownership plan trust, which directors believe should have been made in 1991. Substantial cash resources had been accumulated over the year, the company said: Some Pounds 14.2m was raised from the share issue in connection with the failed offer for Frogmore Estates - the Frogmore shares acquired were subsequently sold at an overall profit. In addition property sales raised Pounds 12.7m and the sale of Hamlet International raised Pounds 10.3m. A recommended final of 2.73p makes an improved total of 4.18p (3.8p). Earnings declined from 5.42p to 2.6p.</p>

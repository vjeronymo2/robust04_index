			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia shows accelerated recovery TOKYO was closed yesterday for the Labour Thanksgiving Day holiday. Attention in the region focused on the accelerated recovery in Australia, and the relative lack of momentum in Hong Kong, writes Our Markets Staff. AUSTRALIA notched up its biggest one-day gain since April 10, aided by heavy bargain-hunting. The All-Ordinaries finished 36.3 higher at 1,446.4. Turnover reached 95.65m shares worth ADollars 234m and a further 16.4m in options were traded. Rises outperformed falls by a margin of seven to three. Brokers said that the market was also aided by option players moving to cover short positions, strong gains in futures and some positive news from the sugar producer and building group, CSR. CSR jumped 16 cents to ADollars 3.63 on a 23 per cent rise in interim profits and the forecast of further growth in the remainder of this year. Its joint partners in a new ADollars 325m cement group, announced on Friday, also made strong gains. Pioneer closed 9 cents nine stronger at ADollars 2.29 and Adelaide Brighton was 5 cents better at ADollars 1.54. SEOUL finished higher in active trade with financial and bank shares in the lead. The composite index closed 15.38 higher at 669.46 as 45.3m shares changed hands against 25.79m in Saturday's half-day session. The government's move to cut interest rates left most financials and banks at their limit highs. Kepco, the electricity generator which is the most heavily weighted share in the market, also hit its daily limit, rising Won1,000 to Won24,300. Foreign investors will be allowed to invest in Kepco from today. NEW ZEALAND saw sharp rises in small rural stocks following the weekend rescue for the Gatt trade talks. But the gains were selective and the NZSE 40 index closed only 10.2 higher at 1,456.79 in turnover of NZDollars 21m which moderate for a Monday. SINGAPORE consolidated and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 5.39 to 1,419.21 in volume of 147.6m shares, up from 138.8m on Friday. A block deal of 40m United Industrial Corporation shares was completed late in the day at 98 Singapore cents. KUALA LUMPUR reflected both bargain-hunting and profit-taking as the composite index closed 1.19 higher at 643.79. Kelang Container made an impressive debut, closing at MDollars 8.40 after a high of MDollars 9 compared with its offer price of MDollars 3.10; it was the most active stock, trading in 20m shares. BANGKOK's property companies registered a good recovery from heavy losses recently, but brokers said that investors had not yet regained their full confidence following the crackdown on share manipulation. The SET index rose 3.35 to 875.07 in moderate turnover of Bt9.14bn. Bangkok Land jumped Bt6 to Bt109, Krisda Mahanakorn Bt3 to Bt134, and Tanayong Bt2.50 to Bt89.50. MANILA slid in light trading but brokers still said that they expected a rally led by oversold commercial issues. The composite index shed 4.06 to 1,299.57. TAIWAN reversed early gains in profit-taking to end slightly lower in moderate trade, the weighted index closing 13.20 lower at 3,698.51 in turnover up from TDollars 7.8bn to TDollars 9.4bn. BOMBAY ended higher with state-owned mutual funds buying up most of the available stocks in the market. The BSE index rose 50.91 to 2,530.47.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Doboj, June 1 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Muslim forces were  attacking Serb positions in the Teslic area, northern Bosnia, on  Monday and Tuesday night, using all weapons available, including  missiles charged with poison gases.    The brunt of the Muslim attack was launched on the southern  part of the Teslic battlefront and on the Kozilo area, which  came under a cannonade of artillery shells charged with poison  gas, Bosnian Serb army sources said on Wednesday.    The Serbs were forced to respond fiercefully [as received]  and neutralize the Muslim shelling in order to protect their  positions and the people of Teslic and the adjacent villages.    Serb forces have prevented two Muslim terrorist actions in  the south-eastern Teslic front.    The Serb army sources said that Muslim forces at about 5  a.m.  (local time) on Wednesday opened heavy anti-aircraft gunfire on  Serb defence positions in Lukici, eight kilometres west of the  Serb town of Brcko, in northern Bosnia.    From the northern Bosnian Croat enclave of Orasje, Bosnian  Croat forces and Croatia's regular troops on Tuesday night  opened strong infantry fire on Serb positions seven kilometres  away from the area, leaving one Serb soldier lightly wounded.</p>

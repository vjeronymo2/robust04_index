			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Program for National Transportation Sources and Federal Activities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The litigation which resulted in today's FIP proposals arose in part from the South Coast's concern that emission regulation of ``federal sources'' such as those associated with interstate transportation or military bases was not keeping pace with controls in other sectors. In order to achieve appropriate emissions reductions in these areas, the FIP proposals include controls for locomotives, airports and aircraft, large marine vessels, and military installations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For locomotives, EPA is relying on a national regulation that will apply to NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions from newly manufactured locomotive engines in two phases, first in 2000, then in 2005. Tighter standards for remanufactured locomotive engines are also being proposed and may be implemented either statewide or nationwide. Because the necessary reductions in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions are so significant in the South Coast, EPA is proposing a supplemental program for railroads in the South Coast FIP. This program would require that railroads reduce their average emission rate of their fleet by 2010 to a level consistent with the reductions proposed for stationary sources. See discussion in section III.D.4.e.(3) and proposed regulation 40 CFR 52.2971. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in section III.D.4.e.(2), EPA is proposing that commercial aviation operations be subject to an environmental performance target in the FIPs, including mobile emissions sources under the direct control of the airline (aircraft, aircraft auxiliary power units, ground service equipment, captive vehicle fleets, and any other airline-operated mobile source). Declining emissions rate targets for these emissions, consistent with the caps proposed for stationary sources, would be set beginning with the ozone season of 2001. This level of allowable emissions would translate into an industry-wide environmental performance factor expressed as an allowable pounds of pollutant per passenger equivalent unit. Airlines which exceed their allowable performance factor would pay a fee based on the amount of excess emissions. In order to provide additional flexibility in meeting these targets, EPA is also proposing intra-airline averaging for airlines with operations at multiple airports within the same FIP area. The Agency is also seeking comment on the establishment of an inter- airline credit and trading program. The proposed regulation is 40 CFR 52.2970. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For general aviation in the FIP areas, EPA is proposing two fee systems in the alternative. One proposal would simply charge a fee for each takeoff sufficient to discourage use without making general aviation prohibitively expensive. The second approach would incorporate an exemption into the fee program for engines that are certified to ``clean'' emissions levels. EPA also requests comment on differentiation of fees based on airport proprietor's programs for other emissions reductions such as refueling vapor recovery and other alternative control programs. See discussion in section III.D.4.e.(2).(d). and proposed regulation at 40 CFR 52.2970. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III.D.4.e.(2).(c). and (5) describes EPA's proposed military installation bubble for each FIP area encompassing all mobile emission sources under the control of the Department of Defense (DOD), with the exception of military aircraft and vessels. This includes auxiliary power units, ground service equipment, captive vehicle fleets, privately owned vehicles, and any other mobile source operated within the boundaries of the installation. A declining emissions cap would apply similar to the cap imposed on stationary sources within each FIP area. Each installation would be required to determine a baseline inventory from which the reductions will be achieved. The proposed regulation, 40 CFR 52.2972, allows trading among active bases and credit for base closures that generate permanent emission reductions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marine vessels are the largest uncontrolled source of emissions of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and sulfur oxides in California. In order to encourage emissions reductions from these vessels in a manner consistent with existing international standards, EPA is proposing a flexible control strategy for the reduction of emissions from ships in port. Specifically, a user fee would be based on the type emission control that a particular ship used. Ship operators would be allowed (and encouraged) to reduce the fees which would be applied by using low emission engines, using electrical onshore power service instead of the ship's engines while in port, and for travelling outside of the Channel Islands. Compliance with all three operational changes would eliminate the fees altogether. Ships that use South Coast ports more frequently would be faced with higher annual fees, and therefore would have a greater incentive to make operational changes and install more efficient emission control devices to reduce or avoid fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Ventura there are no large ports, but marine vessel emissions are still large contributors to the area's NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  inventory, because of the emissions that are blown onshore from passing ships by the prevailing winds. As mentioned above, the South Coast FIP includes a discount in the proposed fee system to encourage ships to move further out to sea when passing the Ventura coastline. See discussion of marine vessels and ports in section III.D.4.e.(4). and proposed regulation 40 CFR 52.2973. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Programs to Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described earlier, vehicle emissions continue to be a large portion of future total VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions inventory, despite increasingly stringent emission standards, because of projections of continued high growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Due to current growth projections, EPA is proposing programs designed to decrease growth in VMT by targeting single occupant vehicle use. The proposed regulations require increases in average occupancy in personal vehicles in Sacramento (for the 1999 attainment option only) and encourage shifts to carpooling and public modes of transportation in all the FIP areas. Various other strategies could be used to achieve decreases in VMT, but most depend on local planning and implementation to be successful. Unfortunately, EPA resources and statutory authority have constrained our ability to propose these possibly more effective strategies. These constraints are discussed generally in section III.A.2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The committee also based its decision on certain production and market factors. The last three crop years were the first crop years that limited use olives were authorized at sizes below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year minimum size requirements. Prior to the 1990&hyph;91 crop year, the committee investigated limited use olives that were below permitted minimum sizes. From investigations and surveys within the industry, the committee determined that limited use olives below 1990&hyph;91 minimum sizes could be efficiently sliced using current technology. However, consumer interest in and need for such olives also had to be determined, specifically for smaller sliced olive rings. Thus, minimum size requirements below the 1990&hyph;91 crop year were recommended and became effective for limited use olives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the following three seasons, the industry experienced a higher percentage of broken pieces in the smaller olives than with the slightly larger sizes. The U.S. Standards for Grades of Canned Ripe Olives (Standards) define a broken piece as any piece of olive that is less than three quarters of a full unit. This situation had a negative impact on the California olive market as the extra broken pieces caused customers to complain about the lack of uniformity and poorer quality of product from these smaller sizes. Such olives also had to compete with imported sliced olives that had fewer broken pieces. Therefore, the committee recommended slightly larger minimum size requirements for limited use olives in order to improve the quality of and enhance the market for California limited use olives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the committee estimates that production for this crop year is expected to be at 95,000 tons, which is smaller than the previous two seasons. Weather conditions early in the crop year caused poor pollination resulting in a smaller crop with an uneven distribution of sizes. The 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94 crop years produced large crops of 163,023 tons and 120,049 tons, respectively. During years with large olive crops, the ratio of limited use olives to other sizes tends to be higher; there are more limited use size olives in proportion to the other sizes. During years with small olive crops, the ratio of smaller olives to other sizes is smaller; there tends to be fewer limited use size olives in proportion to the other sizes. The increased availability of limited use sized fruit could be reflected in handler processing for the last three seasons. For example, during the 1992&hyph;93 crop year, 19 percent of the olives (163,024 tons) processed by handlers were limited use, and during the 1991&hyph;92 crop year, 11 percent of total olives (63,259 tons) processed by handlers were limited use. Although limited use minimum sizes were larger during the 1990&hyph;91 season, limited use olives processed by handlers were 16 percent of total olives (126,879 tons) purchased by handlers. Thus, unlike the two previous seasons, fewer small limited use olives are expected to be harvested this season. The percentage of limited use olives is expected to be smaller. The slight increase in minimum limited use size requirements being established for the 1994&hyph;95 season is therefore not expected to greatly impact available supplies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, it is found that permitting limited use olives as recommended by the committee is expected to improve market conditions, and grower returns, and meet market needs for limited use style olives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 8(e) of the Act requires that whenever grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements are in effect for olives under a domestic marketing order, imported olives must meet the same or comparable requirements. This action allows smaller olives for limited use styles under the marketing order. Therefore, a corresponding change is needed in the olive import regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canned ripe olives, and bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives, imported into the United States must meet certain minimum grade and size requirements specified in Olive Regulation 1 (7 CFR 944.401). All canned ripe olives are required to be inspected and certified prior to importation (release from custody of the United States Custom Service), and all bulk olives for processing into canned ripe olives must be inspected and certified prior to canning. ``Canned ripe olives'' means olives in hermetically sealed containers and heat sterilized under pressure, of two distinct types, ``ripe'' and ``green-ripe'', as defined in the Standards. The term does not include Spanish-style green olives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any lot of olives failing to meet the import requirements may be exported, disposed of, or shipped for exempt uses. Exportation or disposal of such olives would be accomplished under the supervision of the Processed Products Branch of the Fruit and Vegetable Division, with the costs of certifying the disposal of the olives borne by the importer. Exempt olives are those imported for processing into oil or donation to charity. Any person may also import up to 100 pounds (drained weight) of canned ripe olives or bulk olives exempt from these grade and size requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule finalizes an interim final rule that modified paragraph (b)(12) of the olive import regulation to authorize the importation of bulk olives which do not meet the minimum size requirements established for olives for whole and whole pitted uses to be used in the production of limited use styles during the 1994&hyph;1995 crop year. This rule also finalizes establishment of size regulations for such olives in paragraph (b)(12). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

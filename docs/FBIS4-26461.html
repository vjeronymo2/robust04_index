			<p>BFN     [Text] Lanzhou, June 22 (XINHUA) -- More than 1,700  multi-functional markets have been built in northwest China's  Gansu Province, attracting both domestic and overseas business  people.    The state reform and opening-up policy has been an eye  opener  for this remote province.    For this inland province, the construction of the markets  has  promoted exchanges and circulation of commodities between Gansu  and other parts of China.    Lanzhou, capital of the province, is now the biggest  wholesale and commodity distribution center in northwest China,  especially in garments, daily-use articles, manufactured goods  and cloth materials.    The Lanzhou Guanghui cloth material wholesale market is now  one of the six biggest of its kind in China.    Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture is one the biggest  wholesale  centers of leather, wool, timber and tea in the northwest.    With rich resources of nonferrous minerals and petrochemical  products, the northwest petrochemical market in Lanzhou is now  the biggest in China.    The brisk markets have also helped farmers to gauge the real  value of their products such as apples, pears, dates and some  precious Chinese medicinal herbs which sell well on the domestic  market.    Farmers in Gangu county have founded their own grain, edible  oil, timber and garment markets.    Increasing numbers of farmers have engaged in business and  transportation. They have become more and more aware of the  importance of market information in production.</p>

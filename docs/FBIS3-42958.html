			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Appeal by Association of Democratic Soviets of People's </F> Deputies of Ukraine and the Democratic Blocs in the Soviets:  "`The Absence of Self-Government is the Cause of the  Regionalization of Ukraine'"]    [Text] To the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine, the  President of Ukraine, the candidates and deputies of the Supreme  Soviet of Ukraine and the local soviets of Ukraine at all  levels:    The development of events of late has confirmed that the  attempts to replace the Moscow center with a Kiev one, with the  preservation of an extremely centralized system of  administration, is leading to the further regionalization of  Ukraine. The tendency of the center to build a new Ukrainian  state in the old imperial skin without regard for local  initiatives, to unify the power structure and other aspects of  local life by any means, the mistrust of the center of the  inquiries of the localities, the disregard for their specific  features and the attempts to make use of their specific features  as effectively as possible for the benefit of the state and  people are leading to the transformation of regional crises into  nationwide ones.    Owing to the socio-political confrontation of the center and  the Crimea, the latter has received de facto statehood status,  although they were only after economic independence at first.  Owing to the series of conflicts of the Donetsk region with the  center, the idea of the Donetsk--Krivyy Rih republic of 1918 is  actually being revived, although in 1991 the Donetsk inhabitants  made proposals only for the settlement of budgetary issues with  the center. The center, as we see, does not promote proposals  for the institution of true--that is, economically  supported--local self-government, foments conflicts through its  delays, and then retreats considerably further than it needed to  when the problem was raised. These actions clearly indicate that  the efforts of the center are leading to such socio-political  tension that the situation is being qualitatively changed;  centrifugal tendencies are being born instead of demands for  self-government, and when the center is forced to retreat, the  centrifugal consequences surpass the initial expectations.  Proceeding from that logic, it is not difficult to predict the  development of events when the problems that the local areas put  before the center are resolved. Thet are the creation of the  Transcarpathian and Odessa free economic zones, the adoption of  laws on the capital of Ukraine and on megalopolis-cities. The  local areas have already learned ways of solving their own  problems based on the example of Crimea and Donetsk.    The delays of the center in reforming the decorative system  of Soviets have given birth to the idea of the regionalization  of Ukraine and attempts at their constitutional consolidation.  The center is facing an artificial dilemma--either consolidate  the state, which is simplistically understood first of all as  the creation of a rigid executive vertical system, or a forced  democratization, which in the given context takes on the form of  a decentralization of power. The apprehensions of the forces of  statehood naturally make some sense. Decentralization by  regions, it is true, poses a certain threat to the conciliarity  of the state, since the territories will gravitate toward  statehood status.    The possibility exists, in our opinion, of combining both  urgent tasks--the consolidation of the state and the  democratization (decentralization) of power. It consists of the  introduction of strong self-government at the level of the  cities and populated areas, and not territorial (regional)  self-government. It is namely in these populated areas that the  people live, and not in the oblast-regions, which arose not out  of the demands of people, but rather out of the demands for  convenience of the leadership and the solution of questions of a  more integral, half-state nature. The self-government of cities  carries no danger to unity, since the cities are very integrated  into the adjoining territories and cannot themselves be entities  of statehood. We have historical experience, where the cities  were granted the right of self-government in the battle with  local feudal kings (medieval city self-government--the  "Madgeburg right"). The self-government of cities was a powerful  counterweight to the tendency of the feudal lords to secede from  the state. Bringing the power closer to the people also shows  more clearly the local economic capabilities, eliminates the  consumerist "give!" from the local areas to the center and  develops their initiative--that is, fosters local energy to find  and realize ways of raising the well-being of their inhabitants.  We also have the foreign experience of the existence and  prosperity of the modern economic giants--the United States and  the FRG--where local self-government is an instrument for the  strengthening of the state, and not its fragmentation. Every  city in the United States has its own statute or charter; the  state defines by constitution the general principles for its  existence and the rights of citizens, and through laws provides  conditions for real self-government, first of all through  budgetary and tax policy. Each city, proceeding from the general  provisions of the constitution, creates its own system of power  that is effective for that city, and codifies it by means of the  aforementioned statute or charter. Local power, structured in an  identical form for all and thrust upon the cities by the  Ukrainian center, is ineffective in any city.    The association, back during the disputes surrounding the  Law  "The Representative of the President," appealed to the Supreme  Soviet to proceed in nation-building not by strengthening  executive power alone, with an unbalanced rise in the role of  judicial authority and monitoring on the part of the people of  the actions of executive power through the representative  bodies--the Soviets--elected by them, but also by means of  bringing self-government closer to world standards as codified  in the Universal Declaration and European Charter on  self-government.    The current economic and political crisis has shown that the  center is not handling the tasks of economic and power reform in  Ukraine, and has to transfer some of the power to the local  areas, first of all the cities--that is, temporarily introduce  local self-government--by shifting to the local areas both  authority and responsibility for the state of the economy and  the well-being of the inhabitants. If the authorities are unable  to provide for the people, they are obligated to give them the  opportunity of providing for themselves--that is, give them  freedom. And then the task of the state consists only of the  creation of conditions for the everyday activity of people and  their security, and in the protection of the socially weak.    Adopted by the assemblies of the Association of Democratic  Soviets of Ukraine and the democratic blocs of the Soviets.    By authority of the assemblies, deputy chairman of the  coordinating council of the Association and deputy of the Kiev  Soviet Valeriy Rubtsov    13 January 1994, City of Slavsk</p>

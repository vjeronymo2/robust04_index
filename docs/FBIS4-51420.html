			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 26 (CNA) -- Foreign Affairs Minister  Chien Fu on Thursday [26 May] denied rumors that the Republic of  China [ROC] has agreed to extend a U.S.$200 million loan to  South Africa as part of Taipei's efforts to help shore up  endangered bilateral ties.    Chien, replying to an interpellation by Democratic  Progressive Party legislator Parris Chang, said the government  had foreseen as long as three and a half years ago that drastic  political changes would occur in South Africa, even though  bilateral ties with the white-ruled government at that time were  solid.    "We indeed had promised a U.S.$60 million loan to help South  Africa finance a farming development project during F.W. De  Klerk's tenure as the president, but the loan has not yet been  given," Chien said.    The loan proposal was raised again when President Li  Teng-hui  visited South Africa to attend Nelson Mandela's presidential  inauguration on May 10, Chien said, adding that both countries  may re-start negotiations on the loan.    Chien emphasized that Li had not offered any new loans to  South Africa during his visit, but did agree to help South  Africa implement a vocational-training project. "South Africa  will send people here to see for themselves how job-training  projects are implemented," Chien said.    He added that the ROC has agreed to share with South Africa  its successful experience in helping military personnel  assimilate into society after retirement.    Many legislators here are against any new economic aid to  South Africa on grounds that the Nelson Mandela-led African  National Congress, which now rules the new government, has  maintained close ties with Beijing for many years, and may  eventually shift diplomatic recognition away from Taipei.    On the contrary, though, Li's visit, previously perceived as  a last-ditch effort by Taiwan to salvage its relationship with  South Africa, seems to have paid off handsomely. A confident  Li, shortly after a meeting with Mandela, told a group of  Chinese and representatives of Taiwan-owned companies in South  Africa on May 11 that the bilateral ties between the two  countries are strong and steady.    South Africa is the largest country of the 29 with which the  ROC maintains official diplomatic ties.</p>

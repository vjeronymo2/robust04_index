			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Brief Local News" column] </F>   [Text] Designated Foreign Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo,  who leaves the country on a 15-day vacation today, revealed  yesterday that Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez will meet  with Panamanian President-Elect Ernesto Perez Balladares in  Madrid, Spain, on 10 July, when the latter starts an official  four-day visit in that country.    The possibility of Spanish investments in Panama, support  for  the tourism program to be implemented by the new Panamanian  Government, and other economic and social issues are part of the  agenda to be discussed by Perez Balladares and Gonzalez, Lewis  Galindo reported. He also said the banana issue will not be  absent even though it is well-known that this is a very complex  problem and could never be resolved during this trip.    "The main purpose of this visit to Spain is to look for a  rapprochement with Panama's traditional friends, such as the  Spaniards and especially their president, Felipe Gonzalez,"  Lewis Galindo stated.    The designated foreign minister, however, did not reject the  possibility that the Democratic Revolutionary Party will make  efforts to be reinstated into the Socialist International [SI],  an organization of political parties with a great deal of  prestige. Felipe Gonzalez is one of the SI's most important  leaders.    He added that President Perez Balladares will be accompanied  by designated Planning Minister Guillermo Chapman, designated  Presidency Minister Raul Arango, designated State Security  Minister Jose Luis Sosa, former President Aristides Royo, and  Mario Velasquez, the president-elect's spokesman.</p>

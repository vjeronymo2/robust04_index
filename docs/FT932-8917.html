			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Bosnian Serb voters set to reject peace plan Bosnian Serb soldiers queueing up to vote yesterday in the Bosnian Serb referendum on the Vance-Owen peace plan, near the northern Bosnian town of Brcko, the scene of fierce fighting between Serb and Moslem forces over the weekend. An overwhelming No vote is expected on the UN-backed peace plan which Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic declared was dead. General Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb army commander, threatened bomb attacks in London and Washington if the west tried to intervene to force Serbs to accept it. Meanwhile, Russia suggested the peace plan should be implemented regardless of the outcome of the referendum. In Mostar, south-western Bosnia, Croat forces launched a fierce assault with missiles and artillery on Moslem positions. Peace plan, Page 3; Serb mayor, Page 14</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAREER-TYPE FASHIONS;  </P> <P> SLIGHT CLOTHESTIME PROFIT FOLLOWS MARKETING SHIFT  </P> <P> Clothestime, an Anaheim-based retailer that underwent a major transformation to  win back a market for its discount fashions, reported a slim profit of $82,000  for its fiscal 1989 first quarter, which ended April 30.  </P> <P> The profit contrasts with a loss of $819,000 in the year-earlier period.  Revenue for the quarter increased 9% to $41.2 million, compared to $37.8  million.  </P> <P> Analysts said the earnings indicate that a major change in Clothestime's  marketing strategy may be proving successful. For years a success at selling  fashions to 14- to 25-year-olds, Clothestime began to suffer as the size of  that market declined in recent years. For fiscal 1988, the company recorded a  loss of $2.2 million.  </P> <P> Last summer, Clothestime, which operates 329 stores in 15 states, began  stocking higher-quality, career-type apparel, and hired a new ad agency to  bring women in their 30s into the stores.  </P> <P> The company has reported sales gains in recent months, and for April,  same-store sales increased by 38.5%.  </P> <P> "The turnaround is still in its early phase, but this management has shown it  can excel," said Thomas Tashjian, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Investors apparently anticipated positive earnings news after reports from the  company that store sales were up this spring. Within the last 2 weeks, the  value of Clothestime stock has increased 40%. Friday, the stock closed at  $10.25, up 87.5 cents in trading of 464,400 shares. The stock traded for less  than $5 earlier this year.  </P></p>

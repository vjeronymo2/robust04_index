			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By trainee Li Fujie (2621 1133 2638) and reporter Wang </F> Fuliang (3769 4395 0081): "The Three Types of Foreign-Funded  Enterprises Must Not Infringe on the Legal Rights and Interests  of Staff Members and Workers"]    [Text] The three types of foreign-funded enterprises have  developed rapidly in Shandong over the past few years.  According to statistics, Shandong's three types of  foreign-funded enterprises had totaled 14,000 by the end of June  this year, instilling new vigor into Shandong's economy and  becoming the choice of more and more job seekers thanks to their  special charm. As has been shown in the survey conducted by  pertinent departments, however, many of the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises, especially the enterprises  exclusively funded by foreign firms and the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises located in towns and townships, have  infringed on the legal rights and interests of their staff  members and workers to a rather serious extent. For this  reason, people say that the three types of foreign-funded  enterprises are no longer the "paradise" of the choice of job  seekers.    --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises do not sign  labor contracts with their staff members and workers. The  survey of labor departments showed that about 70 to 80 percent  of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises did not sign  labor contracts with their staff members and workers, so that  they could dismiss staff members and workers any time they  wanted. Once disputes occurred, labor arbitration departments  also had difficulty in handling them, making it difficult to  duly protect the legal rights and interests of staff members and  workers.    --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises adopt  various  means to embezzle the wages of staff members of workers and  default payment. The three types of foreign-funded enterprises  were once a favorite among job seekers due to their excellent  pay. Many such enterprises, however, no longer offer "higher  pay." According to relevant state stipulations, the basic wages  of staff members and workers of the three types of  foreign-funded enterprises should be at least 20 percent higher  than that of the state-owned enterprises of the same trades in  the same localities. "Doing one thing under the cover of  another," however, some three types of foreign-funded  enterprises included numerous subsidies of enterprises with  basic wages and compared it with basic wages of other  enterprises. In appearance, the basic wage of these three types  of foreign-funded enterprises was higher, but the actual income  of their staff members and workers was much lower. Some  enterprises even defied state stipulations to withhold overtime  pay.    --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises are wanton  in  their administration and meting out of physical punishment to  workers. The bosses of some enterprises scolded or beat staff  members and workers at every turn and ordered those who had  violated plant regulations to face the wall or run around the  plants as punishment.    --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises provide poor  labor protection. According to the survey of the labor  department of a certain city, 33 percent of the local three  types of foreign-funded enterprises developed production in a  very poor environment, 95 percent of them lacked necessary labor  protection facilities, and one recorded lead poisoning levels  dozens of times higher than the standard in their workshops. At  some enterprises, the overtime hours of their staff members and  workers exceeded the state-stipulated amount by over 100 hours.  A joint venture in a certain city even asked pregnant workers  and workers at nursing period to work overtime or regarded them  as being absent without leave and dealt with them accordingly if  they refused.    --The three types of foreign-funded enterprises adopt harsh  terms in labor management. The rules and regulations of many of  the three types of foreign-funded enterprises go against China's  labor laws and regulations. For example, some enterprises  dismissed their workers for absence without leave for even a  single day or banned their workers from going to restroom during  work hours.    In view of the infringement on the legal rights and  interests  of staff members and workers by some three types of  foreign-funded enterprises, responsible persons of the  provincial labor department called for accelerating legislation  so that there will be laws to abide by in labor protection.  They also called for improving the trade unions of the three  types of foreign-funded enterprises so that staff members and  workers will have a place to turn to when they have something to  say. Meanwhile, they also urged the staff members and workers  of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises to enhance  awareness of laws to protect their own legal rights and  interests.</p>

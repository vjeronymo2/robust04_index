			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Letter: An odd tax system to encourage investment Sir, A lot of hot air has been spoken in the last week on the subject of capital allowances and corporation tax. Norman Lamont suggested during his Budget speech that the present UK corporation tax does not act as a drag on investment. Would that this were so, but unfortunately all the research of which I am aware indicates that this tax does discourage economically viable investments. The reason is not hard to find. For investment financed by borrowing, companies can deduct the approximate costs of both depreciation and finance through capital allowances and interest deductibility, so that the tax is approximately neutral. For investment financed from retained profits, they can claim only capital allowances. The lack of any deduction for the cost of using equity finance comparable to interest deductibility in the case of debt means that equity-financed investment is discouraged. Since about three quarters of total company investment is financed from retentions, corporation tax certainly acts as a drag on investment. Estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest that this drag could be the equivalent of an extra two percentage points on interest rates for investing companies. Add to this the discouragement that business rates impose on business investment in buildings and the combined effect begins to look serious. The Labour party's response is a curious melange. Its 'shadow' Budget proposal gives, for a temporary period only, a small subsidy to investment in manufacturing plant and machinery. This form of investment accounts for only one-fifth of total company investment in the UK, so the remaining four-fifths would be unaffected. Just why manufacturing investment in plant and machinery should temporarily be singled out for special treatment is hard to fathom. While this would achieve a modest and short-lived stimulus to this form of investment, it looks like a very odd way to run a tax system. Stephen R Bond, Nuffield College, Oxford OX1 1NF</p>

At the meeting, Aichi touched on  the issue of the defense budget for fiscal 1994 and demanded  that expenses be approved as requested in the roughly estimated  budget demand. Director General Aichi said: "The roughly  estimated budget demand calls for a 1.95 percent increase  compared to the DA budget for fiscal 1993. However, we can keep  it down to about a 1.6 percent increase if we look closely into  the contents, including the foreign exchange rate. I hope it  will not be trimmed more than that because further reduction  will affect training and other matters."    Moreover, Ko Nakai, deputy secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party, also met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on the  same day at the prime minister's official residence. Nakai  handed over a request, which calls for the approval of the 1994  DA budget's full amount while giving considerations to defense  industries, to the prime minister.</p>

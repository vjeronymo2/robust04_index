			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: National Grid float now expected in May or June Mr Bryan Townsend, chief executive of Midlands Electricity, said yesterday he did not expect an announcement on the flotation of the National Grid until after mid-January. Mr Townsend, speaking at his company's interim results, said he expected a Grid flotation in the late spring. 'Provided everything works out all right, we expect to float in May or June,' he said. Mr Townsend, who is leading negotiations with the government over the treatment of proceeds from the demerger, said discussions were 'on track'. There were tax issues to be resolved, as well as the benefits to customers and shareholders. Last week, the government, which owns a golden share in the Grid, said it would appoint financial advisers for the flotation. Mr Townsend said speculation that flotation would put a value of Pounds 5bn on the Grid was 'way over the top'. Meanwhile, Midlands' shares slipped 15p to 765p, in spite of a 14 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits and a 22 per cent rise in the dividend. The market was disappointed by the dividend increase, although profits were at the top end of expectations. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 89.5m to Pounds 102.4m for the half-year to September 30, on sales down from Pounds 625.5m to Pounds 621.6m. The restructuring of the core business announced in September was progressing well. Midlands expected 500 of the targeted 1,200 job losses to be completed by the end of the year. During the first half, before restructuring benefits, costs had fallen by 3.9 per cent. A strong distribution performance and higher interest gains helped improve profits. The operating return from distribution rose 15 per cent to Pounds 76.1m, owing to strong unit growth and cost control. Industrial and commercial demand showed a 3 per cent increase. Supply profits were steady at Pounds 17.5m, in spite of tougher price controls. Earnings were 4p higher at 34.1p and the dividend rises from 7.65p to 9.3p. COMMENT Excluding the effects of the Pounds 154.5m share buy-back in October, the underlying increase in the dividend was a disappointing 10 per cent. However, the market should have realised Midlands would find it politically difficult to unveil a bigger increase. Once the talks are out of the way, however, Midlands has substantial scope to push dividend growth. A strong balance sheet and high dividend cover give it plenty of room for manoeuvre. Forecasts are for profits of Pounds 210m and a dividend of 28.3p. On this basis, Midlands' yield is 4.6 per cent, a slight premium to the sector. Midlands' attraction lies in its potential to improve this position even further.</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS FAILED TO PURSUE AUDIENCE FOR BASEBALL  </P> <P> The story, "CBS Expects Its First Loss in Decades" (Nov. 20), overlooks a  factor contributing to the network's baseball-related financial woes: It has  clearly demonstrated only a half-hearted commitment to the sport, thereby  discouraging regular viewers.  </P> <P> During the season, CBS sporadically aired only a handful of games.  </P> <P> After shelling out more than $1 billion for the right to broadcast baseball,  one would think that the network would aggressively pursue a steady audience --  or, at the very least, formulate a set broadcast schedule.  </P> <P> Further evidence that the network is not serious about building baseball  viewership is its decision to air one of the playoff games on a Monday  afternoon rather than pursue prime-time competition with "Monday Night  Football." Thanks to CBS, baseball fans have now learned that the "hidden ball  trick" is not just for infielders.  </P> <P> The first year of the contract between CBS and Major League Baseball has been a  fiasco for the network, the fans and the game. As a lifelong baseball fan, I  hope that in the next round of negotiations for the broadcast rights to  baseball, Major League Baseball will consider factors about its suitors other  than the size of their bids.  </P> <P> NEAL MCGARITY  </P> <P> Burtonsville, Md.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> CITY HALL PACT REAFFIRMED  </P> <P> The Culver City Redevelopment Agency on Monday reaffirmed its authorization of  a $1.7-million contract with CHCG Architects Inc. to design the new City Hall.  </P> <P> The 3-2 approval, with Councilmen Steven Gourley and Jim Boulgarides  dissenting, was given despite a finding by the architectural consulting firm  Karsten/Hutman Margolf that CHCG severely underestimated the cost of retaining  the old City Hall facade to serve as a historical monument.  </P> <P> CHCG estimated saving the facade would cost $150,000, while the consulting firm  calculated it would take $800,000 to $1.25 million because of the difficulty of  keeping the unreinforced masonry wall in place during demolition.  </P> <P> The conceptual design called for the facade to be kept in place at the corner  of Culver Boulevard and Duquesne Avenue as an entry monument to the park-like  grounds of the new City Hall.  </P> <P> The consulting firm, which gave CHCG an overall favorable review, also  disagreed with the $1.7-million limit on the redevelopment agency's contract  for the design. Karsten/Hutman Margolf estimated that the agency should limit  the contract to $1.4 million. Agreeing with the consultant, Gourley and  Boulgarides voted against approval.  </P> <P> The agency did not make a formal decision on whether the design should include  the old City Hall facade or a replica, but directed CHCG to explore options to  exclude it.  </P></p>

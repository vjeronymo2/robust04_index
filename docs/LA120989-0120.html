			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL APPROVES CONSTRUCTION PLANS  </P> <P> Despite dozens of letters opposing the relocation of the Newport Pier's public  restrooms, the City Council has approved plans to construct new restrooms and  remodel the lifeguard headquarters.  </P> <P> Opponents of the construction, scheduled to begin within a month, fear that  relocating the restrooms from one side of the pier to the other will block the  views of houses and businesses.  </P> <P> The construction is the first step in an $8-million project to upgrade Cannery  Village and McFadden Plaza, according to City Manager Robert L. Wynn. Residents  on the east side of the pier generally oppose relocating the restrooms to their  side, while those on the west, where the restrooms now stand, endorse it, Wynn  said.  </P> <P> But, Wynn said, "there will be a minimal impact on any of the views."  </P> <P> Plans for the lifeguard headquarters include adding 926 square feet of space,  constructing a ramp for the handicapped and remodeling the floor.  </P> <P> The entire project is estimated to cost $870,671.

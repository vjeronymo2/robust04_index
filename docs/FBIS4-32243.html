			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "Powerful President; </F> Constitution According to Belvedere, Senate, and KPN"]    [Text] A merry-go-round of constitutional drafts has  been set in motion in the Sejm. Sejm deputies and senators of  the Constitutional Commission familiarized themselves yesterday  with three of the six constitutional drafts.    Today the commission will debate the remaining three drafts:  a joint draft coming from the Polish Peasant Party and the  Union of Labor, one from the Democratic Left Alliance, and one  introduced by the Freedom Union.  <H5>  Belvedere Draft </H5>   Lech Walesa wants a strong presidency -- the president would  be able to dissolve the Sejm at almost any time. He would only  not be able to do so if the Sejm were less than one year old  (unless during that time, the Sejm deputies fail to adopt a  budget) or within six months of the end of the presidential term.    The president would be entitled to issue decrees, but only  with consent from the Sejm. In case parliament is dissolved,  the president would be able to issue decrees as he pleases.    The president would lead the government, he would appoint  and  dismiss the prime minister, and he would appoint and dismiss  ministers on the prime minister's motion. The Sejm would not be  empowered to do a lot regarding the government's composition --  all it would be able to do is hold a confidence vote in the  government.    The president would be commander in chief of the Armed  Forces; among other posts, he would appoint the chief of the  General Staff. He would also "supervise" the Foreign Affairs  Ministry and the Internal Affairs Ministry. The president is  full of energy but he is not empowered to do much -- argued Lech  Falandysz, a minister at the Belvedere.  <H5>  Draft of Senate and KPN </H5>   These drafts also provide that it would be the president who  would be playing a decisive role in appointing the prime  minister, whom members of the Confederation for an Independent  Poland [KPN] call a chancellor [kanclerz]. Both drafts endow  the president with the right to issue decrees.    According to Alicja Grzeskowiak of the Center Accord, the  Senate draft refers to a "coherent system of values based on  Christianity." The draft begins with the words: "In the name of  God Almighty," it envisions a Concordat with the Vatican, it  guarantees the right to life from the moment of conception,  religious lessons in schools ("every legally recognized religion  may be the subject of school teaching"), and it prohibits the  death penalty.    The KPN draft creates privileges for the Roman Catholic  Church: "The Roman Catholic religion, being the religion of an  overwhelming majority of the nation, occupies a leading position  among religions having equal rights in the Republic of Poland."    KPN members want Sejm terms to be numbered, beginning with  the general Sejm session held in Piotrkow in 1493. Sejm  deputies and senators would not be allowed to read their  speeches from notes, but they would be entitled to free travel  on public transportation.    All presidential candidates born after 1990 would have to  have higher education, while candidates for Sejm deputies,  mayors of towns and cities, and chief officers of groups of  villages would have to have at least a high school diploma.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Major pledges to ratify EC union treaty MR JOHN MAJOR last night offered his European partners an unequivocal commitment to ratify the Maastricht treaty in spite of the mounting opposition in his own party. As the prime minister held a series of bilateral discussions with other European leaders on the eve of today's Birmingham summit, British officials voiced confidence that the meeting would end with a clear statement of intent on the future direction of the Community. However, they cautioned against expectations of any 'breakthrough' to end the near-paralysis in the EC caused by the Danish rejection of the treaty. Mr Major, who will chair the meeting, is looking for a clear pledge on subsidiarity to help damp opposition in the Tory party ahead of the Commons debate on Maastricht, paving the way for ratification at the end of the year or early next year. Support emerged for Mr Major from both Bonn and Brussels last night. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said: 'I recognise that the political situation in Britain is very difficult. One of the objects of this (summit) is to help Mr Major and the British government.' German officials said that Bonn wanted the summit, above all, to be a success for Mr Major, to strengthen his domestic political position and give 'a signal of confidence' to the rest of the EC. Britain and Germany appeared to have patched up their quarrel over recent currency turmoil and German interest rates. After two and a half hours of talks between Mr Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a UK spokesman said there was no problem with the German government over sterling's withdrawal from the European exchange rate mechanism. 'I think the relationship with the German government is very good. The problems with the Bundesbank are history,' the spokesman said. During dinner, Mr Kohl reassured Mr Major that there was no question in his mind of a 'two- or three-speed Europe.' The Community must move ahead as 12, Mr Kohl said, according to the British spokesman. A draft declaration presented by the British presidency to other governments said the 12 should combine reaffirmation of the Maastricht treaty with a series of pledges to decentralise decision-making, to inject greater openness into the Community's institutions and to offer reassurance that European union will not threaten national identities. However, fundamental disagreements remaining about the precise application of the principle of decentralisation or 'subsidiarity' mean that the Birmingham declaration will do little more than commit the leaders to more detailed decisions at the Edinburgh summit in December.

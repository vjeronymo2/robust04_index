			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Sport: Students at the feet of the masters - Soccer / Angus Foster watches a familiar scene with an unexpected twist On a dust-red football pitch an hour from Brazil's largest city, Sao Paulo, the daily training regime begins promptly at 10am. It follows a familiar pattern of running, passing and ball control practice. This is a scene played out thousands of times throughout the country of the World Cup winners. It is a scene that would barely catch the attention of a passing villager, tempted to break the monotony of the day. But this is no ordinary practice session, and certainly no ordinary team. The trainer's barked orders induce uncomfortable giggles among local children who have come to watch. The players, all teenagers, have the same taut and agile bodies of Brazilian footballers. But their faces are very different. Jin Zhengmin, manager of the Chinese National Youth Football Team, steps forward to explain why he, two trainers, a teacher and China's 22 most promising young footballers are living on the other side of the world in Brazil. 'We are preparing for the 2000 Olympics. These players will return to China in five years. We have other programmes under way in China, but we hope these players will be the best,' said Jin, who played for his country in the 1960s and was a big fan of Bobby Charlton. China is a newcomer to the footballing tradition. The game only recently became popular through television and the 1986 and 1990 World Cups. In some regions the former England captain Gary Lineker overtook Margaret Thatcher as the most famous Briton. Impressed by this growing popularity, and football's suitability as a cheap team sport for developing countries, bureaucrats in Beijing agreed the country's football infrastructure needed an overhaul. China was making a concerted push to enter the top levels of international sport, a campaign which led to outstanding results - as well as accusations of foul play - in swimming and athletics. Two years ago, when China was still favourite to host the 2000 Olympics ahead of Sydney, a nationwide championship was held to select the country's 60 most promising footballers. Following further trials in Beijing, the best prospects, aged between 14 and 17, were sent to Brazil to spend five years learning the game. They arrived last November and the team is playing in championships and cups around the country and may soon hire a Brazilian coach. Jin also hopes that his most promising players will join local clubs, although Brazil's rules on employing foreigners are tight. According to Li Fei, one of the squad's two trainers and a former professional player in Germany, China still has much to do before its football reaches international standards. 'Compared to other countries, these boys' level is poor. But for China, it is very high,' he said. China supports the programme but all finance has been provided by a drink company from China's southern province of Guangdong. Brazil seems an odd place to send China's sporting prodigies. The country's football is unquestionably often brilliant. Yet it is equally often erratic, and stresses an individualism which would shock many a Chinese mandarin. Jin, a likeable, earnest man, explains: 'The Brazilian physique is the same as the Chinese, both strong and agile but slight. This is better for our young people who have difficulty playing against young Europeans, who are bigger.' The young Chinese are quickly adopting Brazilian habits. One training exercise involved practising the back flick perfected by the retired star Socrates. At the end of the session, the players huddled arm in arm singing a football song learned from Sao Paulo football club, and shouting 'China' in Portuguese. The squad's indoor training school, a wooden barn, was transformed into a party hall for the Carnival celebrations. According to Jin, the squad is employing a Brazilian to teach it to dance the samba. Some of the players say they miss Chinese food, but Jin is adamant. 'Brazil's food is better for football training because of the high meat and carbohydrate content,' he said. Asian habits rule when it comes to punishment. Culprits run between two lines of players and receive violent slaps on the back from everyone. Following a two-hour session, the boys return to their training camp in a bus hired from the local municipal council. The Olympic rings have been painted on the dormitory building's wall. There is also a huge Chinese flag and map in the dining room, and a video recorder and some popular Chinese films. Otherwise, there seems little to occupy China's future footballing stars. Many of their countrymen would no doubt envy them and their bright sporting futures. But five years seems a long time to spend on a farm in the middle of the Brazilian countryside. One of the boys, with short hair and bad acne, seemed unconcerned. 'There's many things to do to relax. We can play football, sometimes there's football on TV and there's lots of videos of football matches,' he said.</p>

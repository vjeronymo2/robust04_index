			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] In Spain, the foreign minister has  justified the NATO attack. Javier Solana said that the planes  shot down violated the UN resolutions. Concern is now focused  on the Spanish troops serving with the United Nations in the  conflict area. The soldiers and the conscientious objectors are  well, but on alert awaiting events. The Defense Ministry is in  permanent contact with the forces in Bosnia and measures have  been taken to avoid danger. Ana Medina reports:    [Medina] [passage omitted] The Spanish forces have continued  with the tasks of escorting convoys because the Spanish  positions are in areas controlled by Croats and Muslims, but  convoys to Serb enclaves are suspended. There is also calm  among the Spanish conscientious objectors, who are working far  from the Serb firing line. The Principe de Asturias aircraft  carrier is on alert at Rota base ready to depart if it is  considered necessary. The Defense Ministry is in permanent  contact with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] command and the  Spanish military command in Bosnia. The government supported  the NATO action in the voice of Foreign Minister Javier Solana,  who said that although on previous occasions air space had been  violated, this time there was a special element because the  intruding aircraft had bombed Bosnian territory:    [Begin Solana recording] Yes, this violation had special  significance and it is a violation, which we consider to be  important, of a UN resolution. Therefore, there was an emphatic  action, as you were able to witness this morning. [end recording]    [Medina] The United Left, however, has criticized this  operation which it considers to be an extreme and inopportune  interpretation of the UN mandate that will not help the process  of detente that has been achieved.    [Announcer] The prime minister has also just spoken about  the  latest events in the area. He spoke after visiting the  president of Argentina, Carlos Menem, in the Pardo Palace  [Madrid]. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports:    [Cespedes] Following the line of the allied heads of  government, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez says that the NATO  air attack is, he believes, the strict fulfillment of the UN  Security Council resolutions:    [Begin Gonzalez recording] And I hope there will be no more  violations so there are no incidents that create added tension  at a time when there was an opening, and there still is, of a  certain hope for peace in Bosnia after a long time. [end  recording]    [Cespedes] Repercussions following the shooting down of the  four Serb planes cannot be predicted. To speculate on this  would be dangerous, although Felipe Gonzalez emphasized that so  far there had been no negative reaction.</p>

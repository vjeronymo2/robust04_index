			<p>BFN     [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Jerry John  Rawlings, returned from Johannesburg after attending ceremonies  marking the swearing into office of Mr. Nelson Mandela as South  Africa's first black president, and the ushering in of the  multiracial and democratic government for the country.  President Rawlings, who was accompanied by the first lady, Nana  Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, and officials of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, was met on arrival by the vice president, Mr.  Ekow Arkaah; special adviser on governmental affairs, Mr. P.V.  Obeng; the chairman of the Council of State, Alhaji Mumuni  Bawumiah; Captain Kojo Tsikata, a member of the Council State;  and service commanders.    Briefing newsmen on behalf of the president, the chief  director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Victor Gbeho,  said the inauguration symbolized the importance of upholding the  rights and freedoms of the individual, the triumph of right over  wrong, and the victory of the forces of good over the forces of  division. He said the most important lesson that came out of  the ceremony was the pervading sense of feeling of the black  majority to forgive and reconcile with the white minority, so  that they can move into the new democratic era in unity.    Mr. Gbeho said while in Johannesburg, President Rawlings  seized the opportunity to interact with world leaders. They  included President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Vice President Al Gore  of the United States of America, and Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife  of the U.S. president. Others were the heads of state of  Botswana, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria, and Guinea. He discussed the  situation in the world and how to expand inter-African trade.    On South Africa in particular, Mr. Gbeho said President  Rawlings was convinced that Ghana should move with speed to  commence diplomatic relations with her within weeks. President  Rawlings also discussed with South African leaders how to  improve economic relations between the two countries. Mr. Gbeho  said President Rawlings hoped that the modest beginnings in  South Africa would inspire all Africans to rededicate their  efforts towards the total elimination of all forms of racism on  the continent.</p>

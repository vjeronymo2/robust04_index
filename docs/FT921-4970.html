			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / International Company News: Anglovaal earnings advance 6% midway INCREASED earnings from Anglovaal Industries (AVI) allowed the Anglovaal group, one of South Africa's large mining houses, to record a 6 per cent increase in earnings in the six months to the end of December. Although turnover rose by 7 per cent to R4.1bn (Dollars 1.44bn) compared with the 1990 interim figure, recessionary economic conditions took their toll with operating profit down by 5 per cent to R376.1m. Attributable earnings, however, benefited from a 42 per cent increase in investment income, to R22.5m, and a 17 per cent increase in equity accounted earnings, to R45.7m, to end higher at R143.1m. Anglovaal also announced yesterday that it would, through AVI, be lifting its investment in cement producer Anglo-Alpha to 19.5 per cent. Under the deal, which involves a restructuring of the interests of the Anglovaal group and Holderbank Financiere Glaris in Anglo-Alpha, AVI will acquire Anglovaal's 8.1 per cent direct interest in Anglo-Alpha. Additionally, the direct interests of AVI and Holderbank in Anglo-Alpha will be injected into an intermediate holding company, Altur. AVI will then acquire from Holderbank a portion of its interest in Altur, equivalent to an effective 11.4 per cent interest in Anglo-Alpha. Altur will hold 54.8 per cent of Anglo-Alpha's equity, and in terms of a proposed offer to Altur minorities - who have a 5.5 per cent effective holding in Anglo-Alpha - Anglovaal's indirect holding could increase to 25 per cent. The aggregate purchase price of R249.1m will be paid for by the issue of 1.92m ordinary shares in AVI. Mr Basil Hersov, Anglovaal chairman, noted that while AVI's earnings had increased by 18 per cent, income from mining investments had been flat compared with 1990. Interest income declined as rates softened and surplus funds were used for purchases and to follow rights in the recent AVI offer. Earnings per share rose by 6 per cent to 240 cents and the interim dividend is being lifted by 10 per cent to 33 cents a share. Mr Hersov said group earnings would remain under pressure for the balance of the financial year.</p>

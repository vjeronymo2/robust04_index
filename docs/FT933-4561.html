			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting and improving markets help Adscene COST CUTTING and a steady improvement in the market helped Adscene Group, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, to raise pre-tax profits by 30 per cent from Pounds 1.61m to Pounds 2.1m in the year ended May 31. The shares responded with a 12p rise to 187p. Turnover was 7 per cent lower at Pounds 13.96m (Pounds 15.04m) and with operating profits ahead from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 2.3m, margins grew from 13.9 per cent to 16.5 per cent. Mr Harry Lambert, chairman and chief executive, said that after a strong end to the year trading had continued to improve in the first quarter. Turnover had increased and advertising revenues of the publishing division had shown consistent improvements. Based on this performance, he looked forward to a 'most satisfactory year.' With earnings per share up 19 per cent to 10.1p (8.5p), the recommended final dividend has been raised to 3.2p (2.5p) for a total 1p higher at 5p. The publishing side had a good year, especially in the second half when the group experienced a marked improvement in trading conditions. Operating profits grew by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.66m. In printing, as a result of changed work schedules following more work from the publishing division and tight cost control, margins were lifted from 12.1 per cent to 25 per cent. Profits increased from Pounds 460,000 to Pounds 616,000. Strong cash flow enabled the group to repay Pounds 1.78m of debt and reduce gearing from 32 per cent to 13 per cent at the year end.</p>

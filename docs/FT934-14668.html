			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Absurdism and the reverse / Review of Ionesco and Bulgakov How ironic: in the main auditorium of the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith you can currently see an absurdist romp by Ionesco being performed in Romanian, while in the studio theatre one floor beneath you can see performances in English of a serious drama by Bulgakov. One is deliberately ludicrous, a comedy shaped by the sense that ordinary life itself is wildly, inanely, incoherent. The other has its absurdities - its opening scene features an peasant who turns out to be an archbishop, and a woman in labour who turns out to be a general - but is a near-tragedy about people escaping from a country racked by civil war yet making coherence from life. Though Ionesco wrote his plays in French, he was born in Romania and spent much of his early life there. He began his form of theatre in France after the Second World War and the division of Europe. ('Cut off from his religious, metaphysical and transcendental roots, man is lost;' he wrote, 'all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless.') His work connects to, and helped to define, the sense of the absurd that runs so deep in modern French culture; but, as this staging of The Bald Prima Donna suggests, his absurdism may also have been profoundly Romanian. In the post-Ceausescu nation his plays are apparently now making great effect; this production has elicited standing ovations there. The Bald Prima Donna is like a Feydeau farce without a rationale. Mr and Mrs Smith receive Mr and Mrs Martin; a maid assists; but a fireman calls; and . . . The rest is mayhem. For the Hungarian Theatre of Cluj, Gabor Tompa bumps up the craziness of everything by having the characters behave like clockwork dolls. The set encourages us to believe we are watching life within a doll's house, and the room is a white box set with bright neon lighting. For those of us whose Romanian has grown rusty, there are surtitles; but these are poorly projected (and timed), and the bright onstage lights makes them hard to read. Some in the audience kept up a constant supply of titters. My problem, however, is one that will be shared by many Britons. Shaped by a culture unlike Ionesco's or Ceausescu's, I cannot enjoy a sense of the absurd that underlies everything. Tompa's staging ends with a coup whereby the cast mime, at breakneck speed, the whole play backwards, from end to beginning, at top speed. Bravura stuff. But so what? My only serious interest in the whole affair is as a cultural observer - in trying to piece together the ghastly mechanical but pointless sense of existence that must make Romanians enjoy this so heartily. Bulgakov's Flight (1926-8) also expresses a world that has been torn in two  -but how profound his Russian view of history, and life. The action begins in the Crimea in 1920, where the White Russian army is taking its last stand and where refugees find themselves as much abused as they had been elsewhere. Later, we see these Russian exiles stranded in Constantinople and Paris. The first half shows us civil war, and the tragic sense of history that we know in Shakespeare, Pushkin, Tolstoy and Pasternak. The second half is like Ninotchka in reverse; it shows us Russians bewildered by Western corruption, hopeless, and gradually deciding to go home to rediscover themselves. Flight has not been seen here for 21 years, years in which Bulgakov's work in fiction and drama has become better known to us. This Contemporary Stage Company production is directed by David Graham-Young, whose recent staging of Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita earnt acclaim. Some minor roles are weakly acted, and Wolfe Morris's account of the White Commander-in-Chief is a terrible display of old ham. But the four central parts are played with integrity: particularly Peter Tate in the most remarkable, and most tragic, role of General Khludov, a man tortured by physical and moral exhaustion, duty, and, above all, conscience. I cannot recommend everything about this production of Flight - for too much of the evening a certain English mildness inhibits Bulgakov's vision of history - but it is a play that should be seen. Whereas, to my mind at least, The Master and Margarita is an exceptional novel that never fully translated to the stage, Flight belongs naturally in the theatre; I am amazed we have not seen it more often. It is one of the most stirring, and most multi-faceted, visions of how a country, and individual people, were torn in two. Whereas The Bald Prima Donna reduces humanity to a pointless joke, Flight makes the human condition poignant, complex, rich. The Bald Prima Donna is at the Lyric, Hammersmith, this week, and then tours to Derry, Glasgow, Leeds and Oxford during October and November. Flight continues at the Lyric Studio until November 6</p>

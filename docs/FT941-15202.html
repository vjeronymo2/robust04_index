			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Turkmen leader wins support The government of former-Soviet Turkmenistan has said that voters in the Central Asian republic, by endorsing the leadership of Mr Sapurmurat Niyazov, have granted the president a 10-year term of office, reports Steve LeVine in Istanbul. The result of a referendum on Saturday, whose 99.9 per cent margin was predicted because of Mr Niyazov's tight grip on power, probably reflects broad support for his plans to convert Turkmenistan's natural gas into higher living standards for the country's 4m people. Turkmenistan, like the neighbouring ex-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, sits on big reserves of largely untapped oil and natural gas. It is already profiting by initial foreign investment.</p>

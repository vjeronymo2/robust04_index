			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> SALES OF HUNTING LICENSES DROP  </P> <P> Sales of hunting and fishing licenses in California have declined steeply for  the last 10 years and threaten the Department of Fish and Game with a serious  money shortage, its director says.  </P> <P> Director Pete Bontadelli said urbanization of California and shifts in social  attitudes toward hunting have had a major effect on the department, which  traditionally relies on license sales to sportsmen to finance much of its work.  </P> <P> "The traditional funding bases . . . are not holding up," Bontadelli said  Wednesday. "In the last (1988-89) fiscal year, we had a $7-million deficiency.  This year it may be even greater."  </P> <P> Bontadelli testified at the annual seminar on fishing issues held by the  Senate-Assembly Joint Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture. He said that for  the first six months of the current fiscal year, the department's cash  shortfall has reached $6 million.  </P> <P> Future economies may include closing fish hatcheries, dumping fish and  restricting travel of employees "to the point where their work will be  ineffective," he said.  </P></p>

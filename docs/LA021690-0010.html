			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE KOREANIZATION OF SOUTH KOREA  </P> <P> In the late 1970s, President Jimmy Carter set off something of a panic in the  Republic of Korea when he proposed -- though he never carried out -- a  unilateral cut in U.S. military forces there. By contrast, Defense Secretary  Dick Cheney's new agreement with Seoul to withdraw up to 5,000 Americans over  the next few years seems unlikely to raise even a ripple of concern. Times have  changed, and one big sign of that is South Korea's growing self-confidence,  based on its increasing economic, political and military strength. It helps,  too, that its enemy on the divided peninsula, the Communist north, now finds  itself more internationally isolated than at any time in its history.  </P> <P> The threat of renewed military aggression from the north will remain especially  credible so long as Kim Il Sung lives and remains in charge. Kim is the  Soviet-installed dictator who has held near-absolute power for more than 40  years. He's almost 78 now, but there's no reason to think he has abandoned the  goal of a reunified Korea that led him to invade the south in 1950. In an  effort to establish the Communist world's first dynasty and to ensure that his  aims would be pursued, Kim has named his son as successor. Others in North  Korea -- in the military and higher echelons of the Communist Party -- no doubt  have ideas of their own about how the succession should be handled. The point  is that North Korea remains militarily powerful and intensely committed  ideologically. Given what has gone before, its potential for aggression must  continue to be taken seriously.  </P> <P> What's different now is that North Korea, should it risk war, can no longer  expect to get the human and material help from the Soviet Union and China that  it could count on in 1950. At a minimum, the foreknowledge that it would be on  its own must limit any aggressive planning; probably it forces the rational  assessment that war-making is simply out of the question. The trouble is that  Kim, who has fostered an almost Pharaonic cult of personality, and who seems to  believe in his own infallibility, can't be counted on to behave rationally.  </P> <P> Which is why even after cutbacks take place, the United States will keep about  38,000 troops in South Korea, where they are likely to stay so long as the  South Koreans want them and Washington calculates the threat from the north to  be serious. The troop reductions agreed to in Seoul do nothing to diminish  American dedication to South Korea's defense. They are instead recognition of  the changed nature of the threat that has occurred, and of the enormous recent  progress South Korea has made.  </P></p>

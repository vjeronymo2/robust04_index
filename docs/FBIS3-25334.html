The country's  defense minister, Mr. Moven Mahachi, said today that Zimbabwe  has already lined up a battalion of soldiers for duty in Liberia  at the request of the United Nations but they will not be  deployed unless more money is made available. Zimbabwe has  troops with UN forces in Somalia and Mr. Mahachi said his  government had learned from experience that the money available  for the Liberian exercise was just not enough.    He said America had put up 31 million dollars for  Zimbabwean,  Ugandan, and Tanzanian troops due to go to Liberia and argued  that the United Nations should approach other countries for more  funds. Ugandan and Tanzanian troops have already been sent to  join a Nigerian-led peace-keeping force in Liberia under the  terms of an accord signed between rival Liberian factions in  July last year, to put an end to a brutal civil war that began  in December 1989.</p>

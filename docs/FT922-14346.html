			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Political advertising may not be working - Gary Mead finds that the message seems to be falling short of the medium as collectively the three main parties will probably have done by April 10 - with little impact on ratings might seem evidence of very poor planning. But the tighter the race, the more dervish-like will be the marketing frenzy. Each party has recruited commercially successful advertising agents but the view among a number of seasoned advertising people is that none of the parties is shining. The Liberal Democrats use the agency TBWA-Holmes Knight Ritchie, with the effervescent Alasdair Ritchie at the helm. Labour has assembled a team with Chris Powell - described as 'coldly intellectual and very private' - of BMP DDP Needham, and the reticent Philip Gould of Philip Gould Associates. The Conservatives have again opted for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, with the equally distant Charles Saatchi pondering the posters. However, talent and experience cannot compensate for fundamental flaws. The first requirement of any advertising agency is a clear outline of the client's strategy: what is the product and what is to be said about it? According to some experienced London-based advertising executives, none of the three main parties seems to have developed such a core brief. More importantly, the financially stronger Conservative party - with perhaps Pounds 20m to spend against Labour's Pounds 8m and the Liberal Democrats' Pounds 2m - is not, apparently, getting value for money. Adam Lury, of Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury, believes Conservative advertising has failed compared with that of the other main parties. He said: 'What they (the Conservatives) got right in previous campaigns was to pull out a salient image, to touch a nerve. 'Labour isn't working' (in 1979) was a crystal-clear image. They haven't produced anything like that this time.' Gary Duckworth, of Duckworth, Finn, Grubb, Waters, said: 'The Tories had one great hit before the election started - 'Labour's Tax Bombshell'. They handled it perfectly, the poster said one thing, the broadcast followed up and the media analysis was forced to really focus on Labour's tax proposals. I thought, 'here comes the Tory election machine in its oiled magnificence', but now they seem to have completely lost it.' Shaun Woodward, the Conservative party's communications director, denies that Conservative advertising has been negative. The party has started running full-page advertisements in national tabloid newspapers, one of which features a 10-point list of Conservative 'achievements' under the slogan 'Everything Britain Has Won, Labour Would Lose'. The Tories are also using 7,000 poster sites carrying large images of John Major amid smiling children, with the slogan 'The Best Future For Britain', a more positive image than they have used for much of the campaign. Mr Woodward said: 'One thing that's always a marker of a Conservative campaign is that they peak at the right moment - on polling day.' Brendan Bruce, Conservative party communications chief under Margaret Thatcher, believes the Conservatives' poor showing in the polls reflects a much deeper problem than whether a particular advertisement is considered effective. He said: 'The Tory party has failed to take the media along with its emphasis on negative campaigning. The problem is not the execution of the strategy but the strategy itself.' Mr Duckworth supports that. He said: 'Labour have got a coherent strategy, like it or not.' Labour's slogan, 'It's Time For A Change - It's Time For Labour', underlined in red, had been a consistent part of its campaign. However, he feels the advertising has been weak overall. He said: 'I don't think that Labour, the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats have thus far come up with an image of the potency or simplicity of 'Labour Isn't Working'. It's still the definitive political ad.' Robin Wight, of WCRS, is a former Conservative candidate. He says the party's marketing is doing an excellent job in a grave economic context. With recession, unemployment and a depressed housing market, the party's advertising had worked well in keeping down Labour's lead. Barry Day of Lintas, who was once a speechwriter for former prime minister Edward Heath, said he looked at what the parties were doing with 'a degree of horror'. He said: 'It's very 1970s in advertising terms. Big images, heavy typeset words, almost all verbal puns. The voter, I suspect, will find it far too clever - communication people's communications.' Carol Reay, of Reay Keating Hamer, said: 'The conduct of the campaign on the advertising front has been atrocious. The campaign is just so squabbly, although the Liberal Democrats are a shining light by comparison with Labour and the Tories. Our research shows that people like the Lib Dem advertising a lot.' The Liberal Democrats have run a consistent theme - the yellow circle with 'My Vote' adorns all posters and advertisements - but there has been confusion about what it actually means. Carol Reay believes that many electors are now quite jaundiced. He said: 'Political advertising in the main is just 'let me tell you a completely biased fact' and there isn't much control. 'When you are talking about the very democratic process of this nation you'd think it would be a bit more important than washing powder and aftershave.'</p>

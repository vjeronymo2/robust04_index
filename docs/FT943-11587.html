			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Arts: The Lady from the Sea - Theatre At the Lyric Hammersmith we have one of the least manageable later Ibsen plays, The Lady from the Sea. Brave and interesting, this co-production with West Yorkshire Playhouse scores only a qualified success. If you saw the Royal Exchange version with Vanessa Redgrave 15 years ago, in Manchester or at the Roundhouse in London, you may stay home in good conscience; if not, the Lyric staging has its rewards for Ibsen devotees (until August 27). This 1888 play came between Rosmersholm and Hedda Gabler. Like them, it has an anguished heroine at its centre - but where those other heroines are anchored (or trapped) in concrete situations, the 'lady from the sea' floats free of anything concrete; her obsessions are private and deeply fey. Ibsen lays on the symbolism hard. Ellida grew up in a lighthouse on the open sea (now she lives at the dull end of a fjord, wedded to an older widower); her disordered thoughts return constantly to the wild waves, and to her fateful encounter with a foreign sailor; she has almost withdrawn from real life, and from her two stepdaughters who supply the echoing sub-plots. The play works up slowly to its climactic event, the reappearance of the romantic sailor to claim his mystical bride and Ellida's dramatic re-assessment of her situation. Lindsay Posner's production has apt, intimately impassioned music by Paddy Cuneen, of the Cheek by Jowl company, and a bold set by Tim Hatley: a looming assemblage of sea-smoothed rocks overhead, and beneath it nothing but a steeply raked floor, upon which items of furniture turn up as needed for the domestic scenes. At the final liberation, the stones lift away (as far as the Lyric's flytower will permit). We lose, however, any visible sense of the practical, provincial reality which is Ellida's lot. Ibsen insisted that we must never glimpse the 'open sea', but Hatley's designs look open as could be - we had not expected, after all, to see painted waves on the backcloth. It is left to the actors to mime the confinement of their frustrating lives amid this unconfined space, which they do with varying degrees of conviction. The stepdaughters manage nicely. Though Emily Watson plays the younger Hilde insufferably pert, she remembers just in time to register deep feeling at Ellida's return. Matilda Ziegler brings a curious whining drawl to Bolette, the elder, but also exact representations of Bolette's moods - resigned, suddenly hopeful, delighted, bereft. But the moods succeed one another with disconcerting speed; and for that, I think, the director is to blame - for he has done the same with Ellida herself, and with her patient husband Dr Wangel (Pip Donaghy). In Wangel's case, he blows hot, cold and judiciously concerned from moment to moment, and Josette Simon's Ellida veers still less predictably. Miss Simon is not only black but strikingly close-cropped, which makes her an exotic figure in 19th-century Norway; and why not? Her special virtues, however, are meaningful stillness and fraught grace - whereas Ibsen puts his heroine through mood-switches which may seem quite crazy, as too often they do here, if not underpinned by a palpably consistent character. Still, Miss Simon has some noble moments. And among the secondary leads, the swains of (respectively) Hilde and Bolette are engagingly natural: Paul Higgins' would-be artist Lyngstrand dreams of a Southern career, enhanced by Hilde's constant prayers from a safe distance, and Sean Baker's dry, disappointed Arnholm - Bolette's ex-tutor - faces up to a late, uncertain marriage. Here the director's heavy hand intrudes. It is quite clear to him, though it should not be to us, that her choice amounts to a sacrifice. Ibsen's claim is that because it is chosen freely it is no sacrifice, just like Ellida's final resolve. Much stress is laid upon Bolette's disheartened fate, when Ibsen intended nothing so unambiguous. Contrariwise, Ellida's sailor - the Stranger - is described as Finnish, and always referred to as 'the American', but arrives in the unmistakeably Irish person of Liam de Staic. From Peter Kelly there is a pleasant sketch of a typical Ibsen oddity, the artist/horn-player/hairdresser Ballested. His theatrical troupe collapsed in this little town, and he has lived there ever since. But we never really learn where 'there' was: a pity, because Ibsen's most visionary flights always start from tough, pragmatic bases.</p>

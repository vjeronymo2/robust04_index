			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Campaign promises encourage Australia to hit six-month high TOKYO WAS closed for a national holiday but other Pacific Rim markets were generally firmer. AUSTRALIA climbed to a six-month high, drawing encouragement from employment data and campaign promises from both of the main political parties to help the corporate sector. Strong demand from domestic and overseas investors propelled the All Ordinaries index above the 1,600 level, but late profit-taking pulled prices off their highs. The index closed 8.5 higher at 1,599.1 in turnover of ADollars 342.1m. More than 9.4m Pioneer shares were traded following the resignation of the chief executive officer. The stock added a cent at ADollars 2.32, with investors taking the view that it has been an underperformer recently. HONG KONG remained positive, with investors encouraged by the successful flotation of Denway, which saw its HKDollars 402m share offer oversubscribed by some 700 times. The Hang Seng index ended 21.45 ahead at 5,857.00 but turnover was low at HKDollars 1.9bn. Some analysts commented that slightly better than expected December trade figures also helped sentiment. In pre-listing trade, Denway was quoted at HKDollars 3.50, up from HKDollars 3.00. HSBC Holdings rose 50 cents to HKDollars 61.50. BANGKOK gave up some of an early advance but the SET index still managed to edge 1.08 ahead to 991.21. Some analysts expect the index to breakthrough the 1,000 level today. Turnover was Bt12bn. Bank shares were in demand. Bangkok Bank put on Bt2 at Bt135. Thai Farmers Bank rose Bt28 to Bt928, Krung Thai Bank Bt4 to Bt404 and Bank of Ayudhya Bt1 to Bt79. MANILA adopted a positive tone and the composite index climbed 23.94 to 1,403.61, with mining issues leading the rise on the back of improved gold prices. Among blue chips, Philippine National Bank moved ahead 12 pesos to 245 pesos and Manila Electric added 25 pesos at 220 pesos on rumours of a rights issue. SEOUL benefited from demand for financial issues and some other large-capitalisation stocks, and the composite index firmed 4.35 to 681.60. Turnover was Won654bn, up from Wednesday's Won597bn. KUALA LUMPUR picked up as the government and the country's hereditary rulers broke their deadlock over constitutional amendments. The composite index, 5.01 lower at midday, picked up to end 3.28 easier on balance at 635.34 in turnover of some MDollars 633m. SINGAPORE was weaker, while Rothmans Industries shares were suspended from trading ahead of a company announcement. Rothmans Plc in London said that it had begun talks with its divisions in Malaysia and Singapore which could lead to a regional holding company. The Straits Times Industrial index shed 4.43 to 1,621.47 in volume of 140.5m shares, against 134.3m on Wednesday. TAIWAN remained firm following Wednesday's announcement that Governor Lien Chan was to be nominated as the next premier, so easing political worries. The weighted index rose 43.33, or 1.2 per cent, to 3,621.43 in turnover of TDollars 18.3bn, after the previous day's TDollars 32.7bn. NEW ZEALAND was helped by strength in Fletcher Challenge, which advanced 6 cents to NZDollars 2.58. The NZSE-40 index gained 10.88 at 1,577.66. BOMBAY eased back on profit-taking: the BSE index closed 26.29 down at 2,785.83.</p>

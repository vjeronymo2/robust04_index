			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> 'HORRIFIED' OVER DESTRUCTION OF SIGNS  </P> <P> It is with great sadness that I write this letter. I am horrified by the total  lack of respect some people have in Glendora for the constitutional rights of  fellow citizens.  </P> <P> The continuous destruction of "No on 1530" signs was culminated on Election Day  by the destruction of most remaining "No" signs. (City ordinance No. 1530 would  have raised the maximum height for two-story homes in some areas from 25 to 30  feet, and would have permitted heights of 35 feet with City Council approval.)  It is regrettable that this is the standard of behavior our children have to  follow. I found my rights denied by not being allowed to speak at the Rancho  Glendora Mobile Home Park by the actions of a person representing the "Yes"  position.  </P> <P> I believe that this letter is necessary so people will be aware of what took  place during the recent election.  </P> <P> Not only were signs destroyed and individuals not permitted to speak but some  members of our community decided to be judge and jury by deciding that the  citizens should not read distributed material by removing it from cars.  </P> <P> For those individuals who attempted to circumvent our basic rights, I only have  contempt. For the future, I pray for an electorate more mature and respectful  of the rights of others.  </P> <P> DAVID S. BODLEY  </P> <P> Glendora councilman  </P></p>

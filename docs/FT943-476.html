			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Oil output rises British oil production averaged 2.44m barrels a day in August, up from 2.39m b/d in July, according to figures issued yesterday by the Royal Bank of Scotland. It was 26 per cent higher than a year ago. Natural gas output was 6 per cent up from July, when demand is usually lowest. The average daily value of production fell to Pounds 33.8m from Pounds 34m in July because of lower world oil prices.</p>

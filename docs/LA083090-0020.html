			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AUGUST 29': CHICANO ANGST  </P> <P> You know the old saying about too many cooks. It can apply in the theater as  well as in the kitchen, and it is to the credit of the Los Angeles Theatre  Center's Latino Theatre Lab that the play they created collectively under the  pseudonym Violeta Calles (a rakish stand-in for "violent streets") avoids  spoiling the caldo.  </P> <P> "August 29," seen at a press preview Tuesday, is a rousing tribute not so much  to the fallen newsman Ruben Salazar, but more perhaps to what he has come to  represent in the 20 years since he was killed by a 10-inch tear-gas projectile  that pierced his skull.  </P> <P> It was launched by a sheriff's deputy into the Silver Dollar Bar in East Los  Angeles, where Salazar had stopped for a beer. He was covering the Chicano  Moratorium of Aug. 29, 1970, when, nobody quite knows why, the peaceful march  from Belvedere Park to Laguna Park (now Salazar Park), turned into a riot.  </P> <P> Salazar, who had been a Times bureau chief in Mexico City and still wrote a  weekly column for the paper, was then news director at KMEX. Was he a victim of  random violence or a targeted man? The question was never satisfactorily  answered, but he became a powerful symbol in his death.  </P> <P> The lab ensemble and director Jose Luis Valenzuela have attempted to dramatize  the present in the light of the past, hoping to assess how things have changed  -- not necessarily for the better.  </P> <P> Evelina Fernandez plays Lucero, a Chicana activist at the time of the  Moratorium who has since become a "chuppie" (a Chicano yuppie), complete with  nice apartment, stylish clothes and BMW (license plate: PHD). A respected  college professor and historian, Lucero is writing a book on Salazar that she  considers her ticket to tenure.  </P> <P> But a favorite student becomes a victim of police brutality. And when Lucero  resists pressure from friends and ex-comrades in activism to publicly denounce  the incident, she's forced to confront herself and re-examine her values.  </P> <P> This takes us on a journey of reminiscence and re-enactment wherein Lucero is  assisted, or at least prodded, by the presence of an imaginary Salazar (E.J.  Castillo). His desire to know all that has happened since he died is a  convenient device for a look at how times have changed and how Chicanos -- now  known as "Hispanics," or what Lucero's friend Molly (Angela Moya) calls "the H  word" -- have become as complacent and self-involved as the rest of the  citizenry.  </P> <P> The result is a theatrically correct piece that pours a little salsa on the  expected. Using rear projections of Aug. 29 footage, as well as vivid  abstractions by set designers Douglas D. Smith and Gronk, it offers a nostalgic  look at the spent ardor of the '70s and the bloodlessness of the '80s.  </P> <P> It does not quite sink to separating history into good guys and bad guys, but  even while "August 29" acknowledges that Salazar's early writings were  politically noncommittal and his lifestyle more Anglo than Chicano, it only  glances off the issues rather than digging into them with bared fangs.  </P> <P> In addition, there is an aura of calculation that such manufactured pieces have  trouble averting, and a few too many halos to pass around. But Valenzuela has  directed with dispatch and the acting is balanced and buoyant throughout.  </P> <P> Castillo and Fernandez do a nimble, restrained dance around the issues,  skillfully touching history and each other. Vanessa Marquez is a bit too soft  to be believable as the militant young Lucy, while Sal Lopez is so sweetly  jocular as Benny, the boyfriend who betrays her, that it's hard to accept him  as the traitor he is in the end.  </P> <P> Abel Franco and Lupe Ontiveros, the lab's all-purpose Latino parents, are  especially successful as Lucero's -- neither overly rambunctious and  stereotypical nor overly subdued.  </P> <P> Moya and Mike Gomez are forceful as Lucero's activist friends (and in other  cameos), and a nod goes to Tony Maggio, playing a virtual gallery of cops and  other villains, to whom he manages to impart distinctive individual traits.  </P> <P> What one had hoped for was more meat on the bones. We get a listing and a  naming of what's still terribly wrong for Hispanics/Latinos/Chicanos today --  plenty -- but not much more. The play is a Cook's Tour of issues, not a  penetrating expedition into the underbrush.  </P> <P> 'AUGUST 29'  </P> <P> A new play by Violeta Calles. Director Jose Luis Valenzuela.

Since French Ambassador Francois Scheer let off steam at a Bonn  meeting with journalists last week this definition has had to be  altered: The diplomat is a paragon of discretion who is sent  abroad to commit indiscretions in the interest of his country.    The ambassador let it be understood that the ghosts of the  past had risen once again. The differences over the  nonparticipation of the chancellor in the commemorative  ceremonies in Normandy and Bonn's refusal to allow the Allies to  stage a farewell military parade in Berlin should be viewed  against a "background of general mistrust." France needs  "clarity from Germany" that nothing will change about Germany's  place in West Europe as a result of the transfer of the seat of  the government to Berlin, relations of a new kind with Russia,  and the expansion of the European Union [EU] to the north and  the East. There is much that still has to be done for  reconciliation to develop into friendship.    This has caused a minor tempest in a teapot. There were few  signs of perceptiveness -- according to Max Weber, "the ability  to allow reality to affect one while remaining calm and  collected" -- in German reactions and commentaries. There are  three points that need to be set out and contrasted with that.    First, in view of differing national interests,  temperaments,  and memories, the Franco-German relationship remains difficult.  However, as it has evolved over the past few decades, it is  enduring enough to survive temporary irritations. It is not --  regardless of ambassadorial garrulousness or ministerial  bluntness -- in trouble at the present time.    Just as the Maastricht Treaty was a product of a  Franco-German initiative, there are many other things that have  emerged from joint Franco-German efforts since then: The  European Council's Copenhagen resolution, which opens up  prospects for admission for the countries of Central and East  Europe; the decision to offer the countries of the East  cooperation with the Western European Union [WEU] to supplement  the Partnership for Peace; and the Kinkel-Juppe proposal for  Bosnia, which the Americans have made their own in the meantime.    There are countless examples of successful cooperation --  the  GATT negotiations, which the Germans helped to lead to a  successful conclusion without France losing face; the subtle way  in which France was brought into NATO via the Eurocorps; the  close coordination of the two EU presidencies, Germany first and  then France, with an emphasis on drawing East Europe into the  Brussels community and promoting stability in the entire Eastern  region.    Second, it is true the Germans have still not found their  role in the world following the Cold War, reunification, and  communism. We still do not know what we should want. However,  that is no less true of the French. The ECONOMIST diagnosis  was: "The old certainties regarding national solidarity and  cultural integrity, especially things connected with France's  place in Europe, which is continuing to develop, have collapsed.  They have been replaced by worry."    Paris feels it has been forced to the periphery. For a long  time, it has called on the Germans to finally assume a degree of  responsibility that is commensurate with its size and influence.  However, as soon as the government prepared to do just that, the  ghost of a German desire to achieve a dominant position loomed.  Sometimes, this concern almost sounds like Clemenceau's caustic  Gallic complaint that there are "20 million Germans too many."    These fears on both sides must be discussed -- the German  fear of being made to stand in the corner once again and French  fears that if the focus of Bonn policies shifts to the north and  the East, then France will be forced to the sidelines of the  European arena. Klaus Kinkel must initiate such a dialogue in  Paris this week.    Third, in view of the uncertainty surrounding the future,  there may be a temptation to seek refuge in the hackneyed  certainties of the past. The ceremonies that are planned to  mark the 50th anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy  smack of anachronism; there is a feel of smoke-filled back rooms  in which veterans associations preserve past memories about  them, of regimental rooms where relics of the past are  displayed. The chancellor is not to be present as if victory  over the Germans were being celebrated rather than a triumph  over Nazi ideology. Why is one staging a retrospective of this  last great battle rather than celebrating European union?    The government is in a huff ("concerning ceremony for the  end  of World War II: German presence is not envisaged"). The  chancellor is having rumors spread that one cannot expect him to  take part in an event that involves celebrating the defeat of  Germany. How can this stupid statement be reconciled with  Bonn's secret desire to be present? That would only be possible  if it were admitted that 6 July 1994 marked the beginning of  defeat and Germany's liberation from the Nazi yoke. However,  making that kind of statement is something that many in Bonn  still find distasteful.    "Ten centuries of European history are visible in the  background" is how Ambassador Scheer explained French mistrust.  Is the point not that real history should now be made out of  past events? Should one not heed Nietzsche's words of warning:  "There is a degree of sleeplessness, of ruminating on things,  of historical awareness that drives life out of things to the  point of its extinction."    Last fall, Helmut Kohl spoke about Franco-German friendship  before the Senate in Paris. He said on that occasion that not  all the evil spirits of the past had been banished in Europe  once and for all. Every generation faces the task of preventing  their return anew, of shedding old prejudices, of allaying  suspicion. Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman  Rudolf Scharping expressed himself in very similar terms  recently. He advised that Bonn foreign policy should display  clarity with regard to substance, modesty and restraint in its  style, and sensitivity toward neighbors. The meaning of the  criticism leveled by the French ambassador, who is a  dyed-in-the-wool European, was not that different. The dialogue  that he has called for is not only due, it is overdue. In the  Europe of the future, a Europe of Romance, Germanic, and Slavic  peoples, Germany and France constitute the indispensable hinge  between north and south and East and West. This hinge needs to  be oiled urgently.</p>

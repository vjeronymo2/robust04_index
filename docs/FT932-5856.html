			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Swiss approve S African sale THE Swiss government gave the go-ahead yesterday for a controversial sale of 60 turboprop trainer aircraft to South Africa, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. The government said it was satisfied that technical changes to be made by the manufacturer, the Pilatus subsidiary of the weapons and engineering group Oerlikon Buhrle, would make it impossible to convert the aircraft for combat use. The government also announced it would grant an export credit guarantee to support the SFr250m (Pounds 110.1m) order. Last December, when the order was announced, a UN Security Council committee monitoring the mandatory UN arms embargo on South Africa said sale of the PC-7 to South Africa would violate the spirit of the embargo. The Swiss government then said it would not issue an export licence unless the aircraft were modified so they could not be used for combat.</p>

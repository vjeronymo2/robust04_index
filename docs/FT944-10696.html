			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Commission to investigate Australian sugar price 'war' A review of Australia's sugar industry is to be undertaken by the Trade Practices Commission, the country's competition watchdog, following speculation that a sugar price war is being waged by Australian companies. The TPC yesterday noted that 'media reports have indicated that long-term sugar contracts are being executed by Australian companies at significant losses'. This situation would be 'unusual' in the sugar market and warranted investigation, the TPC said. The move was welcomed by Mackay Refined Sugars, which alleges that CSR, traditionally the big player in the country's refining industry, has embarked on 'a deliberate strategy of selling refined sugar at below cost for a number of years forward'. MRS is a joint venture between Mackay Sugar Co-operative Association and London-based trading house, ED &amp; F. Man, and has established a new, low-cost refinery in Queensland. MRS claimed that it was seen as 'a threat to the established market refiners and in particular to CSR which has historically dominated the market'. CSR, which originally hoped to establish a joint venture with MRS before encountering TPC opposition, said it would co-operate fully. 'All our sales of refined sugar, without exception, have above our costs of supplying the sugar concerned,' it said. Jamaica's raw sugar production is to be increased by 100,000 tonnes a year with an expansion in the capacity of three of the island's larger mills, which were bought by a private company from the government earlier this year. The Sugar Industry Company of Jamaica will spend USDollars 70m over the next five years to rehabilitate the mills, bringing their aggregate output to 220,000 tonnes per year by the 1998-99 harvest. Their combined production this year was 120,000 tonnes. The company will also rehabilitate the island's only sugar refinery, lifting annual production to 30,000 tonnes, and reducing the need for Jamaica to import whites. Jamaica's raw sugar production this year was 220,000 tonnes, and the industry is forecasting the next harvest to yield 240,000 tonnes.</p>

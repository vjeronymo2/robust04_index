			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Arts: The old order changes - Theatre The Studio at the Royal National Theatre is less well known than it ought to be to the general public. Physically, it exists in a lot of space at the Old Vic, provided rent-free by the Old Vic owner, Ed Mirvish. The funding for its work is largely (and slightly mysteriously) private: the names of its benefactors have not been published. Its purpose is research and development and the encouragement of new talent, not just for the RNT but for British theatre as a whole. Most of its works are shown only to invited audiences. There is now an opportunity to see more widely what the Studio is up to. Last Saturday three new plays, developed at the Studio, were shown at the Cottesloe. More are to come and the Springboards season, as it is called, will be extended around the country. This was the second time in two weeks that I spent almost an entire day in a theatre, the previous occasion being Bill Morrison's trilogy, A Love Song for Ulster, at the Tricycle. It is an exhausting, but ultimately rewarding and mind-changing experience. Seen on separate days, the three plays at the Cottesloe might look thin, with the quality of the acting and the direction far outstripping that of the writing. Seen on the same day, the writing looks much less random. There is almost a common theme, which is that there is not much to laugh about, or even to hope for, in contemporary Britain. All three plays show societies breaking down, though each has at least one character either striving for something better or trying to preserve the best of the old. Hove is a collaborative work without a single author by the Talking Tongues Company. It is set in a boarding house in that amorphous area somewhere between where Brighton ends and Hove begins. One of the guests, a specialist in sea studies played by Alan David, has been there for 25 years: he still prefers to talk to the sea rather than to the other inhabitants. The landlady, majestically performed by Lindy Alexander, plainly thinks her place is a cut above the rest: special cooking, special rules. That is not how others see it. A married local councillor has been keeping his girlfriend there for some time, both preserving the fiction that he is more important than he is. The arrival of Clare (Rachel Joyce), who may be an artist but has a touch of the property developer about her, disturbs any calm the place may claim. The words 'dead house' are painted on a wall. The landlady's son covers himself with petrol, then departs with a box of matches. In short, the old house, the old order, is falling down. Hove is not a finished play: too much is left unexplained - the apparent suicide, for example. But played as it is at the Cottesloe, and directed by David Farr, it is certainly haunting. The Neighbour, by Meredith Oakes, is set outside one of those tower-block council estates that one thought were no longer being built. It also seems slightly odd in the 1990s that the inhabitants are all white. The characters live in fear and mutual suspicion. Only one of them - John, played by Ben Chaplin - has much in the way of aspirations: he wants to repair old furniture. His mother throws it out; another boy sets fire to it, as being fit only for yuppies and not even worth nicking. John tells the police and the community closes in on him for grassing. He dies, having drunk a bottle of vodka as a dare to prove himself to his contemporaries. Alcohol plays a strong role in all three plays. I found The Neighbour needlessly brutal. Yet set against Judith Johnson's Somewhere, which is the best of the bunch, it falls into context. Here are people without much money, without decent jobs and without much hope. They are not down-and-outers: somehow the social security must provide, but ambition is almost unthought of. In Somewhere, set initially round Merseyside, the best hope for the girls is to go to Manchester to work as escorts for tired businessmen. Later they move to Amsterdam where being on the game is open. For one of the boys the only hope is the army. What I admire most about the play is that, despite all of that, Ms Johnson has written a love story. That is a bold thing to do in such a setting in 1993. Dawn, the long-time prostitute, is ultimately reunited with her soldier lover. In a way, society has held together. Dawn is magnificently played by Katrina Levon and the direction by Polly Teale is faultless. In repertory, Cottesloe Theatre until May 15</p>

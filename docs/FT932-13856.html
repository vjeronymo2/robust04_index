			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey up on market optimism THE LONDON stock market's current thirst for good news prompted a rise in Abbey National shares that surprised even the bank's supporters. Analysts agreed that Abbey's annual meeting statement was a mixed bag. Progress in the UK was encouraging, although it reflected volume growth rather than a general upturn in the housing market. The bank also highlighted problems with European debt, saying it would remain at least at 1992 levels. Nevertheless, the shares jumped 17 to 395p on turnover of 3.7m. Mr John Wriglesworth at UBS said: 'Such is the desire for optimism that the market is totally happy to ignore the bad news in the statement.' His forecast for 1993 remains at Pounds 630m, at the low end of the range of estimates. Also, SG Warburg, the company broker, remains a buyer, but was nevertheless said to be slightly surprised at the level of market enthusiasm. The house has maintained its Pounds 650m forecast.</p>

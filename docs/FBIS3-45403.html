The Chinese general made the statement when he called on  Indonesian Vice President Try Sutrisno here today.    Liu assured that China always insists on its national  sovereignty, but it holds that disputes should be solved through  diplomatic means and dialogs by leaders of the countries.    Try Sutrisno stated that the exchanges of visits by senior  officials of Indonesia and China will surely promote mutual  understanding and further strengthen the already existed  friendly relations between the two peoples and two armed forces.    After briefing the Chinese guests on Indonesia's success of  economic construction in the past 25 years and the tasks for the  future 25-year long term economic development, the vice  president stressed that the tasks need an environment of peace,  stability in the world and in the Asian-Pacific region in  particular.    Vice Chairman Liu recalled Vice President Try's 1992 visit  to  China in his then capacity as Indonesian armed forces  commander-in- chief.    He said with heavy economic construction tasks, China would  develop friendly relations with all the countries in the world,  neighboring countries in particular.    Vice Chairman Liu and his entourage flew to Bali this  evening  after paying a visit to the Lastern Fleet in Surabaya.</p>

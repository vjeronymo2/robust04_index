			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Sorokin] </F>   [Text] Kazan June 2 TASS -- "The urgent measures to  stabilise Tatarstan's economy are being taken for the sake of  our people," Tatar Prime Minister Mukhammat Sabirov told  ITAR-TASS. Corresponding draft documents have already been  drawn up by the republic's government and will be submitted for  approval to the next session of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet.    "These radical measures were prompted by the difficult  situation in the republic's economy," the premier said. "The  production slump equalled to almost 30 per cent this year, as  compared to the corresponding period of 1993, and the figure for  the defence industry reached 47 per cent. The situation is  somewhat better only in the agro-industrial sector, where output  of goods is growing. Vigorous measures were taken to ensure a  good harvest this year. The government was able to find money to  pay the wages delayed since January 1944.    "The purpose of the urgent measures is to help the strong  and  protect the weak," the premier said. "Strong commodity producers  will be provided with better conditions for increasing the  output of high-quality goods. The poor sections of the  population will get differentiated social protection.  Possessing rich natural resources and a strong scientific and  technological potential, Tatarstan is able to create every  condition for the harmonic development of its market, for  improving the people's living standards," the prime minister  believes.    "Leading economists and financiers have worked for almost  one  year on the urgent measures. They have a minimum programme,  covering the period from 1994 to 1995, and a maximum programme  for a longer stretch of time. They have drawn on the experience  of market economies in more than 60 countries, including Turkey,  China, Germany and the United States. Although no exact  all-embracing model was found, many parts of the programme are  based on foreign experience," Sabirov stated.</p>

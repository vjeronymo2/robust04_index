			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Observer: Brush-off One consolation for loss of office that Margaret Thatcher might have expected is Germany's Ludwig Erhard prize, awarded yearly for distinction in practising or commentating on economic policy. She has at least once been considered for the award by the Ludwig Erhard Foundation - which promotes the 'social market' tenets of West Germany's legendary economics minister. As a serving premier, though, she was ineligible. Now the bar of office has gone, but the prize committee has given her the brush-off. It has ruled her out on the ostensible grounds that she's a 'capitalist' as opposed to a mixer of market economics with social-policy pragmatism in the German style. This year's award is going instead to Bundesbank president Karl Otto Pohl, who's unpopular with Chancellor Helmut Kohl because of his criticism of policy towards eastern Germany. So the award is an important vote of confidence from the country's economics establishment for Pohl's reluctance to sacrifice the D-Mark through rushing into European monetary union. When he collects the prize in Bonn on July 2, a speech in his honour will be made by good friend Fritz Leutwiler, ex-president of the Swiss National Bank. Given the tensions between the Bundesbank and Kohl, however, it would be surprising if the chancellor turned up to listen.</p>

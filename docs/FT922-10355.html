			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: De la Rosa buys 9% of Ebro for Pta8bn MR JAVIER de la Rosa, the deputy chairman of Ebro, Spain's biggest foods group, has acquired 9 per cent of the company for Pta8bn (Dollars 77.4m). The stake has been purchased on the open market from Banco de Santander. A spokesman said that the Kuwait Investment Office, which owns 39 per cent of Ebro through Torras, its Spanish holding, planned to maintain its shareholding. It is understood that Mr de la Rosa, who is a close associate of Ebro's chief executive Mr Manuel Guasch, would continue buying into Ebro with the intention of acquiring 24.9 per cent, just short of the level that under Spain's stock market rules would force a full takeover bid. The development puts an end to speculation over the investment strategy chosen by Mr de la Rosa, one of the most active businessmen in Spain, as well as one of the wealthiest. Ebro, which is the dominant sugar company in Spain and the fifth largest in Europe, has moved aggressively to become Europe's leading rice producer following a string of acquisitions outside Spain. Its sales totalled Pta180bn last year. The company is poised to expand further through the acquisition of Elosua, the second largest domestic edible oils producer. Negotiations which would gain Ebro a controlling position in Elosua through a joint venture with Tabacalera, the state-controlled tobacco group, are due to be finalised next week.</p>

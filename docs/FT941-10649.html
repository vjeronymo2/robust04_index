			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold seen struggling to top Dollars 400 this year Gold's price would find it very difficult to move above Dollars 400 a troy ounce, Mr Peter Munk, chairman of American Barrick Resources, one of North America's biggest gold producers, said yesterday. But neither did he expect the price to drop below Dollars 200. Gold would trade in 'a steady, stable, profitable range like most commodities,' he told analysts and institutional investors in London. Earlier Mr Bob Smith, Barrick's president, reported that the group's hedging policy ensured it would receive more than Dollars 400 an ounce for its output for the next two years while retaining the flexibility to take some of the gains should the price go above that level. The London gold price closed last night at Dollars 384.70 an ounce. Barrick produced 1.632m ounces of gold last year and had set targets of 1.8m for 1994 and 2m for 1995, said Mr Smith during the company's annual European 'road show'. Mr Munk recalled that Barrick was set up only 10 years ago to become a 'pure' gold company operating solely in North America. Today it was North America's most profitable gold producer and owner of the continent's biggest gold reserves. Now Barrick intended to use its 'balance sheet, track record, credibility' and its North American know-how and technology to expand internationally while continuing to focus only on gold. 'We will become as dominant internationally as we have become in North America,' Mr Munk promised. Mr Smith said that the international drive was gaining momentum with activities in Mexico, Chile, Peru and China. American Barrick was looking for opportunities elsewhere in the world and was willing to make strategic investments in two or three exploration companies that had assembled land positions in areas of interest to the company but where it had no exploration teams of its own.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] "As a well brought up person I cannot evaluate the  unexpected departure of Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev  from the talks," Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy  stated on Friday at a press conference on the talks between the  Ukrainian and Russian delegations concerning the Black Sea Fleet.    He said the defense ministers had agreed to meet at 1500  [1100 GMT]. However, Grachev had not appeared. "He could at  least call us and prevent that he would not come," Radetskyy  remarked. [sentence as received]    On the question put by INTERFAX-Ukraine, Radetskyy stressed  that the Russian proposal to base the Black Sea Fleet in all  Crimean ports and the Ukrainian navy in Nikolayev, Ochakov,  Odessa or Ismail was unacceptable for Ukraine.    Radetskyy suggested that Ukraine could accept basing in  different bays of Sevastopol.    Radetskyy said the delegations had found understanding and  worked fruitfully at the talks. He emphasized that the complex  issues had been worked on by experts.    Radetskyy was surprised by the statement of Grachev on  "seizure" of 126 Black Sea Fleet ships by the Ukrainian Navy.  He said the fleet had been divided proceeding from the number  of 864 ships registered on August 3, 1992, in accordance with  the Yalta agreement.    He refuted the statement of Grachev saying that his position  differed from that of the Ukrainian president. Radetskyy said  in this case he would have presented a report and would have  expressed his disagreement.    Radetskyy pointed out that if the Black Sea Fleet issue was  solved, it would let lessen the tension in Crimea and tackle the  economic problems. "However, some people find it beneficial to  defer settlement of the problem on the Black Sea Fleet,"  Radetskyy suggested. "I think this time Russia had no desire to  resolve the Black Sea Fleet issue," he added.    "It is regrettable that we did not justify the expectations  of the presidents. This is to be blamed only on the Russian  party," Radetskyy accentuated.    Ukrainian Navy Commander Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy stressed at  the press conference that the issue on basing dealt with the  infrastructure and "we had been deciding on separation of the  fleet ships so necessary during the period of transition and  giving such opportunities for maneuvering."    Ukraine has been financing Sevastopol for quite a long time,  Bezkorovaynyy said while commenting on the statement of Grachev  concerning financing of the Black Sea Fleet by Russia. "This is  four times more expensive for Ukraine than for Russia is to  finance the Black Sea Fleet," he added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Much of the media has recently been writing about a  cooling off in the Russian-American relations. Can we call it a  crisis now? Here is our commentator Aleksey Sokolov's view.    [Sokolov] Indeed, there are quite a few reports in the press  on this. A lightweight diplomatic scandal is brewing between  Moscow and Washington -- this is how IZVESTIYA, for instance,  has headlined one of its articles. The article is about the  possible negative consequences of the former U.S. President  Nixon's visit to Russia, where, unfortunately enough, he had a  meeting with the opposition before meeting the head of state and  those who represent the administration.    The article's author does not rule out the emergence of new  and substantial friction in the relations between Moscow and  Washington.    State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin did mention the rough patches  that have recently been affecting the relations between the two  countries during his recent visit to Washington.    Incidentally, I have so far failed to come across the word  crisis, evidently because, when all is said and done, there is  no crisis as such between Russia and the United States. It is  more likely that other aspects do exist here -- it is simply  that Moscow and Washington have begun to regard each other from  more realistic positions. There is no doubt that Russia's  vigorous diplomatic initiative in Bosnia took America by  surprise. To detract from its undoubted impact, a jealous White  House wheeled out the Ames' spy affair. Pleasantries were  exchanged -- the Russian and American residents were expelled  from Washington and Moscow. The United States began to fan up  the spy hysteria in every possible way here. The halting of U.S.  assistance to Russia was even mentioned.    Nevertheless, let me reiterate that there are no grounds to  speak of a crisis in the Russian-American relations. It simply  looks like the United States, which has adopted the unofficial  title of the only superpower and which has recently gotten used  to Moscow behaving in a certain predictable pattern on the  international arena and to its role as a younger brother, as it  were, has suddenly discovered that despite its own family  difficulties, this brother has become stronger and more  confident and that it intends its role in international affairs  to be completely independent.    It is as though the United States has forgotten that in view  of objective reasons, such as the size of its territory and the  presence of nuclear weapons, Russia itself was, is, and will be  a world power, with a voice and interests of its own.    No, it is not a matter of returning to the times of the Cold  War. Russia is no longer ideologically hostile to the West --  but, having said that, it does have inalienable national  interests with which, judging by everything, the United States  will have to reckon in the nearest future.    As for America's interests, these can at times continue to  coincide with the Russian interests or not, as the case may be,  and if the latter is the case, rough patches are possible.  However, the essence of the mutual relations between Russia and  America ought to remain invariable. As Ivan Rybkin noted in  Washington, partnership and cooperation in the name of peace and  concord in the world represent the constant features of  Russian-American relations.</p>

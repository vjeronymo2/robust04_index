			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. RENT FIRM IS ACCUSED OF DEPOSIT FRAUD  </P> <P> In one of the most sweeping consumer actions ever mounted by the Orange County  district attorney, prosecutors Tuesday filed suit against a Garden Grove  property management firm accused of illegally withholding security deposits  from hundreds of apartment renters.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein also issued a preliminary injunction  against the firm, Elerding Properties, prohibiting its operators and employees  from withholding refundable deposits, falsifying records, or inflating repair  and cleaning bills sent to former tenants.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that over the last four years, Elerding Properties has  "engaged in and (is) still engaging in certain acts of unfair, unlawful and  fraudulent business practices." It seeks restitution and at least $2,500 in  penalties for each alleged violation, according to the complaint filed in Santa  Ana.  </P> <P> While the number of affected renters is still being tallied, "This is one of  the most widespread violations of consumer laws that our unit has had to deal  with," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Chris Kralick of the office's consumer and  environmental protection unit.  </P> <P> Attorneys for Elerding Properties have maintained that the firm is not guilty  of any wrongdoing and that it will contest the lawsuit. The firm's lawyer,  Arthur Morello, was unavailable for comment Tuesday.  </P> <P> Officials with the Orange County Fair Housing Council say the failure of  landlords to promptly refund security deposits is a significant problem that  contributes to homelessness. During its last fiscal year, the agency received  5,278 complaints of non-refunded security deposits valued at about $2.85  million.  </P> <P> "Most of these (renters) could not afford the loss of this money at a time that  it was needed for relocation," fair housing officials wrote in a recent report  to the Orange County Community Development Council. "Consequently, hundreds  faced homelessness due to the wrongful taking of their deposits. . . . Many  managers have virtually institutionalized their own process so as to be in a  best position to take a helpless tenant's money."  </P> <P> The Times reported five weeks ago that at least 113 renters had filed small  claims suits against Elerding and that the Marine Corps had taken the  extraordinary step of removing the firm's 10 Orange County and two Los Angeles  County complexes from its approved housing list.  </P> <P> Several hundred other former renters have not filed suit to recover their  security deposits but have written letters of complaint to Elerding Properties,  according to two company employees who asked not to be identified for fear of  losing their jobs.  </P> <P> The district attorney's complaint does not specify the number of alleged  violations uncovered by investigators. But Deputy Dist. Atty. Kralick said  several investigators have been working full-time during the last month to  compile a complete list of the renters whose deposits were illegally withheld.  </P> <P> "They are literally going through thousands of documents," Kralick said.  </P> <P> As soon as the list is completed, Kralick said he would file an amendment to  the lawsuit along with a list of alleged building violations. The Orange County  Environmental Health Division had received at least 43 complaints since January  of 1989 of substandard housing conditions at some of the firm's apartments.  </P> <P> The lawsuit names as defendants the estate of Dr. Charles E. Elerding Jr., his  wife, Janet R. Elerding, two trusts held in each of their names, and their  three sons -- Charles III, James and Joseph Elerding.  </P> <P> The senior Elerding served as company president before he died of cancer last  May. Two years ago, he was featured in Sports Illustrated when he and his wife  provided a $1.75-million endowment to the USC football team -- the largest  single contribution ever made to the school's athletic program.  </P> <P> The lawsuit also identifies 10 apartment complexes and 27 other properties  owned and operated by the rental company. The Orange County complexes owned by  Elerding include: Amberwood in Buena Park; Casa Madrid in Cypress; Mountain  View Apartments and Villa Viejo Apartments in El Toro; City Park Plaza in  Garden Grove; Huntington Apartments and Bahia Puerto in Huntington Beach;  Tustin Arms Apartments in Orange, and Cerritos Apartments and Pine Tree  Apartments in Stanton.  </P> <P> Under the California Civil Code, a landlord is allowed to withhold all or part  of a renter's security deposit to cover nonpayment of rent, clean the premises  or repair "damages to the premises, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear."  Within two weeks of the termination of a tenancy, the landlord is required to  give every former renter an itemized statement listing the basis for any amount  that is being withheld.  </P> <P> Several renters' groups have charged that some landlords arbitrarily withhold  the entire amount or a portion of the security deposit by claiming that the  apartment needed repairs.  </P> <P> However, the injunction specifically enjoins officials of Elerding Properties  from "falsifying any 'vacating statements,' or inflating expenses listed on  'vacating statements' when determining the cost of restoring a vacated unit to  its original condition."  </P> <P> As part of an agreement struck with the district attorney's office, Elerding  Properties has agreed to make available to investigators copies of all written  rental agreements for four years after the termination of each tenancy. The  firm has also agreed to allow its employees and apartment managers to be  interviewed by district attorney's investigators.  </P></p>

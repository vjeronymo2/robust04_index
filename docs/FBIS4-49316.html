			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 5 (AFP)--China expressed "shock and  indignation" Thursday at a Japanese minister's assertion that  the 1937 Nanjing Massacre was a fabrication but stopped short of  demanding an official apology from the new adminstration in  Tokyo. Despite the obvious anger generated in China by Justice  Minister Shiheto Nagano's remarks, analysts here said Beijing  clearly wanted to avoid an emotive row with the government of  Tsutomo Hata, who was only elected Japanese prime minister last  month.    "A cabinet member of the Japanese Government has openly  distorted history and denied the facts to justify the (1937-45)  war of aggression and we feel shock and indignation at that,"  Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said.    Nagano, who was appointed justice minister by Hata last  week,  said in an interview published Wednesday in a major Japanese  daily, that the Nanjing Massacre was a "fabrication" and that it  was "wrong to describe the war as a war of aggression."  According to a Japanese source, the number two at the Japanese  embassy here, Koichi Matsumoto, was summoned to the Foreign  Ministry Thursday morning. "The representation made to Matsumoto  was in line with the comments made by the ministry spokesman,"  the source said, adding that the Chinese side had asked the  Japanese government to "deal seriously" with the matter.    Japanese troops occupied the eastern city of Nanjing in 1937  and slaughtered citizens and prisoners of war. According to the  Chinese authorities, some 300,000 people died in the massacre.    Hata, currently on a European tour, publicly criticised  Nagano's remarks on Wednesday, caling them "inappropriate." "My  view on the past history is that our past actions, including  aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and  sorrow for many people," Hata said.    Asked if Hata's remarks had sufficiently mollified the  Chinese side, spokesman Wu said only: "We have taken note of  Prime Minister Hata's attitude towards the history-distorting  statement... and he also thinks it is inappropriate for the  minister of justice to make such remarks."</p>

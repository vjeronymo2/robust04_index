			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Justinian: The admissibility of evidence The two former City merchant bankers who are awaiting trial on charges arising out of the Guiness affair failed in the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) to have the testimony they both gave to Department of Trade appointed inspectors declared inadmissible at their forthcoming trial. Mr Roger Seelig, former corporate finance director at Morgan Grenfell and Lord Spens, former director of corporate finance at Henry Ansbacher, may have a legitimate grievance that the law does not cover the questioning of those involved in inspectors' investigations under the Companies Act. Answers given by any person to inspectors are admissible in guidance in subsequent proceedings. But are the answers safeguarded in the way that police questioning is? The legal issue is simple enough. Are DTI inspectors within the meaning of the phrase in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, namely 'persons charged with the duty of investigating offences?' If they are, they would be bound to caution witnesses who appeared before them. Even if the inspectors were investigating criminal offences, and there had been a breach of the code established under the 1984 Act, it would still have been in order for the trial judge to admit the evidence. Mr Justice Henry, who will be trying the second Guiness case and who conducted the pre-trial hearing, had decided that fairness to the accused would not be threatened by allowing the evidence to be heard by the jury. (Clearly, the prosecution attached great importance to the admissions made by the two men to the inspectors.) The judge also rejected the claim that improper means had been used to compel the two men to incriminate themselves. The Court of Appeal had little difficulty in concluding that inspectors do not investigate offences of a criminal nature. They investigate events of a commercial or financial nature, in the course of which they are very likely to uncover criminality on the part of one or more of the actors in the events under investigation. The inspectors' task is quintessentially inquisitorial; and the task partakes of none of the aspects of the criminal process which is designed to protect the accused from any oppressive action by criminal investigator or prosecutor. Inquisitions are by design held unremittingly to discover the truth. The English criminal trial, on the other hand, is a restricted method to determine the guilt or innocence of an accused according to a high standard of proof. The trial process is the semblance of truth, or at least may only approximate to the truth. If the inspectors had nevertheless to caution a witness according to a well-recognised formula before asking any questions, or advise that he or she need not answer a question thought to incriminate the witness, it would place an absurd restriction on the ability of the inspectors to uncover all the relevant information. Indeed, it may even be necessary for inspectors to withhold information from a witness until the questioning takes place, or to confront a witness with a highly material document for the first time during the questioning. Such tactics would be regarded as highly irregular in a criminal trial. Inspectors normally try to be fair to witnesses, but in the final analysis their duty is to extract the optimum information and report their findings. Mr Seelig and Lord Spens had asserted that there had been a conspiracy between the inspectors, the DTI, the Serious Fraud Office and police officers that the inspectors would use their statutory powers for an ulterior purpose - namely, to build up a case for preferring criminal charges and not for the purpose of investigating company affairs. Two years ago such a danger was recognised by providing that where evidence of a crime had been uncovered and referred to the prosecuting authority, the minister could discontinue the inspectors' investigation. But those who have to undergo the probing questions of inspectors will doubtless feel that the exercise smacks of a preparation for criminal proceedings. Since criminal charges, not infrequently, do follow these inspectors' reports, such reaction of those investigated is not unreasonable. It all seems unfair. Any unfairness in the procedure is publicly tolerable, indeed necessary in the cause of finding the truth. What becomes less tolerable is the publication of the inspectors' report - always held up pending any criminal proceedings - because the individuals may be revealed for their commercial irresponsibility, if not also for their criminality. Mr Robert Maxwell, the publisher, smarted under the public condemnation of his behaviour as a director over the affairs of Pergamon in the 1970s. It is a common feature of public inquiries generally that prospective witnesses are encouraged to come forward by promises that they will be given immunity in respect of their testimony. The attorney-general then declares that evidence before the inquiry will not be used in any subsequent criminal proceedings. Something akin to that concession would be appropriate for investigations by DTI inspectors. There is even a case for treating the investigation, with its draconian powers, and the public report that follows as a substitute for a criminal trial, leaving it to stockholders or creditors to take proceedings. But that would require an even more sophisticated approach to the dubious value of criminal justice, as opposed to a searching public inquiry and civil action, in unravelling complex financial dealings.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 22, BNS -- Leaders of Russian  community in Estonia don't agree with a statement Nikolay  Yugantsov, Russian Representative Assembly chairman, and Alexey  Zybin, the elder of Russian community, released last week.    The statement demanded that Estonian authorities give  residence permits to all persons registered as residents before  July 1990, except those categories of residents listed in the  aliens law as ineligible, military retirees among them.    Pyotr Rozhok, chairman of Russian community in Estonia's  committee on Russian citizens' problems and representative of  Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party in Estonia, now  issued a counter-statement declaring that his organization  actually wants permanent residence permits for all non-citizens  who lived permanently in Estonia before July 1993 when the  aliens law was adopted.    Rozhok claimed Russian community in Estonia had forbidden  Zybin to speak on behalf of the organization. In his opinion,  the Yugantsov-Zybin statement actually supported "deportation of  military pensioners."    Today's statement was signed, besides Rozhok, by Zybin's  deputy, Stanislav Mikhailov, and another Russian Community  leader, Yuri Kotenkov.</p>

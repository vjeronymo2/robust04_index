			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEMOLITION WORK BEGINS ON FORMER BREWERY BUILDING  </P> <P> Preservationists who had hoped to protect the Aztec Brewery buildings in Barrio  Logan suffered a setback Wednesday when the property's owners began preliminary  demolition of the historic structures.  </P> <P> Crews, operating on provisional permits issued by the city of San Diego, began  tearing out windows and frames on the buildings at 2301 Main St.  </P> <P> "The permits allowed them to pull the windows out (before starting) actual  demolition," a city spokesman said Wednesday. "They might be able to get their  final demolition permit in a day or two."  </P> <P> San Diego City Council members in March agreed to stall demolition for 60 days  in order to give Foote Development Co. one last chance to negotiate a  development agreement with Northern Automotive, the current owner. That permit  delay period ended Tuesday.  </P> <P> Council members in March made it clear that they would allow demolition if  Foote or another developer failed to strike an agreement.  </P> <P> On Monday, a Foote spokesman declined to comment on those discussions. "We have  met, and we have talked," the spokesman said. "But I wouldn't want to  jeopardize the (negotiations) by saying any more than that."  </P> <P> Community groups in the Barrio Logan threatened Monday to seek legal action  aimed at stopping demolition. It was uncertain Wednesday, however, if any court  action had been initiated.  </P> <P> The buildings were erected in 1911 and 1915. The city earlier agreed to  temporarily display murals that were removed from the brewery's rathskeller.  </P></p>

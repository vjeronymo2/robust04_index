			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political </F> adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and head of the  Palestinian delegation to the negotiations with Israel, by  Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo, Egypt; date not given]    [Text] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to the  Palestinian president and head of the Palestinian delegation to  the negotiations with Israel on the implementation of the  autonomy agreement, has stated that the Palestinians are trying  to halt the drive of certain Arab parties toward discussion of  joint projects with Israel. He revealed that, at President  Yasir 'Arafat's request, African leader Nelson Mandela agreed  not to visit Israel before the emergence of the Palestinian  national authority. He stressed the importance of the boycott  card to the Palestinian negotiators.    In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Sha'th said that it would not  be proper for the Israeli Labor Party to offer the Palestinian  less than what Likud offered for peace with Egypt. He stressed  that four categories now have the right to return. They are the  1967 refugees, investors, officers and soldiers, and members of  the national authority in the family reunion framework. He also  confirmed that the PLO is in favor of a general amnesty for  collaborators with the occupation authorities "with the  exception of those who have killed Palestinians."    Sha'th warned against Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's  backtracking from the commitment to the dates for the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles. He also said  that "the Israeli Army's assumption of responsibility for the  negotiations does not necessarily mean obstructing these  negotiations."    On this week's negotiation agenda, Sha'th said: "The  negotiators will complete discussion of the security procedures  for Gaza and Jericho, particularly in relation to the coast, the  air, and the sea." He said he does not expect the discussion of  these procedures to last "longer than this week, and that  includes agreement on the security corridor between Gaza and  Jericho."    He added that "what is required during this round is that we  should have a final draft agreement and the text pertaining to  the presence of UN forces." He said that the water issue will  be discussed by the committee responsible for the transfer of  civilian authority on Thursday [24 February] following the  completion last week of the discussions of issues related to  antiquities, state land, and regional planning. Discussion of  the issues of the detainees in the context of a document of  general amnesty for the Palestinian detainees will also be  resumed, he added. He also said: "We will spend two nights  drafting the final agreement, but it will only be complete next  week, at the end of which President 'Arafat and Rabin will  supposedly be invited to resolve six pending issues and then  sign the final agreement."    Sha'th said that Rado Meister, head of the International Red  Cross Commission in Israel and the occupied territory, handed  him in Taba last week a list containing the number of registered  detainees based on the latest statistics, totaling 9,400  detainees.    Sha'th cautioned that despite the expectations "it is  difficult to give a specific date for the signing because of  certain issues, some related and some not related to the  agreement." They include "the continuous Israeli attempts to  pit the Israeli-Syrian track against the Israeli-Palestinian  track and delay one on account of the other," and they also  include "exploitation of the internal situation in Israel and  Rabin's attempts to exert pressure for retreat from what is  known as the sacred dates."    Sha'th said that one "should beware of Rabin's attempts to  waive the commitment on dates" because "the sanctity of the  dates, as opposed to lack of it, is one of the most important  positive aspects of the Oslo agreement. By that I mean the fact  that there is a specific timetable for each step."    Giving his explanation of the fact that the Palestinian side  has recently been speaking of positive developments in the  negotiations despite the fears resulting from the Israeli Army's  interference in the negotiation process, Sha'th said that "it is  partly a question of who is negotiating.... The army does not  necessarily always obstruct, but the Israeli Army wanted to have  control of the negotiating process."    He added: "When civilians conduct the negotiations, the army  obstructs the process and when (Shim'on) Peres negotiates, Rabin  obstructs...but, ultimately, all the Israeli parties, with the  exception of the right-wing hardliners and some Likud leaders,  want a solution because peace is more in the interest of Israel  than it is in the interest of the Palestinians although peace is  more urgent for us." He added that when "one party takes charge  of the negotiations it tries to make progress, contrary to its  predecessor."    On the question of Rabin linking the issue of the release of  detainees to an amnesty for agents or "collaborators" and their  absorption in Palestinian society, Sha'th said that "the PLO is  not less formidable than Hamas, which has opened the way for the  collaborators to join it..., because we should give everyone who  collaborated with the Israelis under pressure and terrorization  a chance, with the exception of the collaborators who committed  murder crimes against Palestinian citizens, for as Israel made  all the strugglers accountable for every killing operation even  though that was legitimate resistance, the least we can do is  make the collaborators accountable for their crims."    Sha'th emphasized that "the PLO is not against a general  amnesty for all those who made mistakes, so they can return and  participate in building their homeland."    He revealed that, in Rabin's view, the general amnesty  should  cover the Israeli soldiers who opened fire on Palestinians  without orders. He pointed out that the target "is an amnesty  for all the Palestinians and Israelis who took part in battles."    On the Arab League's announcement that the question of  ending  the third-degree Arab boycott of companies dealing with Israel  would be raised at the Arab League Council's meeting on 27  March, Sha'th criticized the calls for an end to the boycott and  emphasized that "we should not pay a price to the Israelis in  advance because they charge us for every centimeter, every line,  and every word. Everything should be taken into account."    He added: "There can be no naivete in politics. Some say we  should concede to the Israelis and God will reward us." Sha'th  proposed "a timetable for comprehensive peace, similar to the  interim timetable for negotiations on the Palestinian-Israeli  track."    Asked if the PLO has held consultations with some Arab  parties to halt their drive toward discussion of joint projects  with Israel, Sha'th disclosed that there have been "Palestinian  efforts on that matter." He added that "African leader Nelson  Mandela responded to a request by President 'Arafat -- during  their meeting in the Netherlands last week -- not to accept an  invitation to visit Israel until after the establishment of the  Palestinian national authority." He continued: "If Mandela has  responded it is even more appropriate that the Arab brothers  should respond."    On Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' statements about  not allowing the Palestinians in the diaspora to return and  whether that matter was raised in the negotiations, Sha'th said:  "Any Palestinian in the diaspora who decides to go to Gaza or  Jericho is entitled to an entry visa from the national authority  which can be extended to any period under one year..., and any  Palestinian in the diaspora who wants a permanent residence can  now have that in the context of family reunion, and that covers  investors, officers and soldiers, members of the national  authority, and everyone who has been out of the country since  1967."    He added: "The Palestinians in the diaspora since 1948 who  do not fall under the aforementioned categories are now entitled  to visit, but the question of full repatriation for them will be  resolved when the refugee problem is solved."    On 'Arafat's assertion, before the signing of the Cairo  agreement, that "Palestine is back on the map," and whether that  reflects a conviction that the agreement was the first step  toward a Palestinian state, Sha'th said: "There can be no  solution without a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its  capital..., and there is no such thing as comprehensive and  durable peace without Israeli withdrawal from every inch  occupied in 1967.... The Egyptians fought six years for every  last inch of Taba, where we are holding our negotiations, and  did not leave a single settler on that territory."    He added: "Likud accepted that. So the Labor Party should  not offer us anything less than Likud did." He continued:  "Every current step is a step toward a state, but everything at  the appropriate time and stage."</p>

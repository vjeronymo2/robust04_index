			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on 16 April  warned that Paraguayan businessmen who "want to invest in the  Caribbean island will have to endure a lot of pressure. There  must be no doubt about this. But if he overcomes this stage of  foreign pressure he can be quite sure he will be successful."    He explained that the lack of raw materials or qualified  labor is not the investment problem in Cuba; it is the pressure  that will be applied by U.S. businessmen. "For every 10 people  who want to invest in Cuba, only two stay because he who  believes he is the owner of the hemisphere and the world  threatens the businessmen with ruining their businesses in other  places," he said.    Notwithstanding, he invited, as he has done in other South  American countries, a group of Paraguayans to visit Cuba and  learn about its reality, and where they will have the  opportunity of talking with specialists in various sectors and  thus observe what is occurring in Cuba. He also indicated that  they will be able to speak with foreign businessmen who already  have risked investing in the island so they can learn the truth.    When he was asked whether trade would be difficult because  Paraguay does not maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, he  said no. "Diplomatic relations are not justified when the  benefits do not reach the people. In that case it is much more  convenient to have trade relations so we Cubans do not keep our  products and so Latin America can sell us what we need," he  said. As an example, he indicated that diplomatic relations  with Colombia began through trade relations.    Robaina concluded his unofficial visit to our country during  the afternoon of 16 April. At 1530 he went to Silvio Pettirossi  Airport to board a private plane, in which he arrived on 15  April, to fly to Posadas (Argentina)</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CONE GETS BACK AT ASTROS, 2-1  </P> <P> Unaccustomed as he became to losing last season when he came from nowhere to  post the best record in the majors, David Cone has been disappointed in his  start this season.  </P> <P> The New York Mets' right-hander, pushed into the starting rotation last season  after being 5-6 as a rookie reliever in 1987, finished with a 20-3 record. He  did not lose his second game last season until July 4 and played a key role as  the Mets won in the East.  </P> <P> Imagine his chagrin last Sunday when the light-hitting Houston Astros pounded  him for seven hits and seven runs in 2 1/3 innings and handed him his second  defeat this season.  </P> <P> Cone was impressive against the Astros Saturday in New York when he pitched the  Mets into first place with a 2-1 victory.  </P> <P> Howard Johnson's third-inning two-run home run gave Cone the runs he needed and  he pitched a five-hitter, striking out eight, to improve his record to 3-2. In  27 games, the Mets are 16-11 but have had only two complete games, both by  Cone.  </P> <P> Nobody was as cognizant of the change in Cone as Glenn Davis, the man who  carries the Astros' offense. Sunday Davis tagged him for two hits. This time it  was a mismatch. Cone struck him out four times.  </P> <P> "He looked like Cy Young against me today," Davis said. "It was a combination  of breaking stuff and me getting myself out with bad swings."  </P> <P> Cone thought he might have turned everything around. "There's no better way to  redeem yourself than to come back and pitch well against the team that beat  you," he said.  </P> <P> The Astros scored in the sixth and loaded the bases with one out in the  seventh. But Cone induced Ken Caminiti to hit a grounder to second baseman  Gregg Jefferies who turned it into a double play. The middle man was shortstop,  Howard Johnson.  </P> <P> Manager Davey Johnson is going to find a spot for the hot-hitting Johnson.  After moving into the No. 2 spot in the order, Johnson has hit in 11 of 12  games with five home runs and 14 runs batted in.  </P> <P> It was a tough loss for Jim Clancy, facing the Mets for the first time. He  escaped a first-inning jam largely because of the Mets' poor baserunning. But  the one Met who faced him when he pitched for Toronto beat him.  </P> <P> "I guess I remembered him," Johnson said. "I had my first major league hit off  him. I had gone 0 for 3 in Toronto when I singled against him.  </P> <P> "I had told our players that Clancy would come right at you. He'll win a lot of  games for them."  </P> <P> Only if the Astros find some offense to go with Davis.  </P> <P> San Francisco 9, St. Louis 0 -- Rick Reuschel, who will be 40 later this month,  moved within a victory of No. 200 by giving up five hits in six innings to halt  the Cardinals in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Sixty-six of Reuschel's victories have come since 1982, when everyone thought  arm problems had ended his career.  </P> <P> Instead, he appears to be getting better with age. He won 19 for the Giants  last season and is 5-2 despite aching knees this season.  </P> <P> Reuschel, who departed with an 8-0 lead, left because he wants to save wear and  tear on the knees. He will try for No. 200 at Montreal Friday night.  </P> <P> The Giants jumped on Jose DeLeon and finished him off with six runs in less  than two innings. DeLeon (5-2) came in having limited opponents to a .152  average. He retired only five batters and gave up seven hits.  </P> <P> "Jose was due for one of those," Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said. "He had  nothing. Reuschel was the same as always. He throws a little slider, and a  little sinker and he doesn't let you run."  </P> <P> The Cardinals also lost left fielder Vince Coleman, who strained his right  hamstring beating out a bunt in the eighth.  </P> <P> Atlanta 13, Montreal 3 -- Only the Dodgers have a worse team batting average  than the Braves.  </P> <P> The Braves got 19 hits against Pascual Perez (0-4) and three other pitchers,  including infielder Tim Wallach, en route to their fourth consecutive victory.  </P> <P> Andre Thomas drove in five runs at Atlanta, Jody Davis four and Lonnie Smith  and Ron Gant hit home runs as the Braves improved to 14-17 and climbed out of  the cellar in the West.  </P> <P> A year ago the Braves were 9-22, 10 games behind and already talking about next  year.  </P> <P> Wallach gave up an unearned run in one inning. Monday night in a 19-6 loss to  Cincinnati, infielder Tom Foley took a turn on the mound.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 7, Philadelphia 4 -- Todd Benzinger hit a go-ahead single in the  fifth inning at Cincinnati, and Paul O'Neill and Ron Oester each drove in two  runs.  </P> <P> Mike Schmidt drove in two runs for the Phillies, who twice wasted one-run leads  and lost for the fifth time in six games.  </P> <P> Schmidt, who drove in 62 runs in 106 games last season, has driven in 24 in 28  games this season.  </P> <P> Padres 4, Pirates 2 -- Mark Parent, subbing for slumping Benito Santiago, drove  in all four San Diego runs with a sacrifice fly and a three-run homer as the  Padres ended a three-game losing streak at San Diego.  </P> <P> Bruce Hurst (4-2) held Pittsburgh hitless until one-out doubles by Barry Bonds  and Jose Lind in the sixth inning made the score 1-1. Hurst left after yielding  one-out singles to Bonds and Lind in the eighth inning and Mark Davis went the  rest of the way for his major leagues-leading 12th save in 12 opportunities.

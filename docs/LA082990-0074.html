			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDIS READY FOR GAS ATTACK, SAY DEATHS WOULD BE FEW  </P> <P> Civil defense officials have ordered more than 2 million gas masks and are  preparing to distribute them at fire stations and shopping centers to protect  against a chemical weapons attack that could come with as little as five  minutes' warning, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The government has also set up evacuation centers for every major city in Saudi  Arabia's Eastern province and fitted sirens on a fleet of vehicles to warn  residents in the event of an attack.  </P> <P> Civil defense authorities said they are confident they would be able to limit  casualties if Iraq were to attack Saudi population centers with chemical  weapons, though to what extent depends on the warning time and the steps people  take to protect themselves.  </P> <P> "I think if all the people stayed inside the house, I think no more of a  problem than 10 or 15 dead, (of the) people who stay outside," said Col.  Mohammed Magrabi, head of Saudi Arabia's 3,000-strong civil defense forces.  </P> <P> "But in our religion, if my God wants a man to die, yes, he will die, if he is  inside the door or outside the door."  </P> <P> In a tour of civil defense facilities for foreign reporters, Saudi officials  displayed fleets of ambulances, fire trucks, vans, bulldozers and cargo  vehicles, along with warehouses packed with firefighting equipment.  </P> <P> Training classes are under way for a new volunteer civil defense force of 1,000  recruits, which will be supplemented by an additional 1,000 in the coming  weeks, Magrabi said.  </P> <P> The siren-equipped vehicles are to roam the streets in case of an imminent  attack, warning people to go indoors.  </P> <P> "We will tell them if he's outside, cover your head and just try to run away  against the wind," said Capt. Jamil Arbaein. "Get inside. Close the door, shut  off the air conditioner, close the windows. If there's a mask, put it on. But  you have to get inside as soon as possible. It shouldn't be more than one  minute."  </P> <P> Civil defense headquarters is connected by telephone hot line to air force  radar stations, allowing sirens to be sounded all over the province if an  incoming missile or aircraft is sighted. Magrabi estimates that the authorities  would have five minutes' warning time of an incoming missile, and more time  with aircraft.  </P> <P> Magrabi said residents of Eastern province, which is nearest the Kuwaiti  border, where tens of thousands of Iraqi troops are massed, have seemed to be  reassured since the civil defense authorities distributed brochures telling  them what to do in the event of a chemical attack and published statements  minimizing the likelihood of an attack on Saudi cities.  </P> <P> "The danger of the eastern region being hit with a chemical event is very low,"  Magrabi said, "because we have enough weapons to destroy all (Iraq's) weapons  in this area. Maybe we will get one or two (direct hits). But this is not  enough to make it a dangerous area."  </P></p>

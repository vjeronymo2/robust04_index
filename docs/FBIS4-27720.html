			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Jun 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Cable News  Network (CNN) of the United States has agreed to carry a denial  of its report that Malaysia supplied arms to Bosnian Muslims,  Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat said Sunday.    The television station would also contact the Malaysian  Embassy in Washington to rectify the error, he told reporters in  southern Johor state.    CNN had recently carried a report saying that Malaysia had  supplied light weapons to the Muslim army in war-torn  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Mohamed said the government did not want to pick a quarrel  with the CNN over the report but hoped that the western media  including CNN would be fair and accurate in their reporting,  particularly on Malaysia.    We only wanted a clarification from CNN... But they said  they  will carry a denial, which is very good as we want fair  reporting, he said, adding that CNN had written to him a few  days ago.</p>

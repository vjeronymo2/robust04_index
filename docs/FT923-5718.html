			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Survey of Malaysia (3): 'Our market has matured and deserves attention' / Profile of Rashid Hussein, stockbroker and exemplar of Malay business skill IN THE 1960s Mr Rashid Hussein went to London as a law student. Disenchanted with the legal world, he switched to philosophy. Finally he pushed Kant aside and moved into stockbroking. Mr Rashid now runs the Rashid Hussein company (RHB), the first stockbroking firm in Malaysia to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange and the largest capital market specialist in the country. He is listed as one of the country's 25 richest directors: RHB, with pre-tax profits of MDollars 68m in 1991, has its own modern office block in the middle of Kuala Lumpur (the Rashid Hussein 1) and recently purchased a controlling stake in the country's fifth largest bank. Mr Rashid, still only in his mid-40s, was born in Singapore but changed to Malaysian citizenship while away studying in London. He is often pointed to as a leading example of Bumiputra - or Malay - entrepreneurial skill. 'I did not come from a poor background, but my family was certainly not a very wealthy one,' says Mr Rashid. He discovered a flair for stockbroking when he worked in the City of London in the early 1970s. 'When I returned to Malaysia in the mid-1970s stockbroking here was a real bucket shop business.' Mr Rashid started to do investment research. He then joined Bumiputera Merchant Bank, at that time part managed by Rothschilds, and became its first Malaysian fund manager in 1976. 'It was very difficult at first. Customers, particularly locals, were unused to dealing with a Malaysian fund manager. They preferred to deal with foreigners. It took time to build up confidence and trust.' By 1983, he had grown tired of banking and returned to stockbroking, setting up Rashid Hussein Securities. 'I realised that, although things were happenning in Malaysia, a lot of stockbroking business was going elsewhere, particularly to Singapore'. The opening of Rashid Hussein Securities coincided with a recession in Malaysia, which swept away half Kuala Lumpur's stockbrokers. Rashid Hussein survived, and in 1988 went public, a move fiercely contested by the authorities. 'They didn't like the idea at all, but my argument was that I could show them more banking failures than stockbroking failures. Most people thought I was mad, but we needed capital to diversify into other financial areas in order to take advantage of the deregulation going on in Malaysia and the corporatisation or privatisation process.' The Rashid Hussein company has certainly done well out of Malaysia's privatisation policy. RHB was lead manager, along with Morgan Stanley, in the late 1990 partial privatisation of Telekom Malaysia, the state telephone utility. The privatisation involved the issuance of a USDollars 190.15m sovereign bond, and was heavily oversubscribed. Mr Rashid is married to the daughter of Mr Kuok Hock Nien, one of south-east Asia's wealthiest businessmen, who heads a hotel, shipping and trading empire. Competitors say such a connection gives Mr Rashid a distinct business advantage: they also allege that a large measure of RHB's success is dependent on Mr Rashid's connections with leading political figures. 'That's rubbish,' he replies. 'It's only envy. No one in their right mind would think that the authorities would give you business if they thought you couldn't deliver.' For more than 20 years, the Malaysian government has had a policy of positive discrimination in favour of the Malay majority, in order to give Malays a greater share of national wealth. Mr Rashid admits that he has been helped by this Bumiputera policy. 'If it had not been for the Bumiputera policy, it would not have been easy to start off my business. There was help with various banking facilities, but still it is wrong to conclude that this alone is responsible for RHB's success. There's an awful lot of competition in the financial market here now.' Largely due to privatisations, plus a host of new companies coming to the market, the Kuala Lumpur exchange is now south-east Asia's largest. Although about 30 per cent of total funds on the market come from foreign sources, Mr Rashid feels the main financial centres still do not take Malaysia seriously enough: 'Many foreign investors still see Kuala Lumpur as one of the world's colourful, rather exotic markets. They play with it, moving funds around. It's still seen as a rather volatile market. Yet it has matured considerably, and is worth much more attention.' RHB now plans more regional moves. RHB was the first Malaysian stockbroking company to win approval to buy a stake in a Singapore-based stockbroking firm. The company is doing substantial business in Hong Kong, and there are plans for expansion to the UK and US. 'We are going at things carefully, but there's no reason why we Malaysians cannot compete with the biggest and the best,' says Mr Rashid.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / ANC backs away from conflict over plan THE African National Congress yesterday backed away from confrontation with the South African government over a proposed plan for multi-racial power sharing. The organisation's policy-making national exeuctive committee yesterday decided to endorse the plan, which calls for a multi-party interim government to rule until the end of the century, reversing an earlier decision to refer the deal back to its membership for approval. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC Secretary General, said the decision had been unanimous. However as he spoke in Johannesburg, Mr Chris Hani, a prominent ANC leader and general secretary of the South African Communist Party, contradicted him in a speech in Cape Town, saying the ANC would share power with the National Party in a 'government of national unity' only for about nine months - the time it would take to write a new constitution - and not for the five years announced by Mr Ramaphosa. Mr Ramaphosa's success at pushing the deal through the national executive could give a boost to multi-party negotiations on a new constitution, with the first round of talks due to take place next week. However, there are many crucial issues which remain unresolved in the outline agreement due to be debated in the talks, including whether power-sharing in the interim government should be voluntary or compulsory. Another area of dispute will be the cabinet mechanism for decision-taking: Mr Ramaphosa insists that the majority party will dominate cabinet except in certain limited cases where a two-thirds majority will be required.</p>

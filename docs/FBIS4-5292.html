			<p>BFN     [Text] At a regular news conference on 7 April, Tetsuya  Nishimoto, Joint Staff Council Chairman of the Self-Defense  Forces [SDF], touched on the issue of North Korea's suspected  development of nuclear weapons. Asked about rescuing Japanese  staying in South Korea if the situation on the Korean peninsula  should become tense, he said: "Our operation should not deviate  from the law. Japanese staying there will feel relieved when a  bill on revising the SDF Law submitted to the Diet passes  through the Diet. I hope the bill will be adopted as early as  possible." In this way, he expressed hopes that the bill on  revising the SDF Law which allows the SDF to use  government-owned planes for rescue operations will be enacted at  an early date.</p>

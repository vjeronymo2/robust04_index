			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAYHIKE: THE WALK TO SAN MATEO POINT BEGINS IN SAN CLEMENTE  </P> <P> "Our beach shall always be free from hurdy-gurdies and defilement. We believe  beauty to be an asset as well as gold and silver, or cabbage and potatoes."  </P> <P> This was the pledge of Norwegian immigrant Ole Hanson, who began the town of  San Clemente in 1925. It was quite a promise from a real-estate developer,  quite a promise in those days of shameless boosterism half a century before the  California Coastal Commission was established.  </P> <P> Thanks in part to Hanson's vision, some of the peaceful ambiance of San  Clemente, which he regarded as "a painting 5 miles long and a mile wide," has  been preserved. And some of its isolation too. Most everyone in the real-estate  community thought Hanson crazy for building in a locale 66 miles from San Diego  and 66 miles from Los Angeles, but today this isolation attracts rather than  repels. Isolation was one of the reasons former President Richard Nixon  (1969-74) established his Western White House on the bluffs above San Clemente  Beach.  </P> <P> San Clemente Beach is a great place for a walk. The beach is mercifully walled  off from the din of the San Diego Freeway and the confusion of the modern world  by a handsome line of tan-colored bluffs. Only the occasional train passing  over Santa Fe Railroad tracks located near the shore interrupts the cry of the  gull, the roar of the breakers. The trestles, located at the south end of San  Clemente Beach at San Mateo Point, gave Trestles Beach its name.  </P> <P> Trestles Beach is one of the finest surfing areas on the West Coast. When the  surf is up, the waves peel rapidly across San Mateo Point, creating a great  ride.  </P> <P> Before the area became part of the state beach, it was restricted government  property belonging to Camp Pendleton Marine Base. For more than 25 years,  surfers carried on guerrilla warfare with U.S. Marines: Trespassing surfers  were chased, arrested and fined, and on many occasions had their boards  confiscated and broken in two. Find a veteran surfer and he'll tell you about  escapes from Jeep patrols and guard dogs. Many times, however, the cool Marines  charitably gave surfers rides while out on maneuvers.  </P> <P> This hike's destination, San Mateo Point, is the northernmost boundary of San  Diego County and the beginning of Orange County. When the original counties of  Los Angeles and San Diego were set up in 1850, the line that separated them  began on the coast at San Mateo Point. When Orange County was formed from  southern Los Angeles County in 1889, San Mateo Point was established as the  southern point of the new county. You can have the fun of sunning in one  county, swimming in another.  </P> <P> Hikers with the time and inclination can easily extend this beach walk several  miles south to San Onofre State Beach. Another option worth considering is to  take the train to San Clemente and walk south from the Amtrak station.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: From the San Diego Freeway (Interstate 5) in San  Clemente, exit on Avenida Calafia and head west a half-mile to Calafia Beach  Park, where there is metered parking. You can also park for a fee at San  Clemente State Beach. A limited amount of free parking is available in the  residential area near the state beach.  </P> <P> The hike: From Calafia Beach Park, cross the railroad tracks, make your way  down an embankment and head south. As you'll soon see, San Clemente State Beach  is frequented by plenty of shore birds, as well as plenty of surfers, body  surfers and swimmers.  </P> <P> At distinct San Mateo Point, which marks the border of Orange and San Diego  counties, you'll find San Mateo Creek. The headwaters of the creek rise high in  the Santa Ana Mountains above Camp Pendleton. A portion of the creek is  protected by the Cleveland National Forest's San Mateo Canyon Wilderness.  Rushes, salt grass and cattails line the creek mouth, where sandpipers, herons  and egrets gather.  </P> <P> Ford the creek mouth (rarely a problem except after winter storms) and continue  south toward San Onofre State Beach and the giant domes of San Onofre Nuclear  Power Plant. Or you can return the same way.  </P> <P> Here's a third alternative, an inland return route: Walk under the train  trestles and join the park service road, which is usually filled with surfers  carrying their boards. The service road takes you up the bluffs, joins the San  Clemente Coastal Bike Trail, then winds through a residential area to an  entrance to San Clemente State Beach Campground. Improvise a route through the  campground to the park's entry station and join a footpath next to the station.  </P> <P> The path descends through a prickly pear-filled draw to Calafia Beach Park and  the trailhead. The wind- and water-sculpted marine terraces just south of the  trailhead resemble Bryce Canyon in miniature and are fun to photograph.  </P> <P> TRESTLES TRAIL: San Clemente State Beach to San Mateo Point; 3 miles round  trip.  </P></p>

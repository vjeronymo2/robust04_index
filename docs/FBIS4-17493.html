			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Apr -- Reserves for extinguishing the  Bosnian conflict by peaceful means have not yet been exhausted  and Boris Yeltsin's initiative is more likely than bombing and  shelling to lead to an end to the war. This opinion was  expressed by Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Security Council, in  an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He reported that  the Bosnian question was discussed at a meeting of the Security  Council which had heard a report from Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev as well as detailed information about the Russian  president's initiative.    Oleg Lobov considers that a top-level meeting of the leaders  of the world's leading countries and UN and CSCE  representatives, with the participation of the warring sides,  could yield the most positive results.    The Security Council secretary said that at the present time  drafting work is being actively carried out on the concept of  economic security. It is planned to examine the concept at a  meeting of the council in November. Alongside military and  social security, economic security is one of the most important  areas of the council's activities.    The aim of the economic security program, Oleg Lobov said,  is  to stabilize the situation in the economy and to seek ways out  of the crisis. Meanwhile, even before the program is adopted, a  number of questions are being urgently tackled. These are  questions connected with privatization, providing the Russian  populace with medicines, the ecological problem, and land  fertility. In the opinion of the Security Council secretary  these could be described as global problems.</p>

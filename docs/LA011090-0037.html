			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> GUIDE FOR THE DISGRUNTLED MAY HAVE YOUR NUMBER  </P> <P> Question: Like a lot of people, I frequently feel the need to complain to  someone -- anyone -- when I feel that I've been ripped off. But where do I  start? Writing to a department store, for instance, is like dropping the letter  into a big hole. Any suggestions? -- G.M.  </P> <P> Answer: Even with a Rolodex filled with consumer-oriented contacts, I know and  share your bafflement. You should find a new publication by San Francisco-based  Consumer Action invaluable, however. It's the 1989-1990 edition of the group's  16-page pamphlet, "Consumer Services Guide," and it includes the addresses and  telephone numbers of regulatory and law-enforcement government agencies,  business-sponsored complaint resolution offices, nonprofit information and  referral organizations and agencies that offer free, or low-cost, legal  assistance. I use it constantly.  </P> <P> You can get a copy by sending $1 for postage and handling to: Consumer Action,  116 New Montgomery St., San Francisco, Calif. 94105. Free copies of the guide  are available in bulk to community-based organizations.  </P> <P> Q: I was deeply disappointed in the answer you gave recently on the way the  California Lottery publicizes its large prizes -- a deceptive and fraudulent  practice. Instead of condemning it for the deception that it is, you condoned  it, and you further muddied the waters with a discussion of taxes.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most basic concept in all of economics is the notion of the time  value of money. A dollar to be paid tomorrow is not worth as much as a dollar  paid today. The only way you can call that lottery prize "a million dollars" is  to assume that interest rates are zero.  </P> <P> The quote that a lottery representative gave you: "the money we spend to pay a  $1-million prize is exactly half that," is a bald-faced admission of that lie.  Your newspaper could end the deception tomorrow. All it would take would be for  you to agree that whenever you run a story about a lottery prize, the number in  the article and the number in the headline should be the present value of the  award. -- K.G.M.  </P> <P> A: I wouldn't presume to argue with a university professor of mathematics even  if I didn't agree with you in principle.  </P> <P> I quite understand the concept of the value of money and I am not condoning the  lottery or the people charged with conducting it. I explained the state's  rationale for doing it the way it does it -- to keep public interest in the  lottery at a fever pitch. I don't recall saying that I approved of this  fun-with-figures way of presenting it.  </P> <P> I agree with you -- any state lottery is a piece of fluff right from the time  you buy a $1 ticket, only 50 cents of which goes into the "pot" in the first  place. And, with odds of 14- to 16-million-to-1, this is "gambling" in about  the same way that diving blindfolded, and armed with a spear, into an  Olympic-sized swimming pool containing two guppies is "going fishing."  </P> <P> This is pure fantasy. The state knows it and the lottery players know it and,  speaking of odds, I will lay odds that the next person hitting a "$10-million"  top prize doesn't give a diddly what the "present value" of that $10 million  really is -- he sees 20 annual payments of (before taxes) $500,000.  </P> <P> Q: Last April, American Continental Corp. declared bankruptcy. I am 76 years  old and my wife is 67. We had invested $45,000 in this company. It was money  earned with hard work to provide an extra income to supplement our Social  Security. About 25,000 other investors were involved, and the company used the  money to buy luxury cars and houses.  </P> <P> We don't know where to turn. Is there any law in this country to protect the  little investor? -- Z.L.  </P> <P> A: I wish we could be more optimistic here, but it's going to take a long time  for the federal regulators to muddle through the complex, overlapping affairs  of American Continental and its many subsidiaries -- the principal one being  Lincoln Savings, which did, indeed, sell about $200 million in bonds to  individual investors. And most of those investors, unfortunately, are in the  same boat as you. Bondholders like you fall under the heading of "unsecured  creditors" and, in the pay-back line, are behind the other creditors holding  so-called "secured" claims on the company.  </P> <P> "Laws to protect the little investor," alas, don't really work. With any  investment there must be some degree of risk. There are laws, of course,  requiring that the degree of that risk be fully disclosed. And this is where  tightening up is called for. All you can really do, I'm afraid, is hope that  enough of American Continental's assets can be sold off to get the bondholders  at least a portion of their (your) money back.  </P></p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Broker boost to properties PROPERTY shares were sent surging forward yesterday as one leading agency broker issued a major buy note on the sector, producing the highest turnover in Land Securities, the UK's biggest property group, for nearly four years. James Capel's decision to turn positive on the sector came as a result of Tuesday's Budget, where changes to advance corporation tax meant that property stocks were yielding an all-time high against the equity market for gross funds. Capel's Mr Alan Carter said: 'Even though the sector has shown some gains of late, we believe there is further recovery to come.' The broker's recommendations sent the shares of all the leading stocks sharply forward. Land Securities advanced 11 to 517p in very heavy turnover of 8.5m, while British Land gained 12 at 275p, Brixton Estates 7 at 197p, Great Portland Estates 7 at 169p, Greycoat 3 1/2 at 19p and MEPC 13 at 418p. The only stock Capel was not recommending was Hammerson, where the broker believes the recent bid spec-ulation has taken the shares too high. Yesterday the 'A' shares closed a penny firmer at 376p and the ordinary 8 ahead at 416p. Second line property issues rode on the coat tails of the leaders' rise. Frogmore Estates appreciated 7 to 398p, Helical Bar 6 to 152p, Speyhawk 2 to 14 1/2 p and Chesterfield Properties 28 to 253p. However, other property analysts expressed a more cautious view. Mr Graham Stanley at NatWest Securities said a blanket rerating of the sector was untimely and that pension and gross fund investors, although underweight, would be selective in their investments.</p>

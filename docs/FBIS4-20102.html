			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by Peter </F> Snow in London on 25 April from the "Newsnight" program --  recorded]    [Text] [Snow] I spoke to the Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd, and I asked him whether the world wouldn't take this rush  of meetings in London to mean that all was confusion and  indecision.    [Hurd] Everyone today was clear on the military side. The  Bosnian Serbs have to pull out beyond Gorazde, out of the  exclusion zone, or they run the risk of being struck, so that's  clear.    [Snow] Their troops as well, their infantry, all of them?    [Hurd] Their heavy weapons, the ones laid down in the NATO  decision. But what we're also clear about is that the efforts  being made by the Russians, by the Europeans, by the Americans  for a negotiated settlement have got to be brought together, and  that's the meaning and purpose of the contact group meeting here  in the Foreign Office tomorrow. All of them together for the  first time.    [Snow] Now the other part of tomorrow night's ultimatum  talks  about the other safe areas which are declared outside Sarajevo,  Gorazde, and beyond that. How can you declare the intention  that you have of protecting those safe areas with air strikes,  when it failed in Gorazde?    [Hurd] Well, hasn't failed in Sarajevo and provided there  are....    [Snow, interrupting] We're talking about in Gorazde....    [Hurd, interrupting] It hasn't worked so far in Gorazde and  there's been hideous suffering and atrocity meanwhile. This  comes down to the question of troops for the UN forces, because  you need people on the ground, as well as forces in the air;  it's something we discussed today. The troops contributors are  not coming forward, the blockage is now the money, and it is  extremely important that in the coming weeks everybody, but  particularly the Americans, unloose the purse-strings so that  the United Nations can actually put into the field the forces  which it will need to implement peace as peace grows, as we hope  it will.    [Snow] But they're not there at the moment, and yet you're  declaring that you will protect these safe areas. Am I right?    [Hurd] They are there at the moment. Every one of the safe  areas that you mentioned, except Gorazde, has UN forces in  them....    [Snow, interrupting] Enough?    [Hurd] Enough for the purpose of the Security Council  resolution and the NATO decision. If we were to extend that  principle to other areas, not named -- and you are perfectly  right, we don't at the moment have the resources, which is why  we are not doing that.    [Snow] But let me be clear. You are saying that if the Serbs  try in Zepa, in Srebrenica, in Tuzla, what they did in Gorazde  -- you know you will be able to stop them?    [Hurd] I believe we will be able to stop them. There are  troops there, and they now have a clear warning, a clear  decision about an exclusion zone. Neither of those facts were  there in Gorazde last week.    [Snow] Do you think on the whole, looking back over this  whole thing, it was a mistake to commit yourself to principles,  to policies, that you simply were unwilling to defend in  practice?    [Hurd] The safe areas -- the Security Council named them as  safe areas and at the same time appealed for troops. We  responded, the French responded, one or two other countries  responded, but the total response was inadequate. So you got  the situation which haunts us from Goradze....    [Snow, interrupting] Why didn't you say they weren't safe  any more? Why didn't you say they are not safe, those safe areas?    [Hurd] Because then that of course is an immediate incentive  to overrun them, but when we got to Maglaj this year, I made it  quite clear that we could not support naming new safe areas,  until there were troops to make them safe. Which is what has  happened in Maglaj. So there is a lesson to be drawn there.  But I believe now as regards the areas which have been covered  it will be possible to secure them.    [Snow] So looking very broadly ahead at a timetable, this  contact group sits down tomorrow, it works out guidelines for  the way forward from here. When, realistically, would you hope  to see a cease-fire throughout Bosnia?    [Hurd] I think it's a cessation of hostilities, i.e. it's a  bit more than just a cease-fire, it's actually getting the heavy  weapons, it's dealing with it in the same way as Sarajevo has  been dealt with. I can't tell you the answer to that. I think  the Bosnian Muslims will be reluctant simply to see the Serbs  sit on the existing lines with any air of permanence. Therefore  one has to link the cessation of hostilities with the effort and  the pressure to get the Serbs to withdraw into the sort of map  which has to be agreed and gives them a fair but not excessive  share of the Bosnia in which all three communities have to live.    [Snow] Do you think if we look very coolly at what the Serbs  have achieved so far, do you think they must be very nearly at  the limit of what they actually aim to achieve in terms of  conquest?    [Hurd] But they won't be able to retain it. There's no real  life there, and in order to get life going again for themselves  and their children, they are going to have to withdraw from a  large part of the territory they occupy. That is what -- the  contact group is just a diplomatic technique -- but that is what  the rest of the world, including the Russians, have to point out  to them.</p>

Briefing the heads of foreign missions in Dhaka yesterday, he  said the serious environmental problems being faced by  Bangladesh call for urgent international attention. Some of  these problems are within the capacity of Bangladesh to solve,  but much of them are caused by external harnessing of shared  international water resources.

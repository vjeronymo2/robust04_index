			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Field valued at Pounds 148.4m in 250p main market flotation FIELD GROUP, the folding carton maker, has priced its flotation at 250p a share, valuing the company at Pounds 148.4m. The issue involves a placing of 22.5m shares and a public offer of 12.1m shares, raising Pounds 84.1m after expenses. Of this amount, Pounds 71.9m will go to the company, cutting its gearing to nil, and the rest will go to existing shareholders. The issue price gives a p/e of 17.7 on pro forma earnings per share, excluding exceptional costs, of 14.1p. The pricing was pitched between the industrial sector and the packaging sector which stands at a premium to the market. A notional net dividend of 6.4p for the year to April 4, gives a gross yield of 3.2 per cent, which is covered 2.2 times. Field makes cartons for the food, drink, tobacco, toiletry and pharmaceutical industries, with five plants in the UK, where it is market leader, and one in Belgium. It has expanded partly through acquisitions, such as the recently-agreed purchase of the carton packaging activities of Boots, the pharmaceutical and retail group. It expects volume growth in the carton market in the medium term, partly as cartons are seen as more environmentally friendly than plastic packaging. It also has a record of increasing market share. After the flotation CINVen, the venture capital group, will have 21 per cent of the equity, after selling 4.3m shares in the issue, the maximum it is allowed. Directors and employees are selling 700,000 shares and will together have 15.2 per cent of the share capital. The offer closes on June 30 and dealings in the shares are expected to start on Wednesday July 7. COMMENT Field has plenty going for it. Having spent Pounds 50m over the last five years it has the capacity to expand and the ability to pick up new business. Trends in the industry favour larger groups, likely to benefit as customers cut their lists of suppliers, which can offer the high-quality design which now characterises much consumer packaging as a strong impact on the supermarket shelves is vital. Further, there is scope for a number of deals such as the one with Boots, due to complete next month, which will raise gearing to a mere 8.2 per cent. A forecast of current year pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.7m before one-off costs (operating profits of Pounds 12.6m before exceptional costs) gives a prospective p/e of 14.7. After the successful flotation of RPC Group, the plastic packaging company, there is likely to be good demand for Field, although it is twice the size. The shares are worth buying and holding.</p>

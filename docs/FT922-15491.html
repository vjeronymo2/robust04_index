			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Company News: Krupp earnings rise to DM300m KRUPP, the German steel and engineering group, put in a strong performance in its last full year before the flotation due this summer. Despite the pressures of recession overseas and stagnation in domestic markets, the Essen-based company increased net earnings to DM300m (Dollars 182m) from DM217m last time, Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman, said yesterday. Hoesch, which will shortly be taken over by Krupp, fared less well. Yesterday, it reported falling profits and announced plans for 2,800 job cuts this year, following last year's reduction of 2,500. While Mr Cromme strove to paint a relatively rosy picture to encourage prospective shareholders, Mr Heinz Kriwet, Thyssen's chairman, pointed to a uniformly black background. Sales at Thyssen in the five months to the end of February had risen 1 per cent to around DM15bn, but profits had continued to fall, he said. Economic conditions had worsened since last year. 'We can see no signs of improvement. The German economy is stagnating and we may be at the start of a recession.' Thyssen, the biggest of the three companies, was preparing for 'stormy weather ahead,' and recovery might take very much longer than many people now believed, Mr Kriwet said. Sales at all three groups stagnated or showed minimum growth in 1991. Turnover at Krupp was up just 2 per cent. At Hoesch, it was unchanged at DM12.6bn, according to Mr Kajo Neukirchen, chairman. Thyssen's figures, published in full two weeks ago, showed a 1 per cent rise to DM36.6bn. The main causes were falling steel prices and fading demand in Germany and abroad, the three chairmen agreed. According to Mr Cromme, after-tax profits at Fried. Krupp, the core operating business in the Krupp group, rose DM90m to DM200m, allowing it to wipe out losses carried forward and post an unappropriated profit unofficially estimated at DM50m. Krupp Stahl, the steel subsidiary, held its ground in difficult conditions. Results matched those of 1990, Mr Cromme said, hinting at a further dividend payout. Krupp Stahl, at present the only quoted part of the group, last year paid its first dividend - DM5  - for 16 years. Mr Cromme also upgraded estimates of the benefits of the impending takeover of Hoesch. He said the long-term 'positive effect' on results would be about DM500m a year. In the shorter term, however, he warned of 'suitable counter-measures' needed to cope with the current downturn. 'The world economic setting in 1992 is much more difficult than last year,' he said. The group would also have to work hard to merge Hoesch's complementary activities in steel-making, plant-engineering, auto-components and trading, to extract the maximum benefits as soon as possible. The takeover of Hoesch is expected to be completed in July, despite an unexpected dispute with the federal cartel office in Berlin. The office is understood to be concerned that the merger will give the enlarged group too big a share in the springs market. Mr Neukirchen said overall his company had a satisfactory year. Although after-tax profits were down, they were still well over DM200m, he said.</p>

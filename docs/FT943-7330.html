			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / British Coal aims to cut more jobs British Coal yesterday started negotiations for a final reduction of staff before privatisation. The move is expected to lead to more than 2,000 job losses by the end of the year. In talks with three unions the corporation was unable to state exactly how many jobs would go but said the cuts would be broadly limited to management and clerical staff at national, regional and group headquarters. Of British Coal's 14,000 industrial employees and staff, about 10,000 are miners with the rest either managers or white-collar workers. Most of those not working in pits are unlikely to be needed by the corporation's successors. The government has asked bidders for the five core mining regions to present their tenders by September 14 and is expected to select a preferred candidate for each soon after. It wants to complete the sale of all five, plus any closed mines that the private sector wants to re-open, on December 24. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee-relations director, told the unions that the government's sale of the core mining activities was progressing on schedule. In addition, the corporation's sale of non-core businesses was attracting considerable interest. Many of British Coal's 4,000 non-miner employees are employed in these businesses. Mr Hunt called on miners who had not yet accepted flexible working packages to 'focus their attention' during the next few days. They have been given a deadline of August 31 to decide. The packages provide miners with one-off payments of Pounds 6,000 and allow for redundancy packages of up to Pounds 27,000 if they lose their jobs before March 1998. They must also, however, agree to work rosters which can include shifts of up to 12 hours and weekend work.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dragan Djuric: "The Scutari Oil Pipeline"] </F>   [Text] "God grant the sanctions continue," is the phrase  used most frequently by those with whom we talked about the  smuggling of petroleum products across Lake Scutari. The story  about the wealth which people have amassed overnight explains  the background of this strange prayer.    "Every day about 200 boats cross the (imaginary) border  between Montenegro and Albania illegally on Lake Scutari," says  someone very familiar with the flows of smuggled goods between  Zeta, the rich farming region on the Montenegrin shore of the  lake, and Vraka, the Albanian part of the Scutari region, which  is mainly settled by Serbs and Montenegrins.    So, the southern Yugoslav republic has been managing to  avoid  isolation a full year longer than Serbia and has been regularly  supplying the public with fuel. Since adoption of Resolution  820, foreign tankers, mainly Greek, have had a harder and harder  time running the NATO blockade in front of the port of Bar. Just  before New Year's, the government announced that reserves had  fallen so low that it was forced to "discontinue gasoline  coupons for individuals."    Numerous private and government-owned firms became involved  in the smuggling of petroleum products immediately after the  sanctions were introduced toward the FRY; not long afterward,  they were joined by resourceful individuals on both sides of the  Montenegrin border.  <H5>  The Oil Well </H5>   The merchants in Scutari were the quickest to react. They  installed double gas tanks in their cars and used them to carry  gasoline across the border checkpoint at Bozaj for sale in Tuzi  or Podgorica, which is only some 20 km or so from the border.  Thus, the ancient meaning of the name of Tuzi, a small town  midway between Podgorica and the Albanian border, has been  restored. (The town, mostly settled by Albanians and Muslims,  takes its name from the time when caravans carrying salt passed  through, and the town came to be called Tuzi--"salt station.")    Almost every house in the town has become a small gasoline  station. Car owners from Podgorica who need more than the  limited amounts of gasoline (30 liters a month at the beginning  and then 15 liters) go to Tuzi as though it were the nearest gas  station. The reason, of course, lays in the price. The price of  fuel in Tuzi has steadily been 20 to 30 percent lower than at  the open-air markets in Podgorica.    People living in Zeta have been involved since this past  autumn. They have begun to run the blockade in boats. They do  not even need visas, which, because of the restrictions of the  Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, are the greatest obstacle to  crossing at Bozaj, the only border crossing between Montenegro  and Albania. It is simple: You cross Lake Scutari in a rowboat  to the town of Kamenica on the Albanian shore, without any kind  of border or customs inspection; you are met there by your  "trading partners" from what until recently was the most  isolated country in the world, and they have drums full of  petroleum products. The boats are used in this way to smuggle  everything--from cigarettes to satellite dishes--but petroleum  products and gasoline are the most common. Here are figures on  how lucrative this entire operation is. The Albanians are paid  between 160 German marks [DM] and DM190 for a 210-liter drum of  petroleum products, depending on the quality, while in Zeta that  same drum "sells at wholesale from DM210 to DM240 or even DM300."  <H5>  The Fleet </H5>   The heady rate at which money is earned is attractive for a  great many people. In recent months, new boats are being built  in large numbers or old ones repaired. One reason is that the  traditional rowboats that the people of Zeta have used to fish  Lake Scutari can take only five drums of petroleum products, and  that exceeds the allowed load and presents a risk of capsizing  and sinking in any kind of sea. So now the Zeta rowboats have  sides which are four or five or more planks high, instead of the  previous three, so that they can take a much larger load. Demand  has also increased suddenly for drums, and there is a frantic  demand for the metal plugs used with the drums. They carry a  price of DM10, and the Aluminum Combine in Podgorica is faring  the worst, because its employees are stealing large numbers of  them.    The wind and waves are the greatest danger to the people in  the boats. The boat ride from the Montenegrin to the Albanian  shore in small boats takes an hour to an hour and a half, but  coming back, because they are loaded, it takes about two and a  half hours. Moreover, part of this is away from the shore of the  lake (only 15 minutes or so of the trip), but this is where the  seas are highest and there is a constant danger of sudden winds.  In Albania, the drums containing petroleum products are loaded  by hand, so that often the associates simply exchange full boats  for empty ones.    On the Montenegrin shore, the transshipment technology is on  a higher level. Tractor attachments are used to lift the drums  from the rowboats, much in the way of a crane, and they are  loaded onto trailers or trucks, and from there they are stored  in farmyards.    Tank trucks carry the petroleum products from Zeta to other  regions of Montenegro, Serbia, and the Serbian krajinas. The  petroleum products are drained from the drums very quickly with  a compressor or ordinary water pump. This job, our informants  explained, even involves the Montenegrin government, which  issues special certificates to individuals, according them the  right to purchase and carry the smuggled petroleum products.  <H5>  Chain </H5>   The sudden wealth and the spirit of adventure which go with  smuggling petroleum products across the largest lake in the  Balkans have been generating many "hunting" stories about the  exploits of the newly created "businessmen." It is thus said  that there is no house in Zeta which has not earned at least  DM10,000 or so from petroleum products. The earnings of a  journalist from Montenegrin Television, who was among the first  to become involved as a buyer and carrier, is estimated at DM2  million. Albanian soldiers, who are said to intercept the  smugglers, occasionally even quite amicably, are collecting  bribes of DM10 per person. In order to dispel our disbelief, one  of our informants pointed with pride to a new Mercedes tank  truck, which he had just bought for DM130,000. "That came from  petroleum products," he said.    The associates in Albania, we were told, are quite  straightforward in their dealings. The Montenegrin and Albanian  smugglers help one another, and it is not uncommon at all for  them to visit one another for even several days (illegally, of  course).    In Albania, it is prohibited to pump petroleum products into  drums at filling stations, so that it is actually sold by the  truckers, whose job comes down to cruising constantly around the  gasoline stations. The petroleum products are usually of very  poor quality. A great deal of kerosene (30 to 50 percent) is  dumped into it, because in Albania it is cheaper--10 pfennigs  per liter. So that engines can operate on this mixture, any kind  of motor oil (usually used) is added to it.    The petroleum products go through five hands before they  reach the ultimate consumer. The job also runs the risk that the  police patrols, who are said to be increasingly numerous, will  seize the petroleum products as they are being carried from Zeta  in canisters. It is a long chain, and the links in it include  both big operators, who order tank trucks by phone, and also  erstwhile high school students waiting for customers in the  open-air markets with plastic containers. Many firms whose  trucks and buses have long been paying visits to farmyards in  Zeta instead of the official Jugopetrol stations also rely on  the newly opened "oil pipeline."    There is the smell of petroleum products at every step in  Zeta. As you enter Zeta, our informants joke, there should be a  "NO SMOKING" sign, just as there is at filling stations.</p>

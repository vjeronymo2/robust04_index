			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIOLATORS TAKE NOTICE OF BILLS FOR REMOVING POSTERS;  </P> <P> ADVERTISING: 528 RESIDENTS WERE ASSESSED CHARGES FOR REMOVING THEIR NAILED AND  THUMBTACKED SIGNS FROM PUBLIC PROPERTY.  </P> <P> On a warm afternoon last October, Woodland Hills resident Richard Linder  carefully printed "House for Rent" on six pieces of 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper,  stuffed a box of thumbtacks in his pocket and drove around Van Nuys pinning the  sheets on telephone poles.  </P> <P> Last week, a stunned Linder discovered that the mundane task would cost him  $194.20. "Your signs have been illegally posted," stated a city letter that  ordered the 63-year-old contractor to pay a high price for creating "blighted  conditions" in his community.  </P> <P> "I'm shocked. I'm just a little guy trying to rent a house," Linder said. "I  freely admit I hung the signs. But this seems like a severe penalty for tacking  a sign on a pole."  </P> <P> Linder is among 528 Los Angeles lawbreakers, who have received the first batch  of costly bills from the Los Angeles Department of Public Works as part of an  aggressive new law enforcement program in which city crews are tearing away  illegally posted signs and billing offenders for the removal service.  </P> <P> The days of stapling, nailing and taping "Garage Sale," "For Sale" and even  "Lost Dog" signs on telephone and street light poles are over, said public  works officials. The city aims to slap heavy fees on lawbreakers -- homeowners,  big developers and entrepreneurs alike -- to deter them from what has long been  a widespread practice.  </P> <P> "You can no longer use public property as a free form of advertising," said  Patrick D. Howard, director of the Public Works Department's Bureau of Street  Maintenance. "This type of blight is offensive to a vast majority of the  population. It is visual pollution. Our goal is to stop it."  </P> <P> The tough law, approved by the City Council last August, was born of vehement  complaints from San Fernando Valley and Westside homeowners who scorn the  multitude of real estate and other signs that clutter city streets. At times  over the past three years, anger has reached such heights that self-proclaimed  "sign vigilantes" roved streets in the Valley and elsewhere ripping down outlaw  posters to protest weak city sign ordinances.  </P> <P> Although tacking signs on public property has been a misdemeanor offense for  more than 40 years, city officials had to actually catch an offender in the act  to bring charges. Only a handful of violators had been prosecuted in the last  few years, officials said.  </P> <P> There are about half a million illegally posted signs citywide on any given  day, a figure arrived at through a sample survey of busy thoroughfares, street  maintenance officials said.  </P> <P> The new law, introduced by north Valley Councilman Hal Bernson, established a  principle called "rebuttable presumption," which assumes that the person  benefiting from the sign can be held responsible for paying the cost of its  removal.  </P> <P> So, in Linder's case, as well as in scores of others involving everything from  dance hall operators to religious organizations, 16 city work crews have torn  and peeled away signs, tracked down the owners and billed the party for the  cost of the removal job. Officials said the law applies equally to political  candidates who post election placards.  </P> <P> The first sign, regardless of its size, costs $190.40 to remove, an amount  calculated by city accountants who tabulated the cost of a two-man crew, their  new van, equipment and staff time to find the offender. Each additional sign  costs $1.60 to remove because the crew is already on the job.  </P> <P> Those who use glue to paste up signs will be charged $48.50 for each additional  removal because it takes crews longer to scrape the paper away with a chemical  solution.  </P> <P> A two-person crew dons hard hats, gloves and goggles to remove up to 300 signs  a day. And the work can be dangerous.  </P> <P> "All these staples and nails can come popping out at you," said Juan Reyes, 30,  of Arleta who often uses a shovel or crowbar to pry off stubborn nailed-in  posters.  </P> <P> The workers take a Polaroid camera snapshot of the illegal posters for evidence  and write down the information such as names, addresses and phone numbers on  the sign. This is turned over to an inspector who tracks down and then bills  the owner.  </P> <P> In the first Dec. 15 billing, the city has charged offenders a total of  $119,108 for their misdeeds. Officials hope to collect more than $600,000 in  fines this year to pay for the cost of running the program. So far, only $1,847  has been paid. Misdemeanor criminal charges may be filed against those who fail  to pay within 30 days, Howard said.  </P> <P> Many incensed violators claim they did not know the law was in place and have  demanded first-offender leniency.  </P> <P> Surely, said Rabbi Boruch Shlomo Cunin, of Chabad House in North Hollywood and  West Los Angeles, the city will not charge his charitable organization $408 for  posting dozens of "L'chayim to Life" telethon posters around town. "I intend to  come to the hearing and bring the 1,000 posters we did not hang to show them  since we became aware of the illegality of this," Cunin said. "We are a  charitable organization that helps the homeless. We hope the city will be very  kind to us and waive the fees."  </P> <P> City officials said they have been merciful to a few first-time offenders --  such as parents of children who hung up lost puppy signs and homeowners who  hung garage sale signs.  </P> <P> "I sent them a warning letter," said John Kissler, the West Valley inspector.  "But if there is a second offense, they will be charged."  </P> <P> But profit-takers beware. City officials said they have little sympathy for  business people who use public property for personal gain.  </P> <P> "We are going after people who post signs for commercial purposes as part of  their business operations," said William E. White, chief street-use inspector.  </P> <P> Mike Graves, a co-owner of Economy Electrical and Plumbing of Sun Valley, has  been charged $388 for distributing about 200 signs advertising "Plumber  Services" throughout the Valley.  </P> <P> "The business we got from those signs kept us from going under when we started  up last August," Graves said. "It was a cheap, effective and easy way to let  people know we were out there."  </P> <P> Since receiving the bill, Graves dispatched workers to remove his remaining  signs. He said he intends to write off the charges as "the cost of doing  business."  </P> <P> "I just wish we could have gotten some kind of warning that this was against  the law," he said.  </P> <P> But another violator, the owners of about 300 fluorescent-colored signs  throughout the Valley publicizing "Six Foot and Under Basketball," say they  plan to fight their $816.80 bill. Ray Danish, a partner in the nonprofit Sports  League, said that the city removal fee is "ridiculous. . . . It only costs us  15 cents to hang them up. It shouldn't cost the city more than 20 cents to take  them down.  </P> <P> Besides, Danish argued, "Our signs are neat and colorful. They should be  allowed to stay up."  </P> <P> But for folks like Richard Linder, who was trying to rent out a small house  with his few hand-made signs, the lesson has been more sobering.  </P> <P> "I know ignorance of the law is no excuse," Linder lamented. "But the bill came  the day before Christmas. It just seems like such a high cost for my minor  offense."  </P></p>

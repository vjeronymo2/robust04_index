			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / The Long View: Yielding no quarter The building societies this week put forward their candidacy for an Ostrich Award when they blustered that a mere quarter-point cut in interest rates was not worth a response. TSB, a retail bank that is one of their most direct rivals, thought differently, and quickly trimmed its mortgage rate. As mutual companies, building societies face severe restrictions on how they may respond to radical changes in the mortgage and savings markets. They struck it lucky during the inflationary boom periods of the 1970s and 1980s and were able to grow on an enormous scale. In historically freakish circumstances their balance sheets expanded at an average annual rate of 15 per cent during those two decades. But now the growth rate has tumbled to 5 per cent and worse may be to come. There will always be a place for mutual savings and mortgage banks, but they might need to become much smaller. To take a pessimistic view, they might have the same minor relationship to banks as friendly societies, for instance, have to life assurance companies. Low interest rates have exposed the vulnerability of building societies. They suffered net outflows of savings deposits in five of the last seven months of 1993 - although this is ignoring interest credited, allowing for which savings rose by Pounds 10.7bn during the year. This result was only achieved, however, by holding interest rates on savings relatively high, which has meant that building societies have become uncompetitive on the mortgage side. Net mortgage advances have dropped from Pounds 20.6bn to Pounds 9.4bn over two years. As the banks - notably Abbey National, which converted to banking status in 1989 - have grabbed business, the building societies' market share of new house mortgage lending has tumbled from 78 per cent in 1991 to about 55 per cent last year. The building societies cannot expect to get away with a mortgage rate of, say, 7.64 per cent (the Halifax's at present) when wholesale money costs 5.25 per cent. According to calculations by Legal &amp; General, the rise in liquid assets held by the personal sector last year was about Pounds 15bn when on the basis of the growth of savings as a whole it could have been expected to be some Pounds 24.5bn. Thus Pounds 9.5bn went missing - largely into unit trusts. This hit the banks as much as the building societies, but the banks could easily raise alternative finance in the wholesale money markets or the securities markets. Abbey National derives about 50 per cent of its resources from the wholesale markets, Halifax Building Society only about 15 per cent. The Building Societies Act imposes a limit of 40 per cent on non-retail funding, but a safety margin is needed and, in practice, societies operate well below this level. The ceiling could be raised, and indeed a review of the Act is under way, but there is an underlying principle that mutual societies must transact most of their business with members. They always have the option, after all, of converting to bank plc status if the straitjacket proves too frustrating. There might be another way out. The building societies' problem is not just that the savings flow is too small, but that there is a growing mismatch between their variable rate savings balances and the increasing popularity of fixed rate mortgages. The overwhelming proportion of UK householders' outstanding mortgage debt of some Pounds 350bn is on a variable rate basis, but at the margin there has been a radical change. Two years ago less than a fifth of new mortgages had the interest rate fixed for more than a year, but today the proportion is more than half. This represents a shift towards the international norm: in Germany 70 per cent of mortgages are at fixed rates, and in the US 75 per cent. So long as British inflation remains reasonably low and steady, as the Bank of England cautiously suggested in its quarterly Inflation Report this week, fixed rate mortgages will surely become more and more dominant in the UK. In fact it is really rather odd that so much variable-rate short-term finance has been available in the UK to finance mortgages. German mortgage banks have always relied heavily on fixed rate bonds that can be sold on a secondary market. In the US there has been a big move more recently towards securitisation of mortgage finance through the bond market. The building societies are therefore grappling with only the first symptoms of a potentially fundamental long-term problem of balance sheet structure. They must persuade their members to contribute fairly long-term fixed rate savings if on the other side of the balance sheet they are to lend prudently at fixed rates. But British savers are unaccustomed to buying fixed rate bonds, and it will take more than reassurances from the Bank of England to persuade them that inflation is dead. For the time being societies are keeping their heads down and hoping for a lucky break. There are rumours that one or two are originating mortgages and then quietly transferring them to banks, who can obtain matching finance. At least this is a way for the building societies to keep their operations ticking over. They have Pounds 220bn of existing mortgages on their books, on which they can earn a living until the sands of time run out. They are protected by the cost and inconvenience of refinancing existing mortgages in the UK, in sharp contrast to the US where refinancing is a vast business. Also, most borrowers in the UK are unhappy with the idea of making judgments about interest rates; they prefer to stick to what they see as the relative safety of floating rates. Again, an extended period of stable interest rates may change this attitude. So might the persistence of uncompetitive mortgage rates, which is where we are now. Within a year or two the building society sector may have to shrink, which would happen through further important defections to proprietary banking status.</p>

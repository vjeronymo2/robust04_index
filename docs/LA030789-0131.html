			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PILOTS' SLOWDOWN FIZZLES; BUSH VOWS NO INTERVENTION;  </P> <P> EASTERN SENDS 2,500 MORE HOME  </P> <P> Threats that the air travel system would be clogged nationwide by pilots  painstakingly working by the rules fizzled today as Eastern Airlines sent 2,500  more workers home, blaming pilots for leaving it with "no business on the  books" in the fourth day of a machinists' strike.  </P> <P> The pilots union had asked its 40,000 members to follow rule books stringently  today, and there were fears of havoc as delays piggybacked around the country.  But while the union said two-thirds of its members followed the directive,  delays were few.  </P> <P> "The reports we have are that there has been no effect on operations," said  Capt. Roger Hall, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn.  </P> <P> The union contended that its action was not a slowdown but an effort to ensure  safety during the strike.  </P> <P> President Bush in Washington said pilots should not "make the innocent  traveling public a pawn" and he stood by his opposition to government  intervention to stop the walkout by the 8,500-member machinists union, which  represents mechanics and ramp service workers.  </P> <P> Bush said that if the machinists try to shut down rail service he will ask  Congress to ban such secondary boycotts. He said the strike should be settled  through bargaining, but no talks have been scheduled since the strike began  Saturday.  </P> <P> In New York, a federal judge today extended until Friday a restraining order  barring rail workers from staging secondary strikes in sympathy with the  Eastern strikers.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson had ruled Sunday in favor of three New  York area railroads, which carry about 320,000 commuters into New York daily,  who were concerned that their employees would honor secondary pickets.  </P> <P> The Eastern strike, the culmination of a 17-month labor dispute, nearly  grounded the airline, stranded thousands of passengers and pushed the nation's  seventh-largest airline to the brink of collapse. The airline wants $150  million in concessions; the machinists want $50 million in raises.  </P> <P> Eastern has said it lost more than $1 billion this decade and is losing $1  million a day.  </P> <P> "Clearly that has gotten worse," Joe Leonard, Eastern executive vice president  said at a briefing announcing the layoffs of 2,500 more people.  </P> <P> "Yesterday's layoffs ended up hitting almost 7,000 innocent employees, rather  than the 5,000 we announced earlier," he said. "With no pilots, we are running  4% of our normal flight schedule. Economic realities forced by this 4% schedule  simply wipe out 9,500 jobs for people who want to work."  </P> <P> Just 1,500 employees are working, down from 31,200 before the strike, he said.  </P> <P> "We simply don't have any business on the books today," Leonard said. "Our  competitors have simply been sucking up the traffic, our traffic, since March  4."  </P> <P> "I think there's a very strong possibility that Eastern Airlines as we knew it  last week will never come back. It's very wounded," Leonard said.  </P> <P> Some union members have speculated that Eastern's owner, Texas Air Corp., and  its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, are trying to tear the carrier apart.  </P></p>

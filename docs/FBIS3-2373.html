			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "U.S. Interests Behind Pretext of Human Rights"] </F>   [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is going  to visit China on 11 March. He said that he would discuss  economic and trade issues with China on the trip, but that the  United States attached more importance to human rights. Through  various channels, the United States once again has spread the  atmosphere that "if a decision were to be made now as to whether  or not to grant China most-favored-nation [MFN] status, the  United States would decide to cancel it, and that therefore  China must make further progress."    The United States is attempting to use "human rights" as a  big stick to exert pressure on China, interfere in China's  internal affairs, and issue orders as to what road China should  take and how its reform should proceed. In the months before  each June, the United States uses the MFN status as a trump card  to continuously make various unreasonable demands, such as  "allowing the United States to broadcast to China," issuing a  list of prisoners they want released, "improving political and  religious freedoms," "exporting no prison-made products,"  "visiting prisons in China," and "human rights in Tibet." The  United States not only makes demands verbally, but at the same  time supports some troublemakers in intentionally making trouble  within the territory of China. With voices from the outside and  the inside, they create all kinds of so- called "human rights"  incidents in a planned way as a pretext for taking further  interfering action.    In 1989, U.S. officials repeatedly met with Fang Lizhi, Wang  Dan, and others, and closely collaborated with them in making  trouble. Last August, when China made a bid for the Olympic  Games, Han Dongfang, who has close ties with U.S. labor unions,  collaborated by attempting to return to the mainland via Hong  Kong to "promote democratic movements." After he had failed in  an attempt to steal through customs and had his passport  withdrawn, some people in Hong Kong held gatherings and  processions to show support. Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten  gave a speech attacking China. This year, on the eve of the  U.S. secretary of state's China visit, some Americans went from  Hong Kong to Henan's Fangcheng County and carried out illegal  missionary activities there. They had overnight gatherings,  made videotapes, and faxed records of their activities back to  Hong Kong in different batches and at different periods. As  they would not listen to the warning by the quarters concerned,  action was taken to enforce the law, but the Americans  immediately responded by lumping that togethre with the MFN  status. A few days ago, the United States sent Assistant  Secretary of State Shattuck to Beijing to "prepare" for  Christopher's China visit. That was an official visit on which  he should have respected diplomatic protocol by being with the  host on his itinerary and schedule. Shattuck, however, went to  meet with opponents of the Chinese Government, and discussed  with them whether or not to grant MFN status to China. Some of  them suggested that the United States cancel China's MFN status;  others even wished to arrange for meetings between the secretary  of state and the dissidents. Does the United States want a  sincere dialogue with the Chinese Government, or is it  attempting to do something to support the dissidents by making  use of the visit to send them a political gift and give them  support with a view to achieving the political aim of  interfering in China's politics?    Any country must safeguard its sovereignty and security,  keep  its internal affairs from outside interference, and allow no  foreign country to support political dissidents in making  trouble, let alone Wei Jingsheng, who is a parolee who still has  to observe parole regulations. Now that he has violated the  regulations, the Chinese public security authorities, naturally,  could take legitimate summoning measures in accordance with law.  The fact that the United States attempted to interfere in  China's legal procedures and parole regulations, and to put  China's judicial organs under its control naturally has violated  international law.    Clause number seven under article two of the UN Charter  provides for the safeguarding of state sovereignty. It reads:  "This Charter must not be considered as empowering the United  Nations to interfere in any affairs that are of nature within  the jurisdiction of a country." The human rights question  involves the enforcement of law and is the internal affair of a  country. If a foreign country is allowed to interfere in the  internal affairs of a country as it wishes, it will lose its  sovereignty, its political situation will become turbulent, and  it will lose the right of national development, and in turn  personal human rights will have no guarantee. Facts of  aggression and intervention in the Third World explain this  well. The developing situations in former Eastern European  countires, and in Yugoslavia, also explain this.    The United States knows very well how to safeguard its own  sovereignty. Although there are seven international human  rights pacts, the United States has joined only one, not the  other six, because the pacts affect its sovereignty. The United  States insists that its Constitution and laws prevail over the  human rights pacts and that it is not interfered with by these  pacts. On the one hand, it says it is safeguarding "human  rights," but on the other, it is violating them. For instance,  it carried out the armed aggression against Cuba, kidnapped its  president, and bombarded its civilians. In Somalia, it shot  women and children with guns. It openly supported cannon  attacks on the people-elected parliament and the killing of  several hundred people. It has tacitly allowed the slaughters  and strikes in the Israeli-occupied territories every day, and  has grossly intervened in the political criteria and social  patterns of other countries. These countries have no political  choice, as their right of choice is dependent on American will  and new criteria are set by the U.S.-supported political  parties. This U.S.-style "human rights" concept obviously is  unacceptable to the Chinese people.    If Christopher is going to discuss China's human rights  question with an attitude of equality during his China visit,  China will be glad to discuss it with him. If he wants to  develop economic and trade relations with China, China holds a  positive and cooperative attitude, as this is a mutually  beneficial matter. However, if someone is going use "human  rights" to pressure China to open its market, with a view to  reaping economic interests or benefiting himself at China's  expense, and if he goes so far as to use this to test China's  ability and will to safeguard its sovereignty and to force China  to swallow the bitter pill of having its internal affairs  interfered with, then he underestimates China's determination  for independence and self-determination, and will only end up in  dream. If the United States cooperates, then both sides will  benefit, but if it uses MFN status as a threatening means, it  ultimately will harm its own interests.</p>

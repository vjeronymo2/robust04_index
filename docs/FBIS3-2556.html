			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch: "Chen Ziying Urges British Side Not To Undermine </F> Cooperation Again, Stresses That Airport Financing Package Is  Being Studied"]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- Chen Ziying, deputy  director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office, pointed out here today that although the British side  had already sabotaged Sino-British cooperation on the issue of  Hong Kong's political system, he hoped the British side would  not undermine cooperation in other aspects. He also said that  as the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] was bearing a heavier  work load, he did not rule out the possibility that the National  People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee would appoint new  members to the PWC.    Chen Ziying made these remarks when answering questions  raised by reporters after he had attended the opening ceremony  of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPPCC National  Committee today. He said: The Sino-British Joint Declaration  stipulates that the Chinese side and its British counterpart  should make joint efforts to maintain the smooth transition of  Hong Kong. The Chinese side has always called for handling  things in accordance with the Joint Declaration, and its deeds  always square with its words. The British side, however, has  undermined cooperation between the two sides on the issue of  Hong Kong's political system, which produced bad effects. The  Chinese side wishes that its British counterpart would not  undermine cooperation between the two sides in other aspects.    When asked about the fourth new airport financing package,  Chen Ziying said that the Chinese side was studying it  vigorously. He stressed: Every problem related to the new  airport should be solved by proceeding from the objectives of  contributing to Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and of  fully implementing the stipulations of the Memorandum of  Understanding on the new airport. All the suggestions made by  the Chinese side have been written down in the Memorandum of  Understanding as the consensus of the two countries, and no new  demands have been set since then. Hence, as long as everything  is done in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, a  larger and better new airport will emerge very soon.    When talking about the PWC's work, Chen Ziying said: The PWC  has very heavy tasks to bear, and much work must be studied  seriously. It is not enough merely to rely on the strength of  the 57 incumbent members, so I do not rule out the possibility  of recruiting more members in the future. Moreover, the State  Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch are making preparations for recruiting the third  group of Hong Kong affairs advisers, and the list can be  published once the work is complete.    On the other hand, Zheng Yi, deputy secretary of the NPC  Standing Committee and deputy director of the PWC, said today  that the PWC was handling its work quite smoothly and that the  five special subgroups were vigorously accelerating their work.  He said: As a work organ under the NPC Standing Committee, the  PWC should report on its work to the NPC regularly. However,  this topic has not been placed on the agenda of the NPC session  this year. In the future, the PWC will report on its work  according to the progress and requests made by deputies to the  NPC.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Shearson fined in ConAgra stock case SHEARSON Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street broking house, yesterday paid a Dollars 500,000 fine to the New York Stock Exchange in connection with an alleged case of stock manipulation in 1990. Mr Peter DaPuzzo, the brokerage's former co-head of equity trading, paid an additional penalty of Dollars 100,000. Both Mr DaPuzzo, an equity trader and a well-known figure on Wall Street, and Shearson, accepted - without admitting or denying guilt - the NYSE's findings that in November 1990 they improperly influenced the share price of ConAgra, the food and agricultural products group. Their actions, the NYSE alleged, made a stock offering that Shearson was handling the next day less costly for the broking house. According to the NYSE, Shearson's trading desk in New York, which was run by Mr DaPuzzo, instigated a last-minute trade in ConAgra shares on the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco at the price of Dollars 33 1/4 . The order changed the closing price of ConAgra from Dollars 33 3/8 - the last reported trade on the NYSE - to Dollars 33 1/4 , the price at which Shearson had previously arranged to sell the 4.4m ordinary stock offering to investors on the following day. As a result of the last-minute San Francisco trade, which violated NYSE rules against artificially influencing a stock price before a public offering, ConAgra received Dollars 550,000 less from its stock issue than if the price had not been manipulated. Prior to yesterday's settlement, Shearson made up that loss to ConAgra. Mr DaPuzzo said yesterday: 'I agreed to settle with the New York Stock Exchange because it was quickly becoming prohibitively expensive in terms of money and time for me to continue defending myself.' He also announced that he had retired from Shearson after more than 30 years with the company, and had joined Steinhardt Partners, a leading Wall Street money management firm. Mr Manny Geronimos, the senior Shearson stock trader working with Mr DaPuzzo at the time of the alleged stock manipulation, also agreed to a settlement with the NYSE. Mr Geronimos received a censure and was temporarily suspended from the securities industry.</p>

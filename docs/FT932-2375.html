			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of Chemicals and the Environment (6): Year of mishaps ruins a caring reputation - Profile, Hoechst THE extraordinary series of mishaps suffered by Hoechst of Germany this spring provides an awful warning of the way a reputation for responsible care, built up over many years, can be destroyed in a few weeks. After a period of 10 years in which Hoechst had not suffered a single noteworthy accident at its German plants, and in which routine emissions of many pollutants had been cut by 80 per cent or more, there were three serious accidents and 15 lesser incidents between February 22 and April 2. The events themselves would have bad enough to damage public confidence in Hoechst, however the company had responded to them. They started with the contamination of a Frankfurt suburb with 10 tonnes of toxic chemicals, were punctuated in the middle with a lethal explosion that killed one worker and seriously injured another, and finished with a leak of several hundred kilograms of highly corrosive 'oleum' (fuming sulphuric acid). But Hoechst made matters worse by its reaction, which was widely seen as disorganised, defensive and arrogant. The legacy is an atmosphere of mistrust and bitterness. The company has come under attack not only from its natural adversaries in the environmental movement and the media but also from the state and federal governments. The environment ministry in the state of Hesse ordered an independent scrutiny of Hoechst's whole safety and environmental management system, in addition to investigations of the individual accidents. These could lead to criminal charges and/or the loss of operating licences. The indirect impact of the accidents has spread well beyond Hoechst's Frankfurt-based operations, leading to calls for even tougher safety controls for all German chemical plants. The industry's leaders have had to suspend their campaign for some relief from Germany's ever-tightening safety and environmental regulations which, they say, put them at a disadvantage compared to competitors in other countries where rules are more relaxed. A lot of the public relations damage was done by the first accident, at Hoechst's Griesheim works, which sprayed a sticky and evil-smelling yellow cocktail of chemicals over the nearby suburb. For several hours after the incident, the company's PR staff seriously underestimated its impact on residents, as a result of poor internal communications. Later, the company tried to make amends. Several hundred Hoechst staff spent the weekend after the accident helping residents to clean up contaminated cars, homes and streets and arranging to remove tonnes of topsoil from their gardens. They even bought up Germany's stocks of dogs' shoes - available in small, medium and large - so that people could protect their pets' paws. Public distrust was exacerbated by the fact that Hoechst officials did not acknowledge that one of the main chemicals released - ortho-nitroanisole, an ingredient in making dyestuffs - was potentially carcinogenic, until the story reached the press. PR staff explained afterwards that they had not known at the time about studies conducted under the US National Toxicology Programme, which showed an increased incidence of tumours in rats and mice given the chemical in their feed. The company insisted there was 'no risk of permanent harm to residents of Griesheim' because conditions there were quite different from those in the long-term animal studies. But as Mr Jorg Geywitz, a Hoechst environmental manager, pointed out, 'people see the chemical, they smell it and of course, when they read in the newspapers about its toxicity, they're frightened.' Another mistake, according to some observers, was that Mr Wolfgang Hilger, chairman of Hoechst, gave no press conference and made no personal statement about the accident until 10 days later. That gave an unfortunate impression of aloof detachment on the part of senior management. However Hoechst was responding more fully, more humbly and more quickly by the time of the third serious accident on April 2, in which 13 workers suffered the effects of exposure to sulphuric acid fumes. It was followed by a decision to give the whole Hoechst board joint responsibility for safety; one director, Mr Karl Holoubek, had previously been responsible. A disconcerting feature of the series of accidents was that no common thread ran through them, apart from human error and a failure to observe specified operating conditions. There was nothing more specific for the company to put right. The first incident, for example, resulted from a night shift worker's failure to switch on a stirrer in a reaction tank. That led eventually to an uncontrolled build-up of pressure in the vessel - and the explosive release of its contents into the atmosphere. The accidents completely overshadowed Hoechst's annual announcement in April of its environmental spending and performance figures, which showed that the consistent improvement over the past 20 years had been maintained. The total amount of chemical residues discharged from its main works into the Rhine has declined from 263 tonnes in 1972 to 29.6 tonnes last year. Hoechst spent DM1.3bn on environmental protection in 1992 (of which DM232m was capital investment and the remainder running costs). About half of the expenditure is to reduce water pollution. It will be a long time, however, before most people in Frankfurt think again of Hoechst as a company with an excellent long-term environmental record, rather than an accident-prone giant that needs tighter regulation.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Gannett reports Dollars 66m earnings IMPROVED newspaper advertising revenues helped Gannett, the US publisher of 82 daily newspapers - including USA Today - to achieve a first-quarter 1993 net profit of Dollars 66.3m, or 46 cents a share, compared with a loss in the same quarter of 1992 of Dollars 91.4m, or 63 cents a share. The company's 1992 first-quarter loss occurred after Dollars 146m of accounting charges. With these stripped out, the 1993 first-quarter net profit was 22 per cent higher than the level a year before. Gannett's group operating revenues grew by 7 per cent to Dollars 844.7m year-on-year, while operating income was Dollars 120.1m in the first quarter, some 16 per cent higher than a year ago. Newspaper advertising revenues were 9 per cent higher in the 1993 first quarter, at Dollars 465m. Classified advertising volume was nearly 6 per cent better in the quarter. Signs that the US media industry is emerging from the worst of the recession were apparent at USA Today, the popular national daily paper. USA Today's paid advertising pages rose by 29 per cent year-on-year, while advertising revenues were 21 per cent better. Broadcasting revenues at Gannett, which includes 10 television and 15 radio stations in the US, grew by 5 per cent, to Dollars 82.9m. Outdoor advertising revenues, a Gannett speciality, declined by 8 per cent, to Dollars 47.8m. This reflected in part the sale of a business in Arizona.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: MCC vehicle fleet offshoot in administration A vehicle fleet subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation has been placed in administration after more than Pounds 1m was removed from a bank account in early December, following the death of the publisher Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Peter Dunn, of Latham Crossley &amp; Davis, appointed joint administrator on Monday, said Maxwell Fleet &amp; Facilities Management's failure stemmed from cashflow difficulties. MCC removed more than Pounds 1m, in several transactions, from an account designated MCC re Maxwell Fleet &amp; Facilities Management for the purposes of group financial support, he said. The withdrawals were authorised by individuals other than the company's two working directors, who say they were unaware of the transactions at the time. The company was established by Mr Maxwell to provide in-house fleet management and parcel distribution. It later expanded to service companies from outside the group, and handled more than 3,000 vehicles.</p>

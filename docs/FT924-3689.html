			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: The orient survives in Mayfair - Lean times for some dealers are opportune for others MOUNT Street and adjoining Davies Street in London's Mayfair boast the highest concentration of top oriental art dealers in the world. The last year, however, the royal warrant holder, John Sparks Ltd (established 1888)closed and Barling of Mount Street (established 1946), which dominated the Chinese furniture market, ceased trading in June; Japanese ceramics specialists Helen Buxton Ltd locked their doors for the last time last month and other famous names are conspicuous for their lack of activity - and stock. Barling's proprietor Nicholas Grindley believed his most positive response to a threatened 110 per cent rent increase was to call in the receiver. He plans to return to business as a private dealer. Helen Buxton found that her diminishing profits could no longer justify the expense of a shop. She decided to sell most of her stock at auction, reinvest at new prices, and deal from home. Five former antique shops now sit empty on the south side of Mount Street. Moreover, the arrival of Jacuzzi showrooms and hairdressers seems set to change the character of one of the most elegant and exclusive shopping parades in Europe. Of the oriental art dealers, only Speelman and Oriental Bronzes Ltd remain. Landlords and financial backers are proving a far greater threat to London's dealers during this recession than the auction houses ever were. However, lean times for some are also opportune times for others wishing to make the move to Mayfair. In the last year, for instance, the asking rental for the Sparks shop, arguably the best in Mount Street, has dropped over Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 64,000 per annum for a full repairing lease. Last month, Pelham Galleries, distinguished furniture dealers, left the Fulham Road to re-open at Nos. 24 and 25 Mount Street, and a promising new venture, The Oriental Art Gallery, opened its doors at No 4 Davies Street. Kensington Church Street dealers are also rumoured to be off to Davies Street. This week sees the inaugural exhibition of The Oriental Art Gallery Ltd. The firm's directors - and proprietors - are Gerard Hawthorn, formerly of Sydney L. Moss, and virtually the entire old oriental department of Spink: Roger Keverne, Ben Janssens and Miranda Clarke. Some three years ago, Messers Hawthorn and Keverne had attempted to take over the troubled John Sparks Ltd. Its demise, they believe, has left a gaping hole in the marketplace for a general oriental art dealer. In their new enterprise they aim to keep their inventory as large and as diverse as possible. The 127 pieces on show reflect this strategy. Objects range from an archaic Chinese bronze food vessel or ding from the late Shang Dynasty (12th/11th century BC) to porcelain, glass, silver, furniture, lacquer, ivory, jades and other carved hardstones, cloisonne enamel, and textiles. There is even the odd Indian or Khmer sculpture. Most of the pieces are fresh to the market and among the finest of their type - however modest. Prices range from Pounds 525 to Pounds 28,000. The exhibition opens on Wednesday. Eskenazi, in contrast, opens a valedictory show, the last at its present gallery. In the spring the firm moves to its own building, No. 10 Clifford Street, off Bond Street. While The Oriental Art Gallery offers something for everyone, this exhibition focuses on one of the most subtle and recherche fields of collecting: early Chinese lacquer. Almost all of the pieces on offer come from the collection of the late Jean-Pierre Dubosc, a notable scholar-cum-dealer- cum-art adviser. It was in Japan during the 1960s that he began to appreciate the quiet beauty of early Chinese lacquer, then little appreciated. He encouraged museums to assemble notable holdings; part of his own is already in the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. Lacquer is a time-consuming, precise art. The 14th century Yuan period red lacquer dish decorated with melons and heavily veined foliage, for instance, was probably painstakingly built up and carved over a period of years. Each thin layer of lacquer could only be applied when the previous one had dried slowly to the correct consistency. The beguilingly simple Song period (11th-12th century) dish in the form of a seven-petalled mallow flower is the show's tour-de-force of exquisite understatement. It is as light as a wafer, and far more agreeable to handle than chilly porcelain, a medium lacquer greatly influenced. Today, the tables have turned and lacquer is far less valuable than porcelain, although - or perhaps because - it survives in far greater quantities. Prices range from Pounds 12,000-Pounds 90,000. The show runs at Foxglove House, 166 Piccadilly, W1, December 8-22. Back at No. 96 Mount Street, Christian Deydier of Oriental Bronzes shows a spectacular Han Dynasty (206BC-AD 220) bronze horse for one day only, December 8. This noble beast, 1.27m high, was one of perhaps two or four tomb horses made to accompany a chariot. He is for our delectation only; he cost 'many millions' and has already been sold. At Spink's, meanwhile, Michael Spink has returned to the family firm as director in charge of the South East Asian, Himalayan, Indian and Islamic departments. This month sees the firm branching out to offer Arts and Crafts British jewellery for the first time. At 5-7 King Street, St James's, until December 24, is jewellery by the likes of the Gaskins, George Hunt, Sybil Dunlop, Mosheh Oved and Omar Ramsden - plus an entirely new discovery, Maud Eastman. Highly wearable are Sybil Dunlop's 'Carpet of Gems' jewels - richly coloured semi-precious stones, boldly set and redolent of Indian jewellery. Her rectangular brooch set with green and pink tourmalines, fire opals and citrines in the form of a vine, of around 1925, is yours for Pounds 2,500. Maud Eastman's necklace of faceted rock crystal, rose quartz and beads is a delight - and a more reasonable Pounds 1,500. Prices start at Pounds 750. Her necklaces are more feminine versions of those by the contemporary sculptor-jeweller Breon O'Casey, hand-cut out of lapis lazuli, amber, moonstone and carnelian. O'Casey's jewellery has a powerful, primitive quality, and is on show at the Oxford Gallery (23 High Street, Oxford) until January 6. Prices Pounds 280-Pounds 3,900.</p>

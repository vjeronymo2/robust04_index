			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Pension transfer hope for state workers Thousands of public sector workers who transferred into private pension plans could find it easier to be readmitted to their old schemes under a possible change in the law being considered by the government. The move, which follows widespread concern about potential mis-selling of pension transfers, would be directed at former members of statute-based occupational schemes, such as that in the National Health Service. Public sector pension schemes offer some of the best benefits in the UK, including inflation-linked pension payments and early retirement provisions. However, members of some schemes were targeted by insurance agents who sold them private plans. Some schemes, such as the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, are already allowing former members back in, though they will be reinstated in full only if they bring an amount to cover their missing contributions. Other large occupational schemes have said they will not consider re-admission. The government is likely to reject suggestions from some regulators and parts of the life insurance industry that legislation should be used to encourage private sector schemes to re-admit former members. But any change in the law would be intended to put pressure on public and private sector schemes to accept back former members who suffered as a result of poor advice and wished to rejoin. The most likely prospect for legislation would be a provision in a bill on the recommendations of the Goode committee on occupational pensions, which the Department of Social Security hopes will be included in the 1994-95 parliamentary session. A working group set up by the Securities and Investments Board, the chief City regulator, is expected in July to report how the industry should recompense customers who have suffered. Unease about the selling of pension transfers surfaced late last year after a study by the accountancy firm, KPMG Peat Marwick, suggested that in nine out of 10 cases, regulators' standards had not been met.</p>

The Secretary is modifying this provision that specifies the commencement of a borrower's repayment period to provide that any borrower who was in an ``in-school'' status at the time the natural disaster occurred and was unable to complete course requirements or enroll in classes due to the earthquake will continue to be in an ``in-school'' status until such time as the borrower withdraws or until the end of the 1993&hyph;94 award year, whichever is earlier. The institution must document this reason for continued ``in-school'' status in the student's file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. 34 CFR 674.42&blank;Contact With the Borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary will not require an institution to comply with the provisions of &sect;674.42(b) that require an institution to make contact with the borrower during an initial or postdeferment grace period if that grace period coincides with the California earthquake. These requirements shall be suspended for a period of time not to exceed the earlier of either the date on which the institution is able to resume normal contact with the borrower or June 30, 1994. An institution must document the reason for suspension of these activities in the borrower's file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. 34 CFR 674.41&hyph;674.50&blank;Subpart C_Due Diligence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary will not enforce 34 CFR part 674, subpart C_Due Diligence. An institution may suspend the collection activities for borrowers already in default at the time of the natural disaster. These requirements shall resume on July 1, 1994. An institution must document the reason for suspension of these activities in the borrower's file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. 34 CFR 674.34&hyph;674.37&blank;Deferment of Repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary modifies the provisions for hardship deferment in 34 CFR 674.34(i), 674.35(e), and 674.36(e) and authorizes an institution to grant an administrative hardship deferment to a borrower who is in repayment at the time of the natural disaster but who is unable to continue to repay the loan due to the disaster. Interest will accrue during any period of administrative hardship deferment. 34 CFR 674.37 requires that a borrower submit a written request for deferment. Under this administrative hardship deferment, a borrower may request this deferment orally and will not be required to submit a deferment documentation form to be considered eligible for this deferment. The administrative hardship deferment may be granted for a period of time not to exceed the earlier of either the date on which the borrower is able to resume making payments on the loan or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30, 1995. Documentation must be maintained according to the governing regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional costs leave Bridon Pounds 23m in the red Bridon, the Doncaster-based wire rope and engineering products manufacturer which announced a substantial restructuring last month, yesterday reported a Pounds 22.7m pre-tax loss for 1993 after Pounds 22.4m of exceptional charges. The expected deficit, which compares with a previous profit of Pounds 1.2m after a Pounds 1.1m of exceptionals came on flat turnover of Pounds 315.7m. Losses per share of 39.9p compare with earnings of 1.9p the previous year. However, reflecting the board's increasing confidence in the future, the final dividend is maintained at 2.75p making an unchanged 4p total. Bridon's shares closed down 3p at 148p. Commenting on the results Mr Brian Clayton, chairman, said 1993 saw a continuation of recessionary pressures in many of Bridon's markets. Demand in the UK stabilised but conditions deteriorated in continental Europe - particularly Germany and Italy. The group's wire and wire rope manufacturing operations had to contend with increases in raw material costs in the second half, while market conditions prevented the full recovery of these higher costs. Group operating profits before exceptional items fell to Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 7.6m). Mr Ronald Petersen, chief executive who joined the group in September, said higher raw material prices in the second half reduced operating profits by around Pounds 400,000 in the UK and by about Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) in the US. The bulk of the exceptional charges - which will cover the costs of a new strategy aimed at improving the group's market focus and manufacturing cost base - relates to the planned restructuring of the wire and wire rope operations. Last year these activities recorded reduced operating profits of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 4m) before Pounds 16m (Pounds 1m) of exceptional costs, on sales of Pounds 216.1m (Pounds 210.7m.) In contrast, operating profits improved slightly in the fibre products and industrial textiles operations, but engineering profits slipped to Pounds 800,000 (Pounds 1.9m) before exceptional costs of Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 100,000) on flat sales of Pounds 45.4m (Pounds 45.6m.) The 1993 pre-tax deficit also took account of a Pounds 2.6m loss on the sale and termination of operations and reduced net interest costs of Pounds 3.3m (Pounds 4.2m). COMMENT Bridon faces fierce competition from east Asia in its core wire and wire rope business and its strategy for the future - code named Project 360 - which was also unveilled yesterday, is in essence a survival plan. Implementation will take time and will probably involve further disposals. In the meantime, the group is fortunate in having a strong balance sheet. No benefits are expected before 1995 at the earliest, so results are particularly difficult to predict. For the moment the 3.3 per cent dividend yield is supporting the share price.</p>

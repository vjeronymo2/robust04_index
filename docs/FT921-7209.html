			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Attention switches to World Bank's global yen plan INTERNATIONAL investors gave a warm welcome to Spain's giant Y125bn bond issue last week, underlining the appetite of investment managers for Euroyen assets - if they are sensibly priced. The caveat could be important as the market braces itself for another huge issue of yen bonds, against a background of uncertain market conditions. Attention has now switched to the World Bank's planned 10-year global yen bond issue, expected early next month. The deal will be of at least Y150bn, and possibly as large as Y250bn, dwarfing even last week's deal. Nomura International, IBJ International and JP Morgan have been awarded a joint mandate to lead-manage the transaction, the first global offering in yen. The strong underlying demand for yen bonds is based on the outlook for Japanese interest rates, which are likely to fall as the economy slows. The overnight discount rate was last cut by  1/2 a point to 4.5 per cent on December 30. However, it remains uncertain just when the Bank of Japan will cut rates again, and the bond market has been engaged in a game of cat-and-mouse with the authorities this year. Japanese government bond prices peaked in mid-January as the market began to discount another monetary easing. But the central bank deliberately squashed expectations of another early cut in interest rates, squeezing money-market rates higher and causing the bond market to retreat. Government bond yields touched 5.185 per cent on January 22 at the peak of the market, but bounced back to 5.475 per cent on February 2. They have since been caught in volatile trading range. There is also uncertainty over the direction of the Japanese currency. In the run-up to last month's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrial countries, there were expectations of co-ordinated action to strengthen the yen. The argument ran that policy-makers would use a stronger yen to cap Japan's huge trade surplus - which rose 50 per cent to Dollars 78.2bn last year. However, the G7 meeting did not result in any firm commitment on exchange rates. Although the US Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan have since intervened in the foreign exchange markets to prop up the yen, many investors still see the chance of gradual depreciation of the Japanese currency against the dollar. Hence, while there is strong underlying interest in Euro-yen bonds, the immediate market conditions for 'jumbo' issues are not altogether auspicious. Spain recognised this by pricing its bonds at a sensible level. The deal was seen among syndicate officials as a triumph for consensus pricing. Nomura, which won the mandate to lead-manage the deal following a competitive bidding process among top underwriting firms, eventually priced the bonds in consultation with its competitors. It remains to be seen whether the World Bank will be as accommodating. Outstanding World Bank bonds trade at a yield lower than Japanese government bonds, a record which the borrower will be hoping to extend. Against this, the Euro-yen market has seen a move in favour of larger, more liquid issues in recent years as institutional investors have demanded greater liquidity. Last year saw only fractionally more new issues than in 1988, yet average size of the deals more than doubled over the same period. The World Bank global issue will be the most liquid of all yen instruments available internationally. It will be traded in all time zones and will be of a credit quality to attract all types of investors, including central banks. Even so, investors are waiting to see whether the World Bank will trim its ambitions to fit market conditions. Gefco, the UK government-backed export finance agency, launched a rare Pounds 350m three-year floating-rate note issue on Friday. The only outstanding sovereign-backed issue in the sterling FRN sector is New Zealand's Pounds 200m deal, which was launched in June 1986 and is no longer traded actively. Floating-rate notes of sovereign credit quality are used by central banks to manage short-term liquidity. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the lead manager, estimated that around 75 per cent of the deal was placed with central banks and supranational agencies overseas. The bonds pay a margin of 25 basis points less than the six-month London interbank offered rate. The paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.875, where the discounted margin is 20 basis points under Libor. In the past, Gefco has met most of its funding requirements, used to refinance loans made by commercial banks to overseas borrowers, in the fixed-rate bond market. However, the proceeds of Friday's issue were swapped to give Gefco fixed-rate funding at an interest rate comparable to that achieved by the government in the gilts market.</p>

He  referred to the joint Azerbaijani-Latvian Crescent Trade House  established some years ago and noted that the new bilateral ties  being established will benefit both sides.    Welcoming the agreement on establishing diplomatic ties  between Azerbaijan and Latvia, Aliyev said he believed that  trade, economic, scientific, and cultural relations will further  develop between the two republics, which had close ties for  decades, know each other's history and potential intimately, and  are now confidently walking along the road of independence.

			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH DAY FOCUSES ATTENTION ON DETERIORATION OF ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> It was interesting to read such an optimistic view of institutionalized  religion's effectiveness in supporting environmental issues ("Religions Join  the Crusade to Save Earth," Part A, April 19).  </P> <P> The inescapable problem remains, however, that as long as a significant number  of human beings believe they are the only privileged species created in God's  image and therefore capable of "salvation," passages like Genesis 1:28 will  remain the tacit basis for modern Western civilization's destruction of the  interdependent web of life on Earth.  </P> <P> Also, the difference between "dominion" in this verse and implied "stewardship"  in Genesis 2:15 is only one of degree . . . both are rooted in the shortsighted  notion of human superiority ordained by a human-centered God.  </P> <P> For example, the human population is expanding at the unprecedented rate of  nearly 1 billion every 10 years, shoving into extinction one-third of all  species within the next 20 to 30 years. Yet the impact of organized religion  has been one of the strongest barriers to massive global family planning  efforts, the only solution to our successful cohabitation of the planet with  God's other creations. Be assured that the result of the Earth Day L.A.  Population Task Force mailing to 5,400 area churches was far different from the  other responses reported.  </P> <P> CAROL BENSON HOLST  </P> <P> Director, Small Family Pledge Project  </P> <P> West Coast Office, Glendale  </P></p>

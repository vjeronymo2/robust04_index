			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (9): Crossroads to everywhere - Mannheim GERMANS usually describe their extensive motorways and railways with a touch of national pride. In Mannheim, they praise them as the key to the city's success, writes ARIANE GENILLARD. Every day 140 inter-city expresses go through its main railway station; it is 40 minutes from Frankfurt airport, and the trains go on to Munich, Stuttgart or Nuremberg. And, say local officials, its rents are 30 per cent cheaper than in Frankfurt. The local economic development office wants to promote Mannheim as an attractive location for foreign and domestic businessmen. It hopes that it will soon rival Frankfurt as a leading business and financial centre. Located where three Lander meet, Mannheim is the second largest city in Baden-Wurttemberg. It has 300,000 inhabitants and there are another 1.5m people in the surrounding conurbations. It is traditionally an industrial area but now it is trying to develop services. In the early 1970s, two-third of its workers were employed by industry. Today, industry employs only a third and the others are in services, mostly banking and insurances. The city, located on the confluence of the Rhine and the Neckar, has also become an attractive location for freight business, with nearly 200 transport companies based there. The city also enjoys direct rail services to Strasbourg, Luxembourg and Switzerland. Officials hope that the expansion of the services sector, in which 10,000 jobs were created last year, will partially offset the city's 7 per cent unemployment rate which compares with the average rate in the country. One of the new arrivals is Quick Controls, a British company selling computer technology in banking. Mr Ron Jones, chief executive of the UK parent company, says: 'We chose Mannheim because our operational costs were significantly cheaper than in Frankfurt. We decided to run our distribution from Germany rather than England and finally chose Mannheim because it is so close to Frankfurt.' On the city outskirts, a huge business centre is under construction. Its rectilinear lay-out, with lettered and numbered streets crossing each other, is reminiscent of Manhattan. Whether the resemblance will grow, remains to be seen.</p>

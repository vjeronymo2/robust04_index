			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Transport executives win aid for rail sell-off costs Passenger transport executives, which provide subsidised rail services in Britain's main conurbations outside London, are to receive grants from the government to offset extra costs caused by rail privatisation. The grants will cover increased charges for track use and for operating rolling stock likely to be imposed when the railways are restructured after April 1. The Department of Transport said yesterday that the grants would continue indefinitely. The cost of the subsidy is not known. It depends on the charges levied on the train operators by Railtrack, the state-owned company which will manage British Rail's infrastructure from April 1, and these have not yet been set. At present BR provides rail services for the PTEs which cover the Strathclyde conurbation around Glasgow and the Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, West Yorkshire and Birmingham areas. The local authorities controlling the PTEs determine fares and subsidise the services out of their revenues. From April 1 services in Strathclyde will be provided by ScotRail operating as a shadow franchise. Within a year the franchise will be offered to private-sector operators. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, a Scottish Office minister, has told Strathclyde region, which controls the area's PTE, that the Scottish Office will cover fully the extra costs it may incur in 1994-95 'as a result of restructuring the railway and introducing new track and rolling-stock charging regimes'. The English PTEs will receive the subsidy direct from the Department of Transport in the first year, and thereafter from the Department of the Environment through its revenue support grants.</p>

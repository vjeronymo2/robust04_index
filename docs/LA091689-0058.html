			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE PASSES ETHICS MEASURE TIED TO PAY BOOST  </P> <P> Seeking to remove a cloud of scandal hanging over the Capitol, the Legislature  approved a broad ethics measure Friday aimed at curbing special-interest  influence while paving the way for a substantial legislative pay raise.  </P> <P> The proposed constitutional amendment easily won approval in both houses  despite protests from some Assembly members that it would enable legislators to  get a salary increase without ever having to vote for it.  </P> <P> The bipartisan proposal, which will be placed before voters in June, would ban  honorariums for elected state officials, require legislators to hold their  meetings in public and prohibit lawmakers who leave office from lobbying the  Legislature for a year.  </P> <P> At the same time, it would create an independent commission appointed by the  governor that would have the sole power to set salaries for legislators.  </P> <P> Members of the Legislature now receive $40,816 a year plus a tax-free expense  allowance, and some hope the commission would give them a pay hike that would  more than offset the loss of their honorariums.  </P> <P> "There is an unmistakable mood throughout our state that correctly calls for  changes in the way public officials conduct public business," Senate President  Pro Tem David A. Roberti, author of the measure, told his colleagues. "We are  trying our very best, in a very definitive, positive way, to respond to the  public's call."  </P> <P> However, as the Legislature rushed to take action before its adjournment, the  measure ran into harsh criticism in the Assembly from lawmakers who objected to  linking the issue of ethics with a likely salary increase.  </P> <P> "It's ironic that a good ethics proposal should end up being a massive pay  increase," said Assemblyman Phillip Wyman (R-Tehachapi) in urging his  colleagues to vote against the constitutional amendment.  </P> <P> Added Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-South San Francisco): "I think it's a  mistake to link a salary increase with cleaning up our act. We should clean up  our act first and then ask for a pay increase."  </P> <P> The Legislature has been under mounting pressure to enact stricter standards of  conduct ever since the FBI raided the Capitol more than a year ago in an  ongoing investigation of political corruption.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Payments Probed  </P> <P> The federal probe was launched in 1985 to uncover legislators who might have  accepted payments -- such as honorariums -- from special-interest groups in  exchange for favorable action on legislation.  </P> <P> So far, the investigation has resulted in the indictment of Sen. Joseph B.  Montoya (D-Whittier) on charges of extortion, racketeering and  money-laundering. At least five other elected officials continue to be subjects  of the probe.  </P> <P> In private negotiations during the last several weeks, Roberti, Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown and Republican legislative leaders rejected proposals from  some lawmakers simply to adopt new ethics rules outright, such as a ban on  honorariums.  </P> <P> Instead, they agreed to push for adoption of the proposed constitutional  amendment that would impose tougher standards of behavior only if the voters  approve the salary commission plan.  </P> <P> Some supporters of the measure argued that legislators ought to receive higher  pay from taxpayers so they will not be so tempted to take money from groups  that have a stake in the fate of legislation.  </P> <P> "They should get more public money through the front door and less  special-interest money through the back door," said Walter Zelman, a lobbyist  for California Common Cause, a citizens' group that supports the ethics plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Objections  </P> <P> Privately, some members of the Legislature objected to the measure because it  would limit their ability to earn outside income, such as the lucrative  speaking fees many of them collect. Speaker Brown, for instance, reported  receiving $89,600 in speaking fees last year.  </P> <P> But during a heated debate on the floor of the Assembly, most opposition  focused on the question of the salary commission.  </P> <P> Opponents argued that the Legislature is in danger of creating the same  controversy that beset Congress earlier this year when an appointed commission  recommended a congressional pay hike of 50%, from $89,000 to $135,000. The  increase was linked to legislation that would have prohibited members of  Congress from accepting honorariums.  </P> <P> Initially, members of Congress planned to accept the pay raise without a vote,  but a public outcry ultimately forced the federal lawmakers to reject the  increase.  </P> <P> Despite the congressional experience, the California constitutional amendment  won the approval of the Senate by a vote of 33 to 7. Hours later, it passed the  Assembly by a vote of 68 to 7. The proposed amendment goes directly to the June  ballot.  </P> <P> Among its provisions, the amendment would require all legislative committees to  meet in public, except to discuss personnel, security and litigation matters.  </P> <P> It also would prohibit legislators and top state officials from lobbying their  former agencies for a year after leaving office. Current members of the  Legislature, however, would be exempted.  </P> <P> In addition, the measure would require the Legislature to adopt laws limiting  the gifts that members can receive from individuals or groups with an interest  in legislation.  </P> <P> But the constitutional amendment would do little to strengthen the enforcement  of conflict-of-interest violations in the Legislature. While lawmakers are  prohibited from voting on bills in which they have a financial interest, there  is no penalty for such action.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Campaign Fund Curb  </P> <P> In a related action, the Assembly passed another measure by Roberti that would  limit the personal use of campaign funds by elected officials and candidates.  </P> <P> Many elected officials have taken advantage of lax existing laws and used  campaign funds to pay for such things as trips and living expenses. Roberti's  bill would require that expenditures of campaign funds be "directly" related to  campaign purposes. On a 70-0 vote, the Assembly sent the measure to Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> Backers of the ethics proposals said they would go a long way toward imposing  new standards of behavior and improving the image of the Legislature.  </P> <P> "This plan will help remove the cloud that some believe surrounds the Capitol  concerning unethical conduct," said Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin) during  debate on the constitutional amendment. "It's an unequivocal declaration that  we do not tolerate in the Legislature that kind of conduct. We make that  statement to the world."  </P></p>

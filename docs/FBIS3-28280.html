			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Turbulence Accelerated by Political Reform"] </F>   [Text] The 135-day-long 128th Extraordinary Session of the  Diet, which has been called the "political reform Diet," closed  after taking a myriad of twists and turns and even dropping an  undesirable precedent in the end.    What has been notable in the political reform debates that  have continued to go astray and remain disorderly for over five  years is the turmoil in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ]. The underlying  cause of this turmoil can be attributed to the irresponsible  manner in which the two parties handled matters ever since the  issue of political reform surfaced. In the case of the LDP, the  party has shown a lack of consistency as it first started off  with a plan to introduce an electoral system combining  single-seat constituencies with proportional representation,  called the "heiritsu" system, switching over to a plan to  introduce a system with only single-seat constituencies during  the administration of former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa,  only to revert to the original plan during the current Diet  session.    Probably, the real intentions of many LDP members are that  "regarding political reform, the party is merely posing to  appeal to public opinion and it really wants to maintain the  current medium-size constituency system and continue receiving  corporate donations." They also cannot help but admit that they  have put together electoral reform and prevention of political  graft as a single package to camouflage such intentions. Such  is their insincerity that complicated the issue to such an  extent.  <H5>  The LDP and SDPJ Have Failed To Serve Their Purpose </H5>   The SDPJ has also been irresponsible regarding unifying  differing opinions within itself. At the time when Makoto  Tanabe served as SDPJ chairman, the party decided for the first  time to adopt as its own plan the "heiyo" formula, an electoral  system similar to that adopted in Germany which combines  proportional representation with single-seat constituencies.  However, the party failed to hold sufficient intraparty debate  on the issue. Later, under the leadership of Sadao Yamahana,  who succeeded Tanabe as SDPJ chairman, the party decided to  change from the heiyo to the "renyo" formula [another electoral  system proposed by a private council on political reform that  combines single-seat constituencies with proportional  representation], only to switch to the heiritsu system. In this  way, the party has continued to act incoherently.    Such lack of principle has forced the party to repeatedly  make last-minute concessions. For example, it has had to agree  to increase the number of single-seat constituencies from its  originally proposed 250 to 274, then to 280, and finally to 300.  The party has joined the coalition alliance on the condition  that it would accept the heiritsu formula. This has resulted in  adding fuel to intraparty conflicts. Nevertheless, the price  the party has to pay for the lack of sufficient intraparty  debate has shown up as mass dissension in the upper house.    Honestly speaking, we must say that from the turmoil seen in  both the LDP and the SDPJ during the current Diet session, the  two parties are no longer serving their purpose as political  parties. Even at the plenary sessions of both house of the Diet  on the last day of the current session, dissatisfied members of  both parties acted against their parties' decisions. Dissident  upper house SDPJ members have set up a "Dietmen's group to hold  informal talks on preventing political corruption," which  strongly indicates the formation of a separate party within the  party.    We feel that if LDP and SDPJ members pretend to stay under  their respective roofs, at least in form, they are trying to  deceive the voters.    The LDP was shocked when it was reported during the current  Diet session that Michio Watanabe, one of the LDP strongmen,  planned to leave the party. For that matter, we suggest the LDP  take this opportunity to split into three groups: the Watanabe  faction, pro-electoral-reformists, and those advocating taking a  cautious stance on electoral reform. The SDPJ, too, should  refreshen itself by splitting into two groups.  <H5>  The Broken Walls Between Political Parties </H5>   The SDPJ is the largest among the coalition parties. Should  the SDPJ split up, it would be a threat to the Hosokawa  administration. However, even SDPJ dissidents do not want to see  the LDP regain power. As long as the Hosokawa administration  continues its public-opinion-oriented politics, there should be  sufficient room to hope these dissidents may provide support to  the government from outside the cabinet or take a neutral, but  friendly stance.    The underlying cause of turmoil in the current Diet  session originates with the split in the LDP which occurred when  a no-confidence motion against former Prime Minister Miyazawa  was passed at the ordinary Diet session last June because LDP  dissidents voted in favor of the motion. A general election was  then held in July with new conservative parties making rapid  advances, while the LDP and SDPJ suffered major setbacks. This  was then followed by a crop of dissidents from the LDP and SDPJ  who were dissatisfied with their parties' decisions on the  political reform bills.    Such repeated occurrence of cross-voting indicates that  walls  dividing political parties regarding ideologies and policies  have now begun to crumble. The greatest contributing factor to  bringing about this situation is the end of the Cold War and the  collapse of the former Soviet Union. However, it can be said  that structural changes in politics have converged not because  of policy issues, but rather because of issues directly linked  to the interests of individual Dietmen.    Thinking in such terms, we can say that it was an inevitable  phenomenon to see that the LDP and the SDPJ, which have served  fixed roles as the ruling and opposition parties, respectively,  under the Cold War structure, can no longer hold themselves  together as political parties. To change the traditional  political system under which the LDP and SDPJ played the main  roles -- known as the "55-year structure" -- so that it can meet  the needs of the times, the two parties must inevitably fall  apart and regroup.    Should the two parties split, it means there will continue  to  be a formation of a myriad of small political parties for some  time to come. There may undoubtedly be political turmoil and  instability. However, there is no need to magnify such problems  out of proportion as long as there can be established a basic  principle under which the nation can readily respond to  international problems. This is a price the people must pay to  establish a new political system.  <H3>  Pending Issues in Act III of the Regrouping of Political  Parties </H3>   Act I of the regrouping of political parties has already  been  staged with the LDP's split and the subsequent general election  last year. The coalition government's formation and the  confusion over the political reform bills constitute Act II, so  to speak. In view of the implementation of a new electoral  system, we should now expect to see political parties allying  with each other, while individual politicians and would-be  Dietmen look for parties they want to join.    In Act III, what is important is for parties to clarify  policies and assertions under which they plan to assemble and  embark on the process of regrouping. Among both ruling and  opposition parties, there currently exists a "corrupt" situation  where a mixed group of politicians who hold differing views on  ideologies and policies belong to the same parties. To resolve  this problem and provide voters with options which are easily  understandable is an important task in Act III.    Should the political reform bills actually be implemented,  the process of regrouping of political parties would be sharply  accelerated. According to the new laws, political parties will  receive public funds equivalent to each individual Japanese  paying 250 yen. This brings up an issue in which voters would  be linked to politics in a new way. It is only natural for each  individual Japanese citizen to have great interest in the issue  of how the political system should be reorganized.    We have urged that "results be made on political reform no  matter what it takes during the current Diet session." Now that  the issue has been settled for the time being, we feel it  satisfactory that our hopes have been fulfilled.    When the political reform bills were put up for vote in the  upper house, we urged that there be no fear about expected  changes and that they be tentatively approved, although there  still were many problems with the bills. However, the bills  were rejected. Moreover, there was not much to be hoped for in  the negotiations by the joint committee of both houses. Under  such circumstances, lower house speaker Takako Doi and upper  house speaker Bunbe Hara were called to help break the  deadlocked situation. We praise the fact that, in the end,  their efforts have been realized.    However, doubts have been left as to how last-minute  agreements were forged; that is, there are concerns that the  fact that the bills should suddenly be revived in the form of  agreements which differ in content from what was put up to a  vote in both houses of the Diet -- even though this was done  under mutual agreement between the ruling and opposition parties  -- may set a bad precedent regarding future Diet steering.  <H5>  "Turnaround Agreement" Should Be Treated With Caution </H5>   The gist of the accord, reached through a top-level meeting  between Prime Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Yohei Kono,  includes the revival of key points of the LDP-proposed political  reform bills which were rejected at the lower house plenary  session. It has been decided that the number of seats in the  single-seat constituencies would be increased to 300, and a  fund-raising body would be designated to accept corporate  donations to individual politicians. Thus, placing priority on  having the bills enacted has resulted in having to agree to  almost "swallow" LDP demands "in whole."    At the beginning of the ceremony to sign the accord on the  political reform bills, Hosokawa and Kono said: "We came to  agreement on the understanding that an unhealable scar would be  left on parliamentary democracy unless the political reform  bills are enacted." Apparently, they have given consideration  to public opinion which urged settlement during the current Diet  session no matter what it takes. However, it cannot be ruled  out that such a high-handed manner of forging agreements will  not become a malpractice and be applied to other issues. We  would like to point this out for the sake of the development of  healthy parliamentary politics.    Ms. Doi, who acted as a mediator between Hosokawa and Kono,  has been generally acknowledged as an adamant supporter of the  Constitution. However, since this issue concerns the basic  principles of Diet steering, Ms. Doi should clarify her views  when she finds a chance to do so. Fortunately, there still is  opportunity to conduct deliberations on the date of implementing  the political reform bills at the upcoming ordinary Diet  session. It is hoped the Diet will be able to resolve such  apprehensions.</p>

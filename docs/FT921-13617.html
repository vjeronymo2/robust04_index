			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: News in brief WALES: The government's employment record came in for concerted attack in the Commons yesterday as economic issues dominated proceedings in Welsh questions. Mr Barry Jones, shadow Welsh secretary, said that unemployment in the principality had increased by more than 38,000 since the current recession began. The government should now apologise for its 'false promises'. Other parties joined in the assault, with Mr Richard Livsey, the Liberal Democrats' Welsh spokesman, pointing to rising unemployment in his Brecon and Radnor con-stituency, and Mr Dafydd Wigley of Plaid Cymru highlighting the increasing number of applicants for each vacancy. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said that Welsh Development International had recorded 183 projects promising more than 17,000 jobs  - the highest figure ever. ***** FREEDOM OF INFORMATION: Liberal Democrats will seek a freedom-of-information bill early in the next parliament, Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader, said yesterday. The freedom-of-information proposals supported by the party are set out in a backbench MP's bill sponsored Mr Archy Kirkwood, Liberal Democrat MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. They would create a general public right of access to official records held by public authorities, though some information, for example on defence, would not be disclosed.</p>

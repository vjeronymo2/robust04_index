			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Now we know why County Supervisor Pete Schabarum developed a reputation as a  grumpy guy who feuded with colleagues, bureaucrats and reporters during his  18-year reign on the board.  </P> <P> He was in a bad mood because of all the unflattering photos of him published by  newspapers. He held his feelings inside for a long time. But, the other day, he  finally wrote to The Times:  </P> <P> ". . . On the premise that you apparently do not have one decent photo of me in  the several hundred shot in the last year or two, I am enclosing one you may  wish to use."  </P> <P> The decent photo shows a different side of Pete. This isn't Pete, the growling  former football star. This is Smiling Pete. Pensive Pete. Scholarly Pete.  </P> <P> We can only confess to Schabarum, whose retirement takes effect in December:  </P> <P> Pete, we hardly knew ye.  </P> <P> Speaking of big babies. . . .  </P> <P> When Allen James Roughton came into the world at Queen of the Valley Hospital  recently, he tipped the scales at 14 pounds, 3 ounces.  </P> <P> "He's the largest I've ever had in my practice," said Dr. Henry Moghtader, a  practitioner for 32 years. Because of the baby's weight, Allen was delivered by  Cesarean section at the West Covina hospital two weeks before his due date.  </P> <P> Nicknamed Pudge by his parents, Bryce, 32, and Laura, 31, Allen has another  distinction:  </P> <P> At birth, he had outgrown his baby clothes.  </P> <P> The location of a law firm advertising in the publication California Power  Producer is listed as "1901 Ave. of the Starts." An entry-level address in  Century City?  </P> <P> "What an age we live in!" marvels Meredith Brucker of San Marino. "My husband  and I were approaching our 25th wedding anniversary when neighbors of ours  one-upped us by saying they were planning a party for their 50th. When I looked  surprised, considering how young they look, they added it up: His first  marriage lasted 20 years, her first lasted 15 years, and they've been married  to each other for 15 years. Yep, they've been married 50 years, all right!"  </P> <P> Raymond Chandler fans and others who are familiar with "gat" as a slang term  for gun might do a double-take over the notice on the Bruin Theater's  box-office window:  </P> <P> "PASSES AND GATS BEFORE 6:00 ONLY."  </P> <P> Sounds more like Dodge City than Westwood. Actually, the term stands for "group  activity tickets." The other type of gat is frowned upon by the Bruin at all  times.  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> While KCAL (Channel 9) identifies itself as a Los Angeles/Norwalk-based  station, it has no facilities in Norwalk. The designation has appeared on the  license since negotiations involving the station's former owners (RKO General),  a one-time group of bidders (Norwalk-Fidelity Television), and the current  owners (Walt Disney). KCAL can be picked up in Norwalk, though.  </P></p>

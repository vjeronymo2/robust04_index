			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved ahead strongly from the outset with the FT-SE 100 March contract touching 3,143 at one stage during the morning session, but activity remained seasonally low and investor enthusiasm drained away during the final few hours of trading, writes Jeffrey Brown. At the close of pit trading the March contract was 3,118, up 5 points on last Friday's close but 25 points under the best of the day. The premium to the cash market was 21 points while fair value ranged from 16 points to 20 points, according to estimates. Most activity was concentrated into the first hour of trading with dealers reporting good buying from the moment the market opened in the wake of Wall Street's overnight gains. But later in the day as US markets weakened sentiment came off the top. Goldman Sachs was said have been a relatively heavy seller during the afternoon session. The day's contracts totalled just under 3,000. Stock option activity was also weak with 16,821 lots dealt. Puts comfortably exceeding puts. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE activity accounted for more than 11,500 lots. Business among individual options was thin with Cable and Wireless the most actively traded stock, notching up 785 lots. Tesco, HSBC and Wellcome all managed to exceed 500 lots.</p>

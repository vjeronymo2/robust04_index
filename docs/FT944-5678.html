			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / People: Engineering a move north ScottishPower has selected Ian Robinson, chairman and md of Trafalgar House's engineering division, as its new ceo to succeed Ian Preston. Robinson, 52, will move from running the biggest division of Trafalgar House, with sales of Pounds 2.3bn and 20,000 employees, to a utility which turned over Pounds 1.5bn last year and has fewer than 8,000 people. Robinson has run Trafalgar House's engineering division since 1992, having joined the group through its subsidiary John Brown. He graduated in chemical engineering at Leeds University before working for the engineers Kellogg and later Ralph M. Parsons. At Trafalgar House's engineering division, he rationalised John Brown, Davy and Trafalgar House Offshore. The company yesterday indicated that it was sorry to see him go but that his wish to run a plc in the FT-SE top 100 was understandable. Robinson, who is from the north east of England but married a Scot, will join ScottishPower early next year. Preston, 61, will become deputy chairman until he retires next July. His departure removes the company's last executive director to have spent substantial parts of his career with the company when it was in the public sector as the South of Scotland Electricity Board. ScottishPower chose Robinson in preference to the main internal candidate, Duncan Whyte, chief operating officer and former finance director. Another contender for the post of ceo, Michael Smith, left in August to run a new utility business being set up by Fletcher Challenge, one of New Zealand's largest conglomerates.</p>

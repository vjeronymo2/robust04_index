			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Pollution liability worries banks BANKS warned yesterday that lending to some industries could be cut off or severely restricted if they were forced to bear financial responsibility for pollution by companies that borrow from them. The British Bankers' Association called for the uncertainty over legal liability for pollution to be resolved quickly, but said it would be counter-productive for banks to bear financial responsibility for polluting companies. Sir Nicholas Goodison, the association's president, said it would be 'intolerable' for banks to bear such costs in cases where they had taken possession of a company's assets. The association's call followed a speech by Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, last week in which he said that public funds could not bear the costs of environmental clean-ups in all cases where a company is unable to foot the bill. Mr Yeo told the association that banks could not avoid financial liability for pollution in all cases. He said that liability 'should follow responsibility - possibly even to bankers under some circumstances'. The association said yesterday that there was already evidence in the US of banks refusing loans to companies in environmentally risky industries such as chemical-making. Mr Mike Pummell, the head of Barclays' environmental risk management unit, said that environmental liability was a particular concern because banks could face an unlimited potential risk even if they lent a small amount. He said that banks were unlikely to take such risks if the government clarified UK law in order to ensure that banks could bear financial responsibility in cases where the polluting company was unable to pay the costs. Lord Inchyra, the association's director-general, said it was illogical for a bank to bear more responsibility than 'the person who manufactured the machinery, or supplied the concrete, or the power to make the thing work'. Lord Inchyra said it was wrong for banks to take responsibility for lenders' acts because they had 'deep pockets'. He said it could lead to a severe restriction on finance for some industries. The European Commission has issued a green paper on environmental liability, and the government is carrying out a review of liability for polluted land which is expected to lead to legal clarification. Banks have been concerned that aspects of US law on liability could be adopted in Europe. In one case a bank was held to be liable for pollution costs if it had the capacity to influence management by virtue of having lent money.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["AX"-signed report: "Diepgen Content With His Visit to </F> China So Far"]    [Text] Beijing/Berlin -- In an interim stocktaking of his  visit to China, Berlin's Mayor Eberhard Diepgen was very  positive. His wish to expand economic relations has met with  "great interest" and "great openness," Diepgen told journalists  yesterday. It is important that German exports to China are  increased and that the Berlin area gets a bigger share in this.  Businessmen accompanying him were also content with the results  achieved so far.    In securing orders from China, transport and environment  policies play a special role, Diepgen said. Also, old contacts  established during the GDR era should be used and given a  central role.    The new partnership agreement between the German capital and  Beijing will apply to contacts in the fields of culture and  science, as well as industry, such as joint activities at trade  fairs. Furthermore, it has been agreed that contact persons  shall be appointed to organize companies' activities.    Asked whether he has voiced concern about the arrest of  dissidents -- including the most prominent human rights activist  Wei Jingsheng -- either personally or on behalf of the Federal  Government, Diepgen said he had addressed "all issues" that are  relevant between the FRG and China, "including human rights."  He did, however, not say what form this had taken. Diepgen  will travel to Shanghai today; from there he will go on to the  special economic area of Shenzhen.</p>

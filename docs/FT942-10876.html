			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Panama's voters line up for free election The first of Panama's 1.5m voters cast their ballots yesterday in this country's first fully free election in nearly three decades, Reuter reports from Panama City. Thousands of Panamanians lined up, some of them for more than an hour, at 1,900 polling stations across the country, most of which did not open on time. (1200 GMT). 'We are confident that at the end of this day, we will come out on top,' presidential frontrunner Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary party (PRD) told reporters. The most recent polls show Mr Perez Balladares, whose party was driven from power after the 1989 US invasion, went into the final stretch with a 4-9 percentage point lead over Caribbean salsa music star Ruben Blades. Mr Perez Balladares's lead heading into the elections marks a revival of the PRD, which was founded in the 1970s by General Omar Torrijos but which fell into disrepute under the rule of military strongman Manuel Noriega. Mr Blades, who appeared in Robert Redford's movie The Milagro Beanfield War, wooed voters with lively music and the prospect of a clean break from Panama's traditional politics but his economic platform is less clearly defined. As violence has marred Panama's elections for much of its history, the government took pains to ensure a peaceful voting process, banning sales of alcohol nationwide from Saturday and mandating strict security at the polling stations. Some 8,000 police were posted near polling stations, while an international team of observers headed by former US President Jimmy Carter was monitoring the process. Voters will also choose a new 71-member National Assembly and 67 mayoralties in what appear to be the country's freest elections since the late 1960s.</p>

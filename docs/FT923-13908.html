			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / CSCE challenged by outburst of national freedom THE very name Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is calculated to dampen public interest in an organisation which, though now 17 years old, has seldom caught the public imagination. This week, however, leaders of as many as 52 nations are meeting to discuss adapting a forum created to provide a framework for relations between the communist and western halves of Europe and to set standards on human rights, to the post-Cold war world. Human rights and democratic government are still at the centre of the new Helsinki document due to be adopted today. But the focus has again switched to security problems. As President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia so eloquently told the conference yesterday: 'The sudden outburst of freedom has not only untied the straitjacket made by Communism, it has also unveiled the centuries-old, often thorny history of nations. Peoples are now remembering their past kings and emperors, the states they had formed far back in their past and the borders of those states ..It is entirely understandable that such a situation becomes a breeding ground for nationalist fanaticism, xenophobia and intolerance, as well as for all kinds of demagogues, authoritarians and populists to whom people, overcome by a deep feeling of uncertainty, may well be inclined to turn for salvation.' The intention is to transform the CSCE, which includes the US, Canada, Russia and the other former Soviet states, into a more effective instrument for preventing conflicts as well as dealing with them after they have broken out. Procedures for early warning, conflict prevention, crisis management and peaceful settlement of disputes have been or will be set up. A Vienna-based conflict prevention centre and an Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Warsaw have been created. They will be complemented by the appointment of a CSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities to investigate tensions arising from ethnic and minority problems. Peaceful settlement of disputes will be an important element of a revamped CSCE, though there is disagreement on conciliation and arbitration machinery. The French argue for a formal court, while the US wants more flexible political conciliation machinery based on consensus decisions. If a crisis breaks out, formal peacekeeping operations are envisaged. These would normally be carried out on a case-by-case basis by individual CSCE members or, at the request of the CSCE, which has no armed forces of its own, by organisations such as Nato or the nine-nation Western European Union.</p>

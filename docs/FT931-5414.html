			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (1): A giant step for the north - During the past eight years Manchester airport has become the starting point for more than 12m travellers flying around the world. As the Pounds 265m Terminal 2 opens today, Ian Hamilton Fazey traces the growth of this new international hub THIS could be Manchester's year. The city is bidding strongly for the 2000 Olympics and will host the second world Earth Summit this summer. Today, it inaugurates a new Pounds 265m terminal at its airport, itself a symbol of economic resurgence. The terminal will become operational in three weeks after trials. It should mark a great leap forward, not only for Greater Manchester - the 10 boroughs of which own the airport - but for most of northern England, north Wales, and much of the Midlands. The airport's emergence in the past seven years has been startling. If it ever rivalled the comparably ambitious airports of Birmingham and Glasgow, it left them trailing in the 1980s after government designation as the UK's northern hub and international gateway. This has meant that while Birmingham and Glasgow are each still climbing towards 5m passengers a year, Manchester passed 12.4m in 1992. It was at 4.4m in 1980 but the big surge in growth came from 1985 onwards, after it had done market research and taken the findings to the airlines. The argument was simple: tens of thousands of northern people were being forced to travel to London to catch international flights, with considerable waste of time and money. Why should they not fly from Manchester Airport, which - because of the motorway network - is almost at the road travel 'time centre' of Britain? The 'time centre' argument is strong. The M6 and M62 motorways cross at Warrington, about 15 minutes from the airport via the M56, on which the airport lies. The exact time centre is near Knutsford, a pretty Cheshire village almost under the airport's take-off flight-path. Nor was the argument new: Warrington New Town built up a large national distribution industry, with acres of warehousing and thousands of jobs in the 1970s and 1980s by claiming to be at the centre of Britain. A circle of 220 miles radius drawn on the junction of the M6 and M62 takes in 97 per cent of the British population, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, London, Southampton, Bristol and Cardiff. 'About 20m people live within two hours' drive of the airport and 60 per cent of all UK manufacturing is within three hours,' says Gil Thompson, the chief executive. 'We are a nation in our own right up here and events have proved us quite capable of supporting an international hub airport.' Some international carriers such as Qantas and Cathay Pacific stop elsewhere to top up after starting at Manchester, but passenger convenience is greatly improved by not having to change aircraft at London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris or Zurich. Transatlantic services to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, or Toronto are non-stop and up to an hour faster than using London Heathrow because of the shorter distance and lower level of air traffic congestion. A new weekday service to Los Angeles starts next month. All carriers have been pleased with the results, with passengers carried increasing yearly. When American Airlines started a daily service to New York in competition with British Airways, BA feared it might halve the cake; instead, it doubled it. Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, the Cheshire-based construction and civil engineering group, says: 'The north needs this quality of airport. Heathrow is a block. If you come back from the US to here, you can do it in five-and-a-half hours from New York. The more long-haul flights we can get into Manchester, the better it will be for business north of Birmingham.' Manchester's figures show the strength of the market. In 1985, the airport had 2.4m scheduled passengers, 3.7m chartered, and 114,000 in transit, totalling 6.2m. Last year there were 4.8m scheduled, 6.9m chartered, and 747,000 in transit, totalling 12.4m. The three categories grew by 100 per cent, 88 per cent and more than 500 per cent respectively over eight years. Mr Thompson says the growth in transit passengers is proving Manchester's strength as a hub. 'There are now more domestic passengers feeding Manchester as a hub than any other airport in the country, including London,' he says. 'We have 19 domestic routes. Six years ago, only 2 per cent of our turnover was transfer business, now it's 7 per cent. 'That means 250,000 extra passengers, mainly to long-haul carriers, such as American to Chicago, Delta to Atlanta, or Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong. This is the top-up traffic we promised them when they started these services. 'We feed them in from places such as Dundee, Edinburgh, Exeter, Southampton, Belfast, Cardiff and Newcastle. It's expensive in terms of handling and usage of the runway because we are using up slots we would otherwise have for larger aircraft, but it's our investment in the future - to be a hub, rather than an airport that flies from point to point.' Not everyone is happy with Manchester's development, including many inhabitants of Knutsford and its neighbouring village of Mobberley. Mr Jeff Gazzard, leader of Kamjag - the Knutsford and Mobberley Joint Airport Action Group - says much of Manchester's non-hub business in the chartered and holiday tour traffic markets could be pushed elsewhere, so that Manchester would not need a second runway to cope with forecast levels of growth to 2005. Merseyside's political leaders agree with Kamjag, and say if north-west England needs a second international-standard runway, there is no need to build it at Manchester - or rather in Cheshire's green belt - because there is already one at Liverpool, 30 miles away. For Manchester, however, the 55/45 split between chartered and scheduled-plus-transit passengers is not the issue. Each comes with the other, forming a critical mass in the market place that attracts airlines and establishes the airport as a centre of excellence in operations, maintenance and as a focal point for growth. One in four passengers comes from Yorkshire, a proportion that should increase when the motorway is completed around Greater Manchester in about 1996, shortening travelling times from Leeds to about 50 minutes. Mr Thompson cannot see them driving on to Liverpool, although he supports Liverpool having a complementary role, possibly as a co-terminus for holiday traffic from west of the Pennines. Merseyside, however, which is Greater Manchester's economically poor relation, wants air traffic growth spread more evenly to balance the benefits. The issue will be decided by the government after a public inquiry next year. Manchester will have a powerful argument: the airport is one of northern England's most powerful economic generators; capping its growth when it runs out of runway capacity at 18m passengers would knock on everywhere. The second runway will have wide support. Throughout the 1980s, the Northern Consortium - a transpennine grouping of all local authorities  - consistently pushed for the airport's development so the north could gain the economic benefits of growth. Only the five Merseyside authorities are preventing consensus in the North West Regional Association of councils. Northern business also supports strongly the second runway, as well as wanting improved links by road, rail and air to speed up business travel to Manchester. Moreover, the airlines also want to grow together in one place. Manchester is used by 94 airlines serving 165 destinations. Scheduled traffic should now grow faster, with opportunities to start new routes in Europe, following the arrival of the single market and the deregulation that has come with it. The evidence is that regional hub airports have a developing role in air transport as places like Heathrow become more congested. They also have an economic and social impact on their hinterlands that are important forces in reconstructing regional economies. Manchester has not been Europe's fastest-growing airport for the past five years by accident. It is fast closing on London Gatwick's throughput of around 19m passengers and a second runway would take it to 30m, compared with Heathrow's 40m now. There could also be 50,000 new jobs by 2005.</p>

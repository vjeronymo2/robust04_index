			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed BB: "Ames Case: Switzerland Cannot Grant </F> Mutual Judicial Assistance"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA  database]    [Text] Bern, 4 Mar (ATS) -- The Federal Police Office [OFP]  has rejected the U.S. request for mutual judicial assistance in  the Ames case. According to a press release from the Federal  Office of Justice and Police [DFJP] published on Friday [4  March], espionage is considered a political crime, which  excludes all judicial assistance. However, three Swiss bank  accounts held by Ames have been frozen.    The American request is based on the 1973 Treaty on Mutual  Judicial Assistance in criminal matters. The request, which was  made as part of an investigation into the spying activities of  Aldrich Ames, a high-ranking CIA official, and his wife, Maria  del Rosario Casa Ames, was received in Bern on 25 February.    Since 1985, the couple allegedly transmitted information on  secret operations and on CIA agents to the former Soviet Union,  and later to Russia, in exchange for over $1.5 million. Part of  this money was deposited in Swiss bank accounts in Zurich and  Geneva. The United States has requested that the accounts be  frozen and that all banking documents be confiscated and turned  over to it.    Switzerland cannot grant United States judicial assistance  in  this case, because spying, for which the Ames couple stands  accused, constitutes a political crime, meaning it is  exclusively directed against the state's political and social  organization.    The treaty on mutual judicial assistance rules out its  inapplicability to political crimes. The Public Ministry and  the cantons concerned are making every effort to determine  whether the Ameses have committed crimes within Swiss  jurisdiction.    On Thursday evening, they ordered the freezing of three bank  accounts in Zurich and Geneva.</p>

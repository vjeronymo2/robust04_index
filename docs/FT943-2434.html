			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The bond market is no place for the nervous. Traders have been so uncertain about interest rate trends in Germany that yields have had no place to go but up. The average yield on 10-year bunds exceeded 7.5 per cent last week; that on all quoted government securities closed at a year's high of 7.38 per cent. However, the Bundesbank has decided enough is enough. It made clear last week that its key rates would be put on hold - Thursday's council meeting left them untouched - and that the next move was as likely to be up as down. Traders took remarks by Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, Bundesbank deputy president, to mean that the discount and Lombard rates, last cut by half a point to 4.5 and 6 per cent in May, would be maintained beyond the German general election in October. The same applies to the securities repurchase (repo) rates, now 4.85 per cent. Some economists expect no change until well into 1995, in view of the economy's strength and the still high money supply growth - the August figure is due to be published this week. Inflation is also being closely watched; the Bundesbank will not be happy until the rate falls nearer its goal of 2 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Craig Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban Mar 29 SAPA -- Monday's [28 March] killings  in Johannesburg marked the start of a struggle to the end  between the African National Congress [ANC] and the Zulu nation  unless the April election date was postponed, Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Tuesday. "The  whole question of the sovereignty of the kingdom of kwaZulu must  finally be resolved before there can be an election," he said in  a hard-hitting statement from Ulundi.    Mr Buthelezi directly blamed the ANC for Monday's violence,  describing the shooting of Zulu marchers outside the ANC's head  office as the "Shell House massacre". April 27 -- the initial  election date -- should be declared a "national Zulu day of  mourning", to remember those killed on Monday, said Mr  Buthelezi. He added that there were reports of Zulus massing at  Johannesburg hostels while others were travelling to the Reef to  support their kin. "If we do not take action as elected  representatives of the Zulu people and as grassroots leaders,  there is no saying what the people will do in taking the law  into their own hands."    "The only way to be sure of avoiding the degeneration of the  South African situation into one of ungovernability and violence  beyond control is to suspend the election date, and to seek to  establish a proper basis for a free and democratic election.  Very unfortunately what has thus far taken place in kwaZulu and  in the Transvaal are only precursers of what will yet come,"  said the Inkatha Freedom Party president.    Mr Buthelezi's comment that there could be no effective  negotiations on Zulu sovereignty within the framework of the  present election timetable apparently ruled out his  participation in this week's planned summit with State President  F W de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela. King Goodwill  Zwelithini earlier on Tuesday also pulled out of the summit,  citing Monday's violence as the main reason.    Mr Buthelezi charged Monday's killings made it clear the ANC  remained committed to its "pre-prepared plans to destroy the  kwaZulu government and the kingdom. We can now see that the ANC  is very serious in the attempts it is making to destroy the  kwaZulu government and to take all Zulus into an ANC-dictated  future by the force of violence that they are capable of." He  alleged there could be no doubt the ANC was fully aware of the  consequences of what "they planned and executed".    "They know that the Zulu resistance to what they are  attempting to do constitutionally and politically will now lead  to a flash flood of demands for retribution running through Zulu  society. The pretext that most of the Zulus support the ANC in  kwaZulu is now shown to be ridiculous. One does not do to your  supporters what the ANC did to people who were doing no more  than marching to express their solidarity with their king's call  for the recognition of the sovereignty of the Zulu people. The  Shell House massacre shows that we have now entered a final  struggle to the finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation,  unless there is the extension of the voting date deadline."    Mr Buthelezi alleged "the same ANC which perpetrated the  Zulu  massacre" controlled the Transitional Executive Council [TEC].  The world was now witness to what the TEC's intentions were.    He charged ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa's call for  the disbanding of the kwaZulu government was a call which "the  TEC will back with ANC political violence and state violence".    The IFP had called for an immediate Goldstone Commission  investigation into Monday's bloodletting Mr Buthelezi said, but  claimed the commission was perceived to be partial to the ANC.  "If it is to correct the negative image it has, now is the time  to do so." But, Mr Buthelezi added, the police had to act  against the ANC and arrest those behind Monday's violence. "It  is now time that the state president came to his political  senses. In agreeing to the election in the present climate of  violence, and ignoring the fact that many millions of ordinary  people are opposed to the election, he has agreed to a course of  events, and to an election, in which it is not the will of the  people that will determine the results, but the Machiavellian  planning of the ANC and the capacity they have to unleash  violence that will decide the election."    Mr Buthelezi said international mediation on the  constitutional deadlock should now take place in the wider  context of the election being staged in an atmosphere charged  with violence. Had the IFP's bottom line amendments to the  interim constitution been met, Monday's events and "other events  yet to come" would not have taken place, Mr Buthelezi claimed.</p>

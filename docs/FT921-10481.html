			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Computer errors at DTI arm - Public Accounts DISCREPANCIES in the accounts of the Insolvency Services Agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, responsible for overseeing liquidations and bankruptcies, were caused by faulty computer systems, the public accounts committee heard yesterday. The report on the agency's accounts indicated a difference of Pounds 13.3m between balances in different records was discovered during a changeover of computer systems in 1989. Mr Peter Joyce, the agency's chief executive and inspector general, said the errors occurred because of manual reconciliation of two different systems. The shortfall has now been reduced to Pounds 133,000. Mr Joyce said the difference could not necessarily be eliminated entirely. MPs criticised the agency for not planning its information technolology strategy adequately.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / UK Company News: B Matthews buys NZ lamb business Bernard Matthews, the turkey products group, yesterday announced its first foray into red meat production with the purchase of a New Zealand lamb business. In its third acquisition in 12 months, Matthews is paying an undisclosed sum for state-owned Advanced Foods, which has supplied lamb roasts to the UK company since 1985. It is believed the price is less than the Pounds 3.9m net asset value attributed to Advanced Foods. Mr David Joll, Matthews' managing director, said the acquisition would open new markets to the company's more familiar turkey products. About 50 per cent of Advanced Foods' sales are outside Europe, to markets such as North America and Japan. Matthews is expected to invest about Pounds 2m in expanding the business and will introduce lamb products through its distribution outlets in France and Germany this year. Advanced Foods, owned by the New Zealand Meat Producers Board, was created in 1985 to produce lamb products using technology licensed from Matthews. Last year Advanced Foods made profits of less than Pounds 1m on sales of Pounds 15m. Mr Joll said the purchase was expected to make a small contribution in the current year.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: An improving climate for flotations - A line up for market and a revival of investor interest THE CLIMATE for flotations has rapidly moved from freezing to a near summer-like warmth as investor interest has revived. Recent issues have been comfortably over-subscribed and first day dealings have shown premiums. There is a string of companies lining up for market taking advantage of historically high share prices. Institutional investors are currently keen on smaller companies - most of the recent flotations have given issuers market values of under Pounds 100m. Private investors, painfully aware of falling returns from cash, are turning to equity investment. New issues provide a commission-free way of buying shares, with the hope of a 'stagging' profit. However, there are concerns that the public is being disadvantaged in some issues. Smaller flotations are conducted through institutional placings, with the private investor excluded. Such has been the recovery in sentiment that the Stock Exchange has reversed last summer's relaxation of its listing rules on the proportion of shares to be offered publicly. That move was made when some issues attracted less public demand than expected. Then the Exchange told corporate financiers they could negotiate to cut the proportion to be offered to the public. According to the listing rules issues raising more than Pounds 30m must be by public offer, but up to half can be placed with institutions. A greater proportion can be placed in particularly large issues or, the Yellow Book says, 'in other exceptional circumstances'. Poor retail demand appears to come in that category. In subsequent offers a 75:25 per cent split between firm placing and public offer was normal. But as retail interest in flotations picked up, the Stock Exchange began to edge back towards the written rule. A turning point was the David Lloyd Leisure flotation in March. That issue raised Pounds 59m with 75 per cent of the shares placed firm. The former tennis star's business attracted applications for over 7 times the number of shares on offer. Mr Philip Stephens, of UBS, the stockbroker, says 'the success of some issues has pushed us back to the rubric'. He acts for both Stagecoach, the coach operator which floated in April with a 65:35 split, and for OGC International, the contractor specialising in North Sea oil and gas construction, due to float later this month with a 50:50 division. 'Retail interest is certainly there and has been developing through the year' says Mr Stephens. The Exchange is prepared to give some leeway on the Pounds 30m issue size, with a public offer not necessarily required for issues up to Pounds 35m. In March Hambros Insurance Services raised Pounds 35m through a placing and financial intermediaries offer. This willingness to raise the minimum amount where a public offer becomes obligatory suggests the Exchange is finding it harder to justify demanding a public offer on a Pounds 30m issue. This minimum has, in any case, been gradually rising for years and the 50 per cent institutional placing is relatively new. One merchant banker remembers doing an offer for sale for Pounds 5m in 1986. Another says: 'People forget it is not very long ago that issues over Pounds 30m were all straight offers for sale to the public'. The Exchange is believed to be looking at alternatives to public offers so long as they can be shown to accommodate public demand. It appears sympathetic to the financial intermediaries route. It may gradually edge the minimum upwards, so long as there are no vociferous complaints. However, it is understood to believe that larger offers, and not just privatisations, do need public offers. The rise of the financial intermediaries offer could thus be part of a trend away from the traditional public offer for sale, with all that they entail in terms of fixing a price and underwriting the issue over the week or so before applications come in and dealings start in the shares. Privately, sponsors of issues and institutional investors would be happy to have a cosy arrangement cutting out the private investor. Publicly the line is often 'if retail demand is there, why not tap it?' Says one corporate financier: 'We prefer a firm placing element. It gives you a stable long term institutional investor base. If you offer the lot to the public you have to price it a bit lower to make it go and institutions end up buying it back'. The expectation of low pricing and stagging profits were partly behind the huge - and many regard as undesirable - oversubscriptions of new issues in the mid-1980s. Some fear it could happen again this year. One banker said: 'Some recent oversubscriptions are unhealthy. People have no idea what they are buying, they are just stagging. One issue will go wrong, fingers will get burnt and then we'll be back to last summer again'. Some brokers and bankers feel that this could be avoided if there was a further development of a 'book-building' approach to new issues, with a greatly truncated period between pricing an issue and dealings starting. In the US most of an issue is sold in advance on the basis of a 'red herring' prospectus which contains a price range. Pricing is done one evening, on the basis of demand found among investors, and the issue is usually declared 'all sold' the following morning. To some extent the UK practice is moving that way. Pathfinder prospectuses, introduced with the first British Telecommunications sale in 1984, do not include a price range. But they do provide the basis for informal book-building with institutions. 'Pricing is very much driven by institutional demand even if half is going to the public,' says one broker. The intermediaries offer could tie into a book building approach, thus accommodating private investor demand while removing the risks inherent in an offer for sale. But such an offer excludes investors who do not have a stockbroker and prefer to apply for issues 'off the page'. And it means extra commissions for either the company or the investor to pay to the intermediaries. Companies such as Sharelink, the private client dealing service, and the New Issue Register, have launched new issue schemes for private investors. Sharelink offers an application and dealing service under which it applies for the shares on behalf of investors and can then sell them on the first day of dealing, or later, or transfer them to a personal equity plan. NIR hopes to offer sponsors of issues a list of investors prepared to buy into new issues. If such schemes are plugged into the financial intermediaries offers or even the institutional placing, then an issue could be fully placed - including a placing with retail investors - in advance of pricing. It would cut out the need for a period when investors fill in and post applications. Should the Stock Exchange go along with such notions, the days of heady oversubscriptions, queues of applicants at banks' doors and frantic first day dealings, at least in smaller issues, could be over.</p>

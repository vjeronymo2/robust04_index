			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Poor tilt at Don Quixote a compendium of classical improbabilities laid at the door of Cervantes - is no stranger to our ballet repertory. Ballet Rambert acquired an intelligent small-scale production in 1962. Festival Ballet showed a rather grander and jollier version in 1970. In 1966, Rudolf Nureyev made an excellent staging of the piece as he had known it at the Kirov, and subsequently produced it around the world. A few years ago Northern Ballet Theatre also proposed an entertaining production. Now the Royal Ballet has decided to acquire a Don Quixote. And, inexplicably, has chosen the production which Mikhail Baryshnikov made for American Ballet Theatre in 1978. Everyone has had their way with Don Quixote since Petipa originally mounted it in Moscow in 1869, and revised it for St. Petersburg in 1871. In 1900 Alexander Gorsky edited the Moscow staging, and this recension was brought to Petersburg two years later and serves as source for most subsequent versions. The current Kirov and Bolshoi presentations respect Alexander Gorsky's 1900 edition. Nureyev cleaned the text, made it slightly more logical, and fired every company who presented it with a sense of classic vitality and dramatic verve that exactly suited his ebullient view of the old war-horse. As it arrived at Covent Garden on Wednesday night, produced by Anthony Dowell, with a new design by Mark Thompson and the merry old Minkus score arranged and orchestrated by Christopher Palmer, this Don Quixote is deeply depressing. Its chief fault is to mistrust the historic conventions of the original. It looks uncaring of the text, of the historic relevance of the piece, of the idea of a 19th century balletic Spain where artists can be encouraged to play joyously with roles and with the dance itself. To make sense of the choreography - even in Baryshnikov's charmless recension - requires an appreciation of how national dance attitudes may be used to colour classic rule, how academic propriety may be given a flavour of pimento. Steps must flash. Colours must be bright, and passions brighter. Whatever seriousness once obtained with the narrative, this has now given way to a parade of dance cliches and received ideas, which must be newly minted for us by vivacity in playing, by bravura, and a willingness to believe in the mad conventions of the piece. Wit is all, and there is not a witty thing in this production. Mark Thompson's designs seem to me to be wholly misconceived. The first act square in Barcelona is a claustrophobic construction of blank red and ochre walls, embellished with a vast and skied statue of the Blessed Virgin, and a suggestion of de Chirico perspective. The tavern is austere, unlikely in its wild contrasts in size of barrels and bottles; the windmill scene is so stylised as to make little sense. To 'modernise' an old ballet needs more sympathy for its conventions and attitudes than Thompson shows, and his costumes are massively unsuited for such a spectacle. Funereal black abounds. Unadorned bodices, glum and unflattering shapes, and hideous cutlet-frill tutus in the last act, betray the dance. The second act's dryads are got up in windmill head-dresses and tutus, better suited to the Lido than the opera-house. They are inexcusably crass. The version of the score is hardly more appealing. Baryshnikov hustles the action along, and Minkus is similarly streamlined. The score was never the greatest of musical shakes, but the edition performed in Petersburg is tuneful, sparkling, and its blatancies accord with the buoyancy of that staging. Christopher Palmer's editing is efficient, yet rarely beguiles the ear - and, in the final scene, is more vulgar than is appropriate. For the artists of the Royal Ballet, as for any Western company, there are huge problems in adapting to the stylistic demands of classic-Hispanic virtuosity. The Royal Ballet's first cast, led by Viviana Durante and Irek Mukhamedov, seemed bemused, and not a little uneasy - as who should say: 'Where the hell are we?'. They are in no way helped by their outfits, or by the glooming designs. Nor does the staging - as production or choreographic text - offer any inducement to gaiety. The dance looks dull, the staging ill-paced, and the narrative, such as it is, in constant danger of disintegration. Characterisations are, not surprisingly, blank. As Kitri, Durante gives the last act duet a bright edge of virtuosity, but her reading is as yet unrelaxed, without radiance or generosity. Irek Mukhamedov, a wonderfully happy and engaging Basilio in the Nureyev version with the Royal Ballet of Flanders, looks here like a man who realises he is on board the Titanic. The rest of the cast apparently felt the same: they could plainly hear the strains of 'Nearer, my God, to Thee' coming from the pit. Don Quixote is sponsored by the Linbury Trust and The Friends of Covent Garden. It is in repertory at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.</p>

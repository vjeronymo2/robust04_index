			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UPHOLDING THE LAW  </P> <P> I know not what position others may take, but as for me, when I vote for local,  state or federal office candidates, I expect that those candidates will  recognize that they owe an unreserved allegiance to behave in conformity with  the laws governing this land.  </P> <P> If they wish to change the laws under which our governmental tiers operate,  they have a perfect right to do so just as long as it is done within the limits  set by Constitution.  </P> <P> Under those circumstances, I will support their right to do so, whether I agree  with, or oppose, their position.  </P> <P> I think it takes unbridled, dictatorial gall to tell officials of our  government that they will be, or are putting themselves in jeopardy of being,  excommunicated if they do what they have been elected to do.  </P> <P> Most oaths of office include clauses requiring the candidate to agree to  enforce the obligations of the office without reservations. If the candidate  plans to have reservations about performing the legal duties of an office, the  oath should not be taken and the nominee is not legally entitled to hold the  office. If the candidate insists on declaring a higher loyalty to a person  claiming to hold a mandate from the divinity, that allegiance should be  exercised from the pulpit and not from a public office where a commitment has  been made to uphold the laws of the land.  </P> <P> SI LIFF  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

The opposition accuses the FRODEBU  cadres and members of having organized the massacres in which  tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed.    The government, which has led a reclusive life in the Hotel  du Lac since October, fearing that its surviving members might  also be liquidated, has tried, with difficulty, to overcome its  traumas. It has tried to do so with great distrust, because the  putschists are still at liberty and Uganda has just refused to  extradite four of them! An important stage was the appointment  of a new head of state: This was achieved by a consensus  between FRODEBU, which has a majority, and UPRONA [National  Union and Progress Party], the main opposition party; Cyprien  Ntaryamira won the votes of 78 out of 79 deputies in the  National Assembly. This unanimity ought to have relaxed the  atmosphere, but that was not the case: The radical opposition  was in fact demanding that new presidential elections be  organized, while the state of the country obviously makes the  organization of such an election psychologically impossible and  economically too costly. The extreme opposition, playing on  legalism, also hoped that the Constitutional Court would back  its interpretation of the Constitution. Following the election  of Mr. Ntaryamira, the Constitutional Court was indeed consulted  and, fearing that it might invalidate the vote in favor of the  new president, the government preferred to dissolve it before it  had even given its verdict, thus giving FRODEBU's opponents the  pretext they were seeking to condemn the "civilian coup d'etat."  [passage omitted]    The humanitarian organizations, the only groups that dared  move around Bujumbura, fear new explosions of violence. Indeed,  it seems that the Hutu population is not prepared to accept that  the paralysis of the institutions by excessive legalism should  deprive it of the election victory it won last June.    According to some reports, peasants in the hills have  started  cutting down trees and barricading roads again; perhaps to  prevent incursions by the army. Perhaps the Tutsis also fear  that new massacres are being planned.... It also seems clear  that Tutsi extremists, whose putsch partly failed last October,  are determined to paralyze government action. This would  indicate that the coup d'etat, or rather the trial of strength,  is not yet really over. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (6): An ever-present challenge - Building standards have risen dramatically TECHNOLOGY for improving the energy efficiency of buildings has been around for decades. But the proudest claims for some of today's high-specification designs in Britain would make Scandinavians snigger, as they were achieving similar standards half a century ago. Closer to home, a couple of hundred Salford council houses built in 1975 would still put to shame the figures touted by modern designers who insist they have made some giant step forward. These endless cycles of 'discovery' spring from the fact that buildings offer such obvious scope for improvement. They absorb almost half the country's energy output and emit twice as much carbon dioxide as that which belches from vehicle exhausts. Domestic buildings alone use half our gas and a third of the electricity. The problem is that energy efficiency has to be constantly re-invented. During booms, occupiers take anything they can get; in slumps few will pay extra for some nebulous long-term saving. Individual advances are forgotten then rediscovered. Overall standards have improved enormously, however, as building regulations are cranked up to higher specifications. The latest upgrade was designed to make minimum insulation levels 20 per cent more efficient and many developers automatically work to a much higher benchmark. New housing may fall far behind standards in other countries but still scores seven out of 10 on the National Energy Foundation scale compared with a miserable national average of four. Using timber frames stuffed with insulation well above minimum standards helped Laing Homes score an average of nine on one range of flats. Other factors such as siting and internal layout for maximum solar gain are also crucial. A handful even manage a perfect 10. 'In one flat this was achieved by switching to low-energy light bulbs while another was given a larger hot water cylinder and fan-assisted storage heater,' says sales director Pauline Land. Custom Homes scored 9.7 on a show property at the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival by using a heat recovery system, and putting six inches of Rockwool insulation in the walls and nine inches in the roof. Builders Butcher &amp; Slater scored a similar 9.3 through similar efforts on a 'green' home in Huddersfield. But these near-perfect scores are exceptions to the general run of new houses. High land values usually force compromise in siting and internal layouts, while the current fierce price competition has seen some volume builders quietly drop high-profile experiments in super-efficient designs. 'Buyers are still not that keen to pay extra for better performance,' says Ms Land. Running costs as low as Pounds 5 a week can appeal to first-buyers although the up-front price tends to take priority. Housing associations have more incentive to produce efficient designs because they rent to low-income families, but even they are often hamstrung by cost limitations imposed from above. Commercial developers face similar problems of making progress in a dead market. Air-conditioning became almost an industry standard for office blocks during the 1980s and both institutional landlords and tenants now expect such comforts. But they do not come cheaply. 'Annual energy costs can be as high as Pounds 23 a sq metre compared with around Pounds 4 for naturally ventilated buildings,' says David Hitchcock of property consultants Richard Ellis. Some experiments have set out to prove that reverting to older methods would not be regressive. Two years ago Argent Group took advantage of the new BREEAM system of energy-rating created by the Building Research Establishment to back designs for a 'green' office block in Basingstoke. 'We felt occupiers were already looking for buildings that were both cheap to run and environmentally friendly,' says development manager David Partridge. Glazed towers trap the sun, warming the air and drawing ventilation naturally through the building. Energy costs would have been 25 per cent of an air-conditioned block. But the slump intervened and the experiment remains unproven until some enlightened owner-occupier comes along - 'the idea was right and could still be used somewhere else,' says Mr Partridge. Developers would welcome the chance to phase out air-conditioning, which adds as much as 30 per cent to building costs. But most are unsure that it can be ousted from city centres, where tenants expect to be sealed away from traffic fumes and noise. It can be made more efficient, however. Almack House, a prime 100,000 sq ft building in the heart of St James's, scored highly on the BREEAM scale by adopting such techniques as computerised electrical and mechanical services and special glass which collects solar heat. 'Good management can save up to Pounds 7 a sq metre in running costs,' says Mr Hitchcock. But economics raise their head again on such schemes. Almack has a 'facility' for a heat recovery system but, with a pay-back as long as five or 10 years, it is beyond even an enlightened developer like the Dutch pension fund PGGM, to install. That will be up to some future occupier. Advances are being made, though. Another of the developer's buildings has a basement full of table-tennis balls filled with salt water. These are cooled each night with cheap electricity, cutting the cost of air-chilling during the day. As a bonus, this reduces demand for roof-top plant, which diminishes noise and nuisance to neighbours. Erik Batstra of the fund's development subsidiary, Belt Mountains BV, is keen to push forwards the boundaries of efficiency because he wants to attract international tenants. And his experience in Germany is that they will not put up with power-hungry services just because this is the local market norm. In fact, just as homebuyers hold the key to better housing, so business occupiers are crucial to the shape of future commercial buildings. 'If we could persuade owners and tenants to accept a temperature band expanded by a mere degree or so, it would go a long way towards more efficient, greener - and cheaper - buildings,' says Mr Hitchcock.</p>

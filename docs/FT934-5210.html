			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / HK telephone monopoly to end The Hong Kong government said yesterday that three companies would be licensed to compete with Hongkong Telecom, the colony's telephone monopoly, in the provision of local telephone services when the monopoly's exclusive licence expires in 1995. Government officials hailed the decision as an important stage in the implementation of its pro-competition telecoms policy. After a lengthy review the government decided last year to permit competition in the local market. Hongkong Telecom retains its monopoly on international telephony, which generates most of its profits, until 2006. Mr Gordon Siu, secretary for economic services, said the advent of competition would enhance Hong Kong's position as a financial and business centre in Asia and bring substantial benefits to business and residential telecoms users in the colony. The award of the licences is, however, subject to the approval of the Chinese government. Under the terms of Hong Kong's transfer to China in 1997, matters which straddle that year first have to be agreed with Beijing. It is not expected that China will raise any objection to the three groups selected to operate competitive services against Hongkong Telecom. The three large conglomerates - Hutchison Whampoa, Wharf and New World - all have close links with the Chinese leadership. The companies plan to compete with Hongkong Telecom in the provision of niche services for consumers and businesses, mostly video, computer and data services. Wharf, which also operates a cable television network, will have the greatest access to the household market of the three. Analysts said that the advent of competition would not pose a serious threat to Hongkong Telecom's revenues. Mr Andrew Harrington, telecoms analyst with Salomon Brothers, said the new entrants would keep the monopoly on its toes, in terms of the provision of service to customers, and in the future bring to the market services which are today only embryonic.</p>

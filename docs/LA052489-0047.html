			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBERS BLAME ALOHA AIRLINE IN FATAL ACCIDENT;  </P> <P> SAFETY BOARD CRITICIZES MAINTENANCE WORK, SEES LAXITY BY FAA, BOEING  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board Tuesday primarily blamed Aloha  Airlines' maintenance program for an accident last year in which the roof of a  Boeing 737 ripped open over Hawaii, killing a stewardess and imperiling 94  others on board.  </P> <P> On a 4-1 vote, the safety officials found after a 13-month investigation that  laxity at both the Federal Aviation Administration and the Boeing Co. also had  contributed to the loss of an 18-foot section of the jetliner's fuselage.  </P> <P> Specifically, the board laid the accident's "probable cause" to the failure of  Aloha's maintenance workers to detect cracks around rivets in the 19-year-old  fuselage. It said that the airline's management did not "supervise properly its  maintenance force."  </P> <P> In addition, the board criticized the FAA for failing to "evaluate properly  Aloha Airlines' maintenance program and to assess the airline's inspection and  quality control deficiencies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inaction on Lap Joints  </P> <P> It further cited the FAA for failure to require inspection of fuselage lap  joints, as had been proposed by Boeing in an "alert service bulletin."  </P> <P> And the board suggested that the FAA and Boeing should have taken corrective  action after the discovery of early production difficulties in the bonding of  lap joints on 737 fuselages.  </P> <P> The safety officials made 21 recommendations to the FAA, Aloha and the rest of  the airline industry for improving maintenance and inspection programs.  Although the safety board does not have the power to enforce its  recommendations, the FAA and the airlines nearly always follow its advice.  </P> <P> Investigators said that sweeping action by the FAA last week, including  ordering $142 million in modifications to older Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s,  should go far toward preventing catastrophic failures on aging airliners of the  sort that struck the Aloha craft.  </P> <P> In a major change of philosophy, the agency said that the modifications would  have to be made when planes reach a certain age or complete a certain number of  flights -- not merely when inspections turn up problems, the former policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stewardess Killed  </P> <P> In the Aloha accident of April 28, 1988, a stewardess was killed when she was  swept out through a gaping hole in the plane's fuselage. Of the other 94  persons on board, 61 passengers and crew members were injured, but the pilot  managed to land the airliner safely at Kahului airport on Maui. The plane had  been flying at 24,000 feet en route from Hilo to Honolulu.  </P> <P> Safety board investigators examined the roles of metal fatigue, aircraft  design, airline maintenance, crew performance and FAA directives affecting the  aircraft, which had logged nearly 90,000 flights.  </P> <P> During a daylong meeting, metallurgist James Wildey told the board that a  3-by-4-foot piece of metal skin from the plane showed that it had been repaired  but still contained cracks that were missed by airline mechanics before the  accident.  </P> <P> "The piece that they repaired contained additional fatigue cracks that were  underneath the repair patches, between the repair patches and on either side of  the repair patches," Wildey said.  </P> <P> Aloha's president and chief executive officer, A. Maurice Myers, said the  airline "took exception" to that analysis, adding that there was "substantial  evidence that those multiple cracks were not detectable."  </P> <P> Myers noted that close inspections after the Aloha incident uncovered similar  cracks in a number of other aging Boeing 737s and said: "This is an  industry-wide problem that has already been addressed by the industry and the  FAA."  </P> <P> Safety board member Joseph Nall adopted the same position. He dissented from  the board's assignment of blame, saying that he thinks that responsibility  should be spread across the airline system for its failure to deal earlier with  the problem of aging airliners.  </P> <P> Board member Jim Burnett cited indications that the FAA had not followed  recommendations from the plane's manufacturer in issuing maintenance directives  to airlines.  </P> <P> He noted that one Boeing service bulletin had directed airlines to replace  rivets along the fuselage even before the Aloha 737 split open. But an FAA  airworthiness directive was vague in its requirements, he said.  </P> <P> "The real issue is that (the FAA) didn't follow through on Boeing alert service  bulletins," Burnett added.  </P> <P> Chief safety board inspector Barry Trotter said that Aloha has improved its  maintenance program since the accident.  </P> <P> Myers contended that the airline was "in full compliance with FAA requirements  and industry standards at the time" of the accident and has since made many  changes.  </P> <P> Aloha has scrapped three of its 737s, including the one that ripped open, and  purchased several new planes, giving its fleet an average age of 10 years,  compared with 15 at the time of the accident.  </P></p>

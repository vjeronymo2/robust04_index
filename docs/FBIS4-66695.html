			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wajih Abu-Zikra: "Hegemony or Peace </F> Israeli-Style"]    [Text] Professor Ibrahim Sa'dah has posed, in his article,  "Welcome to the Challenge," a highly significant, momentous, and  insightful question: What will be Egypt's position if Israel  realizes its dreams of a new "warm" peace with all the Arabs, as  distinct from the "cold" peace with Egypt?    I believe the answer to this question will be the linchpin  of  political action in the near future, and for years to come. In  order for the answer to the question to be efficacious, I  believe AKHBAR AL-YAWM, in cooperation with a research  organization, should hold a conference in which Egypt's  scientists and political and intellectual leaders take part in  adopting a "strategic Egyptian plan" for facing the coming  challenge. The plan would include a method for managing the  "coming peace struggle" primarily in Egyptian, and, secondarily,  in Arab terms. Every party to the conflict has its own vision of  the post-peace phase.    Israel: Israel sees, in this peace, the second  phase of Israel's evolution. The first phase was the  establishment of the state itself; it was established, and  expanded gradually, to enter into the phase of hegemony over the  region. This was proclaimed by Ben-Gurion in the 1950s, to be a  regulation for all the Israeli leaders who came after him, doves  and hawks alike. Ben-Gurion said, "Peace is essential for Jewish  genius to gain control over Arab money and Arab labor, in order  for this genius to put both (money and labor) to the best use."  Israel began early to initiate studies, research, and projects  preparatory to the peace phase. Israeli espionage agencies and  research institutions specialized in studying and gathering  information about Arab capabilities in all areas. I may mention  one interesting incident that occurred at the book fair.  Specialized national councils exhibited volumes containing  Egyptian scientists' views on internal Egyptian affairs, on  housing, agriculture, Nile water, and livestock, in addition to  issues of extremism and deviance. The Embassy of Israel alone  bought more than one copy of each volume, to make use of them in  post-peace planning.    Israel keeps silent about "cooperation in the context of  peace," as well as about its maneuvers in international finance  organizations. Despite that, some studies on the Israeli concept  of peace have emerged from the realm of secrecy. There was--one  of countless examples--the outcome of an economic conference  held at the University of Tel Aviv entitled "Economic  Cooperation in the Middle East, From a Dream to Reality." Hayyim  Ben-Shahar urged this and included it in a book published in  London in 1989, called Economic Cooperation in the Middle  East. In the view of that conference:    Israel suffers from a water shortage, and the water  surpluses  of the Nile River, the Litani River in Lebanon, and al-Yarmuk  River [in Jordan] are being lost to evaporation. The conference  view was of Israel's "need" to benefit from these waters.    The conference proposed the extension of the Tapline to  Haifa; this junction would be 40 percent cheaper than traversing  the Suez Canal.    They speak of developing Arab-on-Arab wars, and linking them  to the Israeli arms trade.    Israel has submitted several Middle East development  projects  to the World Bank, on condition that they involve more than one  country in the region, with Jewish "genius" being the key point  of each. The projects included water transport, electricity  transport, the establishment of ports, the extension of  railroads, and a network of roads linking Israel and the Arab  states.    Israel's problem is that the pivotal Israel philosophy in  regional cooperation is hegemony.    The Oil Arabs: After Saddam's invasion of Kuwait  and the fact that some Arab countries supported the invasion,  and the PLO's support for that cruel attack, there was a radical  change, and a 180 degree turn in the minds of the "oil Arabs."  They renounced Arabism; they renounced the Palestinian cause;  they imagined that Israel was closer to them and easier to take  than their "treacherous Arab neighbor." Israel, they imagined,  was a powerful country, capable of offering them help and  protection against the perfidiousness of friends and brothers.  With the encouragement of the United States, they secretly  rushed to Israel to sign trade deals and get their sick treated  in Israeli hospitals. The Israeli press has even begun to call  Hadassah Hospital the Rich Arab Patients Hospital. Israel has  respected the Arabs' wish for secrey in their visits and  cooperation. Then there was the Gaza-Jericho agreement,  dispensing even with the fig leaf, with the beginning of a phase  of openness and pride in the agreement and visits to Israel. We  began to read, in Gulf newspapers, about the need to nullify the  Arab boycott of Israel at all its levels. Trade with Israel has  begun in many Gulf countries, and all this has begun even before  a comprehensive peace or the return of the occupied Arab land.  The thing that defies human understanding is that one  "revolutionary" Arab country, rejects the Gaza-Jericho agreement  and Camp David and all forms of negotiations with the Israeli  "enemy." This country got Israel to produce water pipes for one  of its huge water projects, and oil pipelines too; Israeli  factories are working night and day to meet that country's needs.    The Palestinians: I was utterly surprised at the  Palestinians' ebullient feelings about 'Arafat's outstretched  hand and Rabin's hesitant one at the White House festivities for  the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. Then the Palestinians  began a free-for-all to announce Palestinian-Israeli cooperation  to the Israeli media. "Combatant" Palestinian leaders thrust  themselves in front of Israeli television cameras to talk about  "the friendly Israeli people." I felt that the Palestinians and  the Israelis were speaking one language in which I was not  fluent--which I did not even understand; that they were on the  same side, against the Egyptian concept of peace. Our peace, in  the opinion of Prof. Ibrahim Sa'dah, is a cold peace, while the  Israelis and Palestinians have a torrid peace! As if what has  happened over the last half century was a mere tempest in a  teacup; as if we had just been meddling in someone else's  business all that time. I was even more surprised when I heard  one of the leaders of the Palestinian "struggle" use an  expression that nauseated me, saying that "Israel is an  honorable enemy; the Arabs are treacherous friends."    The Syrians: Some of them believe the Syrian  presence in Lebanon is far more important and beneficial than  the Syrian presence on the Golan, because the Golan--as one of  them put it--is a desolate area, whereas Lebanon is Syria's true  outlet to the Mediterranean Sea; thus any peace accord requiring  the Syrians to stay out of Lebanon would be unacceptable, even  if it liberated the Golan.    This is a brief look at Israel's dreams, and of the Arab  political circus, which gives special importance to writer  Ibrahim Sa'dah's big question: What will be Egypt's position if  Israel realizes its dreams of a new "warm" peace with all the  Arabs, as distinct from the "cold" peace with Egypt?  <H5>  Yes, Egypt. </H5>   Egypt today is demanding a correction in the Arabs' course,  their attention to detail, and some understanding on the part of  those who are rushing blindly toward Israel. Only Egypt will  stand by the Arabs; only Egypt will stand against Israeli  hegemony in the region; only Egypt will turn hegemony into  cooperation between partners. Hence my proposal at the beginning  of this article, about the need for the questioner to hold a  scientific conference in which we would call upon Egyptian  genius to set us an Egyptian strategy for managing the coming  peace struggle.    Yes, through that conference we would get a plan for  rebuilding this region on new bases, or, in other words, a  "strategy for thwarting Israel's plan for hegemony," especially  as Egypt has intellectual, human, geographical, and material  resources greater than Israel's, and these scattered resources  must be gathered into a single order so that we need not fear  cooperation with Israel. This proposal could be submitted to the  Arab nation at an Arab summit, as Prof. Ibrahim Sa'dah asked. We  would commit ourselves to it and then, subsequently, enter into  regional cooperation with Israel--after it has withdrawn from  the occupied territories.    I give warning that without a plan, and Arab solidarity with  it, and commitment to it, then Israeli dominance is on the  way--no doubt about it.</p>

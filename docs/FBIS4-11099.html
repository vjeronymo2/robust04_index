			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The former president of the lower chamber,  Deputy Antoine Joseph, called on the Army and the private sector  on 20 April to take a stand against the clean sweep policy and  the implementation of Article 149. Deputy Joseph deems the  demands of some political sectors that demand the return of  President Aristide 10 days after the appointment of a new prime  minister unrealistic.    [Begin Joseph recording, in Creole] Certain solutions that  have been proposed are supported by some sectors. I can put  myself in the shoes of the private sector. I very much doubt  that the private sector would have an interest in supporting the  implementation of Art. 149. This is also my private position.  Personally, I think the country is not ready to face the  political and financial consequences of the implementation of  Art. 149. [passage omitted] [end recording]    Furthermore, Deputy Joseph reaffirmed his support for the  initiative of the president of the Chamber of Deputies to begin  consultations with the various sectors involved in the crisis.

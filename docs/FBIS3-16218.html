The decree envisages, in particular, punishment for those  guilty of delays in the payment of wages and salaries.    "Failure to pay wages, like rust, erodes the entire economic  mechanism. It has ceased to be risky and has become an  economically lucrative thing not to foot bills".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI comments on a draft memorandum on civil  peace and accord. Preparation of such a memo was the subject of  the Russian president's meeting with representatives from  parties and public movements, the parliament and government in  the Kremlin recently.    "However, can a document, even such a substantial and  representative as this one, keep the country from slipping down  into chaos?" the newspaper asks and provides the answer: "It is  unlikely. All depends on whether the leading political and  public forces of the country that have influence among the  masses really intend to make every effort to maintain civil  peace or this is just a tactical manoeuvre for someone".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs a column of replies, under  the general headline "The State has a Future if the Rising  Generation Chooses Patriotism", by participants in a recent  roundtable meeting here about the education of young people in  the spirit of patriotism.    "Our country has got a kind of 'black hole' in this respect,  with cruelty, cynicism, all-crushing nihilism, and the lack of  spirituality drifting in from it".    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the problems of children's homes,  orphanages and special schools.    "Ninety per cent less attention is now given to children in  boarding schools than during the stagnation period".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with outstanding  chess player Anatoliy Karpov who said, in view of his triumph in  Linares: "To me, the triumph in the tournament is both an honour  and self- affirmation as world champion and an evidence of  unabated strength".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA maintains that the Russian Federation's  accession to NATO's Partnership-for-Peace programme "would  enhance russia's isolation and sharply limit its freedom for  foreign-policy manoeuvring".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, touching upon the forthcoming 8th  international aerospace show, the Fidae-94, to be held in the  capital of Chile on March 20-27, quotes Axel Cabrera, Chilean  consul in the Russian Federation, as saying that the success of  the Fidae-94 "is predetermined by Russia's participation".    TRUD analyses the causes of the failure of the  Georgian-Abkhazian talks on a political settlement of the  conflict. The newspaper sees a real way out of the crisis in  Abkhazia's signing a confederative treaty with Georgia, a treaty  under which each side would be declared sovereign and a subject  of international law.    PRAVDA runs an interview with Tajikistan Parliament Chief  Emomali Rakhmonov who believes that his country should have  armed forces of its own. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA carries an  interview with writer Yuriy Bondarev on the eve of his 70th  birthday. The newspaper singles out the writer's words "that  Russia has its own path in world history, a unique one achieved  through suffering".</p>

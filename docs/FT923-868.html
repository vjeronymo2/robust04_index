			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Venture Capital (13): An entrepreneurs' guide - Raising Capital MOST fund-raising proposals put to venture capitalists end up in the waste paper basket. If the venture firm is not too cramped for office space, they may survive, stacked up in the cellar. The problem investments (many made during the late 1980s) have made venture capitalists even more cautious about backing untried ventures. A management background is usually required - entrepreneurial enthusiasm is no longer enough - and most venture capitalists are happier providing established businesses with expansion finance than with backing entirely new ventures. Many venture capitalists claim that their best deals come through personal contacts and professional networks. If you have built up a reputation in your industry or cultivated members of the venture capital community, so much the better. Use these contacts to the full, if only to obtain an informal assessment of your business idea. If you have not established such contacts, your first approach to a venture capitalist may have to be by means of your business plan, sent through the post. Individual venture capitalists estimate that they only back between 1 and 2 per cent of the business plans they receive, so your plan needs a lot of thought. Firstly, make it easy for the venture capitalist to read. Preface your plan with a two-page summary which will allow him to get the feel for your proposal and tell him how much money you need. Do not burden your plan with excessive detail. Computers have made it only too easy to compute endless 'what if' scenarios, but as every venture capitalist knows, forecasts can be made to come up with any result the forecaster wants. The plan should tell the reader what you are going to do; who is going to do it; how you are going to do it; why you will be doing it that way; and when you will do it. To put it more technically, the plan should explain the product or service, the background and experience of the managers, the market, the operational structure and the financial history and projections. Where some entrepreneurs go wrong is to explain the product or service in great detail, but to ignore the people who will be carrying out the plan. Tell the venture capitalist about yourself and your team. Good managers can do a lot with an indifferent product or service: poor managers can fail with the most brilliant of innovations. By the same token, clever technical people can become absorbed by the features of the product they intend to launch and completely ignore the need for marketing expertise or financial management skills. The team and the plan must show a balance. WHO should write the plan? Some would-be entrepreneurs hand the whole thing over to their accountants. The result may be financial models of exquisite beauty but a lack of 'heart.' No entrepreneur can expect to defend a plan drawn up by someone else when the venture capitalist makes his inevitable criticisms. Use your accountant to help out with the financial projections but make sure the plan reflects your personality and ideas. Who should you send the plan to? The proliferation of venture capital companies (temporarily arrested by the recession) has made it difficult to identify the most suitable recipients. But it is important that you target only those venture firms most likely to respond positively. A bulk-mailing to every one on the British Venture Capital Association's membership list will not add to the credibility of your proposal. Venture capitalists are sometimes willing to express a preference for particular industry sectors (see table, page six), but few are willing to specialise in too narrow a field for fear of piling all their fledgling companies into one nest. The terms of the deal which the venture capitalist offers may well be an overriding consideration if you are lucky enough to receive competing offers. But other, less tangible factors should also carry considerable weight. Does the venture capitalist have experience of investing in your type of business? Does his firm have the skills to provide back-up if things go wrong? And does he have the resources to provide follow-up finance? Of crucial concern will be the value that the venture capitalist puts on your company. This will depend on the stage it is at - valuing start-up companies involves a large amount of guesswork - and the degree to which it already possesses tangible assets. In calculating a price/earnings ratio, the venture capitalist will make deductions because your business is unquoted (and hence not readily saleable); because your business will lack the product and geographical diversity which cushions more established companies; because the business has a shorter track record; and because the management is probably less experienced than that of a larger, quoted company. He will increase his estimate of its value if the product or service has bright prospects; is positioned in a fashionable sector; and he faces competition from other venture capitalists. By calculating the value of your company, the venture capitalist can then work out his projected return, usually referred to as his internal rate of return or IRR. His IRR calculation will depend on the risk associated with the business proposal; the length of time his money will be tied up; the ease with which he believes he will be able to realise his investment; and the existence of competing venture capitalists. Raising the funding, however time-consuming and exhausting, is only the start of the venture capital relationship. Once the contracts are signed, you must come to terms with the fact that you have committed yourself to following an agreed strategy and business plan; to reporting regularly to one or more outside shareholders; to providing your investor with an ambitious return; and to getting on with a new board member with a different set of expectations and responsibilities.

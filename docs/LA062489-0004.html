			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SEWAGE IS NOT FOR DUMPING  </P> <P> For years, regulatory agencies and the courts have prodded the city of Los  Angeles toward full secondary treatment of the sewage it dumps into Santa  Monica Bay. As a result, the city has a massive sewage disposal modernization  program under way and will achieve full secondary treatment of its effluent by  1998. Now, the County Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County are fighting  the same losing battle that the city waged for so long.  </P> <P> The districts have been seeking from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency a  waiver -- the sort the city has worked under -- to exempt about half its  effluent from the secondary treatment level required by the Clean Water Act.  </P> <P> The county districts have used a two-pronged argument in seeking partial  exemption from the federal law. They claim that it would be more effective to  work for source reduction -- to get industry and other sewage customers to keep  toxic metals and other harmful effluent material from getting into the sewage  system in the first place. But then, the districts claim it is important they  continue to expel large amounts of solid matter from their Palos Verdes  Peninsula outfall into the ocean because that continues to keep a blanket on  top of DDT deposits dumped there back in the 1950s and 1960s. If the districts  are required to provide a more refined level of treatment of the sewage, there  will not be so much solid matter to spew onto the DDT dumps.  </P> <P> The DDT claim might make some sense, says Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica),  except for the level of toxic metals, pesticides and other materials contained  in the stuff that is being poured on top of the DDT. The waiver also has been  opposed by state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), whose resolution  asking the EPA to reject it has been approved by both houses of the  Legislature.  </P> <P> Actually, the districts should be working toward both secondary treatment of  the sewage and reduction of chemicals and metals at the source. There is a  problem in disposing of the dry sludge that is left over from the secondary  treatment process. But the County Sanitation Districts are not the first to  have to cope with that matter. Better to deal with it on the level than just to  dump it into the ocean.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A Senate committee approved a bill Thursday to reimpose advertising limits on  children's television programs and require broadcasters to provide programs  specifically designed to educate youngsters. The bill is a compromise between  one the TV industry supported -- which passed Congress last year but was vetoed  by President Reagan -- and a tougher measure proposed this year by Sen. Tim  Wirth (D-Colo.). Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), who has bitterly attacked what  he calls "rubbish" on television, persuaded the committee not to send the  legislation to the Senate for 30 days. He wants to consult broadcasters and  consider further changes in the bill. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

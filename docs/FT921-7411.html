			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Oiling the skids for a bout of pessimism - London Markets IN REAL terms, the oil price peaked exactly ten years ago. Since then, it has halved. You might think, to judge from the movement of oil price shares over the past week, that this basic fact of life has only just sunk in: Shell ended the week at 448p, down 19p; BP at 258 1/2 p, down 9 1/2 p. Since January 1, the oil and gas sector of the FT-Actuaries All-Share index has underperformed the market by 13 per cent. The Opec meeting last weekend - which ended without a commitment to sustained production cuts - was the key factor in the sector's slide. As the chart shows, this is only the latest phase in a period of sustained underperformance: the Gulf War spike aside, oil prices in nominal terms have remained roughly constant for the past two years or so, but the oil sector has drifted steadily downwards against the market as a whole. As always happens when a clutch of stocks get a bad name, every piece of news seemed bearish: the after-effects of BP's dividend decision the previous week; some speculation about poor progress in the company's Colombian exploration; the departure of James Ross, BP's US boss, for Cable and Wireless; Shell's 4 per cent dividend rise when the market had been hoping for more. The sense that the worldwide economic slowdown might be longer and more pronounced than hitherto expected has also affected the shares. The week's international economic news has been predominantly gloomy: Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, told Congress that America's credit crunch had not yet eased, for example; and Hans Tietmayer, deputy president of the German Bundesbank, indicated no early easing in interest rates. Oil demand is extremely sensitive to economic activity, and the oil companies' huge fixed costs make their 'downstream' profits very vulnerable when business is weak. The other force at work has been the normal cycle of opinion among the analysts who cover the sector. 'In August 1990,' said one battle-hardened fund manager this week, 'almost all the analysts were very bullish on oil stocks just when the oil price peaked out a month after the invasion of Kuwait.' As the oil price has fallen, so the analysts have started to become more cautious. 'Now the balance is 75 per cent pessimistic and only 25 per cent bullish. I don't think there's much further to go.' The oil industry was not the only example of fashionable pessimism. The tone of much stock market comment is profoundly gloomy: no big downward move on European interest rates, very slow or negative UK growth this year, huge jobs cuts in the City inevitable, to choose just three examples from this week. The consensus expectation, however, is still for a healthy move upwards in share prices later in the year. The argument goes like this: in the short run, the results due from big companies in the next couple of weeks will contain enough unpleasant surprises, especially on dividends, to unsettle the market. Ahead of an election, no sustained buying will emerge. The economy will not show clear signs of renewed growth till the second half of the year, if then. Yet once economic recovery is confirmed, and political uncertainty is removed (if only by the discovery, which the City makes with astonishment a year into every Labour term of office, that things are not so bad after all) there is the prospect of a further move upwards in share prices. Contributory factors would be a consolidation of low inflation and the inevitable downwards move in German interest rates. Of course, there is nothing remarkable in such a prediction: the conventional wisdom, on which Old Moore's Almanac has based a healthy business for centuries, is usually that things will continue very much as they are for the time being, and then get quite a lot better (or quite a lot worse, according to taste) at some indeterminate point in the future. Pessimism about the economy, about profits, and about dividends is now so marked that it is worth considering the possibility of a sudden reversal of sentiment. County NatWest's prediction that of the 33 companies reporting in the next fortnight, 20 can be expected to hold or cut dividends, catches the general air of pessimism perfectly. Against such a background, unexpected benevolence in dividends or hopeful reports on trading might transform the market's mood. This week's indications of a giveaway, pre-election Budget offer a sober long-term perspective, however. The UK's public finances are in the early stages of a structural shift towards deficit, away from the rough balance achieved in the 1980s. Such shifts are hard to arrest while in progress: the odds are that government borrowing will be high for the next few years, keeping long-term interest rates high in real terms, depressing share price valuations in consequence and casting a lingering air of uncertainty over whether the UK will qualify for membership of EC monetary union. In the meantime, there is one practical short-term result of the market's certainty that the election will come on April 9. There will be no bids or rights issues before then, says one equity strategist, since the risks of disruption by some campaign surprise are simply too great. If this view is correct, it rules out the market's lingering thoughts that the banking sector's results season might be accompanied by the announcement of some large-scale merger or restructuring. The Midland Bank, usually mentioned as a central participant in these elaborate hypotheses, is due to announce its results on February 27. The results - and the accompanying management comments - will give some indication of whether a banking realignment is likely in the medium term.</p>

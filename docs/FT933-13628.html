			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Arts: Bream at 60 THURSDAY was Julian Bream's 60th birthday. The celebrated guitarist chose to spend the evening at the Wigmore Hall, in company with members of the Nash Ensemble - and, it hardly needs saying, a packed house of enthusiasts - displaying a few of the modes and styles of guitar-playing that have caused him to remain so much and so long admired. Birthday concerts, anniversary concerts and other forms of event-devising by means of calendar-marking can sometimes seem a rather artificial, stultified method of drawing attention to the art or artist in question. In the case of someone like Bream, however, the stratagem can be useful as a stock-taking opportunity; certainly, this birthday concert served the purpose well. The reason is that it showed Bream to be still a peerless guitar technician, unrivalled in his ability to make the instrument speak in tones of the most 'personal', most finely shaded and varied eloquence. (Since on Thursday it was unpleasantly hot and humid in the hall, fingerings seemed prey to moments of slip and slide - but never so seriously as to compromise virtuosity.) It also showed him to be a player still wonderfully responsive to the personalities and characteristics of others, capable of entering into chamber music with sympathy and ready spontaneity. The opening Haydn work - an adaptation for guitar and string trio of the E major String Quartet, Op. 2 no. 2 - afforded choice examples of those ensemble-partaking gifts and qualities. The slow movement, a kind of aria sung over delicately patterned accompaniment, was particularly full of free, fresh, delight-arousing lyrical nuances. In Toward the Sea (1981), Toru Takemitsu's three-movement duet for guitar and alto flute (Philippa Davies), the raptly intimate character of the duetting made fair amends for the work's wispy, repetitious substance and limited atmospheric range. A solo sonata for guitar (1933) by the little-known Spaniard Antonio Jose, unremarkable in invention, gave Bream's sophisticated rhythmic sense its head. The concert did not attempt to represent every facet of so multifarious a musician: Bream the lutenist, Bream the inspirer of important contemporary composition, Bream the sensitive partner of the singing voice were on this occasion missing. On their own the Nash played Roussel's harp, flute and string-trio Serenade (a beautifully taut account) and the Ravel Introduction and Allegro. It was altogether a civilised, well-varied programme; but it left me ungratefully wanting even more of the birthday celebrant.</p>

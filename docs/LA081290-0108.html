			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLASH FROM THE PAST  </P> <P> In July, 1886, a spark from a passing train set off a wildfire that burned  10,000 acres of farmland stretching from La Puente to Covina. The fire helped  put an end to a boom town in the area called Vineland, but in the same location  eight years later the community of Baldwin Park was established.  </P></p>

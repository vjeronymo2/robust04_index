			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Maxwell crash sparks fees bonanza PROFESSIONAL FEES related to the collapse of the Maxwell business empire may have topped Pounds 11m since last November and could currently total more than Pounds 325,000 a day, according to estimates by the Financial Times. News of the amounts charged comes at a time when the insolvency profession is undergoing severe criticism, including questions about the Pounds 75m bill in fees and costs charged by Touche Ross for winding up BCCI. However, estimates suggest that the Maxwell collapse has already clocked up accountancy bills of more than Pounds 5.3m, and legal bills of more than Pounds 6m. A conservative estimate of accountants' bills assumes that they have worked only eight hours a day, five days a week, with hourly charge-out rates of Pounds 200 per hour for partners and Pounds 80 per hour for other staff. Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, has had about 100 staff and 10 partners involved in the administration of the private Maxwell companies since December 5. This suggests a total bill so far of Pounds 2.8m or nearly Pounds 80,000 a day. Price Waterhouse, the administrator of Maxwell Communication Corporation, has had an average of about six partners and about 90 staff working since late December - a total of about Pounds 1.5m. Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm acting as provisional liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the pension fund manager, have had two partners and the equivalent of 15 other staff full-time investigating pensions since early December, suggesting a bill of Pounds 448,000 to date. Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte appointed two partners and about a dozen staff as investigators to the private Maxwell companies after Mr Maxwell's death: about Pounds 218,000. Touche Ross, the liquidator to First Tokyo Index Trust, a fund controlled by Mr Maxwell, has employed a partner and about seven staff since early December: about Pounds 213,000. Other work from Grant Thornton, administrator to Robert Maxwell Estates and administrator or receiver to several other related subsidiaries, has used about five staff and one partner since early December: about Pounds 168,000 The firms involved declined to comment on their charges, although several have pointed out that the assumptions behind the hours put in were conservative - they have been sacrificing their evenings and weekends for months. However, insolvency practitioners respond to general complaints of overcharging by saying that reports of their fees have been exaggerated, that their costs are scrutinised by the courts and creditors, such as banks, which appoint them, and that the fees they receive represent a small proportion of the assets recovered. The legal bills in the Maxwell case are no less significant. At least 16 leading City law firms and 32 barristers have been involved in the legal quagmire resulting from the collapse of the Maxwell empire, employing an estimated 42 partners and 47 assistant solicitors. Taking solicitors' charges at an average of Pounds 250 an hour for partners and Pounds 170 for assistants, that suggests a daily bill of about Pounds 148,000. In addition, senior QCs will probably be charging between Pounds 400 and Pounds 600 an hour. Since early December most of the solicitors and a third of the barristers will have been working full time on the Maxwell cases, giving total legal costs of the Maxwell collapse of approximately Pounds 6m.</p>

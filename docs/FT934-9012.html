			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Personal View: Pensions could unlock Pounds 7bn tax boon An additional Pounds 7bn tax a year could be raised by the UK government from a simple change to pensions taxation. Only pension fund managers would notice the difference and the change would not reduce consumer demand or investment. Tax incentives for savings take two forms. In the first instance, after tax income is invested, no tax is payable on income or gains and withdrawals are tax free. Such is the case with Peps and Tessas. The second form is where money is invested pre-tax, the roll-up is again tax free and withdrawals are taxed; pensions fall within this category, the withdrawal being the pension. In the vast majority of cases these two methods yield the same result, as the table illustrates. My proposal is that pensions should be taxed on the Peps/Tessa basis. All pension contributions from Budget day by employers and employees should be considered taxable income in the employee's hands. The amount invested after tax will yield the same after-tax pension as before. Total private pension contributions by employers and employees in the UK amount to Pounds 28bn a year. Taxing all future contributions at 25 per cent would yield Pounds 7bn a year. The incomes of both employers and employees after tax would be unaffected. The only losers would be pension fund managers with Pounds 7bn a year less to manage. The new system would be easier for the Inland Revenue to administer, but the transition is complex. The tax yield will gradually decline to zero as revenue from taxing pensions is lost. This will take a generation. For the immediate future the yield will be Pounds 7bn a year. The Revenue and pension fund managers will not like running two parallel schemes, one for contributions made before the change and yielding a taxable pension, and another for contributions made after the change and yielding a tax-free pension. Funds could therefore be offered an option: pay (in instalments), say, 25 per cent of the capital value of the fund in tax now and immediately go on to a tax free basis. If all funds did this the government would receive about Pounds 100bn (total pension fund assets are some Pounds 400bn). The government would immediately lose tax yield on current pensions - about Pounds 3.5bn, but it would still be a net Pounds 3.5bn a year ahead, plus the interest saved on Pounds 100bn of government debt, say, a further Pounds 8bn a year. Individuals may be obtaining tax relief on contributions at a higher rate than they would eventually pay on their pension. This would only be true for a few people and then only for part of their working lives. It could be compensated for, but this may not be felt necessary. Some people's private pensions will fall to be taxed in part or whole at the 20 per cent rate (though tax rates can and probably will change). Similarly, there will be some pensioners who will not fully use their personal allowances. In either case an annual tax credit could be paid in retirement. Unfunded schemes. There is no reason to treat these differently. But such schemes could not go fully onto the new basis as they have no assets with which to buy the transition. Tax would be charged currently on the notional cost of contributions but pensions would be tax free. The tax-free advantage for lump sums is lost. This is an illogical privilege which would be a minor sacrifice for a significant reform. Pension funds investment will be reduced by Pounds 7bn a year, but so too will be the public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 50bn, and the government's need to sell gilts. There will be other technical objections but they could all be overcome. The facts are that the change would have no after-tax effect on employers or employees contributing to pension schemes and need have no effect on after-tax pensions in retirement. The problem is political. Will people believe their pensions will be tax free in 30 years and that the outcome is exactly the same? Will the media welcome the change as sensible or mislead the public about its effect? Such a change needs a first-class salesman: we have one in the chancellor. The risks and difficulties must be set against raising an additional Pounds 7bn a year of revenue with no macroeconomic effects and no effect on people's disposable incomes in work or retirement - surely a prize worth grasping by a bold and imaginative chancellor with a fiscal headache.

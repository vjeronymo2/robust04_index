			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Politicians arrested over Italian murder FOUR PROMINENT politicians in Reggio Calabria were arrested early yesterday, together with seven members of the Mafia, on charges of involvement in the murder three years ago of Mr Lodovico Ligato, former head of Italy's state railways. Magistrates alleged they had all conspired to murder Mr Ligato because they feared he might compete for public works contracts in southern Italy along with rival clans of the local Mafia, the 'nandrangheta. Mr Ligato, an ambitious local Christian Democrat, had been forced to resign from heading the railways after a contract scandal in 1988. Yesterday's arrests raised the possibility of further evidence of the links between politicians and organised crime in southern Italy. These have been long suspected but only in the past two months has concrete evidence begun to emerge. Three of those arrested yesterday are Christian Democrats and one is a Socialist. All four politicians are already under investigation for alleged corruption involving public works contracts in the city, as are eight other leading members of the council. The city of Reggio Calabria is due to hold municipal elections on December 13, following the arrest of the entire 23-strong council on corruption charges in September. Magistrates have also intimated that some members of the former council were linked to the Mafia. The Christian Democrats arrested were Mr Pietro Battaglia, a former deputy and twice mayor of the city, Mr Franco Quattrone, a former deputy and junior minister, and Mr Giuseppe Nicolo, the party's regional secretary. Mr Giovanni Palomara, the Socialist, was also a former mayor of Reggio. Yesterday, there were calls in Reggio for the postponement of the municipal elections. Mr Ligato is alleged to have made an alliance with a rival Mafia group which had hoped to remove a sizeable share of the region's public works contracts, threatening to upset the current structure of contacts between the 'nandrangheta and local politicians. He was killed outside his house after he had been entertaining some guests. He was gunned down by two people on a motorcycle.</p>

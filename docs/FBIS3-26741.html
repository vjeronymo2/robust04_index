			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Pang Jianjing (1690 1696 0079): "China's Civil Aviation </F> Transport Network Takes Shape"]    [Text] Three major civil aviation groups in China -- the  Eastern, Southern, and International Airline Groups -- were  successively founded by the end of last year, thus marking the  formation of our country's civil aviation transport network,  which was started with the founding of the China Southwest  Airline on 15 December 1987. Up to the end of 1993, there were  more than 340 registered large and medium aircraft (each with  over 100 seats).    The greatest changes brought by the initial formation of our  country's civil aviation transport network are the transition  from a sellers' market to a buyers' market in passenger air  transportation. By the end of 1986, the number of passenger  seats provided by the mainland civil aviation industry exceeded  15,400; there were 288 domestic and international air lines; and  the total mileage served reached 1.548 billion metric ton km.  At that time, passengers found it very difficult to buy air  tickets, and some did not hesitate to buy second-hand tickets  from ticket scalpers at high prices. By 1993, the number of  passenger seats provided by the mainland civil aviation industry  exceeded 50,000, an increase of 230 percent over that of 1986.  There were over 610 domestic and international airlines, and  the total mileage served reached 5.2 billion metric ton km.  Today, passengers can easily buy air tickets, and sometimes  they can choose from a number of flights. According to  statistics, the average passenger seat utilization rate in 1986  was 89.7 percent, whereas the average passenger seat utilization  rate in 1993 was 72.4 percent. The formation of a buyers'  market led to the real beginning of competition among various  airlines. The prime concern of safety, high-quality services,  flights that depart and arrive on schedule, and replacing the  fleet with new models of aircraft are important chips which  airlines can use to solicit passengers.    The rapid development of airlines also caused some  difficulties and problems: The quantity of large aircraft is  increasing too quickly and there is a lack of pilots,  particularly high-quality pilot trainers; there is not enough  time for technological development due to frequent refits; and  the standard of service provided by the ground crew and aviation  control personnel demands prompt improvement -- the whole  contingent must be strengthened. The departments and leaders  concerned have attached great importance to these problems.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Plysu suffers sharp decrease to Pounds 3.41m Plysu, the plastic milk and juice bottle manufacturer, yesterday announced a sharp drop in interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 5.81m to Pounds 3.41m, on sales 4 per cent higher at Pounds 44m against Pounds 42.5m. The results had been widely expected following the group's profits warning in October and the shares closed 2p higher at 197p. The interim dividend is maintained at 2p, while earnings fell from 8.4p to 4.8p. Mr Stephen Nobbs, finance director, said the decline in profits had been due to three main factors: firstly, a significant reduction in milk carton prices as a result of the renegotiation of contracts with customers; secondly, exceptional costs of Pounds 1m to increase capacity in the dairy business to secure the contracts; and finally, deepening recession in continental Europe. The profits picture was also slightly distorted by the comparison of 26 weeks in 1993, against 28 weeks last time. However, it was estimated that the pre-tax figure was still 32 per cent down on a comparable basis. Mr Nobbs said that trading in continental Europe had proved to be particularly difficult. Sales had been boosted by the inclusion for the full six months of SEP, the Belgian and Dutch business acquired last year, which contributed Pounds 15.9m. Turnover, however, was down by 9 per cent when currency and acquisitions gains were excluded. Mr Nobbs said Plysu was committed to expanding in Europe, and had some acquisitions in sight.</p>

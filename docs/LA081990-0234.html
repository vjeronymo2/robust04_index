			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BATTLE ON TO SALVAGE FARWEST;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: A LARGE JUNK BOND PORTFOLIO HAS HOBBLED THE HIGH-FLYING BELZBERG  BROTHERS, AND MOST AGREE THAT ONLY A CASH INFUSION CAN SAVE THEIR S&amp;L.  </P> <P> FarWest Savings had long been a good investment for the Belzberg brothers of  Canada -- Samuel, Hyman and William.  </P> <P> Acquiring FarWest in 1974 gave the Belzbergs a foothold in the United States.  Then, using the thrift and and First City Financial Corp. Ltd. in Vancouver,  Canada, they became among the most feared corporate raiders and takeover  strategists on the U.S. scene during the 1980s. Often acting as so-called  greenmailers, their hostile bids made them millions of dollars.  </P> <P> But today, their U.S. flagship is in danger of sinking. On Thursday, federal  regulators imposed operating restrictions on FarWest, prohibiting the purchase  and sale of assets and the making of any loans without regulatory approval.  </P> <P> The action is a blow to the Belzbergs -- and puts greater pressure on them to  bail out the faltering institution. Without a fresh infusion of capital,  FarWest is likely to join the government's portfolio of failed thrifts.  </P> <P> "The thrift's survival is largely predicated on what their principal owners  want to do," said Gerry Findley, a Brea banking and thrift consultant.  </P> <P> Like some other high-flying S&amp;Ls, Newport Beach-based FarWest's problem  stems not so much from bad loans -- the savings and loan has been profitable on  an operating basis -- but from huge investments in junk bonds.  </P> <P> FarWest officials say it is being brought down by the federal law designed to  save the S&amp;L industry -- the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and  Enforcement Act of 1989. The new law banned junk bonds -- high-yield, high-risk  debt securities -- from thrift portfolios by July, 1994.  </P> <P> The thrift has been staking its revival on a plan that called for trimming  assets, selling junk bonds and bolstering capital with a new stock offering to  shareholders of its parent firm, FarWest Financial Corp. in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> FarWest officials have admitted that a failure to get the plan approved could  be fatal. "The company's ability to continue as a going concern depends upon  receiving approval of a plan," the company said in a recent filing with the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> But regulators in San Francisco at the Office of Thrift Supervision, which  oversees thrifts, last week rejected the plan. FarWest has appealed to thrift  regulators in Washington.  </P> <P> Charles Green, chief executive of FarWest, said the regulators, in part,  objected to how the thrift wants to treat a subsidiary holding junk bonds and  equity real estate investments. The S&amp;L wants to liquidate the unit and  fold it into the thrift as a direct holding.  </P> <P> If the plan's rejection is upheld, FarWest would have to write off about $60  million in capital, rendering it insolvent with a negative net worth of $23.6  million to $75 million, depending on accounting and tax considerations, the  thrift says.  </P> <P> Analysts speculate that another major problem may be an unwillingness by the  Belzbergs, who control 57% of FarWest Financial, to commit themselves to  putting more of their own money into the thrift.  </P> <P> "Other investors would want the assurance that the Belzbergs are coming in,"  said Kenneth H. Thomas of Miami, an industry consultant. "If the Belzbergs  don't come in, investors would wonder why they should step forward."  </P> <P> Neither William Belzberg, chairman of FarWest Financial and FarWest Savings,  nor Samuel Belzberg, chairman of First City, responded to several requests for  interviews.  </P> <P> FarWest is among a handful of large thrifts that together acquired billions of  dollars of junk bonds through Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  Earlier this year, Drexel filed for bankruptcy and Milken pleaded guilty to  criminal charges stemming from his junk bond activities.  </P> <P> Most of those who loaded up on junk bonds make up a rogues gallery of troubled  thrifts now under regulatory control: Lincoln Savings in Irvine, Imperial  Savings in San Diego, Gibraltar Savings in Simi Valley, CenTrust Bank in Miami  and Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan in Denver. Columbia Savings of  Beverly Hills was the biggest junk bond buyer among thrifts but has not been  seized.  </P> <P> While some industry analysts and consultants feel that FarWest once stood a  better chance than its beleaguered brethren of surviving, they now say that  regulatory restrictions could be a prelude to a federal takeover.  </P> <P> In August, 1989, FarWest Savings had $667 million in junk bonds, about 14% of  its $4.8 billion in assets. The company has written down its junk bond holdings  since. Its portfolio was valued at $395 million as of June 30.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L lost $46.1 million last year, $25.8 million in the first quarter of  1990 and $3.7 million more in the second quarter. Most of the red ink is  attributed to the writedown of its junk bonds.  </P> <P> While solvent, FarWest does not meet the tougher capital standards imposed by  the new federal thrift law. As of June 30, its $37.7 million in tangible  capital, one measure of stability under federal law, was $23.6 million short of  requirements.  </P> <P> It also faces several troubling lawsuits. Farwest was hit earlier this year  with a $24-million judgment by a Denver jury. The civil case, which Farwest has  appealed, alleges that the thrift reneged on a $5-million loan and ruined the  plaintiff's business. In another case, four shareholders allege that FarWest  wasted assets through its junk bond activities.  </P> <P> While it continues to make a profit on operations, the thrift has been hurt by  loans it made in Colorado, Utah and Texas in the mid-1980s. FarWest stopped  lending in those states three years ago when the loans soured with the energy  bust.  </P> <P> Despite the problems, FarWest executives say they are confident about the  thrift's future if they can overcome regulatory hurdles. They say they have  already taken several steps to turn FarWest around.  </P> <P> * Last year, the holding company contributed $12.5 million of its cash in hand  to the S&amp;L's capital base.  </P> <P> * To help meet capital standards, FarWest is reducing its assets. Thrift  officials said that in the second quarter, assets were cut to $3.7 billion,  partly by selling a mortgage-banking unit to managers who started it six years  ago. The S&amp;L plans to shrink to as low as $2.7 billion.  </P> <P> * FarWest has cut staff and overhead expenses.  </P> <P> * Under a regulatory mandate, the thrift is reducing costs by eliminating  brokered deposits, the large-denomination funds that seek the highest interest  rates.  </P> <P> * Lending has been nearly halted.  </P> <P> Clearly the key to FarWest's survival is more capital, the thrift's final  cushion against losses. But it is unclear whether the Belzbergs are willing to  risk any more of their own cash.  </P> <P> "It comes down to whether it is in their interest to preserve this and salvage  their investment," Findley, the Brea consultant, said. "Or they may be at the  point of saying, 'Oh well, let that thing go. We've got better things to put  our money in.' "  </P> <P> The Belzbergs would not be the first to walk away from a thrift investment.  </P> <P> In June, Huntington Beach developer Frank Mola decided that he wasn't going to  add to the $12 million he already had put into Charter Savings Bank in Newport  Beach and allowed regulators to seize it. The law's new standards for  determining capital had wiped out the solid base that Charter thought it had.  </P> <P> On Aug. 3, M. Lee Pearce quit as chairman of AmeriFirst Bank in Miami, saying  that he would not risk any more funds without more cooperation from regulators.  Pearce, who picked up $65 million in his failed takeover bid of American  Medical International Inc. in Beverly Hills last fall, had invested $8.5  million in ailing AmeriFirst 14 months ago.  </P> <P> "I'm sure the Belzbergs read about people like Pearce, and they may say,  'Sometimes, you run up against a team you just can't beat,' and they may leave  the industry," Thomas suggested.  </P> <P> The Belzbergs, most observers agree, have a keen eye for what makes economic  sense.  </P> <P> Sons of a Polish immigrant, the characteristically close-mouthed brothers built  an empire from their base in Calgary, where their father, Abraham, operated a  furniture store. Hyman, 63, runs that store, Cristy's Arcade, today.  </P> <P> Sam, now 62 and the only brother with a college degree, led his brothers first  into real estate and oil and gas leases in Alberta. In 1962, needing financing,  he started City Savings &amp; Trust Co. in Calgary, the predecessor to First  City Financial's banking unit, First City Trust Co. It grew to become one of  the largest financial institutions in Canada.  </P> <P> The Belzbergs gained widespread attention in their native land in 1973 when  they sold their majority interest -- 62% -- in a real estate firm for $48  million, without requiring the buyers to offer the same terms to minority  shareholders. The following year, in a friendly transaction, they won  controlling interest in FarWest Financial.  </P> <P> FarWest Financial owned State Mutual Savings &amp; Loan, a thrift that opened  in Los Angeles in 1889 and held $450 million in assets in 1974. The Belzbergs  moved the S&amp;L to Newport Beach and later changed its name to FarWest  Savings.  </P> <P> William Belzberg, 57, moved to Los Angeles in 1976 to oversee the family's  first major investment in the United States. He also oversees First City  Properties Inc., a real estate development firm in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The combined assets of FarWest, First City Financial and First City Properties  -- estimated at about $7 billion in 1980 -- allowed the Belzbergs to raise  capital for more serious empire building. Their corporate entities often  provided financing for corporate takeovers or joined in as investor partners.  </P> <P> Over two years, for instance, the Belzbergs used First City to buy 22.6% of  Bache &amp; Co., a major New York brokerage. But Bache found a white knight in  1981 and sold out to Prudential Insurance Co. of America. First City booked a  $48.7-million gain on the sale of its shares.  </P> <P> In 1983, FarWest backed a Belzberg-led effort to acquire Bekins Co. in  Glendale. The company, however, abandoned this effort to join Texas oilman T.  Boone Pickens' investment group in a raid on Gulf Oil Corp. The hostile bid for  Gulf put the giant oil firm in play and sent its stock soaring. Chevron  eventually bought Gulf, and FarWest walked away with a profit of $8.4 million.  </P> <P> The Belzbergs did not stop with Gulf. They took runs at many companies,  including Blue Bell, H. H. Robertson, U.S. Industries, Masonite and Ashland  Oil. But they gained a reputation as raiders and greenmailers, mostly looking  to be paid to go away.  </P> <P> They picked up $14 million from Ashland in 1986 when the Kentucky refiner and  marketer paid the Belzbergs nearly $6 a share more than it cost them to acquire  about 9% of the company. Ashland also extracted a promise from the Belzbergs to  leave it alone for 10 years.  </P> <P> So feared were the Belzbergs that in 1986, when they took a small position in  Southland Corp., the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, the  controlling Thompson family scrambled to keep the company. The Thompsons took  Southland private in a $5.3-billion, leveraged buyout. But the huge debt load  forced Southland into bankruptcy this year.  </P> <P> The Belzbergs have taken control of some companies. Analysts thought the  brothers had overpaid for Scovill Inc., a Connecticut company that made Yale  locks and Hamilton Beach household appliances. They soon sold off all but one  division for $176 million, more than they paid for the entire company in 1985.  </P> <P> All the while, FarWest grew steadily, fueled by the profits of attempted  takeovers, and from traditional thrift operations and junk bond investments.  </P> <P> It built a mortgage banking operation in six years to a $1.5-billion portfolio  at the end of last year. The S&amp;L moved more aggressively into construction  lending for single-family homes and apartment buildings.  </P> <P> But it was junk bonds and brokered deposits that gave the S&amp;L its biggest  boost, helping it grow from $1.1 billion in assets at the end of 1982, when  deregulation opened the doors to a wide array of new investments, to nearly $5  billion last summer.  </P> <P> Despite regulators' concerns about junk bonds, the S&amp;L continues to  emphasize that it is making money on an operating basis. However, it increased  reserves for loan and investment losses by $16.9 million in the second quarter.  And the company noted that its regular annual examination now under way could  result in additional reserves being set aside.  </P> <P> "They're profitable on a core basis, but it's hard to divorce the effects of  the junk bonds," said James M. Marks, an analyst at SNL Securities.  </P> <P> Other than the junk bond problem, FarWest is "doing quite well and, given time,  will sort itself out," said industry consultant David L. Smith, managing  associate of Kaplan, Smith &amp; Associates in Glendale.  </P> <P> As far as Smith is concerned, FarWest's losses from junk bond holdings are  "absolutely a case where Congress is killing an institution" by the passage of  the industry-restructuring law. The ban on junk bonds, he said, was aimed at  specific thrift executives disliked by regulators.  </P> <P> FarWest's junk bond portfolio has several securities that were in default this  year, including those of Braniff, Eastern Airlines and Southmark Corp., all of  which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But the thrift maintains that its junk  bond portfolio overall, including investments in McCaw Cellular, National  Intergroup, RJR Nabisco and Pacific Lumber, is performing well and providing  needed income.  </P> <P> Other analysts, however, don't buy the virtues of junk bonds, at least for  thrifts.  </P> <P> Thomas, an expert on junk holdings by thrifts, charges that thrifts simply  never had any business putting federally insured deposits at such a high risk  by investing them in junk bonds. From the start, he said, the bonds were  grossly overpriced by Milken and Drexel.  </P> <P> "With or without (the new federal law), major junk bond defaults were bound to  occur," he said.  </P> <P> And Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., consultant, believes that five years is long  enough to get rid of portfolios in an orderly fashion.  </P> <P> "It's important not to shed too many tears for the FarWests of the world," Ely  said. "They were enticed by the high yields and really thought that those  issuing junk bonds were giving away a lot of money. I suspect that over time,  junk bonds won't outperform Treasury bonds."  </P></p>

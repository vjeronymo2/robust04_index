			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Maloveryan] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A regular round of  Russian-Estonian talks started here today. It is devoted to  work on a treaty on the withdrawal of Russian troops from  Estonia.    According to Vaino Reinart, head of the Estonian delegation,  Estonia is ready to sign this act and Russia's desire to link  this problem with the provision of social guarantees to the  Russian military pensioners residing in the republic is the only  stumbling block.    On the eve of the round Vasiliy Svirin, head of the Russian  delegation, met with Estonian President Lennart Meri. The  results of the conversation, he believes, give cause for hope  that in a prolonged Russian-Estonian "divorce suit dialogue" the  parties can find strength and willingness to engage in a search  for a compromise to settle the problem.    The talks are being held behind closed doors and will last  for two days. It is planned that a news conference will be  given by the heads of delegations on the results of the talks.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: Finnish elevator group falls 16% at eight months KONE, the Finnish lifts and cranes group, yesterday blamed falling European demand for its elevators as well as currency factors for a 16.6 per cent drop in profits after financial items to FM201m (Dollars 35m) for the first eight months. Overall, sales were up 20 per cent at FM7.4bn, due to the weaker markka. The rate of growth was slightly lower at Kone Elevators, which accounts for 71 per cent of sales, where turnover grew from FM4.5bn to FM5.3bn. Lower European demand for new lifts and modernisation, particularly in Finland, France and Italy, has pushed down the real value of the elevator unit's orders by 5 per cent, in spite of growth in eastern Asia.</p>

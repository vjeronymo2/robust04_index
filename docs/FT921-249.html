			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Fall in real income of poor found THE REAL income of the UK's poorest households fell during the 1980s, the Low Pay Unit campaign group says today, John Willman writes. It calculates that the average income of the bottom fifth of households fell from Pounds 3,442 in 1979 to Pounds 3,282 in 1989 at that year's prices. The average income of the top fifth rose over the same period from Pounds 20,138 to Pounds 28,124. One reason for the increased gap is changes to the tax and social security systems, a report from the unit says. Most of the benefit of income-tax cuts went to taxpayers at the top of the scale, while increases in indirect taxes such as value added tax and National Insurance have been borne by low-income families. The report says the number of adults earning less than the Council of Europe's 'decency threshold' increased during the 1980s from 7.8m, or 38 per cent of the workforce, to 10m, or 47 per cent. The 'decency threshold' defines low pay as 68 per cent of the mean earnings of full-time workers. The unit argues for a national minimum wage. Poor Britain.

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eastern Electricity falls slightly to Pounds 177m Eastern Electricity said yesterday it was seeking permission from shareholders to buy back up to 14.9 per cent of its shares as it announced a 3.6 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said this would give the company greater flexibility but it had not yet decided whether to buy back more shares on top of the 5 per cent already bought. In the year to March 31 profits were Pounds 177m (Pounds 186m) after exceptional costs of Pounds 48.3m (Pounds 1.5m credit), of which Pounds 38.3m (Pounds 13.7m) related to restructuring costs and Pounds 26.8m to a premium on repurchasing government debt offset by regulatory income from previous years of Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 15.2m). Mr Eric Anstee, finance director, said the restruc-turing and bond exceptionals would both enhance future earnings. The underlying profit was Pounds 225m (Pounds 182m), he said. This had been achieved through rigorous cutting of costs, which were down by 11 per cent. Some 640 staff left the electricity business during the year, leaving the total at 5,539. The company expects several hundred more to go this year. Group turnover fell from Pounds 1.92bn to Pounds 1.85bn. The board is recommending a final dividend of 16.4p, bringing the total to 23p (19.2p), up 20 per cent. There was net cash at the year end of Pounds 55.5m, compared with borrowings of Pounds 143.2m, which gave gearing of 17 per cent. The company is also considering changing its name to Eastern Group to reflect better the widening range of activities. COMMENT Once considered the sector dullard, Eastern's star has risen rapidly in the past 18 months as the management belatedly followed others in cutting costs. Taking the most obvious available measure, the company has cut 30 per cent of core jobs since privatisation, probably slightly more than the average rec in spite of the late start. The market also appears to approve the fancy footwork shown by Mr Anstee, finance director since the end of last year, in redeeming government debt, arranging bond issues and implementing share buy-backs. Assuming a 13 per cent dividend rise this year, yesterday's 27p price rise to 614p puts the shares on a prospective yield of 5.3 per cent, near the top of the recs' rating table. Nonetheless, some investment houses feel that in implementing so much change ahead of the regulatory review the company may struggle to impress after it is concluded. Others may be playing a cannier game by holding back the best.</p>

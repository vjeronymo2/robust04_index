			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Worry over Asian securities markets The World Bank has warned of the risk of financial accidents in Asian securities markets because the pace of investment and innovation in them may be too fast for their stage of development. Mr Gautam S. Kaji, vice president for East Asia and the Pacific, said the region's economic growth was taking place from a low income level and that financial markets lacked basic infrastructure and regulatory structures. They could only absorb limited amounts of money for the time being. 'Private markets in developing countries are by no means perfect,' he told a Financial Times conference in London on Asian capital markets. 'Information is imperfectly and unevenly available, and a market failure in this regard can have the most serious consequences, as the debt crisis taught us all.' He expressed particular concern about the use of structured financing and derivatives in Asia's volatile financial markets, in advance of development of national prudential and legal frameworks. 'It frankly worries me to see people pushing high-tech derivatives in markets that lack even well-developed Treasury bill trading.' The World Bank supported the privatisation programmes of Asian countries, including stock market placements. But Mr Kaji noted that 'in a number of these countries, the capital markets are not deep enough to absorb many new placements.' 'These markets still lack instruments and experience, not to mention basic accounting conventions and disclosure rules'. Mr Kaji acknowledged however that privatisation issues also helped to deepen and develop stock markets. He urged governments to hasten the development of capital markets especially because they will be needed to help fund massive investment in physical infrastructure to keep pace with rapid economic growth.

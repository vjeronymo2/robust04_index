			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: A global game for a global market - The sponsors spreading the soccer gospel Corporate America has a long history of pouring millions of dollars into professional sports, either through direct sponsorship, television advertising or marketing tie-ins. As a result, when the US won the right to stage soccer's 1994 World Cup, there were plenty of big companies eager to sign up as sponsors of the event. The fact that the World Cup is a tournament of soccer, a game with an extremely low profile in the US and largely absent from its TV sets, mattered little to American companies, because the event was never expected to draw a particularly large or enthusiastic domestic audience. Instead, the event's lure was the opportunity for US companies to win exposure to the vast global audience expected to follow every pass, tackle and goal of the month-long competition. For corporate America, World Cup football offered the chance to reach the parts that mainstream US team sports - baseball, basketball, ice hockey and American football - rarely reach: South America, Europe, Africa and the far east. It was access to this football world beyond the US that persuaded seven US companies to spend a reported Dollars 20m on official sponsorship rights to World Cup '94. They were: Coca-Cola, General Motors, Gillette, MasterCard, McDonald's, M&amp;M Mars and the battery maker Energizer (owned by Ralston Purina). For US companies with extensive business interests in many overseas markets, the potential worldwide TV audience was the chief attraction. The largest audience ever garnered by the Super Bowl of American football, the showcase of American sports, is 750m people. In contrast, more than 2bn people watched the soccer World Cup final in Rome four years ago. In 1990, the 52 games in Italy drew a cumulative audience of more than 30bn. That is a lot of car owners and hamburger eaters. Aside from the official sponsors, another seven US companies (American Airlines, Budweiser, Electronic Data Systems, ITT Sheraton, Sprint, Sun Microsystems and Upper Deck Trading Cards) have paid several million dollars each to become marketing partners of the event, and dozens more have signed up with the tournament as official product, service and equipment providers, regional supporters and licensees. More than 50 large US companies have paid the international and US football authorities at least Dollars 250m in fees to earn the right to associate their products with the World Cup. Although soccer is a minor professional sport in the US, several of the sponsors for this year's event are not new to the World Cup. Gillette's involvement with the tournament dates back to 1970, Coca-Cola has been a World Cup sponsor since 1978, and General Motors was involved with the tournament in Mexico in 1986. For sponsors like these, the diversity of the global audience is at the core of the World Cup's appeal, whether the event is being held in the US, Europe or South America. General Motors, for example, plans to advertise its cars and trucks on advertising boards placed around the pitches, but the boards will display different makes and models of GM vehicles according to which teams are playing in which game. In a game featuring Germany, for example, GM will use its boards to sell Opel, its chief European brand. When Brazil or Mexico are playing, the boards will display the name of Chevrolet, GM's Latin American brand. McDonald's - which sells an identical product the world over - plans to treat viewers in Norway, Greece, Nigeria, South Korea and Colombia as a single market by broadcasting the same commercial - identical everywhere save for the language of the voiceover. As for sports-loving Americans who normally show little interest in professional soccer, the tournament's sponsors are hoping that promotional events in local markets where the games are being played - combined with media coverage and the excitement generated by the presence of a huge international sporting event - will help to pique the interest of even the most dedicated baseball fan.</p>

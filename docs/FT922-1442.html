			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Chemical weapons pact nears completion AN INTERNATIONAL treaty outlawing chemical weapons looks virtually certain to be completed this summer, after negotiations lasting more than 20 years. Mr Adolf von Wagner of Germany, current chairman of the ad hoc committee on chemical weapons of the United Nations Disarmament Conference, yesterday presented the committee with what he expects to be the final treaty draft. If all goes according to plan, the treaty will be endorsed by governments within the next seven weeks and approved by the UN General Assembly in New York this autumn before a signing ceremony in Paris early next year. The chemical weapons convention, the most ambitious multilateral disarmament accord ever attempted, will ban the development, production, stockpiling and use of toxic arms and require the destruction of all stockpiles and production facilities within ten years of the treaty coming into force. The chemical weapons ban will be policed by an international inspectorate, to be based in The Hague, with wide-ranging and intrusive powers to enter and search not only highly sensitive military installations, but also civilian chemical plants making chemicals for peaceful uses such as fertilisers that could be diverted for weapons production. The negotiations in the 39-member disarmament conference have been slowed by the difficulties of balancing the need for rigorous checks to uncover and deter cheating with countries' desire to protect military and commercial secrets. The US last year backed off its own proposal in 1984 for inspections 'anywhere, anytime'. This followed objections from the Pentagon that open access would allow countries to snoop around military establishments developing, say, Stealth bomber technology on the pretext of looking for chemical weapons. The provisions for inspections now allow countries to protect military or trade secrets through 'managed access' which would, for instance, enable countries to shroud equipment, hide documents, shut off computers or restrict individual inspectors to different parts of the site. Governments will not be able to refuse access altogether, however. Some Third World countries, notably China and Pakistan, have been reluctant to allow any inspection of civilian facilities or undeclared military installations. However, they are not expected to block the proposed treaty, which requires a consensus of Disarmament Conference members. About 50 countries, including all the members of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), have said they will sign the treaty, enough to bring into being the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons which will administer it. The convention will come into force two years after the signing ceremony, provided 65 nations have ratified it. Western negotiators were hopeful that most countries would sign eventually.</p>

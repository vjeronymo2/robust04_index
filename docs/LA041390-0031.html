			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Avoid It: Lady Bird Johnson said that some of the things written about her  husband would make her angry if she read them, so "the simplest thing is not to  read them." She was responding Tuesday to the furor over Robert Caro's "Means  of Ascent."  </P> <P> The book has been sharply criticized by some as being unduly harsh. The former  first lady was in Washington for a reunion of Johnson Administration officials.  </P> <P> Arrested: Steve Gobie, the former paid lover of Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.),  was arrested in Washington on charges of marijuana possession and destruction  of property, police said Thursday. The charges stemmed from an incident  Wednesday in which Gobie confronted an off-duty female police officer who was  driving her personal car. The officer said Gobie was driving erratically and  later jumped on the roof of her car. Frank admitted that he in the past paid  Gobie for sexual favors.  </P> <P> Grave Dispute: According to historical letters released Wednesday in  Springfield, Ill., Abraham Lincoln was almost buried in Washington, D.C. rather  than Illinois. Mary Todd Lincoln was prepared to move the President's remains  to the nation's capital if Gov. Richard Oglesby insisted on the President being  interred several miles from Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield, where Lincoln is  in fact buried. "They began to build a vault . . . before Mrs. Lincoln finally  convinced them Oak Ridge was the place where she wanted the body to be," said a  spokesman for the state's historical agency.  </P> <P> By Degrees: George Bush will give the commencement addresses at television  evangelist Jerry Falwell's Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va., this spring,  Bush press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday. It marks the first visit  to the school by a sitting President. Compiled by YEMI TOURE  </P></p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Israelis debate peace accords A political debate about the viability of the existing Israeli-Palestinian peace accords is under way in Israel as both sides get set to resume talks in Cairo today on extending Palestinian self-rule to the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Several Israeli ministers have expressed reservations about continuing to implement the so-called Declaration of Principles, which sets out interim phases leading to a permanent solution by 1998. The next interim stage, at least nine months behind schedule, seeks Israeli troop redeployment out of Palestinian population centres by the eve of national Palestinian elections. Politicians and military experts believe it is almost impossible to redeploy troops and keep adequate security for the 150 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, home to 120,000 Jewish settlers. The review of the declaration follows a warning from Israel's senior military intelligence chief that clear signs exist of 'Lebanonisation' in the Gaza Strip, with armed militias poised to fight each other. Some ministers favour regrouping settlements into blocks; others favour moving directly to talks about a final settlement with Palestinians, to decide a line of withdrawal including uprooting some settlements; some favour halting the process until the Palestinian authority can guarantee better security. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, implied an impending revision of the process after he said at the weekend that adjustments might have to be made between the two parties. The cabinet will meet tomorrow in special session to continue the debate. Palestine Liberation Organisation officials warned any unilateral change to the declaration of principles would kill the peace process, and accused Israel of using delaying tactics. Mr Ahmed Qurie, economics 'minister', said any change to the principles should be made by negotiation. At least five Israeli ministers who want to step up the pace of implementing the accords believe it is impossible to complete the next phase of the process without relocating at least some settlements. Israel's Premier Yitzhak Rabin has so far ruled out quitting a single settlement ahead of a permanent solution. He has expressed reservations about the ability of the Israeli military to maintain security if it is forced to redeploy out of Palestinian centres such as Hebron, Nablus and Ramallah. The government has begun building roads to ensure settlers can avoid areas under Palestinian control. Some ministers believe such moves will not guarantee security. Mr Moshe Shahal, police minister, believes redeployment can be completed without moving settlements into blocks. Mr Rabin has warned about reopening the agreement. The government is reluctant to hasten political conflict over removing Israeli settlements, which it wants to put off until after the 1996 Israeli general elections.</p>

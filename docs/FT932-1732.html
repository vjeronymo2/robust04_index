			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): EC aid, why the cash misses the mark - Trade THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES by Enzo R Grilli Cambridge Pounds 35, 387 pages THE European Community is the world's biggest market, its greatest source of development aid, and its largest contributor to the international financial institutions. All these superlatives would normally encourage you to think that developing countries would get a good deal out of their relationship with the EC. Not so, according to this useful book by Enzo Grilli. The EC's aid policies are ineffective and uncoordinated; the trade preferences it grants to developing countries are meagre and ungenerous. Above all, Grilli says, the EC's policies towards developing countries have been characterised by what he calls 'limping regionalism': an almost exclusive concentration on sub-Saharan Africa and a handful of other countries in the Caribbean and Pacific - the so-called ACP countries. This geographical narrowness is the child of history. When the Community was first set up in the late 1930s, the colonialists among its founder members - Italy, Belgium, but above all France - managed to transfer the burden of their colonial responsibilities to the new Community, in effect by unilaterally attaching their colonies to the Treaty of Rome. What this did was to create a free trade area which comprised not only the original six Community members, but also the 22 colonies and territories owned by the six. This initial burst of international nepotism was reinforced in the following decades, culminating in the 1975 Lome Convention, which widened the circle of the chosen to include the former colonial possessions of the Community's newest member, the UK. Lome was hailed for a time as a new model for development cooperation, promising a large pool of aid resources as well as other gifts such as export stabilisation funds and non-reciprocal trade preferences. Subsequent renewals of the Lome agreements, however, attracted progressively less enthusiasm. Grilli suggests that the colonial-funded geographical focus of the Community's efforts in the developing world intensified during the 1970s and 1980s, effectively ignoring Latin America and Asia. But all this might seem fair enough - who can criticise the EC for paying too much attention to countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, since it is these countries that are most in need of aid? Who cares if Europe's motives are straight out of Machiavelli, so long as the cheques get posted? Things are not so simple. Grilli argues that the use of aid by Community members as a bilateral political weapon allows serious questions to be raised about the effectiveness of the aid, since it is disbursed in an uncoordinated fashion with little regard for its economic benefits. Moreover, the trade preferences that the EC grants have, it seems, done nothing to prevent the economic decay of many developing countries, and Grilli refers to studies which 'uniformly come to the conclusion that the Lome Conventions failed to have any marked impact on ACP aggregate exports'. Grilli's arguments about the nature of the EC's regionalism are compelling, but he gives too little attention to how things might be changing. As Africa's economic problems become more evidently malignant, the continent is clearly losing its appeal for the Community's policy makers, especially now that eastern Europe presents such an inviting claim on the EC's resources. It is difficult to doubt the suggestion that eastern Europe will to some extent replace Africa as the EC's 'region of choice.' It is perhaps a shame, then, that this book was not written a year later, which would have allowed more time to digest the emerging relationship between the EC and eastern Europe, to show more clearly how the EC's regionalism is limping towards the east.</p>

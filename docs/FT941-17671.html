			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Derivatives markets kept investors on the alert until the very end of 1993, writes Terry Byland. Although there was no repetition of the OTC expiry of the previous session, the half-day session on New Year's Eve saw a sharp reversal in the FT-SE March futures contract, which was quickly reflected in the underlying equities. However, turnover in futures was light, the March future trading only 5,321 contracts. Early deals took the contract to the session high of 3,470, from which it fell to a closing 3,426. While at the peak the contract showed a fair value premium of around 7, the closing reading showed a discount of several points. Volume in traded options totalled 13,835 contracts for the half-session against 28,096 on Thursday. The FT-SE contract fell away to 5,992 from the 15,307 of the previous session. Individual actives were headed by 3,115 contracts in the Euro FT-SE instrument, with Vodafone (622), also busy.</p>

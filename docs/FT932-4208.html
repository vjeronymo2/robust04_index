			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Lamont's last lament Mr Lamont's appeal for the government to lead has struck a blow at the prime minister, but looks a little rich coming from a victim of events. The markets' most likely response to such homilies is a hollow laugh - especially since the City has seen little leadership from the government since the general election. Calls for an independent Bank of England will get equally short shrift, given that Mr Major looks unlikely to act on the suggestion. What is perhaps more influential is final confirmation from Mr Major yesterday that the UK is unlikely to re-enter the ERM during this parliament. That leaves the policy focus unequivocally on domestic concerns, and by implication on the PSBR. It may be that such concentration will eventually prove misguided, if a significant part of the deficit proves cyclical. Yet that will depend upon how far the UK economy is running below capacity, and the extent to which the tax base has been eroded or made more volatile by the tax reforms of the 1980s. Such judgments are extremely difficult to make. The government is therefore forced back on to some kind of medium-term framework for balancing the public finances that carries credibility with the markets. This, rather than headline spending cuts, should be the focus of the current review. Still, if the new chancellor decides to use his political clout to cut spending significantly, there may be an interest rate cut to soften the blow. By the autumn, however, the strength of the economy may make lower rates unnecessary. And the market's hopes of an earlier cut look distinctly misplaced.</p>

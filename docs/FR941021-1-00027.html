			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Johns Hopkins University analysis confirmed an increasing incidence of recorded pathology with increasing age, agreeing with the data from the AMA report, but a relatively low incidence in young individuals. Reducing the frequency of medical examinations could be expected to result in an increased prevalence of undetected pathology within the system. For the younger age groups, however, this effect would be small. The Johns Hopkins analysis did not identify exact ages at which the frequency of examinations should be changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to the AOPA petition to amend &sect;61.23, the FAA issued on October 29, 1982, NPRM No. 82&hyph;15 (47 FR 54414, December 2, 1982) proposing to amend part 61 to revise the duration of validity of third-class privileges of airman medical certificates for operations requiring a private or student pilot certificate. As proposed by Notice No. 82&hyph;15, the requirement for a third-class medical examination would have been changed to every 5 years for the youngest pilots then increasing in frequency to the existing 2-year interval for older pilots.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 27, 1985, prior to the issuance of the AMA Report on its review of the airman medical standards and certification procedures in part 67, the notice proposing to amend part 61 to revise the duration of third-class airman medical certificates was withdrawn (50 FR 39619). The proposal was withdrawn, in part, because of issues raised by the medical community. In addition, a regulatory evaluation of Notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 82&hyph;15 suggested a slight increase in aircraft accident fatalities if the then proposed third-class medical certificate was set to 5 years for young airmen. Given the then pending issuance of the AMA Report and the possibility that the report would provide better data on which to base an evaluation of the safety concerns raised by the medical community, the FAA decided that any future consideration of examination frequency would be within the context of the outcome of the comprehensive review of part 67.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 26, 1986, AOPA again petitioned the FAA to revise the duration of a third-class airman medical certificate to 36 calendar months for noncommercial operations requiring a private, recreational, or student pilot certificate. The petition (Docket No. 24932) was entered in the public docket and remains open.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 24, 1993, AOPA once again petitioned the FAA to revise the duration of a third-class airman medical certificate to 48 calendar months for a specific trial period for noncommercial operations requiring a private or student pilot certificate. The petition (Docket No. 27473) was entered in the public docket and remains open.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the FAA's review of part 67, the FAA's judgment regarding recommendations contained in the AMA Report, and on consideration of all public comments in response to previous notices, the FAA proposes to revise part 67, ``Medical Standards and Certification.'' The proposed revision of part 67 will involve the incorporation of additions and changes to specific medical standards, the scope of examination, and the administrative procedures pertaining to airman medical certification. In consideration of pertinent advances in the field of medicine since the last significant revision of part 67, the medical standards and certification procedures that are being proposed reflect current medical knowledge, technology, and practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the notice withdrawing Notice 82&hyph;15, the duration of airman medical certificates was to be reconsidered after the AMA's report; however, the report provided no duration recommendation. The proposal to revise airmen standards and certifications procedures and the duration of airmen medical certificates was also addressed in a January 1992 agency rulemaking review. The results of these events supported the revision of part 67 and duration of third-class airman medical certificates. A reevaluation of all studies and data collected since 1982 supports a revision of the duration of third-class medical certificates outlined in this proposal. Accordingly, the FAA is proposing revisions to part 67 and to &sect;61.23 of part 61 of the FAR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Proposed Amendments to Part 67  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a summary of the substantive changes proposed in this rulemaking. Because the FAA is proposing a complete recodification of part 67, this summary states both the current and proposed section/paragraph numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Distant visual acuity requirements for first- and second-class certification are changed to delete the uncorrected acuity standards. However, each eye must be corrected to 20/20 as in the current standard. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(b) and 67.15(b); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.103(a) and 67.203(a)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. For third-class certification, the current 20/50, uncorrected, or 20/30, corrected, distant visual acuity standard is changed to 20/40 in each eye, with or without correction. [FAR Standard: Current &sect;67.17(b); Proposed &sect;67.303(a)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. For first- and second-class certification, minimum near visual acuity requirements are specified in terms of Snellen equivalents (20/40), corrected or uncorrected, each eye, at 16 inches and, after age 50, also include an intermediate standard (20/40) at 32 inches. This replaces the current standard of V=1.00 at 18 inches for first-class only. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(b) and 67.15(b); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.103(b) and 67.203(b)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. A near visual acuity standard of  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> 20/40, corrected or uncorrected, each eye, at 16 inches is added to the third-class visual requirements. [FAR Standard: Current (None); Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;67.303(b)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Color vision requirements are amended to read: ``ability to perceive those colors necessary for safe performance of airman duties,'' and are the same for all classes. Current standards require ``normal color vision'' for first-class and the ability to distinguish aviation signal colors for second- and third-class applicants. [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.13(b), 67.15(b), and 67.17(b); Proposed &sect;&sect;67.103(c), 67.203(c), and 67.303(c)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The current first-class standard pertaining to pathological conditions of the eye or adnexa that interfere or that may reasonably be expected to interfere with proper function is substituted in both the second- and third-class standards for the current standards which specify, respectively, ``no pathology of the eye'' and ``no serious pathology of the eye.'' [FAR Standards: Current &sect;&sect;67.15(b) and 67.17(b); Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;&sect;67.203(e) and 67.303(d)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

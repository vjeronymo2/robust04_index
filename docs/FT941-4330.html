			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Ex-Dunne's chief seeks buy-out A boardroom battle for control of Dunne's Stores, Ireland's biggest retailing and supermarket chain, is expected to come to a head within the next two months, following the latest moves by Mr Ben Dunne, the ousted chief executive, to regain control of the family-run business. If he succeeds, the group will be floated on the stock market 'within the next two to five years'. Mr Dunne, who was removed from his position in February 1993 in a boardroom coup by three of his four siblings and fellow-directors, has contracted a team of lawyers and financial consultants to raise an estimated IPounds 320m (Pounds 308m) to buy out his family partners, or alternatively to force them to buy out his own 20 per cent share in the business for IPounds 80m. According to one of the consultants involved, the money is being raised through leading financial institutions in London, and would create an institutional shareholding in the group of up to 40 per cent. One of the conditions attached to the deal by the institutional backers is that the group would be floated 'within two to five years'. Under the present ownership agreement, none of the family partners can sell their holding without the permission of the others. Mr Dunne is to challenge that through the High Court, seeking a ruling that either his partners must sell out to him, or alternatively that they must buy out his own shareholding. A ruling is expected before the summer.</p>

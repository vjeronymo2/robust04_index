			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS SHOULD KEEP VALENZUELA, DANIELS  </P> <P> In 1982 when I was 17 and a senior at Garfield High, Fernando Valenzuela came  out to speak to us. He was a big star then.  </P> <P> He didn't have to come out to see us, but he did.  </P> <P> He told us -- both in Spanish and through an English interpreter -- to stay in  school. He said any of us could have something he didn't have a chance to have  -- an education.  </P> <P> I never forgot Fernando's message. I went to school -- Cal State L.A. and then  got a master's degree from UCLA -- and live a good life with my wife and  2-year-old son.  </P> <P> I feel as if the tables have been turned. Now my career is going well and  Fernando needs someone to believe in him. I sincerely hope the Dodgers bring  Fernando back. I want my Miguelito to see this man.  </P> <P> CARLOS RAMIREZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

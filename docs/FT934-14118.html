			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Gloom growing among consumers A GLOOMY report about consumer confidence has heightened worries that the recent increase in spending by households will soon peter out, threatening the economic recovery. According to the Gallup market research group, fewer people last month thought an upturn was imminent than at any time since March. The number expecting the financial position of their households to improve was at its lowest since November 1992. The main factors depressing confidence appear to be fears of unemployment, worries about a possible rise in tax in next month's Budget and disappointing economic news including signs of increasing inflation. Gallup said there was 'very little' to suggest that consumers would be a driving force behind economic recovery. The survey was based on a poll of 2,000 people every month on behalf of the European Commission. The latest, conducted between September 30 and October 12, comes after several months in which consumer confidence seemed to be increasing. Last month only 24 per cent of people polled said they believed that the economy would improve over the next year. The proportion compared with 37 per cent who reckoned it would worsen. That gave a negative balance of 13 percentage points, down 10 points from September. When people were questioned about the financial position of their households, a negative balance of 15 per cent saw a deterioration next year compared with 5 per cent in September.</p>

Presidential aides said they  had received reports that a small group of blacks pelted a  larger group of National Party [NP] supporters in Kokosi  township. A NP media bus scheduled to stop there was diverted to  Potchefstroom where Mr de Klerk addressed two meetings.    No immediate comment could be obtained from Western  Transvaal  police and NP aides said they had no further information.    Mr de Klerk was received warmly by an audience of mostly  first-year students at the University of Potchefstroom, and  applauded when he addressed a meeting of NP organisers in the  town's banquet hall. The president's Western Transvaal tour,  amid tight security, will continue to Saturday. He was scheduled  to make three stops in Klerksdorp and visit a Ventersdorp farm  on Friday.    Mr de Klerk told the Potchefstroom students to forget polls  which showed 70 per cent support for the African National  Congress, [ANC] saying the NP's own surveys showed the party  could win the election if it could garner the support of  undecided voters.    A small section of the students hissed briefly when he  started his address.    Mr de Klerk said the NP did not have self defence units as  did the ANC and which ran wild and intimidated the public. At  the banquet hall, he called on np organisers to alert the NP to  cases of intimidation so that guilty parties could be charged.</p>

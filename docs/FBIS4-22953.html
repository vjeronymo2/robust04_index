			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Kazakh Republic Deputy Minister of Health M. </F> Kulzhanov by correspondent M. Ambartsumyan; date and place of  interview not given; UDC 368.06: ``Budget-Supported Health  Insurance--the Will of the Day'']    [Text] The matter of the draft law of the Kazakh Republic  ``On Health Insurance for Citizens'' (second reading) was  placed, among other issues, on the agenda of the 10th Session of  the Kazakh Republic Supreme Soviet. Our correspondent M.  Ambartsumyan interviews Deputy Minister of Health M. Kulzhanov  on what health insurance includes, and what the limits of its  possibilities are.  [Ambartsumyan]Maksut Karimovich, many readers have  gained the impression that budget-supported health insurance is  a panacea for all economic ills in public health.  [Kulzhanov]That's far from so. According to  calculations by economists of the republic's Ministry of Health,  this form of providing health care will help to ease the  difficulties that accumulated over the entire existence of the  former public health system by a maximum of only 30 percent.    Let me begin with the basic program of budget-supported  insured medicine, which includes a guaranteed volume of all  forms of ordinary health care (with the exception of specialized  care provided to tubercular and oncological patients), AIDS  centers, children's sanatoriums, dairy kitchena, blood  transfusion stations, cardiac surgery, grafts and  transplantations of tissues and organs, and all forms of  preventive immunizations. This is the part of health care for  which state public health will assume responsibility, providing  it to the part of the population that is still unemployed and to  budget-supported organizations.  [Ambartsumyan]Everyone is troubled by the main  issue--treatment of the sick. On what principle will it be  provided under insured medicine?  [Kulzhanov]Therapeutic assistance that will be  rendered under the conditions of mandatory health insurance is  now acquiring the form of a commodity. It is with regard for  this that medical economic standards, which include mutual  settlements between insurance companies and medical  institutions, have been developed. The cost of treating the most  widespread diseases, the average duration of health care,  possible predictable complications, the results of treatment and  continuity of its stages are all written into these standards.  The medical economic standards are of the necessary volume  guaranteeing the quality of treatment. This program is planned  for 3 years, during which time we will be able to break the  system in and introduce the appropriate adjustments that will  certainly be needed.  [Ambartsumyan]Maksut Karimovich, the editor's office  is receiving anxious letters in which people, its seems, are not  very trusting of this innovation, and ask again and again for  information on the system of mandatory health insurance.  [Kulzhanov]Any form of insurance, be it voluntary or  mandatory, requires a controlling and distributing body which  could coordinate and manage the enormous amount of financial  activity at the basis of insurance relations.    Thus if we take an oblast as an example, we propose  establishing a trusteeship council within its administration, to  be headed by the administration deputy chief for social  problems. The representatives of this council include the chiefs  of the public health administrations, of the oblast financial  administration and of the tax inspection office, trade union  workers, and the chief executives of major enterprises. Were we  to represent our insurance system in the form of a diagram, the  third link would be a health insurance fund receiving money  transferred from the state budget and from enterprises. However,  the rather complex problem of receiving money into the fund's  clearing account arises in this stage. I don't think that there  will be any difficulties with appropriations form the state  budget--they'll come in properly. But how are we to organize  transfer of funds from the enterprises and the various  organizations, especially considering that there are hundreds of  them in the capital, not counting the small enterprises and  joint ventures? Many of them will deliberately avoid payment,  and drag their heels in carrying out this procedure, so  unpleasant to them, citing unprofitability and other factors.    I feel that the tax inspection office should become a  powerful influence in relation to mandatory payments. It is  interested in proper transfer of financial deductions, and the  wages of workers of the inspection office will depend directly  on the amount transferred to this fund.  [Ambartsumyan]As with anything new, insured medicine  harbors unforeseen complications; to what extent are you  prepared for them?  [Kulzhanov]They may arise chiefly between the patient  and doctor. Expert groups consisting of the main unaffiliated  specialists will be established under the health departments for  this purpose. It is they who will be able to resolve conflicts  with the greatest objectivity, performing the role of arbiters  between therapeutic and preventive institutions, patients and  the insurance companies. This form of their activity will be  paid for by the guilty party.    An accrediting and licensing bureau is, I believe, of no  lesser significance. It will perform an important role in  registering small enterprises, and small and midsized medical  institutions occupying premises satisfying the necessary  requirements of epidemiological oversight. It would also make  sure that the personnel working in them are highly qualified,  because there already have been many attempts to register  ``therapeutic institutions'' having not a single physician, or  even a nurse. Also, persons having nothing to do with medicine  but possessing dubious credentials, such as extrasensory  practitioners, bioenergetic surgeons and so on, have tried to  ``take over'' therapeutic activity.  [Ambartsumyan]In what practical ways will relations  between insurance companies and medical institutions be  maintained?  [Kulzhanov]In each case the cost of the course of  treatment for a patient is to be determined by the medical  institution. After that, if the insurance company feels it to be  excessive, it will have the right to appeal to an expert group.    Thus the new economic relations are creating conditions in  which the rights and interests of the patients are protected  foremost. And as for the insurance companies themselves, it  would be to their advantage to have well-equipped medical  institutions with the corresponding top-class team of  specialists, and to materially support this necessary balance.  [Ambartsumyan]We haven't yet broached the question of  rural public health in our interview: The opinion exists that it  must remain under the support of the budget, because in view of  their small amount, insurance premiums will simply be unable to  provide for the level of health care that existed before.  [Kulzhanov]Naturally in these days when agriculture  is basically an unprofitable sector, the system of  budget-supported insured health care foresees pooling of  resources received from insurance premiums as a supplement to  basic budget financing of rural public health. Monetary  resources will be redistributed from the stronger regions to the  weaker ones. And then we can talk about stabler provision of  health care to rural laborers.</p>

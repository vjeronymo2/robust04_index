			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DEATHS;  </P> <P> N.Y.'S 1ST BLACK SCHOOL CHIEF DIES  </P> <P> Richard R. Green, the city's first black schools chancellor whose much-heralded  arrival last year from Minneapolis brought new hope to the nation's biggest  school system, died today of asthma-related causes. He was 52.  </P> <P> Green was brought to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center suffering from acute  respiratory arrest and died 40 minutes later.  </P> <P> Green took over the troubled million-student system in March, 1988, after a  long and bitter selection process that pitted him against the favorite of the  teachers union.  </P> <P> As an outsider from Minneapolis, where he served seven years as school  superintendent and was widely credited with turning around a failing system,  Green offered hope for new approaches for a school system plagued with a high  dropout rate, crumbling buildings and a politically combative hierarchy.  </P> <P> But he soon found himself contending with reports of drug abuse, theft and  sexual misconduct by teachers, principals and school board officials. In  response to the scandals, he suspended two community school boards.  </P></p>

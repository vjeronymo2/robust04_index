			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/4/1994 -- Besides bilateral  ties, the consultations held on 31 March in Athens between  Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu and his Greek  counterpart, Karolos Papoulias, have occasioned a thorough  analysis of the crisis in former Yugoslavia, both sides  insisting on the need to expand the concluded understandings,  according to an interview granted by the Romanian head of  diplomacy to Radio Romania Actualitati.    The two ministers pointed out the importance of a bilateral  political dialogue that would enable the two foreign ministries  to consult and act together under the circumstances of extremely  rapid developments in the area.    "Obviously, besides these general issues, I presented the  Hellenic side also some major projects of economic collaboration  for which we have requested political support from the Greek  authorities," Melescanu said. He also mentioned that they are  several extremely important projects that are envisaged to be  worked out with Greece in the ensuing period, projects that are  to be financed by the European Union, such as the subway in  Salonika and a electric power railway link between Athens and  Salonika, in which Romanian companies are interested.    The Romanian foreign minister also mentioned that  discussions  covered extensively the area of conflict of both sides'  interest, especially the Yugoslav crisis. "Practically, we  agreed that several positive signs are showing up and that  probably Romania's and Greece's contribution is to encourage  such positive steps and expand the understandings concluded  until present".    In that context Melescanu said that several similarities of  opinions were noticed, including the idea that the cease-fire  and the improvement of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina  should be used to launch a global process of negotiations that  would lead thus to a global solution to the crisis in former  Yugoslavia. Also approached were obviously issues related to  the economic sanctions, to the embargo, the two sides expressing  their support for the decision adopted by the European Union  Committee that is for a correlation of the progress made during  negotiations with the slackening or the complete lifting of  economic sanctions.</p>

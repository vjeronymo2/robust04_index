			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> SPORTS TALK ;  </P> <P> BEISBOL GIVES DOMINICAN BOYS A CHANCE AT FAME AND RICHES  </P> <P> The robust dark clouds that have been lingering over the city finally unload  their cargo with unabashed gusto, but nobody runs for cover at the Campo Las  Palmas baseball academy.  </P> <P> A tropical rain or two is not going to keep the boys here from practicing  beisbol, the vehicle they hope to use to reach fame and fortune.  </P> <P> Built in 1987 by the Los Angeles Dodgers after five years at another location  on the island, the camp is one of several operated year-round by major league  baseball teams to develop young players in what has become the most fertile  source of talent for the American pastime anywhere in Latin America.  </P> <P> Last season, for instance, more than 50 Dominicans played in the majors and  many more toiled in the minors. They come from all over this small Caribbean  country of about 6 million people, but the southern coast town of San Pedro de  Macoris, which has produced, among others, St. Louis first baseman Pedro  Guerrero, Toronto shortstop Tony Fernandez, Texas second baseman Julio Franco  and new Dodger outfielder Juan Samuel, is the undisputed hotbed.  </P> <P> "This place is a mine," commented academy director Rafael (Ralph) Avila, 60, a  Cuban-born former amateur player who has been a Dodger scout since 1966. Avila,  the Dodgers head scout in Latin America, said he first proposed the idea of an  academy to former Dodger general manager Al Campanis in 1971.  </P> <P> The 50-acre camp is modest but well-equipped. It houses 40 players, ages 16 to  19, in a dormitory setting and includes a formal dining room -- named after  Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda -- quarters for the instructors and a recreation  room that doubles as a classroom.  </P> <P> There are three baseball diamonds at the complex, three lighted batting cages  and 12 pitching machines.  </P> <P> The players fall into three categories: those under contract, those who are 17  years of age or older and might be signed to Dodger contracts, and those who  are 16 and cannot turn professional for another year, as dictated by Dominican  law. Those under contract play as the Santo Domingo Dodgers in summer and in  winter leagues for rookies, and some are reserves on top-flight professional  clubs here such as Licey, Estrellas Orientales and Escogido.  </P> <P> "What interests us the most in this camp is the development of ballplayers, not  winning championships," Avila said. Yet his teams have won titles in three  winter and two summer leagues of the six in which they have played.  </P> <P> "We don't set a rule as far as how long we keep them at the camp," he said.  "The time it takes them to graduate depends on what they have in their heads  and in their guts."  </P> <P> Avila's coaching and scouting staff includes former Dodger infielder Teddy  Martinez and Dodger shortstop Alfredo Griffin's uncle, Argona Read. They have  helped mold some of the most promising youngsters to come out of here in recent  memory.  </P> <P> At its previous location, the academy produced Dodger outfielder Jose Gonzalez,  and catcher Gilberto Reyes, shortstop Mariano Duncan and pitcher Alejandro  Pena, all since traded to other clubs. Notable Las Palmas graduates include  Dodger right-hander Ramon Martinez, minor leaguers Jose Vizcaino (the potential  heir to Griffin at shortstop), Jose Oferman and Braulio Castillo.  </P> <P> "We don't sign players for the minor leagues," Avila said. "These players are  here because the consensus of the staff is that they possess the tools, the  ability to reach the major leagues if they develop as we expect them to."  </P> <P> Avila said that at least 10 players will leave the camp for Class A assignments  this season at Vero Beach, Fla., and Salem, Ore., and rookie league work at  Great Falls, Mont., and Kissimmee, Fla. They include outfielder Freddy  Gonzalez, who led all U.S. minor leagues in hitting last year with a .381  average while at Kissimmee. Others are power-hitting outfielder Raul Montesi,  second baseman Gustavo Zapata and right-handed pitcher Pedro Martinez, Ramon's  18-year-old brother.  </P> <P> "The general opinion here is that (Montesi) is the best prospect this year,"  Avila said of the 18-year-old from San Cristobal. "Everything he does is above  average. . . . He's an outstanding fastball hitter with tremendous power. We  call him 'Popeye.' "  </P> <P> Avila has been equally impressed with Martinez: "Right now, Pedro is a much  better pitcher than Ramon was at the same age. He has a good curve, good  control and better velocity than Ramon. He now throws 88 m.p.h. He's a  tremendous prospect."  </P> <P> Martinez hopes Avila's assessment is correct: "My dream is to pitch next to my  brother," he said.  </P> <P> Because these players and those to follow -- as experience has proved -- will  have to make adjustments to life in a vastly different environment once in the  United States, the academy supplements the baseball regimen with educational  and social training that ranges from English classes to fundamentals of  etiquette to money management.  </P> <P> Said scout-instructor Pablo Peguero, a former minor league catcher in the  Dodger chain: "The main benefit is that when they arrive in the United States  they also know how to handle things other than baseball. . . . Some of these  boys are from deep in the country and don't even know how to use a toilet."  </P> <P> Some also have problems with English classes. But teacher Joaquin Colome and  the players are enthusiastic.  </P> <P> "It's going pretty well, considering that the boys don't have a high level of  education," Colome said. "It's an English of daily situations so that the  individual has a basic notion and can deal with any necessity over there (in  the United States)."  </P> <P> Avila also wants the young players to remember discipline when they start  earning substantial salaries in the United States. He has seen players shift  their focus from the game to impressing folks with their good fortune, a trap  that has ruined many promising careers.  </P> <P> "They get to the United States with nothing and all of a sudden find themselves  with $700 or $800 in their pockets, and they think they own the world," Avila  said. "And since they have never had money, they don't know how to spend it."  </P> <P> "Then, after they have bought jewelry, radios, stereos, shoes and fancy  clothes, they want to come home. Many people used to confuse that with being  homesick, but in reality it wasn't that they wanted to see mom or dad or their  brothers and sisters. What they wanted to do was show off what they had  acquired.  </P> <P> "Now, we find out about those who are more interested in hats, jewelry and  drugs here, before we have too much invested in them. Before, those problems  surfaced in the United States. Now we weed them out here."  </P></p>

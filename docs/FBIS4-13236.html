			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- PML [Pakistan Muslim League] president  Mian Nawaz Sharif expressed serious doubts about the real  outcome of the recent talks between the US and the PPP [Pakistan  People's Party] government on the nuclear issue.    Demanding the details of the nuclear inspection talks on  Friday the PML chief said media reports had strengthened the  suspicion in this regard as the US declared that its objective  was to achieve non-proliferation in South Asia by forcing  Pakistan to rollback and cap its nuclear programme.    He said since the US Deputy Secretary of State declared  these  talk as "complete success" therefore it was legitimate to ask  about the details of these talks, adding, a further cause of  concern is the announcement by both sides that in the future  deliberations on achieving the American objectives would be  pursed through quiet and secret diplomacy".    Former prime minister pointed out that the joint communique  issued at the end of these talks failed to mention the Indian  nuclear and ballistic missile programme which is a real threat  to the security of the region, adding," there has been no  reference to a regional approach on the nuclear issue.    Nawaz Sharif expressing his concern over the "quiet  diplomacy" being talked about in the context of the nuclear  programme said, "like the rest of his countrymen I have certain  apprehension that under the garb of this quiet diplomacy the PPP  government would damage national security as it did by providing  help to Rajiv Gandhi on on the Sikh issue". He said that help  came to light almost five years after the event when Benazir  herself confessed it recently and perhaps it was also a part of  the PPP's quiet diplomacy of that period.    Criticising Benazir Bhutto he alleged, "since the entire  nation knows that she is a security risk we have every right to  question her motives in pursuing 'quiet diplomacy' which could  end up similar to the secret support to Rajiv Gandhi on the Sikh  issue".    Highlighting the importance of Pakistan's nuclear programme  he said there is broad national consensus on the nuclear issue  and the PPP would not be allowed to compromise on this issue.    Terming the nuclear issue as a sacred trust and as a  deterrent against foreign aggression he said Pakistan's  consistent commitment was viewing the nuclear issue in a  regional perspective with an even-handed approach that links the  core security question like Kashmir with the nuclear issue.    He warned that any reversal of this position would amount to  rolling back the nuclear programme and the national consensus.  He asked the PPP government to dispel apprehensions and doubts  it should categorically the nation about its real position on  the nuclear issue. [sentence as published]    However, he said the PML will not allow any compromise on  the  nuclear issue.</p>

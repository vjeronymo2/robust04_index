			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / County NatWest withdraws from Tokyo Stock Exchange THE collapse of the Tokyo stock market yesterday claimed its most notable victim among foreign stockbrokers as County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster Bank, became the first to announce a total withdrawal from the market. County will be the first foreign broker to give up its membership on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, which it obtained in 1988 after pressure had been put on the Japanese authorities by the UK government. County's move comes as profits at Japanese and foreign brokers have been savaged by the slump of the Tokyo stock market. For the first-half to last September, the 25 foreign members of the TSE posted a 40 per cent fall in combined pre-tax profits to Y30bn (Pounds 155.2m). County reported a loss of Y2.57bn in the year to March. Mr Scott Dobbie, vice-chairman of County NatWest Securities, said the level of business in Tokyo was not sufficient to cover high overhead costs. He said it was unlikely that Tokyo's stock market would return to the volumes and the profitability of the late 1980s. County's move will result in the loss of 70 out of 75 jobs. Mr Minoru Nagaoka, president of the TSE, said he regretted County's decision to relinquish its seat on the exchange. Prudential Securities of the US recently realigned its Japanese equity operations, but said it would retain its TSE membership. Until now, other foreign brokers have also chosen to hold on to their memberships, which were only won after political pressure. County's withdrawal is also a sign of the failure by foreign brokers to instil in Japanese investors a taste for the research services used in Europe and the US. In the 1980s, western brokers claimed that their research approach would give them a strong position in selling Japanese stocks to local investors. Most foreign brokers have decided to concentrate on trading derivatives, taking advantage of disparities between prices in the futures market and in the underlying stock markets. However, profitability of this business has also fallen. Daily trading of Nikkei 225 stock index futures plunged 48 per cent on the Osaka Stock Exchange in the six months to September.

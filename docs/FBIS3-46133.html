			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Doreen Cheung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] There would be no legal vacuum after the 1997  change over despite the likely absence of a legislature for the  first months, a China-appointed body has assured.    Speaking at the end of a two-day session, acting Hong Kong  co- convenor of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) legal  sub-group, Lo Tak-shing, said there were sufficient mechanisms  in place to cope with any problems that arose during the  transition. "We have a sovereign in power and a Basic Law in  place. The Basic Law preserves all the existing laws of Hong  Kong, except those which conflict with the Basic Law."    He said the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress had already empowered the Special Administrative Region  (SAR) Preparatory Committee to do almost anything needed to  prepare for the establishment of the first government. The  legal sub-group's conclusion implied that it was possibly  unnecessary to devise a mechanism to cope with any legal vacuum  at July 1, 1997, he said.    "We have in place a complete structure and laws for the Hong  Kong society. There is no problem at all."    The question of a legal vacuum was raised by the political  sub- group in discussions of the formation of the first  government and the first SAR legislature. Given the collapse of  the Sino-British talks on electoral arrangements and the need to  hold fresh elections by mid-1997, some members feared that Hong  Kong would have no legislature for several months after July 1  997. They suggested interim measures such as forming a  provisional legislature, allowing the National People's Congress  to legislate on behalf of Hong Kong or delegating legislative  power to the SAR chief executive. The political sub-group will  meet on Friday and Saturday in Beijing.    Mr Lo said it was a misunderstanding that the absence of a  legislature in 1997 would mean that there would be no laws in  Hong Kong or no mechanism to enact legislation. "The fact is  that the SAR Preparatory Committee can rule Hong Kong in  accordance with Hong Kong laws," he said.    Mainland co-convenor Shao Tianren said there would be no  vacuum in the transition as China would resume sovereignty over  Hong Kong immediately on July 1, 1997. "There exists no legal  vacuum," Mr Shao said. Mr Shao said few laws would need to be  changed because they failed to comply with the Basic Law.  Changes would mainly be amending terms such as "colonial",  "your majesty" and "governor".    But Preliminary Working Committee member Tam Yiu-chung held  reservations, saying it was difficult to determine so early that  there would not be a legal vacuum.</p>

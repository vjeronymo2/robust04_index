			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: SIMI VALLEY'S SANTOS DECLARED INELIGIBLE  </P> <P> Greg Santos, a senior in his first season on the Simi Valley High baseball  team, was declared academically ineligible when quarter grades were released  last week, Coach Mike Scyphers said.  </P> <P> Santos was batting .323, with four home runs, seven doubles and 18 runs batted  in. He spent much of the season batting cleanup for the Pioneers, who are 20-3  and have clinched at least a share of the Marmonte League title.  </P> <P> Santos spent his junior year at Apollo High, a continuation school in Simi  Valley, because of academic and personal problems.  </P> <P> Three Reseda High baseball players suspended in the wake of a brawl in a game  against Grant have been reinstated, Coach Mike Stone said Monday.  </P> <P> Senior outfielder Robert Gauteraux, senior first baseman Ron Stricklin and  junior outfielder Joey Tushnet have been cleared to play in Reseda's final  three games. They were suspended indefinitely for their involvement in a  bench-clearing brawl that ended an April 25 game against Grant after five  innings. Grant won, 13-1.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 2 February issue of the Podgorica,  Montenegro, daily POBJEDA on page 4 reports that an "original  map of the so-called state of Sandzak" was found on members of  the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] who had been arrested on  charges of planning an armed rebellion in northern Montenegro.  According to POBJEDA, the map was printed in the Republic of  Croatia. The text accompanying the map, the paper notes, states  that the borders of Sandzak were historically and  internationally recognized by the decision of the Congress of  Berlin and the Treaty of Constantinople. The "creators of this  creation" specify that the state of Sandzak will cover over  8,687 square kilometers and have a population of 440,000. Among  the "propaganda material," POBJEDA adds, were brochures printed  in Iran in Arabic. Pictures of fully equipped fighters in  "combat poses" illustrated the text of these brochures.    According to POBJEDA, Harun Hadzic, president of the SDA for  Montenegro, and Rifat Veskovic, president of the Bijelo Polje  SDA municipal committee, were in possession of military staff  and command organization plans when arrested. The paper adds  that Hadzic and other SDA leaders had purchased 11 radio  receivers in Germany and planned to conduct surveillance of the  Yugoslav Army and police and to destroy communications lines and  radio stations.</p>

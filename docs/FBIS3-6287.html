Clinton sounded the clarion call for joint action among the  Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations as he opened a G-7  ministerial conference to examine why job security and high  wages appear hard to reconcile in much of the industrial world.  [passage omitted on Clinton remarks]    In industrial Europe, workers are cushioned by generous  welfare perks, but the jobless rates have stuck in double digits.    Even in Japan, a country known for its low unemployment  rates, the government is considering broad restructuring in  order to protect the so-called "lifetime" employment system.    "At a time when vast changes are taking place in industries  and at a time when workers too are changing their way of  thinking, we too should realize there will be more labor  movement across companies and industries in Japan over the long  run," Japan's Labor Minister Chikara Sakaguchi told the G-7 jobs  conference.    Japan also urged its G-7 partners to maintain "sound  macroeconomic policies and the multilateral trade system" in  order to create more jobs.    The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry,  represented in the G-7 jobs conference by Parliamentary Vice  Trade Minister Otohiko Endo, also proposed easing government  regulations, making capital more readily accessible to  entrepreneurs, and expanding job-skills training, as answers to  job creation.    But Clinton acknowledged that there are no easy answers.    "We are here because we have something to learn from each  other and, hopefully, something to teach each other," Clinton  said in his opening speech.    No binding policy statement will be issued by the jobs  conference, which is largely a closed-door forum among G-7  finance, economic and labor ministers.    During four separate discussion sessions, spread over two  days, the G-7 ministers were expected to discuss a vast range of  labor-related issues, ranging from the impact of macroeconomic  policies to the structure of the labor systems in each of the  G-7 member countries.    The exercise, Clinton said, should help produce a "real  agenda" when the G-7 heads of state and government head to Italy  in July for their annual summit meeting.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BUYERS RUSH TO LUXURY CAR LOTS TO AVOID NEW TAXES DUE JAN. 1  </P> <P> European luxury cars are selling fast as buyers hurry to avoid new taxes that  take effect New Year's Day.  </P> <P> A surge in late November and early December sales was reported by a dealers  association and sales managers.  </P> <P> "All companies are reporting an increase in sales," said Bob Howe, who follows  European luxury cars for the National Automobile Dealers Assn. in McLean, Va.  "In many cases their business has doubled from what it was a year ago. They are  very mindful of the fact that there will be a fall in business in January."  </P> <P> On Jan. 1, consumers paying more than $30,000 for a new car will be assessed a  10% tax on the amount over $30,000, and the gas guzzler tax on the least  fuel-efficient vehicles will double.  </P> <P> The new taxes could add thousands of dollars to a flashy car's price.  </P> <P> At Estate Motors Ltd. in Birmingham, Mich., sales manager David Trudeau said  Mercedes sales in early December jumped about 30% from the previous month.  </P> <P> Throughout the year, sales of expensive European imported cars, including  Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche, had been running behind last year's pace.  </P></p>

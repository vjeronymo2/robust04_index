			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> LEERY SPAIN VENTURES OUT INTO THE WORLD VIA THE GULF;  </P> <P> ALLIES: THE GOVERNMENT'S UNRESERVED SUPPORT OF U.S.-LED ACTION AGAINST IRAQ  MARKS A TURNING POINT.  </P> <P> At the peak of the American flood of men and arms into the Persian Gulf, U.S.  military jets landed at bases in Spain every two or three minutes. Serviced and  refueled, the planes took off again to neighborhood complaints about noise,  national ambivalence over their presence, and an unprecedented commitment by  Spain's Socialist government to their mission.  </P> <P> Strange doings in a country proudly aloof from foreign entanglements for nearly  all of this century, with a government that sounded not long ago like the most  anti-American member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But improbable  things happen when pride changes, a nonplussed and concerned Spanish public is  discovering.  </P> <P> Unreserved support by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez for the United States in  enforcing the U.N. embargo against Iraq -- reinforced by his decision to  contribute to it with Spanish warships -- marks a historic turning in Spain's  official view of itself and what sort of international shadow it should cast.  </P> <P> "Spain is getting its feet wet in the world," said an admiring Western  diplomat.  </P> <P> Polls say the Spanish people are still not convinced, but Spain's performance  so far has earned high marks, prompting a shared pride of achievement among  normally distant military officers and Socialist politicians.  </P> <P> American supply and staging flights continue routinely, heaviest at the  once-disputed Torrejon Air Base outside Madrid where all U.S. facilities will  be turned over to Spain in 1992. Spanish shipyards are maintaining and  repairing American ships. International blockade enforcers in Persian Gulf  waters include two Spanish corvettes and a frigate.  </P> <P> "Our newspapers talk about 'hundreds of American flights.' Indeed. And so  what?" said Inocencio Arias, an undersecretary at the Foreign Ministry. "The  important part of Spanish public opinion is distrustful of our participation in  an American military initiative, but in this case we have no argument with the  United States. Iraq has broken international law in a most brutal and flagrant  way and shouldn't get away with it."  </P> <P> The United States has decided to abandon its lion's share of the Torrejon base  after agreeing to demands from the Gonzalez government to remove a wing of 72  F-16s from Spain by 1992. Many of those fighters are now on alert at a base in  Turkey, and in the present climate of Spanish-American gulf cooperation,  discord over their departure seems as much ancient history as Gonzalez's  refusal to allow overflight by American bombers on their way to a raid against  Libya in 1986.  </P> <P> "This has been a positive experience for Spain. We have been an inward-looking  country with its back to Europe for decades. With the return of democracy in  1975, we began looking outward again. Now, we are participating in this crisis  as a full partner of a modern and democratic Europe," said Miguel Gil, a  spokesman for the prime minister's office.  </P> <P> Spain's international projection in the gulf flies in the face of what one  scholar has called a "culture of isolation" that began with the revolt of  American colonies in the early 19th Century and accelerated with the loss of  the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Cuba in war with the United States in 1898.  </P> <P> Spain sat out both world wars as a weak, irrelevant, self-consumed neutral.  After a sapping civil war, the 1939-75 dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco  cut off Spain not only from democracy but also as a principal beneficiary of  the unprecedented prosperity that has accompanied it in the rest of Western  Europe since 1945.  </P> <P> Under Gonzalez, Spain has moved step by step toward the mainstream. In the  watershed year of 1986, it joined the European Community and NATO after  prolonged national debate. By now, Spain is among the community's loudest  supporters of European integration.  </P> <P> Initially, Gonzalez seemed to underestimate the consequences of Iraq's Aug. 2  invasion of Kuwait, but within a few days his government had authorized  open-door use of bases in Spain for American ships and planes. He dispatched  warships Aug. 26 in response to a call for action by the Western European  Union, a regional defense alliance that Spain joined only last year.  </P> <P> "We will not opt for isolation. Spain has learned over the past 150 years that  it's cold being on the outside," the Spanish prime minister asserted.  </P> <P> Gonzalez did not take his case directly to the leery Spanish people until 40  days after the invasion, though, when conservatives joined Socialists in a  ringing parliamentary endorsement that failed to still popular qualms.  </P> <P> Old ways die hard. Parliamentary support "contrasts with the divided opinions  and, above all, the bewilderment of many citizens in the face of events in the  gulf," said the Madrid newspaper El Pais.  </P> <P> From the outset, it has been painfully apparent to the government that a  majority of Spaniards want no part of any overseas military action. There have  been none since some disastrous sorties in Morocco between 1909 and 1927.  </P> <P> As Spain ventured into the gulf, one private radio station said that  three-quarters of nearly 8,000 people it polled by telephone opposed  participation there. About 300 intellectuals signed a declaration by Communist  and other leftist parties supporting the intervention but opposing any Spanish  military role.  </P> <P> In a September survey of 800 Spaniards of voting age, El Pais found that 54%  opposed direct involvement, 64% said they felt badly informed by their  government and, most tellingly, only 32% thought that Spain's contribution in  confronting Iraq should be at the same level as that of its European Community  partners.  </P> <P> The fact that 150 of the 500 crew members aboard the Spanish vessels sent to  the gulf are 20-year-old conscripts has roused ire across the country. Stung,  the government promises that as a reward for gulf service, the draftees will be  discharged early when the original three warships are replaced by sister ships  later this month.  </P> <P> "Spaniards were delighted at a new stage of history when their country was  integrated with Europe and among the richest and most modern countries in the  world. They didn't know that the price can be very high," said Cambio 16, a  news magazine.  </P> <P> Initial consternation has been replaced by microscopic examination by the news  media of every Spanish step abroad, often accompanied by commentaries and dire  editorial warnings. When Prince Felipe, the gangling, 22-year-old heir to the  Spanish throne, sallied forth in his navy lieutenant's uniform for a weekend  visit to the ships in the gulf, newspapers complained how badly organized his  mission had been. They noted that one weapons system aboard the corvettes was  not working properly and that technicians dispatched to repair it were turned  away because they lacked visas for the countries of the gulf.  </P> <P> All Spain knows that two sailors were scalded by hot soup and that a navy  lieutenant broke his arm boarding a ship to be inspected. On blockade patrol,  when the commander of a nearby U.S. warship suggested that a Spanish ship fire  a warning shot across the bow of a suspect merchant vessel, the Spanish captain  first had to call Madrid for permission. Tapes of his call quickly found their  way onto Spanish radio stations.  </P> <P> As Spain regards the unfolding of its new persona with what amounts to  delicious apprehension, it is clear that Gonzalez's political future, like  those of President Bush, Britain's Margaret Thatcher and France's Francois  Mitterrand, can be strongly influenced by unfolding events abroad. In a Spain  belatedly and anxiously emerging from isolation, that may be the biggest news  of all.  </P></p>

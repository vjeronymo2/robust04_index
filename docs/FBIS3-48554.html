Sieng Kimhoun [spelling of name as received], director of  the  Ministry's Asia Bureau, also visited facilities being readied  for October's Asian Games and said he hoped to return to Japan  during the games.    "I cannot find the words to adequately express how I feel  with regard to the pain and misery suffered by Hiroshima," said  Sieng.    "We and the people of Hiroshima have a saying in common that  this must never happen again," said Sieng, referring to the 1945  atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the Pol Pot reign of terror in  Cambodia during which an estimated two million people were  killed and Sieng himself was forced to labor for four years.    Visiting most of the sites for the October 2-16 Asian Games,  Sieng said he hoped they would contribute to world peace.    Cambodia plans to send its first delegation in 16 years to  Asia's quadrennial multisport event.</p>

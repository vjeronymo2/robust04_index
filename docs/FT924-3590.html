			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Urban policy THE GROWTH of an 'underclass' in decaying inner-city areas is the most formidable challenge facing western democracies in the 1990s, according to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK home secretary. In a thoughtful lecture to the Tory Reform Group two weeks ago, Mr Clarke acknowledged that, even when the economy was growing, it was not automatically the case that a fair share of it trickled down to inner-city residents. A partnership between the public, private and voluntary sectors was needed, he said, to help local communities find their own solutions. These were fine words, but they were said only days after the chancellor's Autumn Statement which cut the government's urban spending plans from Pounds 987m this year to Pounds 806m in 1995-96. Within that total, the Urban Programme, the main source of regeneration funds for local authorities, is to be reduced by 66 per cent. The budgets of some urban development corporations will be cut (including that of the nascent Birmingham Heartlands UDC). Only the new Urban Regeneration Agency will receive more by the mid-1990s. Funding is also to be cut back for City Challenge, the bidding process introduced 18 months ago to encourage inner-city councils to form local partnerships with the private and voluntary sectors to regenerate small areas. In the first two rounds of bidding, 31 of the 57 urban priority areas won Pounds 7.5m a year each of government money for five years. Many of the rest were equally deserving and hoped to be successful in a third round. But it is clear from the Autumn Statement that there will be no further rounds in the next three years. Indeed, the totals set aside for City Challenge indicate that ministers expect some winners in the first two rounds to underspend or fail to secure approval for their detailed plans. Yet City Challenge is the very epitome of the approach commended by Mr Clarke, widely seen as a success even by local authorities which found the notion of winners and losers hard to swallow. Instead, urban authorities will be able to bid for a much smaller pot of Pounds 20m as part of a new scheme, Capital Partnership, designed to encourage councils to raise funds themselves by selling off assets. Capital Partnership may well offset the fall in established urban funding programmes overall, but there is no guarantee that it will be the most needy councils which will benefit. Such zigzags in urban policy may reflect ministerial comings and goings at the environment department and changes in economic policy after the UK's ignominious exit from the exchange rate mechanism. But this further upheaval in the funding regime for urban regeneration will make it harder for responsible inner-city councils to plan for the future and build the partnerships Mr Clarke commends. It is certainly no way to tackle one of the most formidable challenges facing western democracies. The case for a single funding agency, at one remove from the politicians' grasp, with clear objectives and long-term stability is unanswerable.</p>

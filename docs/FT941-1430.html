			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Record profit of Pounds 5.6m at ITN Independent Television News achieved its largest pre-tax profit last year - Pounds 5.6m before exceptional items on a turnover of Pounds 83.3m, Raymond Snoddy writes. The figure represents a considerable turnaround for the commercial television news organisation. Three years ago there was a cost overrun of Pounds 10m and a growing financial crisis because of lease charges on its then new headquarters in Gray's Inn Road, London. There had been fears that the loss on the lease on the near-empty building could reach Pounds 25m over five years. But the building has been filling up slowly, mainly with media organisations. The latest tenant is The European newspaper which plans to move from Orbit House, part of the former Maxwell empire.</p>
